Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Optimizing Angles in a Regular Polygon**\n\nMy goal is to craft a Python script to locate three distinct vertices (`v1`, `v2`, `v3`) within a regular `n`-sided polygon, ensuring the angle `v1-v2-v3` closely approximates a given angle `a`.\n\nI recognize that all vertices of a regular `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle. The angle formed by any three vertices, with the middle vertex defining the angle's point, is an inscribed angle in this circle. A crucial understanding is that the measure of an inscribed angle is precisely half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc.\n\nI'll number the vertices from 0 to `n-1` (or 1 to `n`, but 0 to `n-1` is more convenient in this setup). Without loss of generality, I'll fix `v2` as vertex `0` (or `1`, depending on the numbering).  The challenge then becomes finding `v1` and `v3` such that the angle at `v2` matches `a`. This means looking at the arc between `v1` and `v3` that doesn't include `v2`.  The number of sides this arc spans is key.\n\nIf I fix `v2` as vertex `1` (which is as good as any other), and `v1` as vertex `2`, the angle `2-1-3` (where `v3` is `3`) subtends an arc of 1 side.  `2-1-4` spans 2 sides, and so on.\n\nThe central angle of each side of the `n`-gon is `360/n` degrees. So, if the arc `v1v3` (not including `v2`) spans `k` sides, the central angle is `k * (360/n)`, and the inscribed angle `v1-v2-v3` is half of that, which simplifies to `k * (180/n)`.  The trick is finding the correct value of `k` such that `k * (180/n)` is near `a`.\n\nTherefore, the possible angles are all of the form `k * (180/n)`, where `k` ranges from `1` to `n-2`.  I need to discover the `k` that minimizes the absolute difference between `k * (180/n)` and the target angle `a`.  This is the core of the problem.\n\nFor testing, consider some examples. If n=3, and I want an angle of 15 degrees, the angle I'm computing is k*60, and k has to be 1.  It won't exactly match it, but it will be a 45-degree error.\n\nSince I've fixed `v2` to be `1` and `v1` to be `2`, then `v3` is simply `2 + k`. It's vital to ensure these vertices are distinct, but with `k` ranging from `1` up to `n-2` this is automatically the case. I must remember though that the output should be vertices, so it will be `2 1 k+2`.\n\nSince I can iterate over `k` from `1` to `n-2`, this has a complexity of `O(n)`.  Even if `n` is large (up to 10^5), this is perfectly acceptable.\n\nI need to calculate the difference between each of these potential angles and the input angle.\n\nHowever, I can also solve this in O(1).  The possible angles vary monotonically. So if I compute a value, `a * n/180`, which will correspond to a value. If I floor that, and round that value, that will give me my two bounds (if it is the only viable `k`).\n\nI need to initialize my `min_diff` to infinity and `best_k` to `-1`, I think.\n\nAlso, I must think about some edge cases.  What if the target angle, `a`, is very small or very large?  If `a` is smaller than the smallest possible angle (when k=1), then I should pick `k=1`. Likewise, if `a` is larger than the largest possible angle (when k=n-2), then I must pick `k=n-2`. I need to compare `a` against `180/n` (the minimum possible angle) and `(n-2) * 180 / n` (the maximum possible).\n\nIf I do this, I can reduce to O(1) time.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The vertices are numbered from 1 to `n` in clockwise order.\n\n**Understanding Angles in a Regular N-gon**\n\nAll vertices of a regular `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle. An angle formed by three vertices `v1, v2, v3` (where `v2` is the vertex of the angle) is an inscribed angle in this circumcircle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.\n\nLet's fix `v2` as vertex `1`. To form an angle, `v1` and `v3` must be other distinct vertices. Let's pick `v1` as vertex `2`. Then `v3` can be any vertex from `3` to `n`.\n\nThe arc `v1v3` (that does not contain `v2`) consists of a certain number of sides (edges) of the `n`-gon.\nIf the arc `v1v3` spans `k` sides of the `n`-gon, the central angle subtended by this arc is `k * (360/n)` degrees.\nThe inscribed angle `v1-v2-v3` is half of this central angle, so its measure is `(k * (360/n)) / 2 = k * (180/n)` degrees.\n\nThe number of sides `k` that `v1` and `v3` can span, relative to `v2`, ranges from `1` to `n-2`.\nFor example, if `v2=1` and `v1=2`:\n- If `v3=3`, the arc `2-3` spans `k=1` side. Angle = `1 * (180/n)`.\n- If `v3=4`, the arc `2-4` spans `k=2` sides. Angle = `2 * (180/n)`.\n- ...\n- If `v3=n`, the arc `2-n` spans `k=n-2` sides. Angle = `(n-2) * (180/n)`.\n\nSo, the possible angles are `k * (180/n)` for `k` from `1` to `n-2`.\n\n**Finding the Optimal `k`**\n\nWe need to find an integer `k` (where `1 <= k <= n-2`) such that `|k * (180/n) - a|` is minimized.\n\nThe function `f(k) = k * (180/n)` is strictly increasing with `k`. This means the possible angles form an arithmetic progression. To find the angle closest to `a`, we can consider `a` relative to the range of possible angles:\n\n1.  **Minimum possible angle:** `min_angle = 1 * (180.0 / n)`\n2.  **Maximum possible angle:** `max_angle = (n - 2) * (180.0 / n)`\n\nNow, we have three cases for `a`:\n\n*   **Case 1: `a <= min_angle`**\n    If the target angle `a` is less than or equal to the smallest possible angle, then the smallest possible angle (`k=1`) is the closest. So, `best_k = 1`.\n\n*   **Case 2: `a >= max_angle`**\n    If the target angle `a` is greater than or equal to the largest possible angle, then the largest possible angle (`k=n-2`) is the closest. So, `best_k = n-2`.\n\n*   **Case 3: `min_angle < a < max_angle`**\n    In this case, `a` falls within the range of possible angles. We are looking for `k` such that `k * (180/n)` is closest to `a`. This is equivalent to finding `k` that is closest to `a * n / 180.0`.\n    Let `target_k_float = a * n / 180.0`.\n    The optimal integer `k` will be either `floor(target_k_float)` or `ceil(target_k_float)`.\n    Let `k1 = int(target_k_float)` (which is `floor(target_k_float)`).\n    Let `k2 = k1 + 1` (which is `ceil(target_k_float)` if `target_k_float` is not an integer).\n    Both `k1` and `k2` will be within the valid range `[1, n-2]` in this case.\n    We calculate the absolute differences `abs(k1 * (180.0/n) - a)` and `abs(k2 * (180.0/n) - a)`. The `k` value that yields the smaller difference is our `best_k`. If the differences are equal, either `k1` or `k2` is acceptable (the problem states \"any of them\"). We can choose `k1`.\n\n**Outputting Vertices**\n\nOnce `best_k` is determined, we need to output `v1, v2, v3`.\nA consistent choice is:\n*   `v2 = 1` (the vertex of the angle)\n*   `v1 = 2` (one side of the angle)\n*   `v3 = best_k + 2` (the other side of the angle)\n\nThis ensures that `v1, v2, v3` are distinct:\n*   `v2=1` and `v1=2` are distinct.\n*   `v3 = best_k + 2`. Since `best_k >= 1`, `v3 >= 3`. So `v3` is distinct from `1` and `2`.\nAll vertices are within the range `1` to `n`:\n*   `v1=2`, `v2=1` are valid.\n*   `v3 = best_k + 2`. Since `best_k <= n-2`, `v3 <= (n-2) + 2 = n`. So `v3` is also a valid vertex number.\n\nThis approach finds the optimal `k` in `O(1)` time, making it very efficient. Floating-point precision should be sufficient with Python's default `float` type (double-precision).\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=4, a=68)**\n\n1.  `n=4, a=68`\n2.  `min_angle = 1 * (180.0 / 4) = 45.0`\n3.  `max_angle = (4 - 2) * (180.0 / 4) = 2 * 45.0 = 90.0`\n4.  `a=68` falls into `min_angle < a < max_angle` (`45.0 < 68 < 90.0`).\n5.  `target_k_float = 68 * 4 / 180.0 = 272 / 180.0 = 1.511...`\n6.  `k1 = int(1.511...) = 1`\n7.  `k2 = k1 + 1 = 2`\n8.  Calculate differences:\n    *   `angle1 = 1 * (180.0 / 4) = 45.0`. `diff1 = abs(45.0 - 68) = 23.0`.\n    *   `angle2 = 2 * (180.0 / 4) = 90.0`. `diff2 = abs(90.0 - 68) = 22.0`.\n9.  Since `diff2 < diff1` (22.0 < 23.0), `best_k = k2 = 2`.\n10. Output vertices: `v1=2, v2=1, v3=best_k+2 = 2+2=4`. So, `2 1 4`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # The possible angles in a regular n-gon are k * (180/n) degrees,\n    # where k is the number of edges spanned by the arc v1v3 (not containing v2).\n    # k can range from 1 to n-2.\n\n    # Minimum possible angle (k=1)\n    min_possible_angle = 180.0 / n\n\n    # Maximum possible angle (k=n-2)\n    max_possible_angle = (n - 2) * 180.0 / n\n\n    best_k = -1\n    \n    # Case 1: 'a' is less than or equal to the smallest possible angle.\n    # The closest angle will be the smallest possible angle, which corresponds to k=1.\n    if a <= min_possible_angle:\n        best_k = 1\n    # Case 2: 'a' is greater than or equal to the largest possible angle.\n    # The closest angle will be the largest possible angle, which corresponds to k=n-2.\n    elif a >= max_possible_angle:\n        best_k = n - 2\n    # Case 3: 'a' is strictly between the smallest and largest possible angles.\n    # We need to find k such that k * (180/n) is closest to 'a'.\n    # This means k is closest to a * n / 180.0.\n    else:\n        target_k_float = a * n / 180.0\n        \n        # Candidate k values are floor(target_k_float) and ceil(target_k_float).\n        # Both k1 and k2 will be within [1, n-2] in this 'else' branch.\n        k1 = int(target_k_float)\n        k2 = k1 + 1\n\n        # Calculate differences for k1 and k2\n        angle1 = k1 * 180.0 / n\n        diff1 = abs(angle1 - a)\n\n        angle2 = k2 * 180.0 / n\n        diff2 = abs(angle2 - a)\n\n        # Choose the k that gives the minimum difference.\n        # If differences are equal, any is fine.
