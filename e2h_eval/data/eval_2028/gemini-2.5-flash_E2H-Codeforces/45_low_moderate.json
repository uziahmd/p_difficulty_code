There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Tennis Championship Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Tennis Championship\" problem. I need a Python script to figure out the maximum number of games the winner can play in this knockout tournament. The key rule here is that players can only face each other if their game counts differ by at most one.\n\nMy thought process starts by denoting the winner's game count as `k`.  If two players, A and B, meet, and they've played `k_A` and `k_B` games respectively, the rule is `|k_A - k_B| <= 1`. The winner then has `max(k_A, k_B) + 1` games.  The real goal is to maximize the final number of games, which I'm calling `M`.\n\nMy initial instinct was to think about `dp[k]` – the maximum number of \"alive\" players with `k` games played, but that seems a dead end. Instead, I'm focusing on tracing the winner's path, game by game.  If the winner plays `M` games, their opponents' game counts are crucial. Let's call the winner's opponent in game `k`, `w_k`.  \n\nThe winner starts with 0 games. In the first game, their opponent, `w_1`, must have played 0 games too (since `|0 - k_{w_1}| <= 1` and it's the first round).  But how do I maximize the number of games the winner plays overall?\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence keeps popping up in similar problem structures like this.  I'm now thinking about the \"efficiency\" with which we can eliminate players while still maximizing the winner's path.  \n\nI tried defining `f(k)` as the *minimum* number of players to let the winner play k games and any other players remaining have only k-1 games, this doesn't feel right either.\n\nNow, I'm defining `P(k)` as the maximum number of *initial* players needed for the winner to reach `k` games won, and all other remaining players have at most `k` games. Let's see if this definition leads anywhere. This seems like it captures the core idea of maximizing the winner's game count given the tournament constraints. I need to explore this a bit more.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tournament can play, given a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\n\nLet's denote the number of games a player has played and won as `k`.\nWhen two players play, say player A has played `k_A` games and player B has played `k_B` games, the rule is `abs(k_A - k_B) <= 1`. The winner of this game will have played `max(k_A, k_B) + 1` games.\n\nWe want to maximize the number of games the *winner* plays. Let `W` be the designated winner.\n\nConsider the state of the tournament in terms of the number of players who have won a certain number of games.\nLet `count[k]` be the number of players who have won `k` games and are still in the tournament.\nInitially, we have `n` players, all having won 0 games. So `count[0] = n`. All other `count[k]` are 0.\n\nTo maximize the winner's games, `W` should always play. Let's trace `W`'s progress.\n1. `W` plays their 1st game: `W` has 0 wins. Their opponent must have `k_opp` wins such that `abs(0 - k_opp) <= 1`. Since it's the first game, all players start with 0 wins. So `k_opp = 0`. `W` plays against a player who has 0 wins. After `W` wins, `W` has 1 win.\n2. `W` plays their 2nd game: `W` has 1 win. Their opponent must have `k_opp` wins such that `abs(1 - k_opp) <= 1`. So `k_opp` can be 0, 1, or 2. To maximize the winner's games, we want to ensure there are enough opponents for `W` in later rounds. This suggests we should try to keep as many players as possible \"alive\" for as long as possible, or at least structure the tournament such that `W` always finds a valid opponent.\n\nLet's consider the number of players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games.\nLet `f(k)` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games, such that this winner has played `k` games, and all other players still in the tournament (who haven't been eliminated) have played `k-1` games. This specific structure is often useful in problems related to Fibonacci numbers.\n\nLet's define `f(k)` as the maximum number of players that can be eliminated to produce a player who has won `k` games, while minimizing the number of \"high-level\" players consumed. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of players that can be *represented* by a player who has won `k` games, and all other \"active\" players have won `k-1` games.\n\nConsider the state of the tournament in terms of players who have played `k` games and `k-1` games.\nSuppose we have `a` players who have won `k` games and `b` players who have won `k-1` games.\nA player who has won `k` games can play against a player who has won `k-1` games (difference is 1). The winner will have `k+1` wins.\nA player who has won `k-1` games can play against another player who has won `k-1` games (difference is 0). The winner will have `k` wins.\n\nLet `N_k` be the maximum number of initial players needed to produce a winner who has played `k` games.\nTo produce a winner who has played `k` games, they must have won their `k`-th game.\nTheir `k`-th game involved them (having `k-1` wins) and an opponent (having `k'` wins). The rule `abs(k-1 - k') <= 1` means `k'` can be `k-2`, `k-1`, or `k`.\nTo maximize `k` for a given `N`, we want to use as few players as possible for each `k`.\n\nLet's define `fib[i]` as the maximum number of players that can be in a tournament such where the winner plays `i` games. This is not quite right.\nConsider the structure of players needed to form a winner.\n- To get a winner with 0 games: 1 player. (This is the starting point for any player).\n- To get a winner with 1 game: This player (0 games) plays against another player (0 games). Total 2 players.\n- To get a winner with 2 games: The winner (1 game) plays against an opponent.\n    - If opponent has 0 games: `abs(1-0)=1`. Valid. Winner plays 2 games. Total players = 1 (winner) + 1 (opponent) + players needed to get winner to 1 game.\n    - If opponent has 1 game: `abs(1-1)=0`. Valid. Winner plays 2 games. Total players = 1 (winner) + 1 (opponent) + players needed to get winner to 1 game + players needed to get opponent to 1 game. This is more efficient.\n\nThis pattern is exactly the Fibonacci sequence.\nLet `f[i]` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played `i` games, such that this winner has played `i` games, and all other players who are still in contention (but not the winner) have played `i-1` games.\n- `f[0]` = 1 (a player who has played 0 games)\n- `f[1]` = 2 (a player who has played 1 game. This player (0 games) plays against another player (0 games). The winner has 1 game. The other player is eliminated. There are no other active players with 0 games. So this definition doesn't fit well for `f[1]`.\n\nLet's define `f[k]` as the maximum number of players that can be \"accounted for\" by a player who has won `k` games, assuming we are trying to maximize `k`.\n- `f[0] = 1`: A single player who has won 0 games.\n- `f[1] = 2`: A player with 1 win. This player (0 wins) played against another player (0 wins). Total 2 initial players.\n- `f[2] = 3`: A player with 2 wins. This player (1 win) plays against an opponent. To maximize the number of games played by the winner, we should use an opponent who has also played many games. The best opponent for a player with `k-1` wins is a player with `k-1` wins.\n    - So, a player with 1 win (`f[1]` players) plays against another player with 1 win (`f[1]` players). This would result in `f[1] + f[1] = 4` players for a winner with 2 wins. This is not `f[2]=3`.\n\nThe problem is a classic application of Fibonacci numbers. Let `F(k)` be the maximum number of players that can be *eliminated* to produce a player who has won `k` games.\nNo, let `F(k)` be the maximum number of players that can be *represented* by a player who has won `k` games, such that this player is the \"highest-ranked\" among the group, and all other players in this group have played at most `k-1` games.\n\nLet `P_k` be the minimum number of initial players needed to produce a winner who has played `k` games, *and* all other players who are still in the tournament have played at most `k-1` games.\n- `P_0 = 1` (a single player, 0 games played)\n- `P_1 = 2` (a player with 0 games plays another player with 0 games. Winner has 1 game. Other player eliminated.)\n- `P_2`: The winner (1 game) plays an opponent. To maximize `k`, the opponent should have as many games as possible, respecting the rule. An opponent with 1 game is ideal.\n    - So, we take a \"winner with 1 game\" (requires `P_1` players) and an \"opponent with 1 game\" (requires `P_1` players). They play. The winner has 2 games. Total `P_1 + P_1 = 4` players.\n    - But what if the opponent has 0 games? A \"winner with 1 game\" (`P_1` players) plays an opponent with 0 games (1 player). Total `P_1 + 1 = 3` players. The winner has 2 games. This is better.\n\nThis recursive definition doesn't fit the problem directly.\n\nLet's define `dp[k]` as the minimum number of players required to guarantee that a player can reach `k` wins.\n`dp[0] = 1` (1 player, 0 wins)\n`dp[1] = 2` (2 players, A and B. A beats B. A has 1 win.)\n`dp[2]`: A player with 1 win needs an opponent.\n    - Option 1: Opponent has 0 wins. We need 1 player for the opponent + `dp[1]` players for the winner. Total `1 + dp[1] = 1 + 2 = 3` players.\n    - Option 2: Opponent has 1 win. We need `dp[1]` players for the opponent + `dp[1]` players for the winner. Total `dp[1] + dp[1] = 2 + 2 = 4` players.\n    To minimize players for a given `k`, we pick Option 1. So `dp[2] = 3`.\n\nThis looks like `dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]` for `k >= 2`, with `dp[0]=1` and `dp[1]=2`.\nLet's check:\n`dp[0] = 1`\n`dp[1] = 2`\n`dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0] = 2 + 1 = 3`\n`dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 3 + 2 = 5`\n`dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2] = 5 + 3 = 8`\n`dp[5] = dp[4] + dp[3] = 8 + 5 = 13`\n\nThis sequence `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...` corresponds to Fibonacci numbers `F(i)` where `F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, ...`. Specifically, `dp[k] = F(k+2)`.\nSo, `F(k+2)` is the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play `k` games.\nWe are given `n` players and want to find the maximum `k` such that `F(k+2) <= n`.\n\nLet's verify this interpretation with the examples:\n`n = 2`: `F(1+2) = F(3) = 2`. So `k=1`. Output: 1. Correct.\n`n = 3`: `F(2+2) = F(4) = 3`. So `k=2`. Output: 2. Correct.\n`n = 4`: `F(2+2) = F(4) = 3 <= 4`, so `k=2` is possible. `F(3+2) = F(5) = 5 > 4`, so `k=3` is not possible. Max `k=2`. Output: 2. Correct.\n`n = 10`:\n`F(2+2) = F(4) = 3 <= 10` (k=2)\n`F(3+2) = F(5) = 5 <= 10` (k=3)\n`F(4+2) = F(6) = 8 <= 10` (k=4)\n`F(5+2) = F(7) = 13 > 10` (k=5 not possible)\nMax `k=4`. Output: 4. Correct.\n\nThe logic behind `dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]` is as follows:\nTo get a winner with `k` wins, this player (having `k-1` wins) must play their `k`-th game.\nTo minimize the total number of players `n` for this to happen, the opponent for this `k`-th game should ideally be a player who has `k-2` wins.\nWhy `k-2`? Because `abs((k-1) - (k-2)) = 1`, which is allowed.\nIf the opponent has `k-1` wins, it would require `dp[k-1] + dp[k-1]` players.\nIf the opponent has `k-2` wins, it would require `dp[k-1]` (for the winner) + `dp[k-2]` (for the opponent) players. This sum is smaller.\nAfter the winner with `k-1` wins plays against the opponent with `k-2` wins, the winner has `k` wins. All other players are either eliminated or have at most `k-1` wins. This is the condition for `dp[k]`.\n\nSo, we need to find the largest `k` such that `F(k+2) <= n`.\nSince `n` can be up to `10^18`, we need to compute Fibonacci numbers iteratively until they exceed `n`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize `a = 1` (representing `F(2)`) and `b = 2` (representing `F(3)`).\n2. Initialize `k = 1` (representing the number of games played by the winner, corresponding to `F(k+2)`).\n3. If `n = 2`, the answer is 1. We handle this base case.\n4. Loop while `b <= n`:\n   `temp = b`\n   `b = a + b`\n   `a = temp`\n   `k = k + 1`\n5. The loop terminates when `b > n`. At this point, `a` holds the largest Fibonacci number `F(k+2)` that is less than or equal to `n`, and the corresponding `k` is the maximum number of games.\n\nExample walk-through for `n = 10`:\n- Initial: `a = 1` (`F(2)`), `b = 2` (`F(3)`), `k = 1`.\n- `b <= n` (2 <= 10) is true.\n  - `temp = 2`\n  - `b = 1 + 2 = 3` (`F(4)`)\n  - `a = 2` (`F(3)`)\n  - `k = 1 + 1 = 2`\n- `b <= n` (3 <= 10) is true.\n  - `temp = 3`\n  - `b = 2 + 3 = 5` (`F(5)`)\n  - `a = 3` (`F(4)`)\n  - `k = 2 + 1 = 3`\n- `b <= n` (5 <= 10) is true.\n  - `temp = 5`\n  - `b = 3 + 5 = 8` (`F(6)`)\n  - `a = 5` (`F(5)`)\n  - `k = 3 + 1 = 4`\n- `b <= n` (8 <= 10) is true.\n  - `temp = 8`\n  - `b = 5 + 8 = 13` (`F(7)`)\n  - `a = 8` (`F(6)`)\n  - `k = 4 + 1 = 5`\n- `b <= n` (13 <= 10) is false. Loop terminates.\n- The result is `k - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4`. This is because `k` was incremented one last time before `b` exceeded `n`. The correct `k` is the one *before* `b` exceeded `n`.\nSo if the loop condition is `b <= n`, when it breaks, `a` is the largest Fibonacci number not exceeding `n`, and `k` is its index.\n\nLet's refine the loop and `k` definition.\n`f0 = 1` (corresponds to `k=0` if `F(k+2)` is used)\n`f1 = 2` (corresponds to `k=1`)\n`res = 1` (initial max games for n=2, `f1`)\nIf `n = 2`, output 1.\nIf `n = 3`, `f0=1, f1=2`. `f_next = 3`. `res=2`. Output 2.\nThis implies `f0` and `f1` should be `F_2` and `F_3`.\n\nLet `a = 1` (representing `F_2`)\nLet `b = 2` (representing `F_3`)\nLet `games_count = 1` (corresponding to `b=2`, i.e., `F_3`, which means 1 game for the winner)\n\nIf `n` is `2`: `games_count` is 1.\nIf `n` is `3`: `a=1, b=2`. `b <= n` (2 <= 3) is true.\n  `temp = 2`\n  `b = 1 + 2 = 3`\n  `a = 2`\n  `games_count = 1 + 1 = 2`\n`b <= n` (3 <= 3) is true.\n  `temp = 3`\n  `b = 2 + 3 = 5`\n  `a = 3`\n  `games_count = 2 + 1 = 3`\n`b <= n` (5 <= 3) is false. Loop terminates.\nOutput `games_count - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`. Correct for `n=3`.\n\nExample `n=10`:\nInitial: `a=1, b=2, games_count=1`\n1. `b=2 <= 10`: `temp=2, b=3, a=2, games_count=2`\n2. `b=3 <= 10`: `temp=3, b=5, a=3, games_count=3`\n3. `b=5 <= 10`: `temp=5, b=8, a=5, games_count=4`\n4. `b=8 <= 10`: `temp=8, b=13, a=8, games_count=5`\n5. `b=13 <= 10`: False. Loop ends.\nOutput `games_count - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4`. Correct for `n=10`.\n\nThis logic seems robust.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Base cases for small n\n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    # Initialize Fibonacci sequence for F(k+2) and corresponding games_count (k)\n    # a represents F(k+2) for the previous k\n    # b represents F(k+2) for the current k\n    # games_count tracks the current k\n    \n    # F(2) = 1, corresponds to 0 games (a single player, no games won yet)\n    # F(3) = 2, corresponds to 1 game (winner of a 2-player match)\n    # F(4) = 3, corresponds to 2 games (winner of a 3-player structure)\n    \n    # We start with the state where the winner has played 1 game, requiring 2 players.\n    a = 1  # Represents F_k_plus_2 for k-1 (e.g., F(2) for k=0 or F(3) for k=1 based on how you map)\n    b = 2  # Represents F_k_plus_2 for k (e.g., F(3) for k=1)\n    games_count = 1 # The number of games the winner has played, corresponding to 'b'\n\n    # Loop to find the largest games_count (k) such that F(k+2) <= n\n    while b <= n:\n        temp = b\n        b = a + b\n        a = temp\n        games_count += 1\n    \n    # The loop terminates when b > n.\n    # At this point, 'a' holds the largest Fibonacci number F(k+2) that is <= n.\n    # The 'games_count' variable was incremented one last time when 'b' became > n.\n    # So, the maximum number of games the winner can play is 'games_count - 1'.\n    print(games_count - 1)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
