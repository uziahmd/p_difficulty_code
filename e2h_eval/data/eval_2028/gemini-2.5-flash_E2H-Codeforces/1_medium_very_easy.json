The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's the breakdown of my thinking to solve this \"gilded cells\" problem:**\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many gilded cells are on this rectangular plate. The plate has a width (`w`) and height (`h`), and there are `k` rings. Each ring is a border around a smaller inner rectangle. The `i`-th ring is the border of a rectangle that's `w - 4*(i - 1)` wide and `h - 4*(i - 1)` high. That `4*(i-1)` part is key because the rings get smaller by 4 units (2 on each side) for each ring.\n\nMy first thought is, for each ring, I need to calculate how many cells are in its border. Then, I'll sum those up. How to count the border cells? Well, the most straightforward formula for a rectangular border of width W and height H is `2*W + 2*H - 4`. The `-4` is there because the corners get counted twice. I can use this.\n\nI need to make sure this formula always works, even as the rings get smaller. The maximum `k` value is tied to the minimum dimension (`w` or `h`). So, I work through the math to make sure the inner rectangle always has at least a width and height of 3. This should guarantee this formula is valid.\n\nSo, I'll loop from 1 to `k`. In each loop, I compute the current ring's width and height. Then I use my formula to count its border cells. The trick is always subtracting `4*(i-1)` from the original dimensions, where `i` is the ring number. If I use a 0-indexed loop from 0 to `k-1`, I can use `4*i` instead of `4*(i-1)`. I keep a running total of the cells, then at the end of the loop, I print the total. It's a simple `O(k)` solution. That makes it fast enough.\n",
