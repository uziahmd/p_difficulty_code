The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts on Solving Xenia and Ringroad**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem, \"Xenia and Ringroad\".  I need to write a Python script to solve it. Let's break down the problem and figure out the best approach.\n\nEssentially, there's a circular road with houses, and Xenia needs to visit a sequence of houses in order, moving clockwise. The goal is to find the minimum time to complete all tasks.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the movement time is calculated. Moving one house clockwise takes one unit of time. If Xenia needs to go forward, the time is simply the difference. If she needs to go backward on the ring, it's the number of houses left to the starting point plus the target distance, i.e., (n - current) + target_house. I can simplify this to find the difference between the starting and end house positions using modulo.\n\nSo, for each task, I'll need to calculate the time to move from the current house to the target house. I will track Xenia's location and add the calculated time for each move. To calculate the distance: if target is greater than the current house position, I just subtract. If it's smaller, it's (n - current) + target, where n is the total number of houses.\n\nI'll initialize the total time to zero and Xenia's current position to house number one. Then, I will loop through the list of task houses and add the necessary time to her total.\n\nLet's quickly run through a couple of examples with the calculation to double-check that the idea is correct. If the numbers are as expected, I am good to begin coding. The tests seem to agree with my calculations.\n\nThe code's performance looks great: it runs in O(m) time because I iterate through the tasks once, and the space complexity is also O(m) to store the inputs. Since the inputs are provided in a single line, it's a small extra time but is acceptable. There are no memory issues because Python automatically adjusts.\n\nThe problem says to read input from stdin and print to stdout; the basic structure seems sufficient. Let me start the implementation. I'm going to take the logic described and implement it.\n\nOnce the script works, I'll review it and make sure it is optimized. Looks good!\n",
