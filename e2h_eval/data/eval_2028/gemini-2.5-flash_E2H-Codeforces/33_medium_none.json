You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements.

    "thought": "**Reflecting on the \"Replacing Digits\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with solving this \"Replacing Digits\" problem. The core idea is pretty straightforward: given a number `a` and a set of replacement digits `s`, I want to maximize the number `a` by strategically swapping out its digits with those from `s`. The catch? Each digit in `s` can only be used once.\n\nMy initial thought is that to maximize a number, I need to make the leftmost digits as large as possible. This is because a digit in a more significant position contributes more to the overall value.  So, the general strategy is clear: I want to greedily replace the digits of `a` from left to right with the largest available digits from `s`, as long as that replacement makes the resulting number bigger.\n\nTo implement this, I figure I need to:\n\n1.  **Represent the number `a` in a mutable way:**  A string is immutable, so converting it to a list of characters makes the digit-swapping easy.\n2.  **Sort the replacement digits:** Sorting the `s` digits in descending order ensures I can grab the largest available replacement with a simple pointer or popping from the list.\n3.  **Iterate and compare:**  Go through the digits of `a` from left to right. For each digit in `a`, check if any of the remaining digits in `s` are larger. If there's a larger digit from `s`, and it's greater than the current digit in `a`, replace the `a` digit with it, and move on to the next available digit in `s`.  If no digit from `s` can make the digit in `a` larger, I move on to the next digit in `a`, keeping that replacement digit available.\n\nLet's dive deeper into the algorithm's details:\n\n1.  Read `a` and `s`.\n2.  Convert `a` to a list of characters, `a_list = list(a)`.\n3.  Convert `s` to a list of characters and sort it in descending order, `s_list = sorted(list(s), reverse=True)`.\n4.  Initialize a pointer `s_ptr = 0` to keep track of the largest available digit in `s_list`.\n5.  Iterate through the digits of `a`:\n    *   If I've run out of replacement digits ( `s_ptr >= len(s_list)`), I stop.\n    *   If the current largest replacement digit (`s_list[s_ptr]`) is *strictly* greater than the current digit in `a` (`a_list[i]`), replace the `a` digit with it and increment `s_ptr`.\n    *   If `s_list[s_ptr]` is not strictly greater than `a_list[i]`, I don't replace the digit in `a`, because this is the largest available `s` digit, and no smaller `s` digits could possibly be better. I move to the next digit in `a`, and *don't* increment `s_ptr`, leaving the current replacement digit for later use.\n\nThis `s_ptr` logic is crucial. It ensures I'm always trying to make the most significant digit as large as possible, while also accounting for cases where a replacement at an earlier position in `a` makes later positions in `a` replaceable. This is a crucial detail to ensure correctness! I also have to use the digits from s only once.\n\nConsider the example a = \"1024\", s = \"010\".\nSorted s = ['1', '0', '0']\na[0] is '1', the biggest s[0] is '1'. Don't replace.\na[1] is '0', biggest s[0] is '1'. Replace with '1'.\nResult \"1124\".\nIf `s[s_ptr]` can not improve the number, then keep it around, because the next digit could need it.\n\nLet's also think about edge cases: very short `a` and `s`, cases where `a` has no changes, where `s` is bigger than `a`, and so on. The logic seems to handle these correctly:\n\nThe time complexity appears to be O(n + m log m), where n is the length of `a` and m is the length of `s`. This is dominated by the sorting step. The space complexity is O(n + m), because I need to store the lists `a_list` and `s_list`. This complexity is acceptable for this problem.\n\nI'll use `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` for clean input and",
