Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this \"New Year Candles\" problem. I've got it down to a simulation – keeping track of candles burned and crafted.**\n\nMy goal is to figure out the maximum hours a room can be lit given an initial number of candles (`a`) and a crafting rate (`b`). I realized the core is simulating the burning and crafting process.\n\nFirst, I define a function, `calculate_candle_hours`, and then I will define a main function to get input.\n\nMy simulation works like this:\n*   **Initialization:** Start with `a` new candles and zero burned-out candles.\n*   **Burn & Update:**\n    *   I burn all the `new_candles` – that gives me `hours_this_round`.\n    *   This is added to the `total_hours` the room is lit.\n    *   The burned candles go into `burned_out_candles`.\n*   **Craft:** From `burned_out_candles`, I can craft `new_from_crafting = burned_out_candles // b` new candles. Update `burned_out_candles` to reflect what is left (using modulo operation).\n*   **Loop:** I keep repeating this process (burn candles, then craft more if possible) until I no longer have any `new_candles`.\n\nI've tested it against the examples and it worked perfectly. I also ran through some edge cases to make sure my logic holds, like if you can't craft any new candles.\n\nThe main function now reads the problem input as a set of separate lines of `a b` pairs, as hinted by the example format.\n\nI'm confident this Python script can now solve this New Year Candles problem accurately and efficiently! It is now a fully functional solution.\n",
