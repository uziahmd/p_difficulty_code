Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the 'Mister B and Angle in Polygon' Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem: we've got a regular n-gon and need to find three vertices that create an angle as close as possible to a target angle 'a'.  The key here is exploiting the geometry of regular polygons, especially the relationships between central angles, inscribed angles, and arcs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand that the sides are equal, all interior angles are the same, and all vertices lie on a circle. That means the angle subtended at the center is proportional to the arc length, and the inscribed angle is half the central angle that subtends the same arc.\n\nLet's fix vertex `v2` as a reference point. I can label the vertices 1 to n in clockwise order. So, if I pick v2 to be vertex 2, v1 and v3 will be distinct vertices. The angle formed (v1-v2-v3) is an inscribed angle. Now, the angle will depend on the \"arc\" spanned by v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) or better say \"the number of segments or sides\" between them.\n\nMore generally, let's say v2 is vertex X. I have vertices Y and Z, then YXZ is the inscribed angle, and it depends on how many sides (k) form the arc YZ, excluding X. The central angle is k*(360/n), and the inscribed angle YXZ is half that, or k*(180/n).\n\nNow I need to iterate through all possible combinations, calculating the inscribed angles and keeping track of the one that is closest to `a`. It should be straightforward to code this up efficiently, knowing that I can use the central angle relationship to calculate inscribed angles. I'll need to remember to handle the modulo operation when calculating the distances between vertices.\n",
