    "thought": "**Algorithm for Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of this coding challenge.  The core of the problem is about building a directed graph with a specific property: it has to be \"p-reachable\". This means a certain number of pairs of nodes have to be mutually reachable from each other, considering the directionality. I need to figure out both the absolute minimum number of nodes I can use (let's call that `n`) and, for that minimal setup, how to maximize the number of \"unidirectional pairs\" in the graph.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"p-reachable\" means.  It boils down to counting *unordered* pairs of nodes that can reach each other in both directions. The condition `u < v` is given to select one of `(u,v)` and `(v,u)`. The way to create such pairs is with strongly connected components (SCCs) in the graph. The number of such pairs within an SCC of size `k` is `k*(k-1)/2`. So, the problem becomes finding the SCC sizes such that the sum of these `k(k-1)/2` values equals `p`, while minimizing the total number of nodes `n`, which is the sum of the SCC sizes.\n\nTo minimize the number of nodes, my hunch is to make the SCCs as large as possible. This is because `k(k-1)/2` grows quadratically with `k`, so bigger SCCs help us achieve the target count `p` with fewer total nodes. I'll use a greedy approach: keep finding the largest possible SCC size (let's say `k`) such that `k(k-1)/2` is less than or equal to the remaining `p` value, and then repeat until `p` reaches zero. I am fairly certain this approach works, and I checked the logic and it will provide the minimal value for `n`. I should note down the values of the SCCs, and how they relate to the target number of pairs.\n\nNow, I want to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs. A pair is unidirectional if there's a directed path from node `u` to `v` but no path back from `v` to `u`. The key insight is that to maximize such pairs, the SCCs are arranged in a \"chain\" or a linear order. Imagine a directed graph where SCCs are connected in a chain `SCC1 -> SCC2 -> SCC3`. In such a configuration, any pair of nodes where the first node is in an SCC that comes earlier in the chain is going to be a unidirectional pair. This arrangement creates the maximum possible number of unidirectional pairs given the sizes of our SCCs.\n\nI will need to run the greedy algorithm I defined earlier to find the sizes of the SCCs in order to calculate the number of unidirectional pairs. Once I have the sizes, the math is simple. I can compute the number of unidirectional pairs. The number of nodes `n` and the maximum number of unidirectional pairs can then be calculated. All the examples and logic I used point to this being the right approach. I should precompute a table with values of `k*(k-1)/2`, and then apply a binary search to make the algorithm more efficient.  The maximum value for p is `2 * 10^5`, which should result in SCC sizes around the values of 632, 43, 6, 4. No integer overflow issues.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values for a given integer `p`:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n` required to create a directed graph that is `p`-reachable.\n2. Among all such `p`-reachable graphs with the minimum number of nodes, the maximum possible number of unidirectional pairs of nodes.\n\nLet's break down the definitions:\n\n**1. `p`-reachable graph:**\nA graph is `p`-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\nIf `u` and `v` are reachable from each other, they must belong to the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC). The condition `u < v` means we count each *unordered* pair `{u, v}` of distinct nodes within the same SCC exactly once.\nIf an SCC has `k` nodes, the number of such unordered pairs within this SCC is `k * (k - 1) / 2`.\nIf the graph has `m` SCCs with sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`, then the total count `p` is `sum(k_i * (k_i - 1) / 2)` over all SCCs. The total number of nodes in the graph is `n = sum(k_i)`.\n\n**Minimizing `n` for a given `p`:**\nTo minimize `n` (the total number of nodes) for a fixed `p`, we should use as few SCCs as possible, and make each SCC as large as possible. This is because the function `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2` grows quadratically with `k`. For a given target sum `p`, using larger `k` values means we need fewer `k` values, and the sum `sum(k_i)` (which is `n`) will be smaller.\nThis leads to a greedy strategy:\nRepeatedly find the largest integer `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= p_remaining`. Add `k` to `n_min` and subtract `k * (k - 1) / 2` from `p_remaining`. Continue until `p_remaining` becomes 0.\n\n**2. Maximizing unidirectional pairs:**\nAn ordered pair `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u != v`, there's a path `u -> v`, and no path `v -> u`. This implies `u` and `v` must belong to different SCCs. Specifically, if `u` is in SCC `C_i` and `v` is in SCC `C_j`, there must be a path from `C_i` to `C_j` in the condensation graph (the DAG formed by collapsing each SCC into a single node), and no path from `C_j` to `C_i`.\n\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we take the SCCs found by the greedy strategy (let their sizes be `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`) and arrange them in a linear chain in the condensation graph. For example, `C_1 -> C_2 -> ... -> C_m`. This can be achieved by adding a single edge from an arbitrary node in `C_i` to an arbitrary node in `C_{i+1}` for each `i` from `1` to `m-1`.\nWith this arrangement, for any two SCCs `C_i` and `C_j` where `i < j`, there is a path from any node in `C_i` to any node in `C_j`, but no path from any node in `C_j` to any node in `C_i`.\nThus, every pair `(u, v)` where `u` is in `C_i` and `v` is in `C_j` with `i < j` will be a unidirectional pair. The number of such pairs is `k_i * k_j`.\nThe total number of unidirectional pairs will be `sum_{1 <= i < j <= m} k_i * k_j`.\n\nThis sum can be computed efficiently:\nLet `N = sum(k_i)` (which is `n_min`).\n`N^2 = (sum k_i)^2 = sum(k_i^2) + 2 * sum_{i < j} k_i * k_j`.\nTherefore, `sum_{i < j} k_i * k_j = (N^2 - sum(k_i^2)) / 2`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Initialize `n_min = 0` and `sum_k_sq = 0`.\n2. While `p > 0`:\n   a. Find the largest integer `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= p`.\n      This can be done by solving the quadratic inequality `k^2 - k - 2p <= 0`. The positive root of `k^2 - k - 2p = 0` is `(1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2`. So, `k = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2)`.\n      To avoid floating point issues, we can find `k` by iterating from `1` up to a reasonable maximum (e.g., `633` for `p = 2 * 10^5`) or by binary search. A simple loop `while (current_k + 1) * current_k // 2 <= p: current_k += 1; k = current_k - 1` also works and is efficient enough.\n   b. Add `k` to `n_min`.\n   c. Add `k*k` to `sum_k_sq`.\n   d. Subtract `k * (k - 1) / 2` from `p`.\n3. After the loop, `n_min` will hold the minimum number of nodes.\n4. Calculate `max_unidirectional_pairs = (n_min * n_min - sum_k_sq) // 2`.\n5. Print `n_min` and `max_unidirectional_pairs`.\n\n**Edge Case:**\nIf `p = 0`, the loop `while p > 0` is skipped. `n_min` remains `0`, `sum_k_sq` remains `0`. The formula gives `(0*0 - 0) // 2 = 0`. So the output is `0 0`, which is correct for an empty graph.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`p=4`):**\n1. `n_min = 0`, `sum_k_sq = 0`, `p = 4`.\n2. **Iteration 1:**\n   a. Find largest `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= 4`.\n      `k=1: 0`, `k=2: 1`, `k=3: 3`, `k=4: 6`. So `k=3`.\n   b. `n_min = 0 + 3 = 3`.\n   c. `sum_k_sq = 0 + 3*3 = 9`.\n   d. `p = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n3. **Iteration 2:**\n   a. Find largest `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= 1`.\n      `k=1: 0`, `k=2: 1`, `k=3: 3`. So `k=2`.\n   b. `n_min = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n   c. `sum_k_sq = 9 + 2*2 = 13`.\n   d. `p = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n4. `p` is now `0`, loop terminates.\n5. `max_unidirectional_pairs = (n_min * n_min - sum_k_sq) // 2 = (5*5 - 13) // 2 = (25 - 13) // 2 = 12 // 2 = 6`.\n6. Output: `5 6`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    p = int(input())\n\n    n_min = 0\n    sum_k_sq = 0\n\n    if p == 0:\n        print(0, 0)\n        return\n\n    while p > 0:\n        # Find the largest integer k such that k * (k - 1) // 2 <= p\n        # This is equivalent to k^2 - k - 2p <= 0\n        # The positive root of k^2 - k - 2p = 0 is (1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2\n        # We need floor of this value.\n        \n        # Calculate k using the quadratic formula for efficiency and precision\n        # Using math.isqrt for integer square root to avoid float issues\n        # For very large p, 1 + 8p might overflow standard int if not careful,\n        # but for p <= 2e5, 1 + 8p <= 1 + 1.6e6, which fits in standard integer types.\n        \n        k_val = (1 + math.isqrt(1 + 8 * p)) // 2\n        \n        # It's possible k_val is slightly off due to integer square root properties\n        # or if 1 + 8p is a perfect square.\n        # We need to ensure k_val * (k_val - 1) // 2 <= p.\n        # If k_val * (k_val - 1) // 2 > p, then k_val is too large, reduce it.\n        # This can happen if 1 + 8p is not a perfect square and math.isqrt rounds down,\n        # or if the formula gives a k_val that's just barely too high.\n        # A quick check: k_val * (k_val - 1) / 2 is increasing.\n        # So if k_val is too high, k_val-1 is correct.\n        \n        while k_val * (k_val - 1) // 2 > p:\n            k_val -= 1\n        \n        # k_val must be at least 2 to contribute to p.\n        # If k_val becomes 0 or 1, it means p is 0, which is handled by the outer loop condition.\n        # For k=0 or k=1, k*(k-1)//2 is 0.\n        # We only add positive k values to n_min.\n        # If p is small (e.g., p=0), k_val could be 1.\n        # Example: p=0, (1+isqrt(1))/2 = 1. k_val = 1. 1*(0)//2 = 0 <= 0.\n        # This is fine, as it means 0 nodes are added.\n        \n        # If k_val is 0 or 1, it means this SCC contributes 0 to p.\n        # We should only consider k_val >= 2 for actual SCCs that contribute to p.\n        # However, the calculation of n_min and sum_k_sq correctly handles k_val=0 or 1\n        # by adding 0 to p, n_min, and sum_k_sq.\n        # Since p is strictly positive when entering the loop, k_val will be >= 2.\n        # E.g. if p=1, k_val = (1+isqrt(9))//2 = (1+3)//2 = 2.\n        \n        n_min += k_val\n        sum_k_sq += k_val * k_val\n        p -= k_val * (k_val - 1) // 2\n\n    max_unidirectional_pairs = (n_min * n_min - sum_k_sq) // 2\n\n    print(n_min, max_unidirectional_pairs)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
