He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Strategic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a competitive programming challenge.  The core of it is a string problem, a very common type of problem in these settings. The goal is to figure out the original string `s`, knowing only its improper prefixes and suffixes.  The input's structure, with exactly two strings for each length from 1 to `n-1`, is crucial, I suspect.  We need to use 'P' for prefix and 'S' for suffix to tell them apart.\n\nMy initial thought is to visualize the structure: prefixes grow from the beginning of `s`, and suffixes shrink from the end.  I'm already thinking about edge cases and key properties.  Specifically, the fact that we have two strings of length `n-1` is screaming for attention. These, obviously, are the longest proper prefix and suffix.\n\nI'm zeroing in on those length `n-1` strings: Let's call them `str1` and `str2`. The key, I believe, is to determine which of these is the prefix and which is the suffix. If I can nail that down, I can potentially reconstruct `s`.\n\nIf I assume `str1` is the prefix and `str2` is the suffix, then the overall string `s` could be represented as either `str1 + some_char` or `some_char + str2`.  These reconstructions must be consistent, leading to the condition I need to check.  If `str1` is `s[0:n-1]` and `str2` is `s[1:n]`, then `str1[1:]` must be equal to `str2[:-1]`. Essentially, if I remove the last character of the prefix and the first character of the suffix, the remaining parts need to be identical.  This is the defining condition for the problem, which is what I'll be implementing.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to identify which of the given `2n-2` strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. We are guaranteed that there are exactly two strings of each length from `1` to `n-1`, and that these strings correspond to some valid string `s`. We need to output a string of 'P's and 'S's.\n\nLet the unknown string be `s = s_0 s_1 \\dots s_{n-1}`.\nIts proper prefixes are `s_0`, `s_0 s_1`, ..., `s_0 s_1 \\dots s_{n-2}`.\nIts proper suffixes are `s_{n-1}`, `s_{n-2} s_{n-1}`, ..., `s_1 s_2 \\dots s_{n-1}`.\nThere are `n-1` prefixes and `n-1` suffixes.\n\nThe key observation is that there are exactly two strings of length `n-1`. These must be the longest proper prefix (`s_0 \\dots s_{n-2}`) and the longest proper suffix (`s_1 \\dots s_{n-1}`).\n\nLet's find the two strings of length `n-1` from the input. Let them be `str_A` and `str_B`.\nThere are two possibilities for how `str_A` and `str_B` map to the longest prefix and suffix:\n\n**Possibility 1:** `str_A` is the longest proper prefix (`s_0 \\dots s_{n-2}`) and `str_B` is the longest proper suffix (`s_1 \\dots s_{n-1}`).\nIf this is true, then:\n1. The full string `s` can be reconstructed as `str_A + str_B[n-2]` (i.e., `s_0 \\dots s_{n-2} s_{n-1}`).\n2. Also, `s` can be reconstructed as `str_A[0] + str_B` (i.e., `s_0 s_1 \\dots s_{n-1}`).\nFor these two reconstructions to be consistent, the character `str_A[0]` must be `s_0`, and `str_B[n-2]` must be `s_{n-1}`. More importantly, the common part `s_1 \\dots s_{n-2}` must be consistent. This means `str_A[1:]` (which is `s_1 \\dots s_{n-2}`) must be equal to `str_B[:-1]` (which is also `s_1 \\dots s_{n-2}`).\nSo, if `str_A[1:] == str_B[:-1]`, then `s = str_A + str_B[-1]` is a candidate string.\n\n**Possibility 2:** `str_B` is the longest proper prefix (`s_0 \\dots s_{n-2}`) and `str_A` is the longest proper suffix (`s_1 \\dots s_{n-1}`).\nSimilarly, if this is true, then `str_B[1:]` must be equal to `str_A[:-1]`.\nIf `str_B[1:] == str_A[:-1]`, then `s = str_B + str_A[-1]` is a candidate string.\n\nSince the problem guarantees that a valid string `s` exists, at least one of these two possibilities must hold. It's also possible that both hold and lead to the same candidate string `s` or different candidate strings `s`. If both `s_candidate1` (from Possibility 1) and `s_candidate2` (from Possibility 2) are valid, we can pick either one.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n`.\n2. Store all `2n-2` input strings, along with their original indices, in a list.\n3. Identify the two strings of length `n-1`. Let them be `str_A` and `str_B`.\n4. **Test Possibility 1:** Assume `str_A` is the longest prefix and `str_B` is the longest suffix.\n   - Check if `str_A[1:] == str_B[:-1]`.\n   - If true, construct `s_candidate = str_A + str_B[-1]`.\n   - Verify if all other input strings are indeed prefixes or suffixes of `s_candidate`.\n     - Create sets of expected prefixes and suffixes:\n       `expected_prefixes = {s_candidate[0:k] for k in range(1, n)}`\n       `expected_suffixes = {s_candidate[n-k:n] for k in range(1, n)}`\n     - Count how many times each input string appears.\n     - For each input string `inp_str`:\n       - If `inp_str` is in `expected_prefixes` and `expected_prefixes` still has a slot for it, mark it as 'P'.\n       - Else if `inp_str` is in `expected_suffixes` and `expected_suffixes` still has a slot for it, mark it as 'S'.\n       - If at any point we can't classify an input string, this candidate `s` is invalid.\n     - If all strings are successfully classified, we found a valid `s` and a valid 'P'/'S' assignment. Print the assignment and exit.\n\n5. **Test Possibility 2:** If Possibility 1 didn't yield a solution, assume `str_B` is the longest prefix and `str_A` is the longest suffix.\n   - Check if `str_B[1:] == str_A[:-1]`.\n   - If true, construct `s_candidate = str_B + str_A[-1]`.\n   - Perform the same verification as in step 4. This must yield a solution because the problem guarantees one exists. Print the assignment and exit.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\n`n = 5`\nInput strings: `ba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba`\nStrings of length `n-1 = 4`: `abab`, `baba`\nLet `str_A = \"abab\"` and `str_B = \"baba\"`.\n\n**Test Possibility 1:** `str_A` is prefix, `str_B` is suffix.\n`str_A[1:] = \"bab\"`\n`str_B[:-1] = \"bab\"`\nThey match! So `s_candidate = str_A + str_B[-1] = \"abab\" + \"a\" = \"ababa\"`.\nNow verify `s = \"ababa\"`:\nExpected prefixes: `a, ab, aba, abab`\nExpected suffixes: `a, ba, aba, baba`\n\nInput strings (with original indices):\n0: `ba`\n1: `a`\n2: `abab`\n3: `a`\n4: `aba`\n5: `baba`\n6: `ab`\n7: `aba`\n\nLet's maintain counts for expected prefixes/suffixes:\n`exp_P = {'a':1, 'ab':1, 'aba':1, 'abab':1}`\n`exp_S = {'a':1, 'ba':1, 'aba':1, 'baba':1}`\nResult array `ans = [''] * (2*n-2)`\n\n- `inp[0] = \"ba\"`: In `exp_S`. `ans[0] = 'S'`. `exp_S['ba']--`.\n- `inp[1] = \"a\"`: In `exp_P`. `ans[1] = 'P'`. `exp_P['a']--`.\n- `inp[2] = \"abab\"`: In `exp_P`. `ans[2] = 'P'`. `exp_P['abab']--`.\n- `inp[3] = \"a\"`: `exp_P['a']` is 0. In `exp_S`. `ans[3] = 'S'`. `exp_S['a']--`.\n- `inp[4] = \"aba\"`: In `exp_P`. `ans[4] = 'P'`. `exp_P['aba']--`.\n- `inp[5] = \"baba\"`: In `exp_S`. `ans[5] = 'S'`. `exp_S['baba']--`.\n- `inp[6] = \"ab\"`: In `exp_P`. `ans[6] = 'P'`. `exp_P['ab']--`.\n- `inp[7] = \"aba\"`: `exp_P['aba']` is 0. In `exp_S`. `ans[7] = 'S'`. `exp_S['aba']--`.\n\nAll strings classified. Result: `SPPSPSPS`. This matches the example output.\n\nThis approach works because there are exactly `n-1` unique prefixes and `n-1` unique suffixes for a string of length `n`. When we iterate through the input strings, we prioritize assigning them as prefixes if they match an expected prefix and that prefix hasn't been \"used up\" yet. If not, we try to assign it as a suffix. This greedy choice works because the problem guarantees a valid assignment exists and the counts of each length are exactly two.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # Store input strings along with their original indices\n    input_strings_with_indices = []\n    for i in range(2 * n - 2):\n        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        input_strings_with_indices.append((s, i))\n    \n    # Group strings by length\n    strings_by_length = {}\n    for s, idx in input_strings_with_indices:\n        length = len(s)\n        if length not in strings_by_length:\n            strings_by_length[length] = []\n        strings_by_length[length].append((s, idx))\n        \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    str_A, idx_A = strings_by_length[n-1][0]\n    str_B, idx_B = strings_by_length[n-1][1]\n    \n    # Try Possibility 1: str_A is prefix, str_B is suffix\n    # The full string s would be str_A + str_B[-1]\n    # Check consistency: str_A[1:] must be equal to str_B[:-1]\n    candidate_s1 = None\n    if str_A[1:] == str_B[:-1]:\n        candidate_s1 = str_A + str_B[-1]\n        \n    # Try Possibility 2: str_B is prefix, str_A is suffix\n    # The full string s would be str_B + str_A[-1]\n    # Check consistency: str_B[1:] must be equal to str_A[:-1]\n    candidate_s2 = None\n    if str_B[1:] == str_A[:-1]:\n        candidate_s2 = str_B + str_A[-1]\n\n    # The problem guarantees a solution exists, so at least one candidate_s must be valid.\n    # If both are valid, we can pick either.\n    \n    best_s = None\n    if candidate_s1:\n        best_s = candidate_s1\n    elif candidate_s2:\n        best_s = candidate_s2\n    \n    # If both candidates are valid and different, we need to pick one and verify.\n    # It's safer to try candidate_s1 first, then candidate_s2 if s1 fails verification.\n    # The problem implies that if s1 is consistent, it's a valid choice.\n    \n    # Function to verify a candidate string and generate the P/S array\n    def verify_and_assign(s_candidate, original_inputs):\n        if not s_candidate:\n            return None\n        \n        expected_prefixes = {}\n        expected_suffixes = {}\n        \n        for k in range(1, n):\n            prefix = s_candidate[0:k]\n            suffix = s_candidate[n-k:n]\n            expected_prefixes[prefix] = expected_prefixes.get(prefix, 0) + 1\n            expected_suffixes[suffix] = expected_suffixes.get(suffix, 0) + 1\n            \n        # Create a list to store results, indexed by original input order\n        result_ps = [''] * (2 * n - 2)\n        \n        # Keep track of remaining expected prefixes/suffixes\n        current_prefixes = expected_prefixes.copy()\n        current_suffixes = expected_suffixes.copy()\n        \n        # Iterate through input strings in their original order to assign P/S\n        for s_val, original_idx in original_inputs:\n            # Prioritize prefix if possible\n            if s_val in current_prefixes and current_prefixes[s_val] > 0:\n                result_ps[original_idx] = 'P'\n                current_prefixes[s_val] -= 1\n            elif s_val in current_suffixes and current_suffixes[s_val] > 0:\n                result_ps[original_idx] = 'S'\n                current_suffixes[s_val] -= 1\n            else:\n                # This candidate_s is not valid, or there's an issue with counts\n                # (should not happen given problem constraints if candidate_s is correct)\n                return None\n        \n        # Check if all counts are zero (all expected prefixes/suffixes used)\n        if all(count == 0 for count in current_prefixes.values()) and \\\n           all(count == 0 for count in current_suffixes.values()):\n            return \"\".join(result_ps)\n        else:\n            return None # Mismatch in counts, candidate_s is not valid\n    \n    # Try candidate_s1 first\n    ans = verify_and_assign(candidate_s1, input_strings_with_indices)\n    if ans:\n        sys.stdout.write(ans + \"\\n\")\n        return\n    \n    # If candidate_s1 didn't work (e.g., wasn't consistent), try candidate_s2\n    ans = verify_and_assign(candidate_s2, input_strings_with_indices)\n    if ans:\n        sys.stdout.write(ans + \"\\n\")\n        return\n    \n    # This point should not be reached based on problem guarantees.\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
