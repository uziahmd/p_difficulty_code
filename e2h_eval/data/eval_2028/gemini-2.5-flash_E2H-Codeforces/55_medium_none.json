    "thought": "**Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with transforming a string into its lexicographically smallest form by swapping adjacent '0's and '1's, and '1's and '2's.  Directly swapping '0' and '2' isn't allowed, which is a key constraint.  I realized that this restriction means the relative order of '0's and '2's is *fixed*.  Essentially, a '0' can never pass a '2' (and vice versa) through these swaps.\n\n'0's and '1's, on the other hand, can be freely reordered relative to each other, and the same goes for '1's and '2's. My thinking is, to make the string as small as possible lexicographically, I need to get the '0's to the far left.  Then '1's, and then '2's.\n\nSo, I'll count how many of each digit there are.  The '1's are mobile, the '0's and '2's act as barriers to each other. I'll construct a new string by keeping the original relative order of the '0's and '2's.  I'll call this the \"fixed\" sequence.  The remaining '1's need to be inserted in an optimal position within this fixed sequence.\n\nThe best place to put the block of '1's is right after the sequence of '0's that can go to the far left. The '0's that are to the left of the '2' are kept where they are because we cannot have a '0' pass a '2', in the new string. That means placing all of the '1's before the first '2'. Therefore, I need to find the index of the first '2' in that fixed sequence string.  The resulting string is:  (all '0's before the first '2' from the original sequence) + (all '1's) + (The first '2', and all that follow from that sequence)\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by swapping adjacent '0's and '1's, and adjacent '1's and '2's. We cannot directly swap '0's and '2's.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed operations:\n1. '0' and '1' can swap: \"01\" <-> \"10\". This means '0's can move past '1's, and '1's can move past '0's.\n2. '1' and '2' can swap: \"12\" <-> \"21\". This means '1's can move past '2's, and '2's can move past '1's.\n\nA crucial observation is about '0's and '2's. Since \"02\" <-> \"20\" swaps are not allowed, and '1's are the only characters that can interact with both '0's and '2's, we need to see if '0's and '2's can indirectly swap.\nConsider the sequence \"012\".\n- We can swap '0' and '1': \"102\". From here, '0' and '2' cannot swap.\n- We can swap '1' and '2': \"021\". From here, '0' and '2' cannot swap.\nIn neither case did the '0' move past the '2'. This demonstrates that the relative order of any '0' and any '2' in the string is fixed. If a '0' appears before a '2' in the original string, it must appear before that '2' in the final string. Similarly, if a '2' appears before a '0', it must remain so.\n\nThis observation is the key to solving the problem:\n1.  **Fixed Relative Order of '0's and '2's**: The relative positions of '0's and '2's cannot change. This means if we remove all '1's from the original string, the resulting subsequence of '0's and '2's must appear in the final string in the same relative order. Let's call this subsequence `s_02_str`.\n2.  **Mobility of '1's**: A '1' can move past any '0' and any '2'. This implies that all '1's in the string can be grouped together into a single contiguous block. They are essentially \"free\" to move around, as long as they don't facilitate a '0'-'2' swap.\n3.  **Lexicographical Minimization**: To make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to place '0's as far left as possible, then '1's, then '2's.\n\nCombining these points:\nSince the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed, `s_02_str` forms a \"scaffold\" for the final string. We need to insert the block of `count1` '1's into this `s_02_str`.\nTo achieve the lexicographically smallest string:\n-   All '0's that appear before any '2' in `s_02_str` should come first.\n-   Then, all '1's should come.\n-   Then, the first '2' from `s_02_str` and all subsequent '0's and '2's should come.\n\nThis strategy ensures that:\n-   All '0's that are not constrained by a preceding '2' are moved to the leftmost possible positions.\n-   All '1's are grouped together and placed after these \"free\" '0's but before any '2's. This is the optimal position for '1's to minimize the string lexicographically, as they can move past '0's to their left and '2's to their right.\n-   The '0'-'2' relative order constraint is respected because the '1's are inserted into `s_02_str` without altering its internal order.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Initialize `count1 = 0` and an empty list `s_02_chars`.\n2.  Iterate through the input string `s`:\n    *   If the character is '1', increment `count1`.\n    *   Otherwise (if it's '0' or '2'), append it to `s_02_chars`.\n3.  Join `s_02_chars` to form `s_02_str`.\n4.  Find the index of the first occurrence of '2' in `s_02_str`. Let this be `first_two_idx`.\n    *   If `first_two_idx` is -1 (meaning no '2's are present in `s_02_str`):\n        The string `s_02_str` consists only of '0's (or is empty). All '0's can come before all '1's. The result is `s_02_str + ('1' * count1)`.\n    *   If `first_two_idx` is found:\n        The optimal place to insert the block of '1's is right before this first '2'. This allows all '0's preceding this '2' to come first, then all '1's, and then the rest of the '0's and '2's (starting with that first '2').\n        The result is `s_02_str[:first_two_idx] + ('1' * count1) + s_02_str[first_two_idx:]`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: `s = \"100210\"`**\n\n1.  `count1 = 0`, `s_02_chars = []`\n2.  Iterate:\n    *   '1': `count1 = 1`\n    *   '0': `s_02_chars = ['0']`\n    *   '0': `s_02_chars = ['0', '0']`\n    *   '2': `s_02_chars = ['0', '0', '2']`\n    *   '1': `count1 = 2`\n    *   '0': `s_02_chars = ['0', '0', '2', '0']`\n3.  `s_02_str = \"0020\"`\n4.  `first_two_idx = s_02_str.find('2')` which is `2`.\n5.  Since `first_two_idx` is not -1:\n    `result = s_02_str[:2] + ('1' * 2) + s_02_str[2:]`\n    `result = \"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\"`\n    `result = \"001120\"`\n\nThis matches the example output. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(N) due to single passes and string operations, which is efficient for N up to 10^5.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    count1 = 0\n    s_02_chars = []\n\n    # Separate '1's from '0's and '2's, maintaining relative order of '0's and '2's\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            count1 += 1\n        else:\n            s_02_chars.append(char)\n\n    # Reconstruct the string of '0's and '2's\n    s_02_str = \"\".join(s_02_chars)\n\n    # Find the insertion point for the block of '1's\n    # All '1's should be placed after all '0's that appear before any '2',\n    # and before any '2's themselves.\n    first_two_idx = s_02_str.find('2')\n\n    if first_two_idx == -1:\n        # If there are no '2's in s_02_str (meaning s_02_str is all '0's or empty),\n        # all '0's come first, then all '1's.\n        result = s_02_str + '1' * count1\n    else:\n        # If '2's exist, insert all '1's right before the first '2'.\n        # This ensures '0's that can precede '1's do, and '1's precede '2's.\n        result = s_02_str[:first_two_idx] + '1' * count1 + s_02_str[first_two_idx:]\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(result + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
