Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Dynamic Programming for the TV Game**\n\nAlright, I've got this \"TV Game\" problem, and I've boiled it down to a dynamic programming approach. The challenge is to figure out the optimal sequence of \"Homer\" and \"Marge\" moves to maximize the sum of their individual numbers formed by grabbing digits from a given number.\n\nHere's the gist: we have a number 'A' with 2n digits, and each player gets 'n' moves. In each move, they pick the leftmost digit of 'A' and append it to their number. The goal is to maximize the combined sum of their numbers at the end. I'm thinking the best way is to utilize dynamic programming since the size of the state is feasible.\n\nThe crucial insight here is that the *position* of a digit matters significantly. Each digit contributes a specific value based on the power of 10. If Homer picks digit d_i at their j-th move, it contributes d_i * 10^(n-1-j) to Homer's total. It's essentially a state transition problem.\n\nMy states will be `dp[k][h][m]` representing the maximum prize achievable when considering the digits from the k-th digit onwards, Homer having already made `h` moves, and Marge already having `m` moves. We need to explore all combinations, Homer or Marge picks current digit.\n\n*   **Base Case:** If all digits are processed (k == 2n) and all player moves are done (h == n, m == n), then the total prize is 0. Otherwise (e.g., moves remaining), it's invalid so, I'll return -1.\n\n*   **Transitions:** For each state, there are two choices: Homer picks or Marge. I'll need to check if each choice is valid (Homer or Marge hasn't exhausted their move). The contribution will also be added to a new state and if the new prize is better, then update the state.\n\n*   For instance, from `dp[k][h][m]`, if Homer has moves left (h<n), he can pick the current digit `A[k]` and the prize will be `A[k] * 10^(n-1-h)` plus the best prize achievable from the state `dp[k+1][h+1][m]`. I need to handle Marge similarly.\n*   I'll memoize the intermediate results in `dp[][]` and store the 'H' or 'M' choice in `path[][]`.\n\nTo implement this, I'll convert the input string to an integer array and precompute the powers of 10 for speed. Since the constraints are not excessive, 64-bit integers will be enough. I'll also initialize `dp` table with -2 to mark them uncomputed and `path` with empty strings. And finally, I can reconstruct the sequence by backtracking using the `path` table.\n\nThis DP solution should work perfectly. I can reconstruct the optimal move sequence from the filled `path` table and output it.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a sequence of `2n` moves, `n` for Homer ('H') and `n` for Marge ('M'), such that the total sum of their resulting numbers (S1 + S2) is maximized. The numbers are formed by taking digits from a given `2n`-digit number `A` from left to right. When a player takes a digit, it's appended to their number. The position of the digit within their number determines its place value.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming. Let's define the state:\n\n`dp[k][h_count][m_count]` represents the maximum total prize (S1 + S2) achievable when considering the digits from index `k` to `2n-1` of the original number `A`, given that Homer has already made `h_count` moves and Marge has already made `m_count` moves.\n\nThe dimensions of the DP table will be `(2n + 1) x (n + 1) x (n + 1)`.\n\n**State Definition:**\n*   `k`: The index of the current leftmost digit in `A` that is being considered (from `0` to `2n`).\n*   `h_count`: The number of digits Homer has already taken (from `0` to `n`).\n*   `m_count`: The number of digits Marge has already taken (from `0` to `n`).\n\n**Base Case:**\n*   If `k == 2n` (all digits have been processed):\n    *   If `h_count == n` and `m_count == n` (both players have made exactly `n` moves), then this is a valid completion, and no more prize can be added. Return `0`.\n    *   Otherwise (if the move counts are not `n` for both), this is an invalid path. Return `-1` (or a very small negative number) to indicate this.\n\n**Recursive Step (Transitions):**\nFor a state `(k, h_count, m_count)`, we consider the `k`-th digit of `A`, let's call it `current_digit = A_digits[k]`. There are two possible moves:\n\n1.  **Homer takes `current_digit`:**\n    *   This is only possible if `h_count < n` (Homer still needs to make moves).\n    *   The `current_digit` becomes Homer's `h_count`-th digit (0-indexed). Its place value is `10^(n - 1 - h_count)`.\n    *   The prize contributed by this digit is `current_digit * 10^(n - 1 - h_count)`.\n    *   The remaining problem is `solve(k + 1, h_count + 1, m_count)`.\n    *   If the recursive call returns a valid prize (not `-1`), calculate `total_prize = Homer_digit_value + res_from_next_state`.\n\n2.  **Marge takes `current_digit`:**\n    *   This is only possible if `m_count < n` (Marge still needs to make moves).\n    *   The `current_digit` becomes Marge's `m_count`-th digit (0-indexed). Its place value is `10^(n - 1 - m_count)`.\n    *   The prize contributed by this digit is `current_digit * 10^(n - 1 - m_count)`.\n    *   The remaining problem is `solve(k + 1, h_count, m_count + 1)`.\n    *   If the recursive call returns a valid prize (not `-1`), calculate `total_prize = Marge_digit_value + res_from_next_state`.\n\nWe choose the option that yields the maximum `total_prize` and store it in `dp[k][h_count][m_count]`. We also need to store the choice ('H' or 'M') that led to this maximum prize in a separate `path` table to reconstruct the sequence of moves later.\n\n**Memoization:**\nThe `dp` table is initialized with a special value (e.g., `-2`) to indicate that a state has not been computed yet. If `dp[k][h_count][m_count]` is not `-2`, we return its stored value.\n\n**Precomputation:**\nThe powers of 10 (`10^0, 10^1, ..., 10^(n-1)`) can be precomputed for faster access.\n\n**Reconstructing the Path:**\nAfter the `solve(0, 0, 0)` call computes the maximum total prize, we can reconstruct the sequence of moves by starting from `(k=0, h_count=0, m_count=0)` and iteratively following the `path[k][h_count][m_count]` choices until `k` reaches `2n`.\n\n**Constraints and Complexity:**\n*   `n <= 18`. This means `2n <= 36`.\n*   The number of states is `(2n + 1) * (n + 1) * (n + 1)`. For `n=18`, this is `37 * 19 * 19 = 13327` states.\n*   Each state involves `O(1)` work (two recursive calls and comparisons).\n*   Total time complexity: `O(n^3)`.\n*   Space complexity: `O(n^3)` for the `dp` and `path` tables.\n*   `18^3` is a small number, so this approach is very efficient and well within typical time limits for competitive programming problems. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle large sums without overflow.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Global variables to be used by the recursive function\nn = 0\nA_digits = []\npowers_of_10 = []\n\n# dp[k][h_count][m_count] stores the maximum total prize for the subproblem\n# -2: not computed yet\n# -1: invalid path (e.g., cannot satisfy n moves for both players)\n# >=0: computed max prize\ndp = []\n\n# path[k][h_count][m_count] stores the choice ('H' or 'M') that led to the max prize\npath = []\n\ndef solve(k, h_count, m_count):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively calculates the maximum total prize.\n    k: current digit index being considered (from 0 to 2n-1)\n    h_count: number of moves Homer has already made\n    m_count: number of moves Marge has already made\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Base case: All digits processed\n    if k == 2 * n:\n        if h_count == n and m_count == n:\n            return 0  # Valid end state, no more prize to add\n        else:\n            return -1 # Invalid end state, not exactly n moves for each player\n\n    # Check if this state has already been computed\n    if dp[k][h_count][m_count] != -2:\n        return dp[k][h_count][m_count]\n\n    current_digit = A_digits[k]\n    \n    max_prize_for_state = -1 # Initialize with -1 to indicate no valid path found yet\n    best_choice_for_state = ''\n\n    # Option 1: Homer takes the current digit\n    if h_count < n: # Homer still has moves left\n        # Calculate value for Homer's current digit\n        # This is Homer's (h_count)-th digit (0-indexed), so its power is n - 1 - h_count\n        homer_digit_value = current_digit * powers_of_10[n - 1 - h_count]\n        \n        # Recursively solve for the next state\n        res_from_next_state = solve(k + 1, h_count + 1, m_count)\n        \n        if res_from_next_state != -1: # If the path from the next state is valid\n            current_total_prize = homer_digit_value + res_from_next_state\n            if current_total_prize > max_prize_for_state:\n                max_prize_for_state = current_total_prize\n                best_choice_for_state = 'H'\n\n    # Option 2: Marge takes the current digit\n    if m_count < n: # Marge still has moves left\n        # Calculate value for Marge's current digit\n        # This is Marge's (m_count)-th digit (0-indexed), so its power is n - 1 - m_count\n        marge_digit_value = current_digit * powers_of_10[n - 1 - m_count]\n        \n        # Recursively solve for the next state\n        res_from_next_state = solve(k + 1, h_count, m_count + 1)\n        \n        if res_from_next_state != -1: # If the path from the next state is valid\n            current_total_prize = marge_digit_value + res_from_next_state\n            if current_total_prize > max_prize_for_state:\n                max_prize_for_state = current_total_prize\n                best_choice_for_state = 'M'\n    \n    # Memoize the result and the best choice\n    dp[k][h_count][m_count] = max_prize_for_state\n    path[k][h_count][m_count] = best_choice_for_state\n    return max_prize_for_state\n\ndef main():\n    global n, A_digits, powers_of_10, dp, path\n\n    # Read input\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    A_digits = [int(d) for d in A_str]\n\n    # Precompute powers of 10 for efficiency\n    # powers_of_10[i] will store 10^i.\n    # The maximum exponent needed is n-1 (for the first digit taken by a player).\n    powers_of_10 = [10**i for i in range(n)]\n\n    # Initialize DP tables\n    # dp table: (2*n + 1) rows for k, (n + 1) columns for h_count, (n + 1) depth for m_count\n    # Initialize with -2 to signify 'not computed'. -1 will signify 'invalid path'.\n    dp = [[[-2 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(2 * n + 1)]\n    # path table: same dimensions, stores 'H' or 'M'\n    path = [[['' for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(2 * n + 1)]\n\n    # Start the dynamic programming computation from the initial state\n    # (k=0, h_count=0, m_count=0)\n    solve(0, 0, 0)\n\n    # Reconstruct the optimal sequence of moves\n    result_moves = []\n    current_k, current_h, current_m = 0, 0, 0\n    while current_k < 2 * n:\n        choice = path[current_k][current_h][current_m]\n        result_moves.append(choice)\n        if choice == 'H':\n            current_h += 1\n        else: # choice == 'M'\n            current_m += 1\n        current_k += 1\n    \n    # Print the result\n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result_moves) + \"\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```",
