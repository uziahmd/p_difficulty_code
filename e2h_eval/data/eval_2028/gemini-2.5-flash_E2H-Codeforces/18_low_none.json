    "thought": "**Deconstructing the Frog's Journey and Counting Reachable Integers**\n\nAlright, so the user wants me to tackle this competitive programming problem involving a frog and a series of jumps. The core is calculating a sum:  `sum_{i=0 to m} f(i)`, where `f(x)` represents the number of distinct integers the frog can reach, starting from `0`, while staying within the confines of the interval `[0, x]`. The frog can either jump forward by `+a` or backward by `-b`.\n\nMy initial thought is to really nail down what `f(x)` means concretely. The frog begins at `0`, and from any position `k`, it can move to either `k + a` or `k - b`. The real kicker is the constraint â€“ the frog is *always* bounded by the interval `[0, x]`. This means that if it jumps from `k` to `k + a`, then `k + a` must be less than or equal to `x`. Similarly, if it jumps from `k` to `k - b`, `k - b` must be greater than or equal to `0`.  Therefore, `f(x)` is essentially the cardinality of the set of reachable points within the interval.\n\nLet's call the set of reachable positions for a given `x`, `S_x`, so `f(x) = |S_x|`. Considering the unrestricted reach, the frog can theoretically jump to any position of the form `k * a - l * b` (where `k` and `l` are non-negative integers). However, the bounded constraint of `[0, x]` makes things considerably more challenging.\n\nAnalyzing how the frog moves, from `0` it can jump to `a`. From `a` it can get to `2a` or `a - b`. Continuing like this, we'll notice the strong relationship between intermediate steps and the final reachable points.\n\nSo, the rule for finding `f(x)` boils down to ensuring:\n\n1.  Every reachable position `p` must reside within the range `[0, x]`.\n2.  If `p` is reachable, and you can jump *forward* to `p + a`, then `p + a` must also be within the bound.\n3.  Similarly, if you can jump *back* to `p - b`, then `p - b` must remain non-negative.\n\nThis structure immediately screams \"graph problem\" to me. Each integer could be a node, and the `+a` and `-b` jumps are the edges. The task is now finding reachable nodes from the starting node `0` within the specified interval `[0, x]`.\n\nMy solution strategy leans towards a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) approach. Let `R` be the set of reachable points. We start with `R = {0}`. Using a queue (`q`) initialized with `0`, we iterate:\n*   Dequeue a `curr` position.\n*   Calculate the potential forward (`next_a = curr + a`) and backward (`next_b = curr - b`) jumps.\n*   If `next_a` is within `[0, x]` *and* hasn't been added to `R` yet, add it to `R` and enqueue it.\n*   The same logic for `next_b`.\n\nThe maximum value of `x` is `m = 10^9`. So, this BFS or DFS will effectively count the reachable integers for each value of `x` up to `m`, allowing me to calculate the final sum.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `sum_{i=0 to m} f(i)`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach, starting from `0`, if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`. The frog can jump `+a` or `-b`.\n\nLet `S_x` be the set of reachable positions under the constraint `[0, x]`. `f(x) = |S_x|`.\nThe condition \"never jumps on an integer outside `[0, x]`\" means that every position `p` visited by the frog, including intermediate steps, must satisfy `0 <= p <= x`.\n\nLet's analyze the reachable positions. The frog starts at `0`.\nFrom a position `k`, it can jump to `k+a` (if `k+a <= x`) or `k-b` (if `k-b >= 0`).\nThis is a standard graph reachability problem on integers. We can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find all reachable points from `0` within `[0, x]`.\n\nThe maximum value of `x` is `m = 10^9`, so we cannot run BFS for each `x` up to `m`.\nHowever, `a` and `b` are at most `10^5`. This suggests that the structure of reachable points might become periodic or stable after a certain point.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. All reachable points must be multiples of `g`.\nThe maximum possible value a reachable point can take (without the `x` constraint) is `k*a` for some `k`. The minimum is `l*b` for some `l`.\nThe actual reachable points are of the form `k*a - l*b`.\n\nConsider the set of reachable points modulo `g`. Since all reachable points are multiples of `g`, they are all `0 mod g`.\nIf `g > 1`, we can divide `a, b, x` by `g` and multiply the final `f(x)` by `g`. However, the question is about individual integers, not blocks of `g` integers. For example, if `a=2, b=2, x=3`, the reachable points are `{0, 2}`. `f(3)=2`. If we divide by `g=2`, `a'=1, b'=1, x'=1`. Reachable points are `{0, 1}`. `f'(1)=2`. This is not correct. `f(x)` counts distinct integers. So, we should not divide by `g` in the general case.\n\nLet `dist[r]` be the minimum non-negative position `p` such that `p % a = r` and `p` is reachable from `0` using only `+a` and `-b` jumps, where all intermediate steps are non-negative.\nThis is a variation of the shortest path problem on a graph where nodes are residues modulo `a`.\nNodes are `0, 1, ..., a-1`.\nFrom `r`, we can jump to `(r-b) % a`. This corresponds to `p -> p-b`.\nFrom `r`, we can jump to `(r+a) % a = r`. This corresponds to `p -> p+a`.\nThe cost of moving from `r` to `(r-b) % a` is `b`. The cost of moving from `r` to `r` is `-a` if we think of `p-b` as a base and we are trying to reach `p`.\nMore precisely, `dist[r]` is the smallest `p >= 0` such that `p % a = r` and `p` is reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps (where all intermediate positions are non-negative).\nWe can compute `dist[r]` for `r` in `[0, a-1]` using Dijkstra's algorithm.\nInitialize `dist[0] = 0` and `dist[r] = infinity` for `r != 0`.\nUse a min-priority queue.\nWhen extracting `u` from priority queue:\n1. Consider `u+a`. This is `u` in terms of modulo `a`. This path does not change the residue, but increases the value.\n2. Consider `u-b`. This becomes `(u-b)%a`. If `dist[(u-b)%a]` is greater than `u-b` (if `u-b >= 0`), or `u-b + k*a` (if `u-b < 0`) then update `dist[(u-b)%a]`.\nThe standard approach for this problem is:\n`dist[0] = 0`, `dist[r] = infinity` for `r \\in [1, a-1]`.\nPriority queue `pq` stores `(d, r)` pairs. Initially `pq = [(0, 0)]`.\nWhen we extract `(d, r)` from `pq`:\n  If `d > dist[r]`, continue.\n  `next_r = (r + b) % a`.\n  If `dist[next_r] > d + b`:\n    `dist[next_r] = d + b`.\n    `pq.push((d + b, next_r))`.\nThis computes `dist[r]` as the minimum non-negative `P` such that `P % a = r` and `P` is reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps, with all intermediate values non-negative.\n\nOnce we have `dist[r]` for all `r \\in [0, a-1]`:\nFor a given `x`, the set `S_x` includes all `p` such that `p <= x` and `p` is reachable.\nA position `p` is reachable if `p >= dist[p % a]`.\nSo, for a given `x`, `f(x)` is the count of `p` such that `0 <= p <= x` and `p >= dist[p % a]`.\n\nLet's define `count_reachable(X)` as the number of reachable points in `[0, X]`.\n`f(x) = count_reachable(x)`.\n`count_reachable(X) = sum_{r=0 to a-1} floor((X - dist[r]) / a) + 1` for `X >= dist[r]`.\nIf `X < dist[r]`, then that `r` contributes `0`.\nThis can be written as `sum_{r=0 to a-1} max(0, floor((X - dist[r]) / a) + 1)`.\n\nWe need to calculate `sum_{i=0 to m} f(i) = sum_{i=0 to m} count_reachable(i)`.\nThe `dist` values are at most `a * b`. Since `a, b <= 10^5`, `a*b` can be `10^{10}`. This is too large.\nThe `dist` values are actually bounded by `a + b + ... + (a-1)b` or similar. A tighter bound is `(a-1)b`.\nIf `a=1`, `dist[0]=0`. `f(x)` is the number of integers `p` in `[0, x]` such that `p >= dist[p%1=0] = 0`. This is `x+1`. So `sum f(i) = sum (i+1) = (m+1)(m+2)/2`. This matches example 2.\nIf `b=1`, `dist[r]` is `r`. `f(x)` is the number of integers `p` in `[0, x]` such that `p >= p%a`. This means all `p` are reachable. So `f(x) = x+1`. This also makes sense, as we can reach any `p` by `p` jumps of `+1` (if `a=1`) or `p` jumps of `+a` and `(p-ka)` jumps of `-b` (if `b=1`).\nExample: `a=5, b=3`.\n`dist[0]=0`.\n`dist[1]=inf, dist[2]=inf, dist[3]=inf, dist[4]=inf`.\nPQ: `[(0,0)]`\nExtract `(0,0)`:\n  `next_r = (0+3)%5 = 3`. `dist[3] = min(inf, 0+3) = 3`. Push `(3,3)`.\nPQ: `[(3,3)]`\nExtract `(3,3)`:\n  `next_r = (3+3)%5 = 1`. `dist[1] = min(inf, 3+3) = 6`. Push `(6,1)`.\nPQ: `[(6,1)]`\nExtract `(6,1)`:\n  `next_r = (1+3)%5 = 4`. `dist[4] = min(inf, 6+3) = 9`. Push `(9,4)`.\nPQ: `[(9,4)]`\nExtract `(9,4)`:\n  `next_r = (4+3)%5 = 2`. `dist[2] = min(inf, 9+3) = 12`. Push `(12,2)`.\nPQ: `[(12,2)]`\nExtract `(12,2)`:\n  `next_r = (2+3)%5 = 0`. `dist[0] = min(0, 12+3) = 0`. No update.\nPQ: `[]`\nFinal `dist`: `[0, 6, 12, 3, 9]`.\n\nThe maximum `dist` value is `max_dist = 12`.\nThe values `dist[r]` are bounded by `(a-1)b`. For `a, b <= 10^5`, this is `~10^{10}`. This is indeed too large.\nLet's re-examine `dist[r]`. `dist[r]` is the smallest `p >= 0` such that `p % a = r` and `p` is reachable.\nThe reachable values are generated by `0`, `0+a`, `0+a+a`, ..., `k*a`. Then `k*a-b`, `k*a-b-b`, etc.\nThe `dist` values are bounded by `a * b`. `a,b <= 10^5`, so `a*b <= 10^{10}`. This is not `(a-1)b`.\nThe `dist` values are `min_p` for `p \\equiv r \\pmod a`.\nThe maximum `dist[r]` value is `(a-1)b`. For `a=10^5, b=10^5`, this is `~10^{10}`. This is too large to use in `floor((X - dist[r]) / a)`. `X` can be `10^9`.\n\nThe problem statement for `dist[r]` is usually \"minimum number of `b` jumps to reach `r` modulo `a`\".\nNo, `dist[r]` is the minimum non-negative value `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `p` is reachable.\nThe Dijkstra formulation is correct for finding these minimum values.\nThe maximum value of `dist[r]` is indeed `(a-1)b`.\nThis is because `(a-1)b` is the largest value `p` such that `p < a*b` and `p` is reachable.\nAny `p >= a*b` can be written as `p = k*a + r`, where `r < a`.\nIf `p` is reachable, then `p-a` is also reachable.\nIf `p >= (a-1)b`, then `p` is reachable if and only if `p-a` is reachable.\nThis is because if `p >= (a-1)b`, then `p-b >= (a-1)b-b = (a-2)b`.\nThe max value of `dist[r]` is indeed `(a-1)b`.\nExample 1: `a=5, b=3`. `(a-1)b = 4*3 = 12`. Max `dist` is `12`.\nExample: `a=4, b=5`.\n`dist[0]=0`.\nPQ: `[(0,0)]`\nExtract `(0,0)`: `(0+5)%4 = 1`. `dist[1]=5`. Push `(5,1)`.\nPQ: `[(5,1)]`\nExtract `(5,1)`: `(1+5)%4 = 2`. `dist[2]=5+5=10`. Push `(10,2)`.\nPQ: `[(10,2)]`\nExtract `(10,2)`: `(2+5)%4 = 3`. `dist[3]=10+5=15`. Push `(15,3)`.\nPQ: `[(15,3)]`\nExtract `(15,3)`: `(3+5)%4 = 0`. `dist[0]=min(0, 15+5) = 0`. No update.\nPQ: `[]`\nFinal `dist`: `[0, 5, 10, 15]`. Max `dist` is `15`. `(a-1)b = 3*5 = 15`.\n\nSo the `dist` values can indeed be large. `M` can be `10^9`, but `dist[r]` can be `10^{10}`.\nThis means for many `r`, `dist[r]` will be greater than `M`.\nIf `dist[r] > M`, then `floor((M - dist[r]) / a) + 1` will be non-positive, so `max(0, ...)` correctly gives `0`.\nSo the formula `sum_{r=0 to a-1} max(0, floor((X - dist[r]) / a) + 1)` is correct.\n\nWe need to compute `S = sum_{i=0 to m} f(i) = sum_{i=0 to m} sum_{r=0 to a-1} max(0, floor((i - dist[r]) / a) + 1)`.\nSwap the sums: `S = sum_{r=0 to a-1} sum_{i=0 to m} max(0, floor((i - dist[r]) / a) + 1)`.\nLet `D_r = dist[r]`.\nThe inner sum `sum_{i=0 to m} max(0, floor((i - D_r) / a) + 1)`:\nLet `k = floor((i - D_r) / a) + 1`. This `k` is the number of reachable points `p` such that `p % a = r` and `p <= i`.\nThis sum can be split:\nFor `i < D_r`, `floor((i - D_r) / a)` is negative, so `k <= 0`. `max(0, k)` is `0`.\nSo we only sum for `i` from `D_r` to `m`.\nLet `j = i - D_r`. Then `i = j + D_r`.\nThe sum becomes `sum_{j=0 to m-D_r} max(0, floor(j / a) + 1)`.\nLet `N = m - D_r`. We are interested in `sum_{j=0 to N} (floor(j / a) + 1)`. (assuming `N >= 0`)\nLet `g(N) = sum_{j=0 to N} (floor(j / a) + 1)`.\nThis is `sum_{j=0 to N} floor(j / a) + sum_{j=0 to N} 1`.\n`sum_{j=0 to N} 1 = N+1`.\n`sum_{j=0 to N} floor(j / a)`:\nThe value `floor(j/a)` stays constant for `a` consecutive values of `j`.\n`floor(j/a)` is `0` for `j=0, ..., a-1`. (a terms)\n`floor(j/a)` is `1` for `j=a, ..., 2a-1`. (a terms)\n...\n`floor(j/a)` is `k` for `j=k*a, ..., (k+1)a-1`. (a terms)\nLet `q = floor(N / a)` and `rem = N % a`.\nThe sum is `a * (0 + 1 + ... + (q-1)) + (rem + 1) * q`.\n`a * q * (q-1) / 2 + (rem + 1) * q`.\nSo `g(N) = N+1 + a * q * (q-1) / 2 + (rem + 1) * q`.\nThis `g(N)` is a closed form for the inner sum.\nThe overall sum `S = sum_{r=0 to a-1} (g(m - dist[r]) if m >= dist[r] else 0)`.\n\nLet's recheck `f(x)` calculation for `a=5, b=3`. `dist = [0, 6, 12, 3, 9]`.\n`m=7`.\n`f(0) = max(0, floor((0-0)/5)+1) + max(0, floor((0-6)/5)+1) + ... = 1+0+0+0+0 = 1`.\n`f(1) = max(0, floor((1-0)/5)+1) + ... = 1`.\n`f(2) = 1`.\n`f(3) = max(0, floor((3-0)/5)+1) + max(0, floor((3-3)/5)+1) + ... = 1+1 = 2`. Wait, example says `f(3)=1`. What's wrong?\n\nThe definition of `f(x)` is \"number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\".\nMy `dist[r]` calculation gives the minimum `p >= 0` such that `p % a = r` and `p` is reachable *without any upper bound*.\nThe upper bound `x` means that if `p` is reachable, then `p+a` is only reachable if `p+a <= x`. And `p-b` is only reachable if `p-b >= 0`.\n\nThis implies that the set of reachable points `S_x` is the set of points `p` such that `0 <= p <= x` and `p` is reachable by a path `0=p_0, p_1, ..., p_k=p` where `0 <= p_j <= x` for all `j`.\nThis is a standard BFS.\n`q = deque([0])`\n`reachable_set = {0}`\n`while q:`\n  `curr = q.popleft()`\n  `next_a = curr + a`\n  `if next_a <= x and next_a not in reachable_set:`\n    `reachable_set.add(next_a)`\n    `q.append(next_a)`\n  `next_b = curr - b`\n  `if next_b >= 0 and next_b not in reachable_set:`\n    `reachable_set.add(next_b)`\n    `q.append(next_b)`\n`f(x) = len(reachable_set)`.\n\nThe crucial observation is that `S_x` is a subset of `S_{x+1}`. `f(x)` is non-decreasing.\nThe maximum value `p` that can be reached is bounded by `x`. The maximum value of `x` is `m = 10^9`.\nThe number of distinct reachable points is at most `x+1`.\nThe number of steps in BFS can be up to `x`. This is too slow for `x = 10^9`.\n\nThe problem is that `dist[r]` is computed assuming no upper bound.\nThe `dist[r]` values are only valid for `x` large enough.\nSpecifically, if `x >= max_dist_value = (a-1)b`, then `f(x)` will behave as `sum_{r=0 to a-1} max(0, floor((x - dist[r]) / a) + 1)`.\nLet `L = (a-1)b`. For `x >= L`, the `f(x)` formula holds.\nFor `x < L`, we need to compute `f(x)` using BFS.\nThe maximum value for `L` is `(10^5-1)*10^5 ~ 10^{10}`. This is too large.\nBut `dist[r]` values are only relevant if `dist[r] <= m`.\nSo `L` should be `min(m, (a-1)b)`.\nThe maximum `dist[r]` value that could be relevant to `f(x)` for `x <= m` is `m`.\nSo `dist[r]` values are bounded by `min(m, (a-1)b)`.\nNo, this is wrong. `dist[r]` can be `(a-1)b` which is `10^{10}`. But if `dist[r] > m`, then `f(i)` will not include any point `p` with `p % a = r` for `i <= m`.\n\nThe `dist[r]` values computed by Dijkstra are correct for `p` being reachable from `0` with all intermediate steps non-negative.\nThe question is about `f(x)`, where all intermediate steps must be in `[0, x]`.\nFor a fixed `x`, `S_x` is simply the set of points `p` reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` where all intermediate points are in `[0, x]`.\nThis is a standard BFS on the graph where nodes are `0, ..., x`.\nThe maximum value of `a` and `b` is `10^5`.\nThe critical threshold for `x` is related to `a*b`.\nIf `x` is small, say `x < a+b`, then the frog can only jump `+a`. So `S_x = {0, a, 2a, ..., k*a}` where `k*a <= x`.\n`f(x) = floor(x/a) + 1`. This holds for `x < b`.\nIf `b > a`, then `f(x) = floor(x/a) + 1` for `x < b`.\nFor `a=5, b=3`.\n`f(0)=1` (`{0}`)\n`f(1)=1` (`{0}`)\n`f(2)=1` (`{0}`)\n`f(3)=1` (`{0}`). We can jump `0+5=5`, but `5 > 3`. We can jump `0-3=-3`, but `-3 < 0`. So only `0` is reachable.\n`f(4)=1` (`{0}`)\n`f(5)=3`. (`{0, 5, 2}`). From `0`, can reach `5`. From `5`, can reach `5-3=2`. From `2`, can reach `2+5=7` (but `7>5`). From `2`, can reach `2-3=-1` (but `-1<0`). So `{0, 2, 5}`.\n`f(6)=3`. (`{0, 5, 2}`). From `0`, can reach `5`. From `5`, can reach `5-3=2`. From `2`, can reach `2+5=7` (but `7>6`). So `{0, 2, 5}`.\n`f(7)=8`. (`{0, 5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3}`).\n  `0`: reach `5`. `S={0,5}`\n  `5`: reach `2` (`5-3`). `S={0,5,2}`\n  `2`: reach `7` (`2+5`). `S={0,5,2,7}`\n  `7`: reach `4` (`7-3`). `S={0,5,2,7,4}`\n  `4`: reach `1` (`4-3`). `S={0,5,2,7,4,1}`\n  `1`: reach `6` (`1+5`). `S={0,5,2,7,4,1,6}`\n  `6`: reach `3` (`6-3`). `S={0,5,2,7,4,1,6,3}`\n  `3`: reach `3+5=8` (but `8>7`).\nAll intermediate points must be in `[0, x]`. This is the standard BFS.\nThe maximum value that needs to be explored by BFS is `a+b`.\nThe set of positions reachable from `0` using only `+a` and `-b` jumps, where all intermediate positions are non-negative, is exactly the set of positions `p` such that `p >= dist[p % a]`. This is what the Dijkstra computes.\nLet this set be `R_inf`.\nFor a given `x`, `S_x` consists of all `p \\in R_inf` such that `0 <= p <= x`, AND `p+a` is not reachable if `p+a > x`, AND `p-b` is not reachable if `p-b < 0`.\nThe `dist[r]` values are correct for `f(x)` when `x` is sufficiently large.\nWhat is \"sufficiently large\"? It's when no jump `k+a` or `k-b` from a reachable point `k` causes `k+a > x` or `k-b < 0` to *prevent* a point from being reachable that would otherwise be reachable.\nThis threshold is `a+b`.\nIf `x >= a+b`, then `f(x)` is determined by the `dist[r]` values.\nNo, not `a+b`. The threshold is `max(a, b)`.\nIf `x >= max_dist_value = (a-1)b`, then the `f(x)` formula based on `dist[r]` is correct.\nThis is because if `p` is reachable and `p >= (a-1)b`, then `p-a` is also reachable.\nThe `dist[r]` values are the minimum positive integers that can be reached for each residue class.\nThe values of `f(x)` stabilize for `x >= max(dist)`.\nThe maximum value of `dist[r]` is `(a-1)b`. Let `K = (a-1)b`.\nFor `x >= K`, `f(x)` is indeed `sum_{r=0 to a-1} max(0, floor((x - dist[r]) / a) + 1)`.\nThe maximum `K` can be `10^5 * 10^5 = 10^{10}`. This is too large.\nWe need to use BFS for `x` up to some limit `L`, and then use the formula for `x > L`.\nWhat is `L`? The maximum value `p` that can be reached by a path that includes `p-b` and `p+a` is `a+b`.\nThe maximum value to be considered for BFS is `a+b`.\nLet's define `limit = a + b`. We can run BFS up to `limit`.\nFor `i` from `0` to `min(m, limit)`, we compute `f(i)` using BFS.\n`dp[i]` = `f(i)`.\n`dp[0] = 1`.\n`q = deque([0])`.\n`reachable = {0}`.\n`current_max_reachable = 0`.\n`total_sum = 0`.\n`max_bfs_val = min(m, a + b + max(a,b))`. A safer upper bound for BFS is `a+b+a` or `a+b+b` or `max(a,b)`.\nA simple upper bound for BFS is `a+b`.\nLet `max_val_for_bfs = min(m, a + b)`.\n`pos_dist = [-1] * (max_val_for_bfs + 1)`\n`pos_dist[0] = 0`\n`q = deque([0])`\n`f_values = [0] * (max_val_for_bfs + 1)`\n`f_values[0] = 1`\n`max_reachable_so_far = 0`\n`total_sum = 1`\n`while q:`\n  `curr = q.popleft()`\n  `max_reachable_so_far = max(max_reachable_so_far, curr)`\n  `next_a = curr + a`\n  `if next_a <= max_val_for_bfs and pos_dist[next_a] == -1:`\n    `pos_dist[next_a] = pos_dist[curr] + 1`\n    `q.append(next_a)`\n  `next_b = curr - b`\n  `if next_b >= 0 and pos_dist[next_b] == -1:`\n    `pos_dist[next_b] = pos_dist[curr] + 1`\n    `q.append(next_b)`\n\nThis `pos_dist` is not what we want. We need `f(i)`.\n`f(i)` is the count of reachable points in `[0, i]`.\nLet `reachable_pts[i]` be the set of reachable points for interval `[0, i]`.\n`f(i)` can be computed iteratively:\n`current_reachable = {0}`\n`q = deque([0])`\n`f_val_arr = [0] * (min(m, a+b+a) + 1)`\n`f_val_arr[0] = 1`\n`max_q_val = 0`\n`for i in range(1, min(m, a+b+a) + 1):`\n  `f_val_arr[i] = f_val_arr[i-1]`\n  `if i in current_reachable:`\n    `# if i is newly reachable, we need to explore from i`\n    `# but actually we explore from all reachable points with value <= i`\n    `# This is wrong. f(i) is based on a BFS with upper bound i.`\n    `# f(i) is not simply f(i-1) + new_points_from_i.`\n    `# The BFS for f(i) is independent from f(i-1) except for the fact that S_{i-1} is a subset of S_i.`\n\nLet's use the `dist[r]` values from the Dijkstra approach.\n`dist[r]` is the smallest `p >= 0` such that `p % a = r` and `p` is reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps, where all intermediate positions are non-negative.\nThese `dist[r]` values are correct when the upper bound `x` is large enough that it doesn't restrict jumps.\nWhat is \"large enough\"?\nConsider a point `p`. If `p` is reachable, and `p+a` is reachable (i.e. `p+a` is in `R_inf`), and `p+a <= x`, then `p+a` is in `S_x`.\nIf `p-b` is reachable (i.e. `p-b` is in `R_inf`), and `p-b >= 0`, then `p-b` is in `S_x`.\nThe `dist[r]` values are the minimum positive values for each residue class.\nThe threshold `L` for which `f(x)` can be computed using the `dist[r]` formula is `max(dist[r])`.\nThe maximum `dist[r]` value is `(a-1)b`.\nIf `(a-1)b` is greater than `m`, then the maximum relevant `dist[r]` is `m`.\nSo, the threshold `L` is `min(m, (a-1)b)`.\nNo, this is wrong. `L` is `max_dist_val`.\nThe `dist[r]` values are computed using Dijkstra. Max `dist[r]` is `(a-1)b`. Let `K = (a-1)b`.\nThe BFS approach is needed for `i` up to `K`.\nIf `K > m`, then we only need BFS up to `m`.\nSo, let `limit = min(m, K + a + b)`. (Add `a+b` for safety margin, to ensure all `dist[r]` are \"stabilized\").\nLet `limit = min(m, 2 * (a + b))`. This is a small constant, `~4*10^5`.\nLet's try `limit = min(m, a + b)`.\nFor `i` from `0` to `limit`: compute `f(i)` using BFS.\n`f_arr = [0] * (limit + 1)`\n`total_sum = 0`\n`q = deque()`\n`reachable_set = set()`\n`for i in range(limit + 1):`\n  `# For each i, we update the reachable set and f_arr[i]`\n  `# A point p is reachable in [0, i] if it's reachable in [0, i-1] OR if i is reachable and i-a or i+b are reachable.`\n  `# This is still not quite right. A BFS for each i is too slow.`\n\nThe problem is that the set of reachable points for `[0, x]` is not simply `R_inf` intersected with `[0, x]`.\nFor example, `a=5, b=3`. `dist=[0,6,12,3,9]`.\n`f(3)`: `R_inf` intersected with `[0,3]` is `{0,3}`. So `f(3)=2`.\nBut the BFS gives `f(3)=1`. Why?\nBecause to reach `3` you need to jump `0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 7 -> 4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 3`.\nThe intermediate jump `0 -> 5` is allowed if `x >= 5`.\nFor `x=3`, `0 -> 5` is not allowed. So `3` is not reachable. Only `0` is reachable.\nSo the `dist[r]` values are only useful for `x` large enough to allow all these intermediate jumps.\nThe maximum value `p` in a path `0=p_0, ..., p_k=p` determines the minimum `x` required.\nThe `dist[r]` values are minimum `p` values.\nThe actual `max_intermediate_value[r]` would be `max_{j} p_j` for the path that reaches `dist[r]`.\n`max_intermediate_value[r]` is `dist[r] + b` if `dist[r]` is reached by `p_k-b`.\nThis is exactly what the `dist` values from Dijkstra give you.\n`dist[r]` is the minimum `p` s.t. `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `p` is reachable.\nThe path to `dist[r]` only contains non-negative values.\nThe maximum value in the path to `dist[r]` is indeed `dist[r]`.\nExample `a=5, b=3`. `dist[1]=6`. Path: `0 -> 3 -> 6`. Max value on path is `6`.\n`dist[2]=12`. Path: `0 -> 3 -> 6 -> 9 -> 12`. Max value on path is `12`.\nSo `p` is reachable in `[0, x]` iff `p <= x` and `p >= dist[p % a]` and `x >= max_intermediate_value(p)`.\nThe `max_intermediate_value(p)` for `p` is simply `p` itself if `p` is reached by `+a` jumps only.\nBut if `p` is reached by `p' - b`, then it needs `p'` to be reachable.\nThe crucial insight is that the set of all reachable points (with no upper bound, only lower bound `0`) is `R_inf`.\nFor a given `x`, `S_x` is the subset of `R_inf` such that for every `p \\in S_x`, `p <= x`, and for every step `p_j -> p_{j+1}` in a path to `p`, `p_{j+1} <= x`.\nThis is a standard BFS. The state in BFS is `(current_position, max_position_in_path_so_far)`.\nNo, this is not needed. The BFS is simply on `[0, x]`.\nThe set of reachable points `S_x` is monotonic: `S_x \\subseteq S_{x+1}`.\nLet `reachable[p]` be a boolean array indicating if `p` is reachable.\n`reachable[0] = True`.\n`q = deque([0])`.\n`f_vals = [0] * (m+1)`\n`f_vals[0] = 1`\n`max_q_val = 0`\n`total_sum = 1`\n`for i in range(1, m+1):`\n  `f_vals[i] = f_vals[i-1]`\n  `# Check if any new points become reachable because the upper bound increased to i.`\n  `# This means we can now jump to i from i-a, or from i+b-a (multiple jumps).`\n  `# Or i can be reached by i-a from i-2a, etc.`\n  `# We need to consider all points `p` in `current_reachable` where `p+a = i`.\n  `# If `i` is now reachable, then we add it to `current_reachable` and `q`.\n  `# Then we need to explore from `i`.`\n\nLet `min_val_needed[p]` be the minimum `x` such that `p` is reachable within `[0, x]`.\n`min_val_needed[0] = 0`.\n`q = deque([0])`.\n`min_val_needed = [infinity] * (max_possible_p + 1)`.\n`min_val_needed[0] = 0`.\nWhen we extract `curr` from `q`:\n  `next_a = curr + a`.\n  If `min_val_needed[next_a] > max(min_val_needed[curr], next_a)`:\n    `min_val_needed[next_a] = max(min_val_needed[curr], next_a)`.\n    `q.append(next_a)`.\n  `next_b = curr - b`.\n  If `next_b >= 0` and `min_val_needed[next_b] > min_val_needed[curr]`:\n    `min_val_needed[next_b] = min_val_needed[curr]`.\n    `q.append(next_b)`.\nThis is Dijkstra on `min_val_needed`.\nThe maximum value `p` can take is `a+b`.\nNo, `p` can be `m`.\nThe maximum value `p` needs to be considered is `a+b` for BFS.\nLet `limit_p = a+b`.\nThe `min_val_needed` array would be `[infinity] * (limit_p + 1)`.\nThe `max_val_needed` for `x` is `m`.\nThis `min_val_needed` is what we need.\n`min_val_needed[p]` is the minimum `x` for which `p` is in `S_x`.\nThe maximum value of `p` we need to consider is `m`.\nThe maximum value of `min_val_needed[p]` is `m`.\nThe number of states `p` is `m+1`.

So `min_val_needed_for_p[p] = p` for `p > N`.\nThis means for `p > N`, `p` is reachable in `[0, x]` if and only if `p <= x`.\nThis is true if `p-a` is reachable in `[0, p]`.\nIf `p-a` is reachable in `[0, p-a]`, then `p` is reachable in `[0, p]`.\nThis means if `p-a >= min_val_needed_for_p[p-a]`, then `p` is reachable in `[0, p]`.\nAnd `min_val_needed_for_p[p-a]` is at most `p-a`.

This is correct.\nSince `m=7 < N=8`, we don't need step 5.\n\nThis solution looks solid.\n\nFinal check on edge cases:\n`m=1, a=1, b=1`. `N=2`.\n`min_val_needed[0]=0`. `pq=[(0,0)]`.\n`(0,0)`: `next_a=1`. `min_val_needed[1]=1`. `pq=[(1,1)]`.\n`(1,1)`: `next_a=2`. `min_val_needed[2]=2`. `pq=[(2,2)]`. `next_b=0`. `min_val_needed[0]=0`. No update.\n`(2,2)`: `next_b=1`. `min_val_needed[1]=1`. No update.\n`min_val_needed = [0,1,2]`.\n`min_val_needed_sorted = [0,1,2]`.\n`m=1`.\n`f(0)=1` (p=0).\n`f(1)=2` (p=0,1).\nSum = `1+2=3`.\nFormula for `a=1, b=1`: `(m+1)(m+2)/2 = (1+1)(1+2)/2 = 2*3/2 = 3`. Correct.\n\n`m=100, a=100000, b=1`.\n`N = a+b = 100001`.\nDijkstra up to `N`.\n`min_val_needed[0]=0`.\n`p=0..100001`.\n`min_val_needed[p] = p` for all `p` because `b=1`.\n`f(i)` for `i <= m=100`.\n`min_val_needed_sorted = [0,1,2,...,N]`.\n`f(i)` = count of `p` such that `p <= N` and `min_val_needed[p] <= i`.\nThis is count of `p` such that `p <= N` and `p <= i`.\nSo `f(i) = i+1`.\nSum `f(i)` for `i=0..100` is `sum_{i=0 to 100} (i+1) = (101)*(102)/2 = 101*51 = 5151`.\nExample output for `100 100000 1` is `101`. This means `f(i)=1` for all `i`.\nWhy is `f(i)=1`?\nAh, if `a > i`, then the frog cannot make `+a` jump.\nIf `a > x`, `f(x)=1`.\nIn the example `100 100000 1`, `a=100000`.\nFor `i < 100000`, `f(i)=1`.\n`m=100`. All `i` from `0` to `100` are less than `a`.\nSo `f(i)=1` for `i=0..100`.\nSum = `101 * 1 = 101`. Correct.\n\nMy Dijkstra logic for `min_val_needed[p]` is for `p` being reachable in `[0, x]` where `x` is the `max_path_val`.\nIf `a > N`, then `next_a = curr + a` will always be `> N`.\nSo `min_val_needed[p]` will only be updated for `p` reachable by `-b` jumps.\nIf `a > N`, `min_val_needed[p]` will only be updated for `p` which are `0, -b, -2b, ...`\nNo, `next_a` can be `curr+a`. If `curr+a <= N`.\nIf `a > N`, then `next_a` will never be `curr+a` unless `curr=0` and `a <= N`.\nIf `a > N`, then `next_a` will not be processed for `curr=0` (except if `a <= N`, which is a contradiction).\nSo if `a > N`, then `next_a` branch is effectively skipped.\nOnly `next_b` branch is taken.\n`min_val_needed[p]` will be `0` for `p=0`, and `inf` for all other `p` if `b > N`.\nIf `b <= N`, then `min_val_needed[p]` will be `0` for `p=0`, and `inf` for `p > 0`.\nThis implies `f(i)=1` for all `i` if `a > i` and `b > i`.\nThe `N = a+b` limit for Dijkstra is a bit arbitrary.\nThe actual limit for BFS should be `max(a, b)`.\nIf `x < a`, then `f(x)=1`.\nIf `x < b`, then `f(x)=floor(x/a)+1`.\nLet's use `limit = max(a,b)`.\nWhat if `a=10^5, b=10^5`. `N=2*10^5`.\nWhat if `a=1, b=10^5`. `N=10^5+1`.\nThe `min_val_needed[p]` values for `p > max(a,b)` will be `p`. This is the key.\nSo `N` should be `max(a,b)`.\nLet's use `N = max(a,b)`.\n`m=100, a=100000, b=1`. `N = max(100000, 1) = 100000`.\nDijkstra up to `N=100000`.\n`min_val_needed[0]=0`. `pq=[(0,0)]`.\n`(0,0)`: `next_a = 100000`. `min_val_needed[100000]=100000`. Push `(100000, 100000)`.\n`(0,0)`: `next_b = -1`. Skip.\n`min_val_needed` will be `[0, inf, ..., inf, 100000]` for `p=0..100000`.\n`min_val_needed_sorted = [0, 100000]`.\n`m=100`.\n`f(0)=1` (`p=0`).\n`f(1)=1` (`p=0`).\n...\n`f(100)=1` (`p=0`).\nSum `101 * 1 = 101`. Correct.\n\nSo `N = max(a,b)` is the correct upper bound for Dijkstra.\nThe values `p` for which `min_val_needed[p]` is computed are from `0` to `max(a,b)`.\nIf `m < max(a,b)`, then we sum `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`.\nIf `m >= max(a,b)`, then we sum `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `max(a,b)`.\nThen for `i` from `max(a,b)+1` to `m`, `f(i) = C + i - max(a,b)`.\nThis seems to work for all examples.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    m, a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # N is the upper bound for positions to consider in Dijkstra.\n    # For positions p > N, min_val_needed[p] = p.\n    # N = a + b is a safe upper bound, as any point p > a+b can be reached by a sequence\n    # of jumps that effectively means p = p_0 + k*a, where p_0 is some point <= a+b.\n    # And the min_val_needed for p_0 will be <= p_0.\n    # So if p > a+b, min_val_needed[p] = p.\n    # A tighter bound like max(a,b) is also often used.
