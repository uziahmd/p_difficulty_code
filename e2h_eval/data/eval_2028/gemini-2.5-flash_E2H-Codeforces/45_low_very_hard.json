There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing the Winner's Games in a Tennis Knockout Tournament**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this tennis tournament problem, and it's all about maximizing the number of games the eventual winner gets to play. The catch is this rule: two players can only face off if the difference in the number of games *won* between them is at most one.\n\nI'm thinking, let's denote the winner's games won as `k`. I'm trying to figure out the maximum possible value of `k`.  The core of the problem seems to be efficiently building up the tournament structure to achieve this maximum.\n\nInitially, the winner has won 0 games, and obviously, they can play someone who has also won 0 games. After the first game, the winner has won 1 game. Now, the opponent in their next match must have also won a number of games that's within one of the winner's games won.\n\nI'm thinking about representing this using a function `f(k)` which would signify the minimum number of players required to create a scenario where someone could have played and won `k` games. The logic here is that for any player who has played `k` games, they need to face an opponent who has a games-won value `j` which satisfies `abs(k-j) <= 1`. The opponent could have won `k-1`, `k`, or `k+1` games.\n\nWhat I'm trying to optimize, I realize, is not just the minimum number of players, but rather the *maximum* number of games the winner could possibly have won. So, in the start, the winner has won 0 games. In round 1, the winner faces someone who has also won 0 games. That's a valid first match. The winner now has 1 game won. It's a binary tree structure. I have to think about this in the terms of the structure to optimize it. Let's see how I can use this concept to maximize the winner's game count.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tournament can play, given `n` players and a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\n\nLet `k` be the number of games a player has already won. If player A has won `k_A` games and player B has won `k_B` games, they can play if `abs(k_A - k_B) <= 1`.\n\nLet's denote `F(x)` as the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played `x` games, assuming the winner follows a path that maximizes their game count under the given rule.\n\nConsider the winner's `x`-th game. They have already won `x-1` games. They need an opponent who has won `j` games, such that `abs((x-1) - j) <= 1`. This means `j` can be `x-2`, `x-1`, or `x`.\nSince the tournament is knockout, a player who has won `j` games must have defeated `j` opponents. To maximize the winner's games, we should try to make the winner play against opponents who have also played many games, but without violating the rule.\n\nIf the winner (who has won `x-1` games) plays against an opponent who has won `j` games:\n1. If `j = x-1`: Both players have won `x-1` games. This is the standard way a tournament progresses (e.g., two semi-finalists who both won 2 games play in the final).\n2. If `j = x-2`: The opponent has won `x-2` games. This is allowed.\n3. If `j = x`: The opponent has won `x` games. This is not possible, as the winner would then have won fewer games than their opponent in the final match. The winner of the tournament is the one who wins all their games. If they play `x` games, they win `x` games. So, their opponent in the `x`-th game must have won fewer than `x` games.\n\nSo, for the winner's `x`-th game, they (having won `x-1` games) can play against an opponent who has won `x-1` games or `x-2` games. To maximize the winner's games for a given `n`, we want to be as \"efficient\" as possible with players. This means we want to use the minimum number of players for a winner to play `x` games.\n\nLet's define `F(k)` as the minimum number of players required to produce a player who has won `k` games.\n- `F(0)`: A player who has won 0 games is just 1 player. So, `F(0) = 1`.\n- `F(1)`: To win 1 game, a player (0 games) must play against another player (0 games). This requires 2 players. So, `F(1) = 2`.\n- `F(k)`: To win `k` games, a player (having won `k-1` games) must play against an opponent.\n    - If the opponent has won `k-1` games: The winner (who won `k-1` games) and the opponent (who won `k-1` games) each needed `F(k-1)` players to reach this state. So, this path requires `F(k-1) + F(k-1) = 2 * F(k-1)` players.\n    - If the opponent has won `k-2` games: The winner (who won `k-1` games) needed `F(k-1)` players. The opponent (who won `k-2` games) needed `F(k-2)` players. So, this path requires `F(k-1) + F(k-2)` players.\n    - The rule `abs(k_A - k_B) <= 1` allows the winner (with `k-1` games) to play against an opponent with `k-2` games. This is a valid strategy.\n    \nTo minimize the total number of players `F(k)` for the winner to play `k` games, we should choose the option that requires fewer players:\n`F(k) = min(2 * F(k-1), F(k-1) + F(k-2))`\nSince `F(k-2)` is generally smaller than `F(k-1)` (as it represents fewer games won), `F(k-1) + F(k-2)` will be smaller than `2 * F(k-1)`.\nTherefore, the recurrence relation for the minimum number of players `F(k)` for a winner to play `k` games is:\n`F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)` for `k >= 2`.\n\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence!\nLet's re-index it to match the standard Fibonacci sequence:\n`fib(0) = 1` (a player who has won 0 games needs 1 player)\n`fib(1) = 2` (a player who has won 1 game needs 2 players: themselves and one opponent)\n`fib(k) = fib(k-1) + fib(k-2)` for `k >= 2`.\n\nLet's list the first few values:\n`fib(0) = 1` (for 0 games played by winner)\n`fib(1) = 2` (for 1 game played by winner)\n`fib(2) = fib(1) + fib(0) = 2 + 1 = 3` (for 2 games played by winner)\n`fib(3) = fib(2) + fib(1) = 3 + 2 = 5` (for 3 games played by winner)\n`fib(4) = fib(3) + fib(2) = 5 + 3 = 8` (for 4 games played by winner)\nAnd so on.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum number of games `x` the winner can play, given `n` players. This means we need to find the largest `x` such that `F(x) <= n`.\n\nSince `n` can be up to `10^18`, we need to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently. We can generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively until `fib(k)` exceeds `n`. The largest `k` for which `fib(k) <= n` will be our answer.\n\nExample Walkthrough:\n- `n = 2`:\n  - `fib(0) = 1 <= 2`\n  - `fib(1) = 2 <= 2`\n  - `fib(2) = 3 > 2`\n  Max games = 1.\n- `n = 3`:\n  - `fib(0) = 1 <= 3`\n  - `fib(1) = 2 <= 3`\n  - `fib(2) = 3 <= 3`\n  - `fib(3) = 5 > 3`\n  Max games = 2.\n- `n = 4`:\n  - `fib(0) = 1 <= 4`\n  - `fib(1) = 2 <= 4`\n  - `fib(2) = 3 <= 4`\n  - `fib(3) = 5 > 4`\n  Max games = 2.\n  (Note: In the example, for n=4, the explanation says \"player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\" This matches our `fib(2) = 3` construction: player 1 (winner) beats player 2. Player 3 beats player 4. Now player 1 has 1 game, player 3 has 1 game. They play. Winner (player 1) has 2 games. This uses 4 players. Oh, the `F(k)` definition is minimum players needed. So, if `F(2)=3`, and `n=4`, we can still achieve 2 games. Our `F(k)` is the minimum, so if `n` is greater than or equal to `F(k)`, then `k` games are possible. So the logic holds.)\n- `n = 10`:\n  - `fib(0) = 1 <= 10`\n  - `fib(1) = 2 <= 10`\n  - `fib(2) = 3 <= 10`\n  - `fib(3) = 5 <= 10`\n  - `fib(4) = 8 <= 10`\n  - `fib(5) = 13 > 10`\n  Max games = 4.\n\nThe algorithm is to compute Fibonacci numbers `f_k` starting with `f_0=1, f_1=2` and `f_k = f_{k-1} + f_{k-2}`, and count `k` until `f_k > n`. The answer is `k-1`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    # F(k) is the minimum number of players required for the winner to play k games.\n    # F(0) = 1 (1 player who has won 0 games)\n    # F(1) = 2 (1 player who has won 1 game, needs 1 opponent, total 2 players)\n    # F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2) for k >= 2\n    # This is a Fibonacci sequence, but shifted and with different initial values.\n    # Let's use a = F(k-2) and b = F(k-1).\n    # We want to find the largest k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n    a = 1  # Represents F(k-2) or fib_val_prev_prev\n    b = 2  # Represents F(k-1) or fib_val_prev\n    games_played = 1 # Corresponds to the current 'b' value (F(1) = 2 players, 1 game)\n\n    # We already handled n=2 case, which gives 1 game.\n    # So we start iteration for 2 games or more.\n    # Current 'b' (2) corresponds to 1 game.\n    # Next iteration will compute F(2) and check for 2 games.\n\n    while True:\n        next_fib = a + b\n        \n        if next_fib > n:\n            print(games_played)\n            return\n        \n        a = b\n        b = next_fib\n        games_played += 1\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
