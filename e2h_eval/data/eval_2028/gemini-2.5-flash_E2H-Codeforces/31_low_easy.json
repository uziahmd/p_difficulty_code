            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Vanya and Cards\n\nVanya loves playing. He even has a special set of cards to play with. Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to \"Vanya and Cards\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Vanya and Cards\" problem.  The goal is pretty straightforward: figure out the minimum number of new cards Vanya needs to reach a sum of zero.  I've got a list of cards he already has, along with the range of possible card values.\n\nFirst, I need to get a handle on the current situation. I'll calculate the `current_sum` of the cards Vanya already possesses. That's the baseline.  The target is a sum of zero, obviously.\n\nNow, the crucial part: I have to determine how much the `current_sum` deviates from zero. The required change, let's call it `required_sum_change`, is simply the negative of the `current_sum`.\n\nTo minimize the number of new cards, I'll leverage the largest possible absolute values within the allowed range (`-x` to `x`). If the `current_sum` is positive, I'll use `-x` cards. If it's negative, I'll use `x` cards. If it's zero, I need no new cards, easy peasy.\n\nThe final step is the calculation.  I know I need to cover `abs(required_sum_change)` with cards of either `x` or `-x`.  Integer division with ceiling is the key here.  I can express this as `(abs(current_sum) + x - 1) // x`.  This formula gives me the minimum number of cards needed to reach zero. I believe I've got it, time to write some code.\n",
