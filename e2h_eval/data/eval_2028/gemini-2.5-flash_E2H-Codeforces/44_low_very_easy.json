He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for a Competitive Programming Challenge**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem staring me in the face, and I need to come up with a Python script to solve it.  It seems straightforward enough, but the devil's in the details. I have inputs:  `n` problems total, `k` days to solve them, and a list `a` representing the difficulty of each problem.  The output needs to be the maximum total profit I can achieve and the specific distribution of problems per day (the `t_j` values).\n\nLet's break this down systematically. The constraints are important: I must use exactly `k` days, solve all `n` problems, and solve problems in order without skipping.  A day's profit is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved *that* day.  The objective, of course, is to maximize the sum of these daily profits.\n\nThe key insight, I think, lies in recognizing that to maximize the total profit, I want each day's maximum difficulty to be as high as possible.  Specifically, if I can, I'd like to make the *k* largest difficulties in the entire list the maximum for each of the *k* days.  That would give me the absolute theoretical maximum profit, which is simply the sum of those `k` largest difficulties.\n\nNow, the challenge is figuring out if this \"perfect\" scenario is always achievable. I need to find the `k` largest values in `a`. Let's say these values are `x_1, x_2, ... x_k`, and their original indices in `a` are `idx_1, idx_2, ... idx_k`.  The tricky part is that I need to partition the `n` problems into `k` contiguous segments so that *each* of the `k` largest values becomes the maximum for *one* of the days.\n\nIt feels like a greedy approach might be the way to go here.  I can start by identifying the `k` largest difficulties and their positions in `a`. Then, I need a strategy to divide the problems into segments that ensure each of these \"maximum\" difficulties is included and is indeed the maximum in its respective segment. I'll need to figure out how to arrange the partitioning so that I maximize the overall profit. I'll have to consider edge cases and ties to ensure robustness in the script.  Essentially, I need a good greedy strategy that gives me the ideal partitioning and therefore the maximum profit.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to partition `n` problems, given by their difficulties `a_1, ..., a_n`, into `k` contiguous segments (days). Each day must solve at least one problem. The profit for a day is the maximum difficulty among problems solved on that day. The goal is to maximize the total profit (sum of daily profits) and output this maximum profit, along with the number of problems solved each day.\n\nLet's consider the `k` largest difficulties in the entire list `a`. Let these be `M_1, M_2, ..., M_k`. The sum `S = M_1 + M_2 + ... + M_k` is the maximum possible total profit we can achieve. This is because each day's profit is the maximum difficulty encountered on that day. If we sum these `k` maximums, the total sum will be at most `S`, as each daily maximum must be one of the `a_i` values, and we can pick at most `k` distinct `a_i` values to be the daily maximums. If we can make each of `M_1, ..., M_k` the maximum for a *different* day, then we achieve this sum `S`.\n\nThis strategy is always possible. Here's how:\n1.  **Identify the `k` largest difficulties and their original indices:**\n    Create pairs `(difficulty, index)` for all problems. Sort these pairs in descending order based on difficulty. Take the top `k` pairs. These `k` difficulties will be our daily maximums.\n    For example, if `a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]` and `k = 3`:\n    Pairs: `(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)`\n    Sorted by difficulty (descending): `(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)`\n    Top `k=3` pairs: `(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)`.\n    The maximum total profit will be `9 + 6 + 5 = 20`.\n\n2.  **Determine the split points:**\n    Collect the original indices of these `k` chosen problems. Sort these indices in ascending order. These sorted indices will be our \"split points\".\n    From the example: indices are `6, 3, 0`. Sorted: `0, 3, 6`.\n    These indices `0, 3, 6` represent the *first* problem of each day that *contains* one of our chosen maximums.\n    *   The first day will cover problems from index 0 up to (but not including) the problem at index 3.\n    *   The second day will cover problems from index 3 up to (but not including) the problem at index 6.\n    *   The third day will cover problems from index 6 up to the end (index `n-1`).\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of problems for each day:**\n    Let the sorted indices be `idx_1, idx_2, ..., idx_k`.\n    *   The first day solves problems from index `0` to `idx_2 - 1`. The number of problems is `idx_2 - idx_1`. (Here, `idx_1` is effectively `0` for the first segment).\n    *   For `j` from `1` to `k-1`, the `j`-th day solves problems from index `idx_j` to `idx_{j+1} - 1`. The number of problems is `idx_{j+1} - idx_j`.\n    *   The `k`-th day solves problems from index `idx_k` to `n-1`. The number of problems is `n - idx_k`.\n\n    Using the example indices `0, 3, 6`:\n    *   Day 1: problems from index `0` to `3-1=2`. Number of problems: `3 - 0 = 3`. (`[5, 4, 2]`)\n    *   Day 2: problems from index `3` to `6-1=5`. Number of problems: `6 - 3 = 3`. (`[6, 5, 1]`)\n    *   Day 3: problems from index `6` to `8-1=7`. Number of problems: `8 - 6 = 2`. (`[9, 2]`)\n\n    Wait, the example output for `[5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]` is `3 2 3`. My split is `3 3 2`. The example chose `[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]`. This means the chosen maximums were `5` (index 0), `6` (index 3), `9` (index 6). The split points are after index 2 and after index 4.\n    The issue with my previous calculation `idx_j` to `idx_{j+1}-1` is that it assumes `idx_j` is the *start* of the segment. It's easier to think of `idx_j` as the *position of the chosen maximum*. The splits will occur *after* `idx_j` for `j < k`.\n\n    Let's refine step 2 and 3:\n    2.  **Identify the `k` largest difficulties and their original indices:**\n        `a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`, `k = 3`.\n        Pairs `(val, idx)`: `(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)`\n        Sorted by value (descending): `(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), ...`\n        Top `k=3` are `(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)`.\n        Sum of values: `9+6+5 = 20`.\n        Indices of these problems: `0, 3, 6`. Sort them: `[0, 3, 6]`.\n\n    3.  **Determine the segment lengths:**\n        These sorted indices `[0, 3, 6]` are where our daily maximums are located.\n        We need `k-1` split points. These split points must be *after* `idx_j` and *before* `idx_{j+1}` for `j=1, ..., k-1`. To ensure each chosen maximum is in its own segment and is the maximum for that segment, we can simply make a split *immediately after* each of the first `k-1` chosen maximums.\n        So, the split points are `idx_1, idx_2, ..., idx_{k-1}`.\n        The first day ends at `idx_1`. The second day ends at `idx_2`, ..., the `(k-1)`-th day ends at `idx_{k-1}`. The `k`-th day takes the rest.\n\n        Let `split_indices` be the sorted list of `k` indices `[0, 3, 6]`.\n        The actual indices where problems are solved are `0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n        The first day takes problems from `0` up to `split_indices[0]`.\n        The second day takes problems from `split_indices[0]+1` up to `split_indices[1]`.\n        ...\n        The `k`-th day takes problems from `split_indices[k-2]+1` up to `n-1`.\n\n        This approach is also problematic because `split_indices[0]` is not necessarily the end of the first day. It's the *position of a maximum*.\n\n        Let's reconsider the example output: `[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]`.\n        The maximums are `5` (at index 0), `6` (at index 3), `9` (at index 6).\n        The splits occur *after* index 2 and *after* index 4.\n        The indices of the maximums are `0, 3, 6`.\n        The indices where the *splits occur* are `2, 4`.\n        Notice that `2` is `split_indices[0] + 2` and `4` is `split_indices[1] + 1`. This isn't a simple pattern.\n\n        The key is that we must choose `k-1` positions to split the `n` problems. These `k-1` positions will be `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1}`, where `0 < p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{k-1} < n`.\n        Day 1: problems `a[0]` to `a[p_1-1]`\n        Day 2: problems `a[p_1]` to `a[p_2-1]`\n        ...\n        Day k: problems `a[p_{k-1}]` to `a[n-1]`\n\n        The profit for day `j` is `max(a[p_{j-1}] ... a[p_j-1])` (with `p_0=0, p_k=n`).\n        We want to ensure that each of our `k` chosen maximum values `M_j` falls into *exactly one* of these segments, and is the maximum for that segment.\n        The simplest way to do this is to pick the `k-1` split points to be *just after* `k-1` of the `k` chosen maximum values.\n\n        Let `max_indices` be the sorted list of indices of the `k` largest problems.\n        `max_indices = [0, 3, 6]` for the example.\n        We need `k-1` actual split points. We can pick the first `k-1` indices from `max_indices` and make the splits *after* these problems.\n        So, split after `max_indices[0]`, then after `max_indices[1]`, ..., up to `max_indices[k-2]`.\n        The first split is after problem `a[0]`. The second split is after `a[3]`.\n        Day 1: `a[0]` (length 1) - max is `a[0]=5`\n        Day 2: `a[1], a[2], a[3]` (length 3) - max is `a[3]=6`\n        Day 3: `a[4], a[5], a[6], a[7]` (length 4) - max is `a[6]=9`\n        This gives lengths `[1, 3, 4]`. The total profit is `5+6+9 = 20`. This is a valid distribution.\n\n        The example output `3 2 3` comes from splits after index 2 and after index 4.\n        This means the first day takes `a[0], a[1], a[2]`. Max is `a[0]=5`.\n        The second day takes `a[3], a[4]`. Max is `a[3]=6`.\n        The third day takes `a[5], a[6], a[7]`. Max is `a[6]=9`.\n        This also gives `5+6+9 = 20`.\n\n        Both `[1,3,4]` and `[3,2,3]` are valid answers. The problem states \"If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\"\n        So, the strategy of splitting *after* the first `k-1` problems that correspond to the `k` largest difficulties (when sorted by their original index) is simple and correct.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1.  Read `n`, `k`.\n2.  Read list `a`.\n3.  Create a list of tuples `(a[i], i)` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.\n4.  Sort this list of tuples in descending order based on `a[i]`.\n5.  Take the first `k` elements from the sorted list. These are the `k` largest difficulties and their original indices.\n6.  Calculate the `total_profit` by summing the difficulties of these `k` elements.\n7.  Extract the original indices of these `k` elements. Let's call this list `chosen_indices`.\n8.  Sort `chosen_indices` in ascending order.\n9.  To find the lengths `t_j`:\n    *   Initialize `current_start_index = 0`.\n    *   Initialize `t = []` (list to store lengths).\n    *   For `j` from `0` to `k-2`:\n        *   The `(j+1)`-th day will end at `chosen_indices[j]`.\n        *   The length of this day's segment is `chosen_indices[j] - current_start_index + 1`.\n        *   Add this length to `t`.\n        *   Update `current_start_index = chosen_indices[j] + 1`.\n    *   The `k`-th day takes the remaining problems: `n - current_start_index`.\n    *   Add this length to `t`.\n10. Print `total_profit`.\n11. Print the elements of `t` separated by spaces.\n\nLet's re-trace the example `a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`, `n=8, k=3` with this refined algorithm:\n1.  `n=8, k=3`.\n2.  `a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`.\n3.  Tuples: `[(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`.\n4.  Sorted by difficulty (desc): `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)]`.\n5.  Top `k=3` elements: `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)]`.\n6.  `total_profit = 9 + 6 + 5 = 20`.\n7.  `chosen_indices = [6, 3, 0]`.\n8.  Sort `chosen_indices`: `[0, 3, 6]`.\n9.  Calculate `t`:\n    *   `current_start_index = 0`, `t = []`.\n    *   `j=0` (first day):\n        *   `chosen_indices[0] = 0`.\n        *   Length: `0 - 0 + 1 = 1`. Add `1` to `t`. `t = [1]`.\n        *   `current_start_index = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n    *   `j=1` (second day, `k-2 = 1`):\n        *   `chosen_indices[1] = 3`.\n        *   Length: `3 - 1 + 1 = 3`. Add `3` to `t`. `t = [1, 3]`.\n        *   `current_start_index = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n    *   Loop ends (since `j` goes up to `k-2=1`).\n    *   `k`-th day (third day):\n        *   Length: `n - current_start_index = 8 - 4 = 4`. Add `4` to `t`. `t = [1, 3, 4]`.\n10. Print `20`.\n11. Print `1 3 4`.\n\nThis matches one of the valid outputs.\n\nConsider edge cases:\n*   `k=1`:\n    `chosen_indices` will have 1 element. The loop for `j` from `0` to `k-2` (i.e., `0` to `-1`) won't run.\n    `current_start_index = 0`.\n    The `k`-th day (first day) length will be `n - 0 = n`.\n    `t = [n]`. This is correct. Total profit is `max(a)`.\n*   `k=n`:\n    Each day solves 1 problem. `chosen_indices` will contain all indices `0, ..., n-1`.\n    `chosen_indices` will be `[0, 1, ..., n-1]`.\n    `j=0`: length `0-0+1=1`. `t=[1]`. `current_start_index=1`.\n    `j=1`: length `1-1+1=1`. `t=[1,1]`. `current_start_index=2`.\n    ...\n    `j=n-2`: length `(n-2)-(n-2)+1=1`. `t=[1,...,1]` (`n-1` times). `current_start_index=n-1`.\n    `k`-th day (i.e. `n`-th day): length `n - (n-1) = 1`. `t=[1,...,1]` (`n` times).\n    This is correct. Total profit is sum of `a_i` for the `n` largest elements. Since `k=n`, all `a_i` are included, so it's `sum(a)`.\n\nThe constraints `n <= 2000` mean `O(N log N)` for sorting is perfectly fine.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Step 1: Create pairs of (difficulty, original_index)\n    problems_with_indices = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        problems_with_indices.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Step 2: Sort by difficulty in descending order\n    # If difficulties are equal, the order of indices doesn't matter for total profit,\n    # but sorting by index as a secondary key ensures deterministic behavior.\n    # We only care about the top k values.\n    problems_with_indices.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)\n\n    # Step 3: Select the k largest difficulties and calculate total profit\n    chosen_problems = problems_with_indices[:k]\n    total_profit = sum(p[0] for p in chosen_problems)\n\n    # Step 4: Get the original indices of these k chosen problems\n    chosen_indices = [p[1] for p in chosen_problems]\n\n    # Step 5: Sort these indices in ascending order to determine split points\n    chosen_indices.sort()\n\n    # Step 6: Determine the number of problems for each day\n    # We will make k-1 splits.
