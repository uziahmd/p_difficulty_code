For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Classifying Musical Triads: A Python Implementation Plan**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to classify a set of three notes (a triad) as either \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange.\"  Let's break this down. First, I need to get a handle on the notes themselves and how their relationships are defined. There are twelve notes, and they form a cycle. The distance between consecutive notes is one semitone. The crucial thing here is that the *distance* is considered from the lower note to the higher note, wrapping around the cycle if necessary. This hints at using modular arithmetic.\n\nMy first thought is to map the notes to integers: C=0, C#=1, and so on up to B=10 and H=11.  Then, I can calculate the semitone distance between any two notes using the modulo operator (%).  For example, the distance between C (0) and E (4) is simply (4 - 0) % 12 = 4, and from E (4) to C (0) is (0 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 8. This ensures I get the correct directed distance.\n\nThe definitions of major and minor triads are key. A major triad has intervals of 4 and 3 semitones between its notes, while a minor triad has intervals of 3 and 4 semitones.  Importantly, I need to make sure I *order* the notes correctly before calculating these intervals. This suggests sorting the notes cyclically.  So if I'm given the notes A, B, and H, I first represent them as integers (9, 10, 11). Then I can sort them in ascending order. Then, I need to check the intervals between each pair, considering that these form a cycle. Using the modulo operator, I need to ensure that the distances are calculated correctly.\n\nGiven the ordering X, Y, Z, I need to check the following: the distance between X and Y must be either 3 or 4; and distance between Y and Z must be either 3 or 4. If these conditions are met in any of the cyclically sorted orderings of the input notes, I've got a major or minor triad. Any other combination suggests the triad is \"strange.\"\n\nTherefore, my Python script will need to do the following:\n\n1.  Map the input note names to their corresponding integer values.\n2.  Consider all possible permutations of the three notes, cyclically.\n3.  Calculate the semitone distance between each pair of notes in each permutation using modular arithmetic.\n4.  Check if the resulting intervals match the major or minor triad definitions.\n5.  Return the classification (\"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\").\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify a three-note chord (triad) as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\". We are given 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, which repeat cyclically. The distance between consecutive notes is 1 semitone.\n\nFirst, we need to map these notes to numerical values to easily calculate distances. We can assign C=0, C#=1, ..., H=11.\n\n```python\nnote_to_semitone = {\n    \"C\": 0, \"C#\": 1, \"D\": 2, \"D#\": 3, \"E\": 4, \"F\": 5,\n    \"F#\": 6, \"G\": 7, \"G#\": 8, \"A\": 9, \"B\": 10, \"H\": 11\n}\n```\n\nA major triad is defined by three notes X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones and from Y to Z is 3 semitones. The total distance from X to Z is 7 semitones.\nA minor triad is defined by three notes X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 3 semitones and from Y to Z is 4 semitones. The total distance from X to Z is 7 semitones.\n\nThe distances are measured along the musical scale, always moving \"upwards\" cyclically. For example, C to E is 4 semitones, and E to C is 8 semitones (E -> F -> F# -> G -> G# -> A -> B -> H -> C). This means if we have three notes `n1, n2, n3`, we should consider all possible cyclic orderings starting from each note, and calculate the intervals between them.\n\nLet the three input notes be `N1, N2, N3`. We convert them to their semitone values `s1, s2, s3`.\nSince the order of notes in the input doesn't matter for the definition of a chord, we need to consider all permutations of `(s1, s2, s3)` as potential `(X, Y, Z)` sequences.\nFor each permutation `(X_val, Y_val, Z_val)`:\n1. Calculate `interval_XY = (Y_val - X_val + 12) % 12`.\n2. Calculate `interval_YZ = (Z_val - Y_val + 12) % 12`.\n\nThen, we check if these intervals match the major or minor patterns.\n\n*   If `interval_XY == 4` and `interval_YZ == 3`, it's a major triad.\n*   If `interval_XY == 3` and `interval_YZ == 4`, it's a minor triad.\n\nThe problem guarantees that the answer will always be unambiguous, meaning a chord won't be both major and minor simultaneously. If after checking all 3! = 6 permutations none of the patterns match, the chord is \"strange\".\n\nLet's trace an example: `C E G`\n`C=0, E=4, G=7`\n\nPermutations of `(0, 4, 7)`:\n1.  `(X=0, Y=4, Z=7)`:\n    *   `interval_XY = (4 - 0 + 12) % 12 = 4`\n    *   `interval_YZ = (7 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 3`\n    *   Matches major triad (4, 3). Output \"major\".\n\nExample: `C# B F`\n`C#=1, B=10, F=5`\n\nPermutations of `(1, 10, 5)`:\n1.  `(X=1, Y=10, Z=5)`:\n    *   `interval_XY = (10 - 1 + 12) % 12 = 9`\n    *   `interval_YZ = (5 - 10 + 12) % 12 = 7`\n    *   Neither (4,3) nor (3,4)\n2.  `(X=1, Y=5, Z=10)`:\n    *   `interval_XY = (5 - 1 + 12) % 12 = 4`\n    *   `interval_YZ = (10 - 5 + 12) % 12 = 5`\n    *   Neither (4,3) nor (3,4)\n3.  `(X=5, Y=1, Z=10)`:\n    *   `interval_XY = (1 - 5 + 12) % 12 = 8`\n    *   `interval_YZ = (10 - 1 + 12) % 12 = 9`\n    *   Neither (4,3) nor (3,4)\n4.  `(X=5, Y=10, Z=1)`:\n    *   `interval_XY = (10 - 5 + 12) % 12 = 5`\n    *   `interval_YZ = (1 - 10 + 12) % 12 = 3`\n    *   Neither (4,3) nor (3,4)\n5.  `(X=10, Y=1, Z=5)`:\n    *   `interval_XY = (1 - 10 + 12) % 12 = 3`\n    *   `interval_YZ = (5 - 1 + 12) % 12 = 4`\n    *   Matches minor triad (3, 4). Output \"minor\".\n\nThe `itertools.permutations` function is useful for generating all permutations.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\n# Mapping from note names to semitone values (0-11)\nnote_to_semitone = {\n    \"C\": 0, \"C#\": 1, \"D\": 2, \"D#\": 3, \"E\": 4, \"F\": 5,\n    \"F#\": 6, \"G\": 7, \"G#\": 8, \"A\": 9, \"B\": 10, \"H\": 11\n}\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the three space-separated notes from standard input\n    notes_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()\n\n    # Convert note names to their semitone values\n    semitones = [note_to_semitone[note] for note in notes_str]\n\n    is_major = False\n    is_minor = False\n\n    # Iterate through all possible permutations of the three notes\n    # Each permutation (X, Y, Z) represents a potential ordering for interval checking\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(semitones):\n        X_val, Y_val, Z_val = perm\n\n        # Calculate the interval between X and Y\n        # Using (Y_val - X_val + 12) % 12 correctly handles wrapping around the 12-semitone cycle\n        interval_XY = (Y_val - X_val + 12) % 12\n\n        # Calculate the interval between Y and Z\n        interval_YZ = (Z_val - Y_val + 12) % 12\n\n        # Check for major triad pattern (4 semitones then 3 semitones)\n        if interval_XY == 4 and interval_YZ == 3:\n            is_major = True\n            break # Found a major pattern, no need to check further permutations\n\n        # Check for minor triad pattern (3 semitones then 4 semitones)\n        if interval_XY == 3 and interval_YZ == 4:\n            is_minor = True\n            break # Found a minor pattern, no need to check further permutations\n\n    # Print the result based on the flags\n    if is_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif is_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
