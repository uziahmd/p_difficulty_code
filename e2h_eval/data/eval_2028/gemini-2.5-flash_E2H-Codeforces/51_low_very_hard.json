Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the \"Amusing Joke\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Amusing Joke\" problem, and I need to whip up a Python script to tackle it. Let's see... the core of it is a pretty neat character counting puzzle.  I'm given three strings: the guest's name, the host's name, and a pile of letters.  The goal is to figure out if that pile of letters is just a jumbled combination of the guest's and host's names.\n\nBasically, I need to check two things:\n\n1.  **Character Counts Match:**  Every character in the pile must exist in the names, and their respective counts must be the same.  If I add up all the 'A's, 'B's, etc., from the guest and host names, it has to be exactly the same as the counts in the pile.\n2.  **Total Lengths Match (implicitly):** The length of the combined guest and host names should equal the length of the pile.  But, realistically, if the character counts match, the lengths *have* to match as well. It's a bit redundant, but good to keep in mind for conceptual clarity.\n\nI ran through the provided examples and it clarified things. For the first one, \"SANTACLAUS\" and \"DEDMOROZ\" can perfectly form \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\".  But the second example, \"PAPAINOEL\" and \"JOULUPUKKI\" can't, because the character counts don't line up.\n\nSo, the simplest and most efficient approach is to count character frequencies. I can either use `collections.Counter` or build my own dictionaries to track the counts.  That seems like the best route to compare the letter distributions. Sounds like a good plan.\n",
