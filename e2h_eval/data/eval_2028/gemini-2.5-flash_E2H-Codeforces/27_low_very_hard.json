On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them.

    "thought": "**My Strategy for the LNDS Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem where I need to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing a subsegment of a sequence. The sequence is limited to just 1s and 2s, and the sequence length `n` is up to 2000.  The naive approach of trying every possible subsegment `[l, r]`, reversing it, and then finding the LNDS would be way too slow. It would be O(N^4), which is out of the question. Even O(N^3) is pushing it. I need to find something closer to O(N^2) or maybe O(N^2 log N).\n\nSince the elements are only 1s and 2s, the LNDS structure is pretty simple: it's just some 1s followed by some 2s. The challenge lies in efficiently finding the best split, after the reversal.  I started by thinking about how to choose `i`, `j`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `z` from different segments, but that's quickly getting too convoluted.\n\nA cleaner perspective emerges: The LNDS is the maximum number of 1s before a split point followed by the maximum number of 2s after that split point. So, I can think of the problem in terms of a split point. Essentially, after reversing a subsegment, I'm looking for the optimal spot where I transition from picking 1s to picking 2s.  This feels much more manageable. Now, I have to figure out how to efficiently determine the maximum LNDS for each possible reversal. This approach will guide me towards the optimal solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum possible length of a non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing a single subsegment `[l, r]` of a given sequence `a`. The sequence `a` consists only of 1s and 2s. The length of the sequence `n` is up to 2000.\n\nA non-decreasing subsequence in a sequence of 1s and 2s will always consist of some number of 1s followed by some number of 2s. For example, `1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2`.\nThe length of such a subsequence is the total count of 1s and 2s chosen.\nTo maximize this length, we essentially need to find an optimal \"split point\" `k` in the modified sequence `a'`. All 1s in the LNDS must come from `a'_1, ..., a'_k` and all 2s must come from `a'_{k+1}, ..., a'_n`. The LNDS length for a given `k` would be `(count of 1s in a'_1, ..., a'_k) + (count of 2s in a'_{k+1}, ..., a'_n)`. The maximum LNDS length for a fixed `a'` is the maximum of this sum over all possible `k` (from 0 to `n`).\n\nLet's denote the original sequence as `a`.\nWhen we reverse the subsegment `[l, r]`, the sequence `a'` becomes:\n`a_1, ..., a_{l-1}, a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l, a_{r+1}, ..., a_n`.\n\nSince `n` is up to 2000, an `O(N^2)` solution is acceptable. We can iterate over all possible pairs `(l, r)` for the subsegment reversal. There are `O(N^2)` such pairs. For each `(l, r)`, we need to efficiently calculate the LNDS length.\n\nLet's precompute prefix sums for 1s and 2s in the original array `a`.\n`prefix_ones[i]` = count of 1s in `a_1, ..., a_i`.\n`prefix_twos[i]` = count of 2s in `a_1, ..., a_i`.\n`suffix_ones[i]` = count of 1s in `a_i, ..., a_n`.\n`suffix_twos[i]` = count of 2s in `a_i, ..., a_n`.\nThese can be computed in `O(N)` time.\n\nNow, consider a fixed `l` and `r`. We want to find the LNDS in `a'`.\nThe LNDS will pick some 1s from `a_1, ..., a_{l-1}`, some 1s from the reversed segment `a_r, ..., a_l`, and some 1s from `a_{r+1}, ..., a_n`. Similarly for 2s.\nThe crucial observation is that the LNDS of `1`s and `2`s can be found by splitting the array into three parts:\n1. Elements before `l`: `a_1, ..., a_{l-1}`.\n2. Elements within `[l, r]` (reversed): `a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l`.\n3. Elements after `r`: `a_{r+1}, ..., a_n`.\n\nLet's fix a split point `k` for the LNDS.\nThe `k` can be thought of as an index in the original sequence `a`.\nIf the split point `k` is before `l` (i.e., `k < l`):\n  Number of 1s: `prefix_ones[k]`\n  Number of 2s: `(count of 2s in a_l, ..., a_r, reversed) + (count of 2s in a_{r+1}, ..., a_n)`\n  The count of 2s in `a_l, ..., a_r` is `prefix_twos[r] - prefix_twos[l-1]`.\n  So, total 2s = `(prefix_twos[r] - prefix_twos[l-1]) + suffix_twos[r+1]`.\n  This is `prefix_ones[k] + (prefix_twos[r] - prefix_twos[l-1]) + suffix_twos[r+1]`.\n\nIf the split point `k` is within `[l, r]` (i.e., `l <= k <= r`):\n  This is more complex because the segment `[l, r]` is reversed.\n  The number of 1s comes from `a_1, ..., a_{l-1}` and then from `a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_k`.\n  The number of 2s comes from `a_{k-1}, ..., a_l` (if `k` is the split point, then elements `a_k, ..., a_l` are part of the \"suffix\" of the LNDS) and then from `a_{r+1}, ..., a_n`.\n  This approach of fixing `k` and then `l, r` is hard because the meaning of `k` changes relative to `l` and `r`.\n\nA better approach: Iterate `l` from `1` to `n`, and `r` from `l` to `n`.\nFor each `(l, r)` pair:\nThe modified sequence `a'` has three parts:\n1. `P1`: `a_1, ..., a_{l-1}`\n2. `P2_rev`: `a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l`\n3. `P3`: `a_{r+1}, ..., a_n`\n\nLet `ones_P1 = prefix_ones[l-1]`\nLet `twos_P1 = prefix_twos[l-1]`\nLet `ones_P3 = suffix_ones[r+1]`\nLet `twos_P3 = suffix_twos[r+1]`\n\nThe counts of 1s and 2s in the *original* segment `a_l, ..., a_r` are:\n`ones_mid = prefix_ones[r] - prefix_ones[l-1]`\n`twos_mid = prefix_twos[r] - prefix_twos[l-1]`\n\nThe LNDS will consist of some 1s followed by some 2s.\nLet's consider all possible ways an LNDS could be formed:\n1. All 1s from `P1`, all 2s from `P2_rev` and `P3`.\n   Length = `ones_P1 + twos_mid + twos_P3`.\n2. All 1s from `P1` and `P2_rev`, all 2s from `P3`.\n   Length = `ones_P1 + ones_mid + twos_P3`.\n3. Some 1s from `P1`, some 1s from `P2_rev`, some 2s from `P2_rev`, some 2s from `P3`.\n   This is the general case. We need to find the optimal split point `j` *within* the reversed segment `P2_rev`.\n   Suppose we split `P2_rev` into `a_r, ..., a_j` (for 1s) and `a_{j-1}, ..., a_l` (for 2s).\n   The number of 1s from `P2_rev` would be `(count of 1s in a_r, ..., a_j)`.\n   The number of 2s from `P2_rev` would be `(count of 2s in a_{j-1}, ..., a_l)`.\n\nLet `ones_before[k]` be the count of 1s in `a_1, ..., a_k`.\nLet `twos_after[k]` be the count of 2s in `a_k, ..., a_n`.\nThe overall LNDS length for a sequence `b` is `max_k (ones_before_k_in_b + twos_after_k_in_b)`.\n\nFor a fixed `l` and `r`, we can iterate through all possible split points `k` in the *modified* sequence `a'`.\n`k` can range from `0` to `n`.\nThe number of 1s up to index `k` in `a'` is `count_ones_prefix(k, a', l, r)`.\nThe number of 2s from index `k+1` to `n` in `a'` is `count_twos_suffix(k+1, a', l, r)`.\nThe maximum sum `count_ones_prefix(k, a', l, r) + count_twos_suffix(k+1, a', l, r)` over all `k` will be the LNDS length for `a'`.\n\nCalculating `count_ones_prefix(k, a', l, r)` and `count_twos_suffix(k, a', l, r)` for each `k` in `O(1)` given `l, r`:\nThis can be done using precomputed prefix/suffix sums.\nLet `cnt1[i]` be the number of 1s up to index `i` in the *original* array.\nLet `cnt2[i]` be the number of 2s up to index `i` in the *original* array.\n(Using 1-based indexing for `a` and `cnt1`/`cnt2`).\n\nFor a fixed `l, r`:\n`max_lnds = 0`\nIterate `k` from `0` to `n`:\n  `current_ones = 0`\n  `current_twos = 0`\n\n  // Calculate 1s in `a'_1, ..., a'_k`\n  If `k < l`:\n    `current_ones = cnt1[k]`\n  Else if `k <= r`: // `k` is in the reversed segment\n    `current_ones = cnt1[l-1] + (cnt1[r] - cnt1[k-1])`\n  Else: // `k > r`\n    `current_ones = cnt1[l-1] + (cnt1[r] - cnt1[l-1]) + (cnt1[k] - cnt1[r])`\n    `current_ones = cnt1[k]` // This simplifies to `cnt1[k]` because the total number of 1s up to `k` is the same regardless of reversal, as long as `k` is outside the reversed segment.\n\n  // Calculate 2s in `a'_{k+1}, ..., a'_n`\n  If `k+1 > r`:\n    `current_twos = cnt2[n] - cnt2[k]`\n  Else if `k+1 >= l`: // `k+1` is in the reversed segment\n    `current_twos = (cnt2[l-1] - cnt2[0]) + (cnt2[k] - cnt2[l-1]) + (cnt2[n] - cnt2[r])` this is `cnt2[l-1] + (cnt2[k] - cnt2[l-1]) + (cnt2[n] - cnt2[r])`\n    `current_twos = (cnt2[k] - cnt2[l-1]) + (cnt2[n] - cnt2[r])`\n    `current_twos = (cnt2[k] - cnt2[l-1])` is count of 2s in `a_l, ..., a_k`.\n    We need 2s from `a_l, ..., a_{k}` (if `k+1` is the split point, then `a_{k}` is the last 1, so `a_{k+1}` is the first 2).\n    The segment `a_r, ..., a_l` is reversed. If split point is `k`, then `a_r, ..., a_k` are 1s, and `a_{k-1}, ..., a_l` are 2s.\n    So, 2s from `a_{k-1}, ..., a_l` means `count of 2s in original a_l, ..., a_{k-1}`.\n    `current_twos = (cnt2[k-1] - cnt2[l-1]) + (cnt2[n] - cnt2[r])`\n  Else: // `k+1 < l`\n    `current_twos = (cnt2[n] - cnt2[r]) + (cnt2[r] - cnt2[l-1]) + (cnt2[l-1] - cnt2[k])`\n    `current_twos = cnt2[n] - cnt2[k]` // This simplifies to `cnt2[n] - cnt2[k]`\n\nThis logic for `current_ones` and `current_twos` looks complicated and error-prone.\nA simpler way to calculate the LNDS for a fixed `l, r` is to iterate through `p` from `0` to `n`. `p` is the *original* index that corresponds to the split point.\nThe LNDS will pick 1s from `a_1, ..., a_p` (in some order) and 2s from `a_{p+1}, ..., a_n` (in some order).\nThe total count of 1s in `a_1, ..., a_p` after reversal is:\n`cnt1[l-1]` (from before `l`)\n`+ (cnt1[r] - cnt1[l-1])` (from `l` to `r` in original)\n`+ (cnt1[p] - cnt1[r])` (from after `r` up to `p`)\nThis is `cnt1[p]`. This is the total count of 1s if `p` is *not* in `[l, r]`.\n\nLet's simplify.\nThe total number of 1s in `a_1, ..., a_p` (in the original sequence) is `cnt1[p]`.\nThe total number of 2s in `a_{p+1}, ..., a_n` (in the original sequence) is `cnt2[n] - cnt2[p]`.\n\nWhen we reverse `a_l, ..., a_r`:\nThe count of 1s in `a'_1, ..., a'_k` is:\n- `cnt1[k]` if `k < l`\n- `cnt1[l-1] + (cnt1[r] - cnt1[k-1])` if `l <= k <= r` (1s from `a_1...a_{l-1}` + 1s from `a_r...a_k`)\n- `cnt1[k]` if `k > r` (total 1s up to `k` is unchanged)\n\nThe count of 2s in `a'_{k+1}, ..., a'_n` is:\n- `cnt2[n] - cnt2[k]` if `k+1 > r` (total 2s after `k` is unchanged)\n- `(cnt2[k] - cnt2[l-1]) + (cnt2[n] - cnt2[r])` if `l <= k+1 <= r` (2s from `a_l...a_k` + 2s from `a_{r+1}...a_n`)\n- `cnt2[n] - cnt2[k]` if `k+1 < l` (total 2s after `k` is unchanged)\n\nLet's test this logic.\n`n = 4`, `a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`\n`cnt1 = [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`\n`cnt2 = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]`\n\nExample: `l=2, r=3`. `a' = [1, 1, 2, 2]`\nIterate `k` from `0` to `n`:\n`k=0`: `current_ones = 0`. `k+1=1`. `1 < l=2`. `current_twos = cnt2[4] - cnt2[0] = 2`.

This matches the example.\n\nThis approach of iterating `l, r` and then `k` gives `O(N^3)`. `2000^3 = 8 * 10^9`, too slow.\nWe need `O(N^2)`.\n\nThe `k` iteration for LNDS calculation has to be faster.\nNotice that the total number of 1s in `a_1, ..., a_p` (original) is `cnt1[p]`.\nThe total number of 2s in `a_{p+1}, ..., a_n` (original) is `cnt2[n] - cnt2[p]`.\nThe LNDS in the *original* sequence is `max_p (cnt1[p] + cnt2[n] - cnt2[p])`.\n\nLet's fix `l` and iterate `r` from `l` to `n`.\nWhen we reverse `a_l, ..., a_r`, the elements `a_l, ..., a_r` are flipped.\nThe number of 1s in this segment is `cnt1[r] - cnt1[l-1]`.\nThe number of 2s in this segment is `cnt2[r] - cnt2[l-1]`.\n\nThe LNDS for `a'` can be formed by:\n1. Taking 1s from `a_1, ..., a_{l-1}` (count `cnt1[l-1]`), then 1s from `a_r, ..., a_j` (reversed), then 2s from `a_{j-1}, ..., a_l` (reversed), then 2s from `a_{r+1}, ..., a_n` (count `cnt2[n] - cnt2[r]`).\n   Here `j` is the split point within the reversed segment.\n   The count of 1s from `a_r, ..., a_j` is `cnt1[r] - cnt1[j-1]`.\n   The count of 2s from `a_{j-1}, ..., a_l` is `cnt2[j-1] - cnt2[l-1]`.\n   So for a fixed `l, r`, and a split point `j` in `[l, r]`:\n   LNDS length = `cnt1[l-1]`\n                 `+ (cnt1[r] - cnt1[j-1])`  // 1s from a_r...a_j\n                 `+ (cnt2[j-1] - cnt2[l-1])` // 2s from a_{j-1}...a_l\n                 `+ (cnt2[n] - cnt2[r])`     // 2s from a_{r+1}...a_n\n   This can be rewritten as:\n   `cnt1[l-1] + cnt1[r] - cnt1[j-1] + cnt2[j-1] - cnt2[l-1] + cnt2[n] - cnt2[r]`\n   `= (cnt1[l-1] - cnt2[l-1]) + (cnt1[r] - cnt2[r]) + (cnt2[n]) + (cnt2[j-1] - cnt1[j-1])`\n   Let `S_j = cnt2[j-1] - cnt1[j-1]`.

Or, since we're iterating `r`, we can maintain the maximum `S_j` for `j \\in [l, r]` in `O(1)` or `O(log N)` time.\n   Specifically, for a fixed `l`, as `r` increases, the range `[l, r]` expands. We just need to update `max_{j \\in [l, r]} (cnt2[j-1] - cnt1[j-1])`.

Count is `cnt2[n] - cnt2[k]`.\n   LNDS length = `cnt1[k] + (cnt2[n] - cnt2[k])`.\n   We need to maximize this over `k > r`.\n   This is `max_{k > r} (cnt1[k] + cnt2[n] - cnt2[k])`.\n   Let `max_suffix_val[i] = max_{k=i}^{n} (cnt1[k] + cnt2[n] - cnt2[k])`.\n   Then the length for this case is `max_suffix_val[r+1]`.\n\nSo for each `(l, r)` pair, we calculate three values and take their maximum:\n1. `L1 = cnt1[l-1] + (cnt2[r] - cnt2[l-1]) + (cnt2[n] - cnt2[r])`\n2. `L2 = max_suffix_val[r+1]`\n3. `L3 = (cnt1[l-1] - cnt2[l-1]) + (cnt1[r] - cnt2[r]) + cnt2[n] + max_{j=l}^{r} (cnt2[j-1] - cnt1[j-1])`\n\nThe overall maximum LNDS length will be the maximum of these three values over all `l, r`.\nThe initial LNDS (without any reversal) is `max_k (cnt1[k] + cnt2[n] - cnt2[k])`.

Initialize `cnt1` and `cnt2` arrays (0-indexed for convenience, `cnt1[i]` is count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`).

Initialize `max_suffix_val` array. `max_suffix_val[i]` stores `max_{k=i}^{n} (cnt1[k] + cnt2[n] - cnt2[k])`.\n   `max_suffix_val[n+1] = 0`.\n   `max_suffix_val[i] = max(cnt1[i] + cnt2[n] - cnt2[i], max_suffix_val[i+1])` for `i` from `n` down to `1`.\n   This takes `O(N)` time.\n3. Initialize `max_overall_lnds = 0`. Calculate LNDS for the original array and store it in `max_overall_lnds`. This is `max_suffix_val[1]`.\n4. Iterate `l` from `1` to `n`.\n   Initialize `current_max_Sj = -infinity` (or a very small number, to handle cases where `l=1` and `j-1=0`).\n   Iterate `r` from `l` to `n`.\n     a. Update `current_max_Sj`: `current_max_Sj = max(current_max_Sj, cnt2[r-1] - cnt1[r-1])`.\n        (Note: `cnt2[j-1]-cnt1[j-1]` refers to index `j-1`. For `j=l`, this is `l-1`. For `j=r`, this is `r-1`.)\n     b. Calculate `L1 = cnt1[l-1] + (cnt2[r] - cnt2[l-1]) + (cnt2[n] - cnt2[r])`.\n     c. Calculate `L2 = max_suffix_val[r+1]`.\n     d. Calculate `L3 = (cnt1[l-1] - cnt2[l-1]) + (cnt1[r] - cnt2[r]) + cnt2[n] + current_max_Sj`.\n     e. Update `max_overall_lnds = max(max_overall_lnds, L1, L2, L3)`.\n5. Print `max_overall_lnds`.\n\nComplexity:\nSteps 1-3: `O(N)`.\nStep 4: Nested loops `l` from `1` to `n`, `r` from `l` to `n`. This is `O(N^2)` pairs.\nInside the inner loop, all calculations are `O(1)`.\nTotal complexity: `O(N^2)`.\nSpace complexity: `O(N)` for `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `max_suffix_val`.\n\nLet's recheck the terms for `L3` carefully.\n`L3` is for the case where the split point `k_split` is *within* the reversed segment `[l, r]`.\nThe 1s come from `a_1, ..., a_{l-1}` (count `cnt1[l-1]`) and `a_r, ..., a_{k_split}` (count `cnt1[r] - cnt1[k_split-1]`).\nThe 2s come from `a_{k_split-1}, ..., a_l` (count `cnt2[k_split-1] - cnt2[l-1]`) and `a_{r+1}, ..., a_n` (count `cnt2[n] - cnt2[r]`).\nSumming these:\n`cnt1[l-1] + (cnt1[r] - cnt1[k_split-1]) + (cnt2[k_split-1] - cnt2[l-1]) + (cnt2[n] - cnt2[r])`\nRearranging:\n`cnt1[l-1] - cnt2[l-1] + cnt1[r] - cnt2[r] + cnt2[n] + (cnt2[k_split-1] - cnt1[k_split-1])`.\nThe term `(cnt2[k_split-1] - cnt1[k_split-1])` is what we need to maximize for `k_split` from `l` to `r`.\nThe index for `cnt1` and `cnt2` is `k_split-1`. So we need `max_{idx = l-1}^{r-1} (cnt2[idx] - cnt1[idx])`.\nWhen `r` increases, `current_max_Sj` needs to be updated with `cnt2[r-1] - cnt1[r-1]`.\nThis is correct.\n\nExample 2: `10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1`\n`n=10`\n`a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1]` (0-indexed)\n`cnt1 = [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5]` (1-indexed for problem logic)\n`cnt2 = [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5]`\n`cnt1[i]` = count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`\n`cnt2[i]` = count of 2s in `a[0...i-1]`\n\n`max_suffix_val` calculation:\n`max_suffix_val[11] = 0`\n`k=10`: `a[9]=1`. `cnt1[10]=5, cnt2[10]=5`. `cnt1[10] + cnt2[10] - cnt2[10] = 5`.\n`max_suffix_val[10] = max(cnt1[10]+(cnt2[10]-cnt2[10]), max_suffix_val[11]) = max(5,0) = 5`.\n`k=9`: `a[8]=2`. `cnt1[9]=4, cnt2[9]=5`. `cnt1[9] + (cnt2[10]-cnt2[9]) = 4 + (5-5) = 4`.\n`max_suffix_val[9] = max(4, max_suffix_val[10]) = max(4,5) = 5`.\n`k=8`: `a[7]=2`. `cnt1[8]=4, cnt2[8]=4`. `cnt1[8] + (cnt2[10]-cnt2[8]) = 4 + (5-4) = 5`.\n`max_suffix_val[8] = max(5, max_suffix_val[9]) = max(5,5) = 5`.\n`k=7`: `a[6]=1`. `cnt1[7]=4, cnt2[7]=3`. `cnt1[7] + (cnt2[10]-cnt2[7]) = 4 + (5-3) = 6`.\n`max_suffix_val[7] = max(6, max_suffix_val[8]) = max(6,5) = 6`.\n`k=6`: `a[5]=1`. `cnt1[6]=3, cnt2[6]=3`. `cnt1[6] + (cnt2[10]-cnt2[6]) = 3 + (5-3) = 5`.\n`max_suffix_val[6] = max(5, max_suffix_val[7]) = max(5,6) = 6`.\n`k=5`: `a[4]=2`. `cnt1[5]=2, cnt2[5]=3`. `cnt1[5] + (cnt2[10]-cnt2[5]) = 2 + (5-3) = 4`.\n`max_suffix_val[5] = max(4, max_suffix_val[6]) = max(4,6) = 6`.\n`k=4`: `a[3]=2`. `cnt1[4]=2, cnt2[4]=2`. `cnt1[4] + (cnt2[10]-cnt2[4]) = 2 + (5-2) = 5`.\n`max_suffix_val[4] = max(5, max_suffix_val[5]) = max(5,6) = 6`.\n`k=3`: `a[2]=2`. `cnt1[3]=2, cnt2[3]=1`. `cnt1[3] + (cnt2[10]-cnt2[3]) = 2 + (5-1) = 6`.\n`max_suffix_val[3] = max(6, max_suffix_val[4]) = max(6,6) = 6`.\n`k=2`: `a[1]=1`. `cnt1[2]=2, cnt2[2]=0`. `cnt1[2] + (cnt2[10]-cnt2[2]) = 2 + (5-0) = 7`.\n`max_suffix_val[2] = max(7, max_suffix_val[3]) = max(7,6) = 7`.\n`k=1`: `a[0]=1`. `cnt1[1]=1, cnt2[1]=0`. `cnt1[1] + (cnt2[10]-cnt2[1]) = 1 + (5-0) = 6`.\n`max_suffix_val[1] = max(6, max_suffix_val[2]) = max(6,7) = 7`.\n\nInitial `max_overall_lnds = max_suffix_val[1] = 7`.\n\nExample says `l=3, r=7` gives 9.
