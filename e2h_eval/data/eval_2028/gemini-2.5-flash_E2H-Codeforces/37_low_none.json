Construct an array b by permuting a such that for every non-empty subset of indices S = {x1, x2, ..., xk} (1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 0 < k < n) the sums of elements on that positions in a and b are different, i. e. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 22) — the size of the array.The second line contains n space-separated distinct integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — the elements of the array.\n\n## Output\nIf there is no such array b, print -1.Otherwise in the only line print n space-separated integers b1, b2, ..., bn.

Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Diving into the \"Gluttony\" Problem: A Pythonic Journey**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Gluttony\" problem. The core is to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` such that the sum of elements from any non-empty, non-full subset of indices in `a` is different from the sum of elements in the same indices of `b`. That `n <= 22` constraint screams for a bitmask or recursive approach. The problem's basically asking to rearrange the array so the partial sums are always distinct, which is more complex than it sounds.\n\nLet's dissect this condition. For any subset `S`, the sum of elements in `a` indexed by `S` should differ from the sum in `b` indexed by the same `S`, excluding empty and the whole set subsets. Since `b` is a permutation, the sum of all elements in `a` and `b` is the same, obviously. This means I need to carefully construct `b`.\n\nIf `n = 1`, it's trivial. The only subset that violates the condition doesn't exist. Any `b` equals to `a` works. Easy.\n\nNow, with `n = 2`. The subsets with `0 < |S| < n` would be a single element. I'm essentially permuting two elements. Given that the elements are distinct, swapping them will always satisfy the condition. `b` is just the reversed array of `a`.\n\nOkay, what about the real fun with `n = 3`? I have three elements. I need to make sure none of the sums of one or two elements in `b` match their counterparts in `a`. Let's assume `a = [a1, a2, a3]`. Possible `b` is some permutation of `a`. I need to start figuring out how to build the logic to systematically check and construct the valid permutation, or to recognize when there isn't one. The constraint of `0 <= a_i <= 10^9` is also important, it might cause overflow issues for large sums. Time to code!\n",
