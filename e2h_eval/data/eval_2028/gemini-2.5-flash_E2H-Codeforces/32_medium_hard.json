Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break down this \"Array Stabilization\" problem. My goal here is to come up with a Python script to efficiently solve it.**\n\nFirst, I need to fully understand the problem. The input is an array of integers, and we're looking to minimize the \"instability\" which is simply the range (max - min) after removing one element.  Constraints are reasonable: array size up to 10^5, and elements up to 10^5. A couple of examples were provided. In the examples, I noticed that to minimize instability, I want to make the new max and min as close as possible.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nThe real core of the problem lies in recognizing that removing an element other than the current maximum or minimum won't get us a better result. Removing an element in between will not do any good. To achieve the absolute minimum instability, the only scenarios to consider involve removing either the smallest or largest element. \n\nI've tested this idea carefully. I sorted the array and compared removing the smallest versus the largest element. After sorting, the potential instabilities are the difference between the largest and second smallest, and the difference between the second largest and the smallest. The minimum of these two values is the answer.\n\nI considered an edge case with an array of only two numbers, and this reasoning holds. The logic extends to the general case. The time complexity of this solution will be `O(N log N)` because of the sort. Space will be `O(N)` for the sorted array, but this is acceptable given the constraints. I could potentially optimize space by sorting in-place, making it `O(1)`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\nThe program should: 1. read the array and number of elements. 2. Sort the array. 3. Calculate the instabilities if the min element is removed and the max element is removed. 4. Output the minimum of the two.\n\n**In terms of implementation specifics:** Using fast I/O is a good idea for competitive programming. `sys.stdin.readline` and `sys.stdout.write`. Converting the strings to integers, then sorting is key.\n\nAll in all, the strategy of only considering removal of min or max is the breakthrough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    instability1 = a[n-1] - a[1]\n    instability2 = a[n-2] - a[0]\n    print(min(instability1, instability2))\nsolve()\n```\nThe program is now complete. It looks efficient.\n",
