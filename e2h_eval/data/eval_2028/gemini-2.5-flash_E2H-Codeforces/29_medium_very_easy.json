Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Python Script for \"Substitutes in Number\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this competitive programming problem. The goal is to build a Python script to solve the \"Substitutes in Number\" problem, efficiently handling large strings and modulo arithmetic. The challenge is that string `s` can grow exponentially due to repeated substitutions, so a direct string manipulation approach is out of the question.  We need a clever way to keep track of the value of each digit.\n\nThe core idea here is to represent each digit `d` (0-9) with two key values: `val[d]` which will hold the final numerical value of digit `d` after all replacements are made and the length of the string it represents, `len[d]`. We'll compute these values iteratively, taking into account the queries. Each query specifies a replacement, for example, `2 -> 00`. We need to determine how this replacement affects the ultimate value and length of the digit `2`.\n\nInitially, each digit `d` represents itself (`val[d] = d`, `len[d] = 1`).  The tricky part is figuring out how to update `val[d]` and `len[d]` with each query `di -> ti`. The order of queries matters significantly, because subsequent queries can alter digits that have already been replaced. To get the correct values, we must process the queries in *reverse* order, so that each update reflects the final, ultimate effect.\n\nFor each query, in reverse order, `di -> ti`, we will compute the new `val[di]` and `len[di]` based on what each digit in `ti` ultimately represents. We'll start by iterating through the string `ti`. With each digit `c` in `ti`, we'll need to figure out its current contribution. The length of the part of the number that is already processed is `len(c1) + len(c2)+ ... +len(ck-1)`. This tells us how much to shift the value represented by `c`.  So the current `val[di]` will be `(current_val * 10^(len(c)) + val(c))` modulo the given `MOD`. The new length `len[di]` is simply the sum of the lengths of all digits in `ti`, modulo `MOD-1`. We'll use Fermat's Little Theorem to handle exponentiation with the large `MOD` value.\n\nAfter processing all queries, the string `s` will be reduced to a number. We then need to process the initial string `s`. With each digit `d` in `s`, we'll look up its final numerical value `val[d]` and its length `len[d]`. The final numerical value is computed iteratively, concatenating digits using our final values. We'll iterate through `s` and calculate `(current_val * 10^(len[c]) + val[c]) % MOD`.  We'll take care to handle leading zeros correctly by using modulo arithmetic. Edge cases, like an empty `ti` or an empty `s`, are implicitly and correctly handled by our logic. The core logic hinges on processing queries in reverse, and applying each substitution in this context. The modulo arithmetic ensures that intermediate calculations and the final answer stay within manageable bounds.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of digit replacements in a string `s` and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo 1000000007. The key challenge is that the string `s` can grow exponentially in length, making direct string manipulation infeasible.\n\nWe need an approach that tracks the numerical value and length of what each digit (0-9) ultimately represents.\n\n**Core Idea:**\n\n1.  **Representing Digits:** Instead of the actual string, we'll maintain for each digit `d` (from 0 to 9):\n    *   `val[d]`: The numerical value that `d` ultimately represents, modulo `MOD` (1000000007).\n    *   `length[d]`: The length of the string that `d` ultimately represents, modulo `MOD - 1`. We use `MOD - 1` for lengths because we need to compute `10^L % MOD`, and by Fermat's Little Theorem, `10^L % MOD = 10^(L % (MOD - 1)) % MOD` for prime `MOD`.\n\n2.  **Initial State:**\n    Initially, each digit `d` represents itself. So:\n    *   `val[d] = d`\n    *   `length[d] = 1`\n\n3.  **Processing Queries in Reverse:**\n    The order of queries matters. If `2 -> 0` is followed by `0 -> 7`, then a `2` becomes a `0`, which then becomes a `7`. This means the *later* queries affect the outcome of *earlier* queries. To correctly determine what each digit `d` ultimately represents, we must process the queries in **reverse order**.\n\n    When processing a query `di -> ti` (where `di` is the digit to be replaced and `ti` is the replacement string):\n    We need to update `val[di]` and `length[di]`. The new `val[di]` and `length[di]` will be derived from `ti`.\n    Let `ti = \"c1c2...ck\"`. The value of `ti` is `val(c1) * 10^(len(c2)+...+len(ck)) + val(c2) * 10^(len(c3)+...+len(ck)) + ... + val(ck)`.\n    The length of `ti` is `len(c1) + len(c2) + ... + len(ck)`.\n    Since we are processing queries in reverse, when we encounter `c_j` in `ti`, `val[c_j]` and `length[c_j]` already hold their *final* values (i.e., after all queries that occur *after* the current one in the original sequence).\n\n    We can compute the new `val[di]` and `length[di]` iteratively:\n    *   Initialize `current_val = 0`\n    *   Initialize `current_length = 0`\n    *   For each character `c` in `ti` (from left to right):\n        *   `digit_val = val[int(c)]`\n        *   `digit_length = length[int(c)]`\n        *   `current_val = (current_val * pow(10, digit_length, MOD) + digit_val) % MOD`\n        *   `current_length = (current_length + digit_length) % MOD_LEN` (where `MOD_LEN = MOD - 1`)\n    *   After iterating through `ti`, set `val[int(di)] = current_val` and `length[int(di)] = current_length`.\n    *   **Special case: Empty `ti`**: If `ti` is an empty string, the loop won't run. `current_val` remains 0, `current_length` remains 0. This correctly means `di` is replaced by an empty string, contributing 0 to both value and length.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    After processing all queries in reverse, `val[d]` and `length[d]` for each digit `d` (0-9) will hold their final effective values and lengths.\n    Now, process the initial string `s` using these final `val` and `length` arrays:\n    *   Initialize `final_result = 0`\n    *   For each character `c` in the initial string `s` (from left to right):\n        *   `digit_val = val[int(c)]`\n        *   `digit_length = length[int(c)]`\n        *   `final_result = (final_result * pow(10, digit_length, MOD) + digit_val) % MOD`\n\n5.  **Output:**\n    Print `final_result`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem: `s = 222`, `2->0`, `0->7`):**\n\n*   `MOD = 1000000007`, `MOD_LEN = 1000000006`\n*   **Initial `val` and `length` arrays:**\n    `val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n    `length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n*   **Queries (stored):** `[(2, \"0\"), (0, \"7\")]`\n\n*   **Process queries in reverse:**\n\n    1.  **Query 2 (original last): `0 -> 7`**\n        `di = '0'`, `ti = \"7\"`\n        `current_val = 0`, `current_length = 0`\n        For `c = '7'` in `ti`:\n            `digit_val = val[7] = 7`\n            `digit_length = length[7] = 1`\n            `current_val = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = 7`\n            `current_length = (0 + 1) % MOD_LEN = 1`\n        Update: `val[0] = 7`, `length[0] = 1`\n        `val = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n        `length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n    2.  **Query 1 (original first): `2 -> 0`**\n        `di = '2'`, `ti = \"0\"`\n        `current_val = 0`, `current_length = 0`\n        For `c = '0'` in `ti`:\n            `digit_val = val[0] = 7` (Note: `val[0]` is now 7 from previous query)\n            `digit_length = length[0] = 1`\n            `current_val = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = 7`\n            `current_length = (0 + 1) % MOD_LEN = 1`\n        Update: `val[2] = 7`, `length[2] = 1`\n        `val = [7, 1, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n        `length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n*   **Process initial string `s = \"222\"`:**\n    `final_result = 0`\n    1.
