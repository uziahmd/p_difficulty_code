Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Anagram Check for Names and Pile**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this anagram problem. The goal is to figure out if we can rearrange letters from two names (guest and host) to spell out a given pile of letters. The core idea is simple: the total character counts in the combined names should precisely match those in the pile. Length must also match.\n\nMy initial thought was to use character frequency counting. I could've used Python's `collections.Counter` for this, it's a perfect fit. However, a simpler approach struck me – sorting. After combining the guest's and host's names, I can just sort both the combined string and the pile string. If the sorted strings are identical, we have a \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\". This leverages the fact that anagrams have the same characters with the same frequencies, just jumbled up.\n\nI considered an example with the names and the pile to test. It was clear that sorting would do the job. The constraints – string length not exceeding 100, uppercase letters only – are easy to handle. Both sorting (O(N log N)) and frequency counting (O(N)) are fast enough for N=200. I figured sorting would be clean and less code.\n\nThe Python code is pretty straightforward: read input lines, concatenate the guest and host names, sort both the combined string and the pile string, and then compare them. If they match, print \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO.\" I am using `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` for input which is good.\n\nI did some more example to ensure this logic is correct with inputs that should return \"NO\", which it does. In the examples I validated that the sorting method and the length check would properly detect when a letter is extra or missing.\n\nRemoving the comments and with some very minor cleanup, the final Python code is below.\n```python\nimport sys\n\nguest_name = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nhost_name = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\npile_letters = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\ncombined_names = guest_name + host_name\nsorted_combined_names = sorted(combined_names)\nsorted_pile_letters = sorted(pile_letters)\n\nif sorted_combined_names == sorted_pile_letters:\n    sys.stdout.write(\"YES\\n\")\nelse:\n    sys.stdout.write(\"NO\\n\")\n```",
