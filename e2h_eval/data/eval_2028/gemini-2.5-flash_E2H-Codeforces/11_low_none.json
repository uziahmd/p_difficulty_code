A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for the \"Soft Drinking\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The \"Soft Drinking\" problem is a classic resource allocation puzzle. I need to write a Python script to figure out how many toasts each friend can make, given limited supplies of drink, limes, and salt. It seems straightforward once we pinpoint the bottlenecks.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints and the inputs: `n` friends, and then supplies: `k` drink bottles with `l` ml each, `c` limes with `d` slices, and `p` grams of salt. Each friend needs `nl` ml of drink and `np` grams of salt per toast.\n\nThe key is identifying the limiting resource. I'll need to calculate the *maximum* number of toasts possible based on *each* resource individually: drink, limes, and salt.\n\nFor the drink, I'll calculate `k * l` to get the total amount, then divide by `nl` (per friend) to get the total *potential* toasts from the drink. For limes, it is a similar calculation: `c * d` total slices, so `c * d` total individual toasts. And with salt, I will calculate `p` divided by `np` for the total toasts it can support.\n\nThen, I'll take the minimum of those three values. That minimum represents the *total* number of toasts that can be made, considering all resources.\n\nFinally, since the problem states that everyone drinks the same amount, I just need to divide that minimum value (total individual toasts) by the number of friends, `n`, to find the maximum number of toasts each friend can make. I'll use integer division (`//`) at each step, because you can't have fractional toasts.\n\nThe sample walkthrough provided confirms this logic. I think I'm ready to code the solution.\n",
