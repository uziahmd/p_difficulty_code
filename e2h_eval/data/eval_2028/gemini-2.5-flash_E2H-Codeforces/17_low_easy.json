He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Prefix/Suffix Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem. They've given me `2n-2` strings, and the goal is to figure out which are prefixes and which are suffixes of some hidden string `s` of length `n`.  It seems like there's a neat pattern here: for each length from `1` to `n-1`, there are exactly two strings – one prefix and one suffix.\n\nMy initial thought is to visualize the string `s` and how its prefixes and suffixes are formed. The prefixes are just the beginnings of the string, `s[0]`, `s[0:2]`, and so on. The suffixes are the ends, `s[n-1]`, `s[n-2:n]`, etc. Since we have two strings of length `n-1`, one of them must be the longest prefix and the other the longest suffix. That's the key.\n\nLet's call the two length `n-1` strings `str1` and `str2`. The logic is to test two scenarios:\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** Assume `str1` is the prefix (`s[0:n-1]`) and `str2` is the suffix (`s[1:n]`).  If this is true, then `str1` concatenated with the last character of `str2` should give us `s`. We can check this by verifying that `str1[1:]` (the first string minus its first character) equals `str2[:-1]` (the second string minus its last character).\n*   **Scenario 2:**  Assume `str2` is the prefix and `str1` is the suffix.  This follows a symmetrical pattern: Check if `str2[1:]` equals `str1[:-1]`.\n\nOnce I figure out which of `str1` or `str2` is the prefix and the suffix, I can construct my string `s` and then generate all its prefixes and suffixes of lengths `1` through `n-1`. I'll compare these generated strings to the initial set of input strings. If the generated set exactly matches the input, I've correctly identified the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nSince the problem guarantees a solution, one of these scenarios *must* work. Once I have `s`, I can easily label each input string as either 'P' for prefix or 'S' for suffix and output the answer. The core is really about correctly identifying the longest prefix and suffix and then using that to reconstruct `s`.\n",
