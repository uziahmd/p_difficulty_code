There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Final Solution: Maximizing Profit from House Building**\n\nAlright, I've got this competitive programming problem. I need to maximize profit from building houses, given height restrictions. The input is: `n` spots, a maximum height `h`, and `m` zoning restrictions. Each spot `i` can have a house of height `a_i` where profit is `a_i^2`. Restrictions are `(l_j, r_j, x_j)`, meaning the tallest house from spots `l_j` to `r_j` is at most `x_j`.\n\nMy initial thought was that with `n, h, m <= 50`, a polynomial-time solution should work, potentially exponential but with a small base. The goal is to maximize the sum of `a_i^2`. Each `a_i` is bound by a global max height `h` and local zoning restrictions.\n\nAt first, I thought this was range maximum problem, but the constraint phrasing \"tallest house...at most `x_j`\" is the key. The phrase translates to \"all houses in that range are at most `x_j`\". This makes the problem much easier. I need to determine the absolute maximum height for each spot by checking all overlapping restrictions.\n\nSo, here's the algorithm:\n1.  Initialize an array `max_heights` of size `n` with `h` for each spot.\n2.  Iterate through each restriction `(l, r, x)`. Update the height limits for each impacted location ( `max_heights[i] = min(max_heights[i], x)`)\n3. Calculate profit: Sum `max_heights[i] * max_heights[i]` and return.\n\nI realized the critical insight is that because of the squared profit function and the range constraint, I can process each spot independently. No dynamic programming or complex data structures are needed.\n\nLet's test this strategy with the examples. The solution matches the outputs of the sample inputs, so I am confident in this approach.\n\nThis has O(n*m) complexity. I confirmed this strategy is efficient to solve the task. The algorithm correctly handles cases where `x=0`, and overlapping restrictions. I wrote a clean implementation in Python. I'll submit this as my final answer.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the total profit from building houses on `n` spots. For each spot `i`, if a house has height `a_i`, the profit gained is `a_i^2`. The height `a_i` must be an integer between `0` and `h` (inclusive). There are `m` zoning restrictions. Each restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)` states that the tallest house in the range `[l_j, r_j]` must be at most `x_j`.\n\nThe crucial part is interpreting the restriction: \"the tallest house from spots `l_j` to `r_j` (inclusive) must be at most `x_j`\". This implies that *every* house within that range, i.e., for all spots `k` such that `l_j \\le k \\le r_j`, its height `a_k` must be at most `x_j`. If any house `a_k` in the range `[l_j, r_j]` were taller than `x_j`, then the maximum height in that range would also be taller than `x_j`, violating the restriction.\n\nTherefore, for each spot `i`, its height `a_i` is constrained by two factors:\n1. The global maximum height: `a_i \\le h`.\n2. For every restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)` that covers spot `i` (i.e., `l_j \\le i \\le r_j`), `a_i \\le x_j`.\n\nCombining these, for each spot `i`, the maximum allowed height `H_i` is the minimum of `h` and all `x_j` values from restrictions that cover spot `i`.\n`H_i = \\min(h, \\min_{j \\text{ s.t. } l_j \\le i \\le r_j} x_j)`\n\nTo maximize the total profit `\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2`, since `a_i^2` is an increasing function for `a_i \\ge 0`, we should choose each `a_i` to be as large as possible. Thus, for each spot `i`, the optimal height `a_i` will be `H_i`.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Initialize an array `max_allowed_heights` of size `n`. Each element `max_allowed_heights[k]` will store the maximum permissible height for spot `k+1`. Initially, set all elements to `h`.\n2. For each of the `m` restrictions `(l, r, x)`:\n   Iterate through the spots from `l` to `r` (inclusive). For each spot `i` in this range, update `max_allowed_heights[i-1] = \\min(max_allowed_heights[i-1], x)`. (We use `i-1` for 0-indexed array access).\n3. After processing all restrictions, calculate the total profit by summing `max_allowed_heights[k]^2` for all `k` from `0` to `n-1`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nRestrictions: `(1,1,1)`, `(2,2,3)`, `(3,3,2)`\n\n1. Initialize `max_allowed_heights = [3, 3, 3]`.\n\n2. Process restrictions:\n   - `(1,1,1)`: For spot 1 (`index 0`), `max_allowed_heights[0] = \\min(3, 1) = 1`.\n     `max_allowed_heights` becomes `[1, 3, 3]`.\n   - `(2,2,3)`: For spot 2 (`index 1`), `max_allowed_heights[1] = \\min(3, 3) = 3`.\n     `max_allowed_heights` remains `[1, 3, 3]`.\n   - `(3,3,2)`: For spot 3 (`index 2`), `max_allowed_heights[2] = \\min(3, 2) = 2`.\n     `max_allowed_heights` becomes `[1, 3, 2]`.\n\n3. Calculate total profit:\n   `1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- Time Complexity: `O(n)` for initialization. `O(m \\cdot n)` for processing restrictions (in the worst case, each restriction covers all `n` spots). `O(n)` for calculating total profit. Total: `O(n \\cdot m)`. Given `n, m \\le 50`, `50 \\cdot 50 = 2500` operations, which is very efficient.\n- Space Complexity: `O(n)` for storing `max_allowed_heights`. Given `n \\le 50`, this is minimal.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    max_allowed_heights = [h] * n\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        \n        l_idx = l - 1\n        r_idx = r - 1\n        \n        for i in range(l_idx, r_idx + 1):\n            max_allowed_heights[i] = min(max_allowed_heights[i], x)\n\n    total_profit = 0\n    for height in max_allowed_heights:\n        total_profit += height * height\n    \n    print(total_profit)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
