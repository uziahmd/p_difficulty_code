            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Vanya and Lanterns\n\nVanya walks late at night along a straight street of length l, lit by n lanterns. Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My approach to solving the \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem:**\n\nI'm tackling this problem with a clear strategy. First, I need to understand the core mechanics. We have a street of length `l`, lanterns placed at positions `a_i`, and each lantern has a radius `d`. The goal is to find the *smallest* `d` that ensures the entire street is illuminated. The initial thought is, how do I break down this coverage problem?\n\nThe constraints immediately jump out as important. `n` and `l` have specific upper bounds, and the output precision is defined. I'm thinking, this hints that a brute-force approach wouldn't be efficient. The precision requirement also guides the calculations. I'll need to use floating-point numbers to maintain accuracy.\n\nMy first instinct is, that sorting the lantern positions is key. By arranging the `a_i` values in ascending order, I can easily analyze the distances between lanterns and how they might affect the required radius `d`. Now, where do I begin the calculations?\n\nI see three critical regions that dictate the minimum value of `d`: the start of the street (0), the end of the street (l), and the gaps between the lanterns. To cover the start of the street, the leftmost lantern's position, say `a_0`, must be within `d` units of 0. This gives me my first inequality: `a_0 - d <= 0`, so `d >= a_0`.  Likewise, to cover the end of the street, the rightmost lantern, `a_{n-1}`, must be within `d` units of `l`:  `a_{n-1} + d >= l`, thus `d >= l - a_{n-1}`.\n\nThe most involved is calculating `d` for the gaps. Considering two adjacent lanterns at positions `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`. They need to illuminate the segment in between. The covered segment of the left lantern is `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`, and of the right is `[a_{i+1} - d, a_{i+1} + d]`. The condition for full coverage is that these segments must either touch or overlap, this gives us: `a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d` which simplifies to `2d >= a_{i+1} - a_i`, or `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`.  I need to find the largest value of this expression across all adjacent lantern pairs, this will be `d_gap_max`.\n\nTo find the minimum value for `d` overall, I need to consider all three inequalities simultaneously.  Therefore, I'll take the maximum value amongst the radius needed for the start, end, and all gaps, i.e., `max(a_0, l - a_{n-1}, d_gap_max)`. This ensures that every point on the street is illuminated. I can see the code logic shaping up in my mind...\n\nImplementation details: I'll read the input `n`, `l`, and the lantern positions. I'll sort the lantern positions, and then compute the required values `d_start = a_0`, `d_end = l - a_{n-1}`, and `d_gap_max` as mentioned. The final result is simply the `max` of these three. To ensure precision, I will use floating-point numbers in all calculations and apply formatting to print the final result to the requested precision.  I will write the code and test with the given examples and other potential edge cases. I'm feeling confident about this approach!\n",
