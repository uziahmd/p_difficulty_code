Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solving the Mister B and Angle in Polygon Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Mister B and Angle in Polygon\" problem. The core of it is finding three vertices in a regular `n`-gon whose angle is as close as possible to a given angle `a`.  My initial thought is to really leverage the geometry here, since this is all about angles and circles.  We're dealing with a regular polygon, so all vertices are on a circumcircle.  The angle we're looking for, `v1-v2-v3`, is an inscribed angle.  And a key property of inscribed angles: they're half the measure of the arc they subtend.\n\nNow, let's get concrete. I'm going to start numbering the vertices from 1 to `n`.  It seems reasonable to fix one vertex, let's say `v2` is vertex 1, without losing generality. Then I just have to find the other two. I'm thinking of labeling them as `v1 = i` and `v3 = j`.  The challenge then becomes, how do I relate the indices `i` and `j` to the subtended arc and ultimately to the angle?\n\nThe crucial step here is to figure out the arc length. Since the angle depends on the arc subtended, and we know that the central angle for any arc will be a multiple of `360/n` degrees, I just need to find the number of edges along this arc. The number of edges along the arc from `i` to `j`, not passing through 1, is crucial.  Using modulo arithmetic might be helpful here. I tried a few ways of calculating this, including `|i-j|`, but it's not quite right. After careful consideration, I'm thinking of vertex 0 as the reference point for calculating offsets.  After some reflection, I think it's simplest if I use the modulo arithmetic and calculate from vertex 0, and then consider the difference between vertices `p` and `q`, from vertex 1. The key is now to formulate the relationship between `i`, `j`, and the subtended arc correctly.\n\nSo, I'm going to set `v2` at vertex `1`, `v1` at `p`, and `v3` at `q`. Then, the angle `p-1-q` is the thing I am looking for.  The correct way of finding the required arc is what needs to be carefully determined now.\n",
