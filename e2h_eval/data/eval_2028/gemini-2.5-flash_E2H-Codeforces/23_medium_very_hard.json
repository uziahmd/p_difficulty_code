In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Tokitsukaze Mahjong Problem: My Reasoning Process**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this interesting programming challenge. The objective is to figure out the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a winning hand (a *mentsu* which is either a *koutsu* or a *shuntsu*). She starts with three tiles, and I need to determine how many more she needs (0, 1, or 2).\n\nMy first thought is to break this down logically. The input is three tile strings, like \"1s\" (one of spades), and the output is the number of draws.\n\nI immediately identify the definitions: tiles, koutsu (three identical tiles), shuntsu (three sequential tiles of the same suit), and mentsu (either koutsu or shuntsu). A winning condition means having at least one mentsu. Drawing means picking any tile you like infinitely.\n\nThe fact that we're only dealing with three initial tiles screams \"check all possibilities.\" It seems like 0, 1, or 2 draws will be sufficient. If we draw twice, with three initial tiles, we'll have a total of five tiles, and I strongly suspect two draws will always be enough to form a winning hand. So, my goal is to figure out when 0 draws work, and then when 1 draw works, and if neither, then I can confidently say the answer is 2.\n\nI start by analyzing the 0-draw case: can we form a mentsu with the initial three tiles? I need to check for both koutsu and shuntsu. For a koutsu, I just see if all three tiles are identical. If so, problem solved! If not, can these three tiles form a shuntsu? For this, they must be the same suit and the numbers must be sequential. I sort the numbers to handle any order like \"3p 1p 2p\".\n\nIf the initial tiles don't make a mentsu, I then move to the 1-draw scenario. Drawing one tile means checking if *any* of the four possible combinations (using one drawn tile) results in a mentsu. This will involve trying the draw of any possible tile type (1m-9m, 1p-9p, 1s-9s). It seems like a lot, so I begin looking for ways to streamline.\n\nThinking more deeply, instead of checking all 27 tile draws, I focus on what a drawn tile *needs* to be to help. I examine the pairs within my initial three tiles. I parse each tile into number and suit, e.g., \"1m\" becomes (1, 'm').\n\nNow, if two initial tiles are identical (e.g., 2m, 2m), then drawing a third 2m creates a koutsu. Easy! If the two are of the same suit and the numbers are close (differ by 1 or 2), then a shuntsu might be possible. If the numbers are 2m and 3m, I could draw a 1m or 4m to make a shuntsu. If the two numbers are 2m, 4m, I would need a 3m to draw.\n\nSo, for the 1-draw case, I look for pairs in my initial tiles, and, if those tiles can complete either a koutsu (two of initial tiles are identical) or a shuntsu (same suit, sequential or differ by 2), then the answer is one draw.\n\nIf both 0 and 1 draws are insufficient, the answer must be 2. If I draw two of the same tile, I'm guaranteed to form a koutsu. So, the overall algorithm is this:\n\n1.  Check for 0 draws (can form a mentsu from original tiles). If yes, print 0 and stop.\n2.  If 0 draws is not possible, check for 1 draw (using my enhanced tile-pair check). If yes, print 1 and stop.\n3.  If neither, the answer is 2, because two draws always create a winning hand.\n\nI'll write helper functions to make the code cleaner. I'll need a way to parse \"1s\" to (1, 's'), check if three tiles form a koutsu, and check if three tiles form a shuntsu. I'll also have a helper function `has_mentsu` that calls the koutsu or shuntsu checkers.\n\nI'll then implement the main logic of 0-draw check, then 1-draw check. For the 1-draw check, I have a more optimized tile-pair approach that focuses on building either a koutsu or",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (meld). A mentsu can be a koutsu (triplet of three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (sequence of three sequential tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles. She can draw any tiles she wants, and the supply of each tile type is infinite.\n\nGiven that she starts with three tiles, and the maximum number of tiles she would consider drawing is very small, we can analyze the problem by checking the minimum number of draws: 0, 1, or 2.\n\n**1. Check for 0 Draws:**\nWith the initial three tiles, can she already form a mentsu?\nLet the three tiles be `t1, t2, t3`.\n*   **Koutsu:** Are `t1, t2, t3` all identical? (e.g., `[1m, 1m, 1m]`)\n*   **Shuntsu:** Are `t1, t2, t3` all of the same suit AND their numbers can be sorted into a sequence `x, x+1, x+2`? (e.g., `[1s, 2s, 3s]` or `[6p, 5p, 7p]`)\n\nIf either of these conditions is met, she needs 0 draws.\n\n**2. Check for 1 Draw:**\nIf 0 draws is not enough, can she form a mentsu by drawing one additional tile?\nShe would then have four tiles: `t1, t2, t3, t_draw`. A mentsu requires three tiles. This means we need to find if there exists *any* tile `t_draw` such that *any* three tiles chosen from `t1, t2, t3, t_draw` form a mentsu.\n\nThis can be simplified: we need to find if any two of the initial tiles (`t_a, t_b`) can be combined with one drawn tile (`t_draw`) to form a mentsu.\nLet the initial parsed tiles be `p1, p2, p3`. We consider the three possible pairs: `(p1, p2)`, `(p1, p3)`, and `(p2, p3)`.\n\n*   **Koutsu with 1 Draw:** If any two of the initial tiles are identical (e.g., `p1 == p2`), she can draw a third identical tile (e.g., another `p1`) to form a koutsu.\n    *   Condition: `p1 == p2` OR `p1 == p3` OR `p2 == p3`.\n\n*   **Shuntsu with 1 Draw:** If any two of the initial tiles are of the same suit and \"close\" in number, she can draw a tile to complete a shuntsu.\n    Let's consider a pair `(t_a, t_b)` with numbers `na, nb` and suits `sa, sb`.\n    *   If `sa == sb` (same suit):\n        *   If `abs(na - nb) == 1` (e.g., `[2m, 3m]`): She can draw `min(na, nb) - 1` (e.g., `1m`) or `max(na, nb) + 1` (e.g., `4m`). At least one of these will be a valid tile (number 1-9). So, a shuntsu can be formed.\n        *   If `abs(na - nb) == 2` (e.g., `[2m, 4m]`): She can draw the middle tile `(na+nb)/2` (e.g., `3m`). This is always a valid tile. So, a shuntsu can be formed.\n    *   Condition: For any pair `(p_i, p_j)`, if `p_i[1] == p_j[1]` AND (`abs(p_i[0] - p_j[0]) == 1` OR `abs(p_i[0] - p_j[0]) == 2`).\n\nIf any of these koutsu or shuntsu conditions for 1 draw are met, she needs 1 draw.\n\n**3. Check for 2 Draws:**\nIf neither 0 draws nor 1 draw is sufficient, she will always need 2 draws. This is because she can always draw two copies of any existing tile (e.g., `t1`) to form a koutsu (`[t1, t1, t1]`).\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n1.  Parse tile strings into a more manageable format, e.g., `(number, suit)` tuples.\n2.  Define helper functions `is_koutsu(tiles_list)` and `is_shuntsu(tiles_list)` for three tiles.\n    *   For `is_shuntsu`, ensure suits are the same, then sort the numbers and check for `x, x+1, x+2`.\n3.  Define `has_mentsu(tiles_list)` which returns `is_koutsu(...) or is_shuntsu(...)`.\n4.  Apply the logic described above:\n    *   Call `has_mentsu` on the initial three tiles. If true, print 0.\n    *   Otherwise, iterate through the three pairs of initial tiles `(p1, p2), (p1, p3), (p2, p3)`. For each pair, check if it can form a koutsu or shuntsu with one additional draw. If true for any pair, print 1.\n    *   Otherwise, print 2.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef parse_tile(s):\n    \"\"\"Parses a tile string like '1s' into (number, suit).\"\"\"\n    num = int(s[0])\n    suit = s[1]\n    return (num, suit)\n\ndef is_koutsu(tiles_list):\n    \"\"\"Checks if three tiles form a koutsu (triplet).\"\"\"\n    # A koutsu requires exactly three identical tiles.\n    if len(tiles_list) != 3:\n        return False\n    t1, t2, t3 = tiles_list\n    return t1 == t2 and t2 == t3\n\ndef is_shuntsu(tiles_list):\n    \"\"\"Checks if three tiles form a shuntsu (sequence).\"\"\"\n    # A shuntsu requires exactly three sequential tiles of the same suit.\n    if len(tiles_list) != 3:\n        return False\n    t1, t2, t3 = tiles_list\n    \n    # All must be of the same suit.\n    if not (t1[1] == t2[1] and t2[1] == t3[1]):\n        return False\n    \n    # Numbers must be sequential.
