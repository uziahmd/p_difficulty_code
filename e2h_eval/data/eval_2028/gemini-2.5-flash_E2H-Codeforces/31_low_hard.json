Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Card Sum Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm dealing with a competitive programming problem where Vanya needs to reach a zero sum with a set of cards. I need to figure out the minimum number of additional cards he needs to achieve this.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the initial sum (`S`) of the `n` cards Vanya already has. That's the starting point. My target is simple: get a total sum of zero. So the difference between my current sum and the target is just `-S`.\n\nTo minimize the number of additional cards, I want to maximize the contribution of each new card. Since the new cards can range from `-x` to `x`, I need to consider a few cases. If `-S` is positive, I want to use cards with value `x` to reduce it as quickly as possible. If `-S` is negative, I'll use cards of value `-x`.  If `-S` is zero, I'm done.\n\nLet's call `-S` the `target_sum`. Now, the problem boils down to: how many cards with value `x` or `-x` do I need to reach this `target_sum`? To figure this out, I'll take the absolute value of the `target_sum` and divide it by `x`. But, it's not quite that simple.\n\nSince I need the *minimum* number, I'll have to consider remainders.  Even if the absolute value of the target sum isn't a perfect multiple of `x`, I'll still need an extra card. So, I need to use the `ceil` function to round up to the nearest whole number. That's my final answer. It is `ceil(abs(-S)/x)`. Let's code this.\n",
