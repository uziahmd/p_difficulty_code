Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**The \"Feed the Golorp\" Puzzle - My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem, \"Feed the Golorp.\"  The goal is to find a set of variable assignments (integers from 0 to 9) that satisfy a given set of mathematical constraints. The input is a string that represents the Golorp's name, which I can immediately see has a specific structure.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the Golorp name structure. It appears to be a mathematical expression followed by a list of constraints. The part before `:-` is the \"jaws\" expression, and the part after is the \"stomach\" or constraints.  Variables are represented by underscores; the number of underscores indicates the variable's index (e.g., `_` is v0, `__` is v1). The expression uses the standard arithmetic operators and parentheses.  The constraints are inequalities using `>` and `<`, separated by commas. I need to be careful to parse these correctly.\n\nMy plan is to split the Golorp name into its two key components: the expression and the constraints. For the expression, I'll replace the underscore sequences with their corresponding variable names (`v0`, `v1`, etc.).  I'll need to evaluate the expression later, and Python's `eval()` function might be helpful, but I have to ensure the environment is safe and controlled. The constraints need to be parsed into individual inequality statements, and the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of each inequality might contain variables or numerical values.\n\nThe core of the solution is to find a sequence of variable values that satisfy all the constraints. The problem specifies to find the lexicographically smallest sequence if multiple solutions exist. This strongly suggests a brute-force or backtracking approach where I iterate through possible values for each variable (0 to 9) in increasing order. I'll need a mechanism to efficiently evaluate the expression and check the constraints for each variable assignment.\n\nLet's break it down further. I need to implement two critical parsing phases:\n\n1.  **Expression Parsing:**  Extract the expression part, replace underscores with variable names, then figure out the most efficient way to evaluate this expression. Python's `eval()` with sanitization, or perhaps a custom parser using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), could work. I need to evaluate this expression for each possible variable assignment.\n\n2.  **Constraint Parsing:** Split the constraint string by commas and then by comparison operators.  Convert the variable references (underscores) to the corresponding variables. This needs to be done meticulously to avoid any indexing errors.\n\nSo, I will start coding!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of digits (0-9) for a set of variables that satisfy a given set of constraints. The constraints and the number of variables are derived from a \"golorp name\" string.\n\nThe golorp name has the format `?EXPRESSION:-CONSTRAINTS.`.\n- `EXPRESSION` defines the mathematical operation whose result is implicitly variable `v_max_idx + 1`.\n- `CONSTRAINTS` define inequalities between variables or results of expressions.\n- Variables are represented by underscores: `_` is `v0`, `__` is `v1`, `___` is `v2`, and so on. If `N` underscores are present, it refers to variable `v_{N-1}`.\n- Operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.\n- Constraints use `>` and `<`.\n\nThe goal is to find values for `v0, v1, ..., v_k` (where `k` is the maximum variable index used in the name) such that all constraints are met, and the sequence `v0v1...vk` is lexicographically smallest. If no such sequence exists, output \"false\".\n\nThis problem can be solved using a backtracking (recursive brute-force) approach combined with parsing. Since we need the lexicographically smallest sequence, we iterate through possible values for `v0` from 0 to 9, then for `v1` from 0 to 9, and so on. The first valid sequence found will be the lexicographically smallest.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  **Parse the Golorp Name:**\n    *   Extract the `EXPRESSION` part (between `?` and `:-`).\n    *   Extract the `CONSTRAINTS` part (between `:-` and `.`).\n    *   **Identify all variables:** Scan both `EXPRESSION` and `CONSTRAINTS` to find all occurrences of `_`, `__`, etc. Determine the maximum variable index `k` used. This tells us we need to find values for `v0` through `vk`.\n    *   **Rewrite the expression and constraints:** Replace `_` sequences with Python-friendly variable names (e.g., `v[0]`, `v[1]`). This makes them evaluable.\n        *   For example, `___` becomes `v[2]`.\n        *   The `EXPRESSION` itself computes a value. Let's say it's `result`. The problem statement implies `result` is also a variable involved in constraints. The examples show that the result of the expression is implicitly `v_max_idx_in_expr + 1`. This is a crucial detail. For instance, if `v0` and `v1` are used in the expression, the expression's result is `v2`. We'll need to handle this.\n        *   A simpler approach, and one that aligns with the examples, is to consider the expression `E` to be `v[max_var_idx_in_E + 1] = E`. This implicitly adds a new variable. However, the problem statement says \"Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9\". This implies the *result* of the expression must also be within 0-9.\n        *   Let's re-evaluate the expression's role based on the examples.\n            *   `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n                *   Expression: `(_-_/___*__)` involves `v0, v1, v2`. Max index is 2.\n                *   Constraints: `___>__` -> `v2 > v1`.\n                *   Output: `0010`. Here `v0=0, v1=0, v2=1`. The expression `(0-0/1*0)` evaluates to `0`. The output `0010` has 4 digits. `v0, v1, v2, v3`. This suggests `v3` is the result of the expression. So `v3 = (v0 - v1 / v2 * v1)`.\n                *   This interpretation seems most consistent: the expression defines an *additional* variable, whose index is one greater than the maximum index appearing in the expression itself.\n    *   Store the rewritten constraints as a list of strings that can be `eval()`uated.\n\n2.  **Backtracking Function (`solve(idx, current_values)`):**\n    *   `idx`: The index of the variable we are currently trying to assign a value to (from `v0` to `vk`).\n    *   `current_values`: A list storing the values assigned so far `[v0_val, v1_val, ..., v_{idx-1}_val]`.\n    *   **Base Case:** If `idx > k` (all variables `v0` to `vk` have been assigned values):\n        *   Calculate the value of the expression `EXPR_VAL` using `current_values`.\n        *   If `EXPR_VAL` is not an integer or is outside `[0, 9]`, this path is invalid.\n        *   Append `EXPR_VAL` to `current_values` as `v_{k+1}`.\n        *   **Check all constraints:** For each constraint string, substitute `v[i]` with `current_values[i]` and `eval()` it. If all constraints evaluate to `True`, then `current_values` is a valid solution. Return `current_values` (as a string of digits).\n        *   If any constraint fails, this path is invalid.\n    *   **Recursive Step:** For `val` from 0 to 9:\n        *   Append `val` to `current_values`.\n        *   Recursively call `solve(idx + 1, current_values)`.\n        *   If the recursive call returns a solution, immediately return that solution (because we are iterating `val` from 0, this will be the lexicographically smallest).\n        *   Remove `val` from `current_values` (backtrack).\n    *   If the loop finishes without finding a solution, return `None`.\n\n3.  **Main Execution:**\n    *   Call `solve(0, [])`.\n    *   If a solution is returned, print it.\n    *   If `None` is returned, print \"false\".\n\n**Refined Parsing and Variable Handling:**\n\n1.  **Initial Scan for Max Variable Index:**\n    *   Iterate through the entire name string.\n    *   When an `_` is encountered, count consecutive `_`s. Let this be `N`.\n    *   The variable index is `N-1`. Keep track of the `max_var_idx` found.\n    *   This `max_var_idx` tells us how many base variables (`v0` to `v_{max_var_idx}`) we need to assign values to. Let's call this `num_base_vars = max_var_idx + 1`.\n\n2.  **Rewriting:**\n    *   Replace `_` sequences with `v[N-1]` in both the expression and constraints.\n    *   The expression will become something like `(v[0] - v[1] / v[2] * v[1])`.\n    *   The constraints will be a list of strings like `v[2] > v[1]`.\n\n3.  **Expression Result Variable:**\n    *   The expression's result will be considered `v[num_base_vars]`.\n    *   So, the `current_values` list will effectively need `num_base_vars + 1` elements.\n    *   The backtracking should assign values for `v0` to `v_{num_base_vars - 1}`.\n    *   After these are assigned, `v_{num_base_vars}` is computed from the expression.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`**\n\n1.  **Parsing:**\n    *   `EXPRESSION`: `(_-_/___*__)`\n    *   `CONSTRAINTS`: `___>__`\n    *   Variables found: `_` (v0), `__` (v1), `___` (v2).\n    *   `max_var_idx = 2`. `num_base_vars = 3`.\n    *   Rewritten `EXPRESSION`: `(v[0] - v[1] / v[2] * v[1])`\n    *   Rewritten `CONSTRAINTS`: `['v[2] > v[1]']`\n    *   The expression result will be `v[3]`. So, we need to find values for `v0, v1, v2`.\n\n2.  **Backtracking (`solve(idx, current_values)`):**\n    *   `solve(0, [])`\n        *   `val = 0`: `solve(1, [0])`\n            *   `val = 0`: `solve(2, [0, 0])`\n                *   `val = 0`: `solve(3, [0, 0, 0])`\n                    *   `idx = 3 == num_base_vars`. Base case.\n                    *   `v = [0, 0, 0]`.\n                    *   Calculate `EXPR_VAL = (v[0] - v[1] / v[2] * v[1]) = (0 - 0 / 0 * 0)`. Division by zero! This path is invalid. Continue.\n                *   `val = 1`: `solve(3, [0, 0, 1])`\n                    *   `idx = 3`. Base case.\n                    *   `v = [0, 0, 1]`.\n                    *   `EXPR_VAL = (0 - 0 / 1 * 0) = 0`. This is an integer in `[0, 9]`.\n                    *   Append `EXPR_VAL`: `v_all = [0, 0, 1, 0]`. (So `v0=0, v1=0, v2=1, v3=0`).\n                    *   Check constraints: `v[2] > v[1]` -> `1 > 0`. This is `True`.\n                    *   All constraints met. Return `\"0010\"`.\n            *   This returns `\"0010\"`.\n        *   This returns `\"0010\"`.\n    *   The main call receives `\"0010\"` and prints it.\n\nThis approach seems robust.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef solve():\n    name = input()\n\n    # 1.
