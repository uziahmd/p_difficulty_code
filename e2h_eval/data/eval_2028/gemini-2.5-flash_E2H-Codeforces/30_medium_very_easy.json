Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break down this \"TV Game\" problem and craft a Python script to solve it.** My initial thought is that this isn't just a simple greedy algorithm; it seems like dynamic programming is the key. The objective is to maximize the sum of the two players' scores, and the position of each digit in a player's number significantly impacts its value.\n\nFirst, I need to really nail down the game rules. Two players, Homer and Marge, each take *n* digits from a 2*n*-digit number *A*. They take digits from the left, appending them to their individual numbers. The goal is to maximize the total sum of these two numbers.\n\nMy first thought was that the problem is to maximize `S1 + S2`. And I realized that the value of each number is not simply the sum of individual digits but depend on the *position* of each digit that each player has collected. I.e. if Homer has digits *a, b, c*, then the value of Homer's number `S1 = a*10^(2-0) + b*10^(2-1) + c*10^(2-2)`.\n\nConsidering the order of digits is vital. The crucial insight is that each digit's value depends on where it *ends up* in the final number. If a digit is taken early, it has a larger place value; if it's taken later, it has a smaller one.\n\nA dynamic programming approach seems suitable here. I define a state `dp(k, h_count, m_count)` to represent the maximum total prize from the digits *A[k:]* where Homer has taken *h_count* digits and Marge has taken *m_count* digits so far. The base case is when all digits are processed, i.e., both players have taken *n* digits.\n\nThe transitions involve deciding which player takes the current digit. If both have room to take more digits, then there are two possibilities. If one player has exhausted their limit, then the other player must take the current digit. The recursive calls solve the subproblems of choosing the next available digit, given the current state. The solution is the maximum value returned from these calls.\n\nWith a good structure for the DP state and transitions, I then need to define the memoization part of my solution, as well as the reconstruction part. I also need to use precomputed powers of ten to speed up value calculation. With the DP defined and the base cases in place, the core idea is to build a table of optimal subproblem solutions in a bottom-up fashion. From there I'll backtrack through the table to build a string indicating moves, and that will be my solution! Now, let's code this up!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a sequence of moves for Homer ('H') and Marge ('M') to maximize their total prize, S1 + S2. Each player must make exactly `n` moves. The digits are taken one by one from left to right from the input number `A`. When a player takes a digit, it's appended to their number. The position of the digit within their number determines its place value.\n\nLet `A_digits` be the list of digits of `A` as integers.\nWhen a player takes the `k`-th digit from `A` (0-indexed, `A_digits[k]`), if it's the `i`-th digit that player has taken (0-indexed), its contribution to that player's score will be `A_digits[k] * 10^(n - 1 - i)`.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming.\nLet `dp(k, h_count, m_count)` be the maximum total prize that can be obtained from the digits `A_digits[k:]`, given that Homer has already taken `h_count` digits and Marge has taken `m_count` digits.\n\n**State:**\n* `k`: The current index of the digit being considered from `A_digits` (from `0` to `2n-1`).\n* `h_count`: The number of digits Homer has already taken (from `0` to `n`).\n* `m_count`: The number of digits Marge has already taken (from `0` to `n`).\n\n**Base Case:**\n* If `k == 2n` (all digits have been processed), the total prize is `0`.\n\n**Transitions:**\nFor `dp(k, h_count, m_count)`:\n1.  **Both players can make a move (`h_count < n` and `m_count < n`):**\n    *   **Homer takes `A_digits[k]`**: The prize from this move is `A_digits[k] * 10^(n - 1 - h_count)`. The total prize for this option is `A_digits[k] * 10^(n - 1 - h_count) + dp(k + 1, h_count + 1, m_count)`.\n    *   **Marge takes `A_digits[k]`**: The prize from this move is `A_digits[k] * 10^(n - 1 - m_count)`. The total prize for this option is `A_digits[k] * 10^(n - 1 - m_count) + dp(k + 1, h_count, m_count + 1)`.\n    *   We choose the option that yields the maximum total prize.\n\n2.  **Homer has taken `n` digits (`h_count == n`):**\n    *   Marge must take `A_digits[k]`. The total prize is `A_digits[k] * 10^(n - 1 - m_count) + dp(k + 1, h_count, m_count + 1)`.\n\n3.  **Marge has taken `n` digits (`m_count == n`):**\n    *   Homer must take `A_digits[k]`. The total prize is `A_digits[k] * 10^(n - 1 - h_count) + dp(k + 1, h_count + 1, m_count)`.\n\nTo reconstruct the sequence of moves, we can store the choice ('H' or 'M') made at each state `(k, h_count, m_count)` that led to the maximum prize. After computing all DP values, we can backtrack from `(0, 0, 0)` using these stored choices.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   `k` ranges from `0` to `2n` (`2n+1` values).\n*   `h_count` ranges from `0` to `n` (`n+1` values).\n*   `m_count` ranges from `0` to `n` (`n+1` values).\n*   Total states: `(2n+1) * (n+1) * (n+1)`.\n*   For `n=18`, `2n=36`. Number of states: `37 * 19 * 19 = 13357`.\n*   Each state computation takes constant time (a few additions and comparisons).\n*   This is efficient enough for `n <= 18`.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n*   Use a dictionary `memo` to store `(max_prize, choice)` for each state `(k, h_count, m_count)` to avoid redundant computations (memoization).\n*   Precompute `powers_of_10 = [10^(n-1), 10^(n-2), ..., 10^0]` for quick lookup of place values. `powers_of_10[i]` will give `10^(n-1-i)`.\n*   When choices lead to equal maximum prizes, any choice is valid. We can arbitrarily prefer 'H' or 'M'.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Read n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n# Read A as a string and convert to a list of integers\nA_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nA_digits = [int(d) for d in A_str]\n\n# Precompute powers of 10 for place values\n# powers_of_10[i] will store 10^(n - 1 - i)\n# This means powers_of_10[0] is 10^(n-1), powers_of_10[1] is 10^(n-2), ..., powers_of_10[n-1] is 10^0\npowers_of_10 = [0] * n\nfor i in range(n):\n    powers_of_10[i] = 10**(n - 1 - i)\n\n# Memoization table: memo[(k, h_count, m_count)] = (max_prize, choice_char)\nmemo = {}\n\ndef solve(k, h_count, m_count):\n    # If this state has already been computed, return the stored value\n    if (k, h_count, m_count) in memo:\n        return memo[(k, h_count, m_count)]\n\n    # Base case: All digits processed\n    if k == 2 * n:\n        return 0, '' # 0 prize, empty choice\n\n    current_digit = A_digits[k]\n    \n    prize_homer = -1\n    prize_marge = -1\n\n    # Option 1: Homer takes the current digit\n    if h_count < n:\n        # Calculate prize if Homer takes it\n        # The current_digit becomes the (h_count)-th digit for Homer\n        # Its place value is powers_of_10[h_count]\n        next_prize, _ = solve(k + 1, h_count + 1, m_count)\n        prize_homer = current_digit * powers_of_10[h_count] + next_prize\n\n    # Option 2: Marge takes the current digit\n    if m_count < n:\n        # Calculate prize if Marge takes it\n        # The current_digit becomes the (m_count)-th digit for Marge\n        # Its place value is powers_of_10[m_count]\n        next_prize, _ = solve(k + 1, h_count, m_count + 1)\n        prize_marge = current_digit * powers_of_10[m_count] + next_prize\n\n    max_prize = -1\n    choice = ''\n\n    # Determine the best choice based on who can make a move\n    if h_count == n: # Homer cannot move, Marge must\n        max_prize = prize_marge\n        choice = 'M'\n    elif m_count == n: # Marge cannot move, Homer must\n        max_prize = prize_homer\n        choice = 'H'\n    else: # Both can move, choose the one that gives max prize\n        if prize_homer >= prize_marge:\n            max_prize = prize_homer\n            choice = 'H'\n        else:\n            max_prize = prize_marge\n            choice = 'M'\n            \n    memo[(k, h_count, m_count)] = (max_prize, choice)\n    return max_prize, choice\n\n# Call the DP function to populate the memo table\nsolve(0, 0, 0)\n\n# Reconstruct the path (sequence of moves)\nresult_path = []\nk, h_count, m_count = 0, 0, 0\n\nwhile k < 2 * n:\n    _, choice = memo[(k, h_count, m_count)]\n    result_path.append(choice)\n    \n    if choice == 'H':\n        h_count += 1\n    else: # choice == 'M'\n        m_count += 1\n    \n    k += 1\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"\".join(result_path))\n\n```",
