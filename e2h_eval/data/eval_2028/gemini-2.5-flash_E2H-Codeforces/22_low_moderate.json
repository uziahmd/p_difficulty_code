After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Marks\" Problem: My Thought Process**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to tackle the \"Marks\" competitive programming problem.  Let me break this down logically. The core of the challenge is identifying 'successful' students based on their performance across various subjects.\n\nI see that I'm given the number of students (`n`) and subjects (`m`).  Each student's marks are provided as input, where a mark is an integer from 1 to 9. The crucial point is that a student is \"best\" in a subject if no other student has a higher mark in that subject.  A \"successful\" student then, is defined as one who excels in at least one subject.\n\nThe input format is straightforward:  the dimensions `n` and `m` on the first line, followed by the actual marks. I envision storing this data efficiently – likely a 2D list (or array) where `gradebook[i][j]` will represent the mark of student `i` in subject `j`.  It's important to remember to convert those character marks to integers for numerical comparison.\n\nMy plan for the algorithm unfolds naturally:\n\n1.  **Input Parsing:** I'll read `n` and `m` first. Then, read the gradebook input and populate my data structure, converting the characters to integers.\n2.  **Subject-wise Analysis:** I'll iterate through each subject. For each subject, I need to pinpoint the highest mark achieved. I'll then traverse the students for that subject and mark any student who achieves the highest mark as the \"best\" in that subject.\n3.  **Success Tracking:**  I'll use a boolean array, `is_successful`, to keep track of the successful students.  Initially all values will be `False`. If a student is identified as \"best\" in any subject, I'll update their corresponding entry in `is_successful` to `True`.\n4.  **Final Count:** After analyzing all subjects and all students, I'll simply iterate through `is_successful` and count the `True` values, which gives me the number of successful students.\n\nThis approach seems to strike a good balance between clarity and efficiency, given the constraints.  Now, to translate this into a Python script and put this theory into practice.\n",
