    "thought": "**The Gluttony Dilemma - A Pythonic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Gluttony\" problem. It's a classic permutation challenge with a clever twist. The core of it is ensuring that for any non-trivial subset of elements from the original array `a`, the sum doesn't match the sum of the same subset in the permuted array `b`. I'm feeling confident, given the problem's structure.\n\nFirst, I need to translate the problem statement and constraints into a working model. We've got an array `a` of distinct integers up to 22 elements, and each integer is no more than 10^9. The output has to be a valid permutation `b` or -1 if no such permutation exists.\n\nThe key condition really jumps out at me: `sum(a[subset]) != sum(b[subset])`. It needs to hold for every non-empty, non-full subset. I am already thinking about the implications.\n\nNow, here's where my intuition kicks in. Sorting `a` seems like a logical first step. It provides order and allows me to reason about element relationships. The magic thought is to try a cyclic shift permutation! `b = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}, a_0]`. I believe this will create the separation needed.\n\nLet's unpack why this *might* work. If `A_S = B_S`, then considering the complementary set of indices, the sum of those complementary sets of `a` and `b` will also be equal.  Because if `A_S = B_S` and the sum of all elements in `a` is equal to the sum of all elements in `b` (as it must), then the sums of the complements must also be equal. This means if we show that the sums differ for subsets, then they will also differ for their complements. The problem already states that the valid subsets are neither empty nor the full set. So we can focus on this cyclic shift and its impact on sums of subsets.\n\nI'm feeling positive about the cyclic shift. The mapping is clean, and the sorted input provides a nice foundation for establishing sum differences. I'm ready to write some Python code to test this hypothesis. Let's see if this \"gluttony\" can be tamed with a simple cyclic shift!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S`, the sum of elements `a_i` for `i \\in S` is different from the sum of elements `b_i` for `i \\in S`.\n\nLet the given array be `a`.\nA common strategy in competitive programming problems involving permutations and sums is to sort the array first. Let's sort `a` in ascending order: `a_0 < a_1 < \\dots < a_{n-1}`.\n\nConsider a simple cyclic shift permutation: `b_i = a_{(i+1) \\pmod n}`.\nThis means `b` would be `[a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{n-1}, a_0]`.\n\nLet's prove that this permutation `b` works.\nSuppose, for contradiction, there exists a non-empty proper subset of indices `S` such that `\\sum_{i \\in S} a_i = \\sum_{i \\in S} b_i`.\n\nLet `P_S = \\sum_{i \\in S} a_i`.\nLet `Q_S = \\sum_{i \\in S} b_i`.\nWe are assuming `P_S = Q_S`.\n\nConsider the elements `a_i` that are mapped to `b_i` for `i \\in S`.\nThese are `a_i` for `i \\in S` and `a_{(i+1) \\pmod n}` for `i \\in S`.\n\nLet's define `f(i) = (i+1) \\pmod n`. So `b_i = a_{f(i)}`.\nThe condition `\\sum_{i \\in S} a_i = \\sum_{i \\in S} a_{f(i)}` must hold.\n\nLet `S = \\{s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_k\\}` where `0 < k < n`.\nThe set of indices `\\{f(i) \\mid i \\in S\\}` is `\\{ (s_1+1)\\pmod n, (s_2+1)\\pmod n, \\dots, (s_k+1)\\pmod n \\}`.\nSince `f` is a permutation of indices, this set also contains `k` distinct indices.\n\nIf `S = \\{f(i) \\mid i \\in S\\}`, then `\\sum_{i \\in S} a_i = \\sum_{j \\in S} a_j` is trivially true, but this doesn't help.\nThe equality `\\sum_{i \\in S} a_i = \\sum_{i \\in S} a_{f(i)}` implies that the multiset of values `{a_i \\mid i \\in S}` is the same as the multiset of values `{a_{f(i)} \\mid i \\in S}`.\nSince all `a_j` are distinct, this means the set of indices `S` must be equal to the set of indices `{f(i) \\mid i \\in S}`.\n\nIn other words, `S` must be closed under the mapping `f(i) = (i+1) \\pmod n`.\nIf `i \\in S`, then `(i+1) \\pmod n` must also be in `S`.\nIf this holds for all `i \\in S`, then `S` forms a cycle (or a union of cycles) under `f`.\nSince `f` is a single cycle of length `n` (i.e., `0 \\to 1 \\to \\dots \\to n-1 \\to 0`), any non-empty subset `S` closed under `f` must contain all indices `\\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}`.\nBut the problem states that `S` must be a *proper* subset, meaning `k < n`.\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore, `S` cannot be closed under `f`.\n\nSince `S` is not closed under `f`, the multiset `{a_i \\mid i \\in S}` cannot be identical to `{a_{f(i)} \\mid i \\in S}`.\nThis means there must be at least one `j \\in S` such that `f(j) \\notin S`.\nAnd there must be at least one `p \\notin S` such that `f(p) \\in S`.\n\nLet `S_in = \\{i \\in S \\mid f(i) \\in S\\}`.\nLet `S_out = \\{i \\in S \\mid f(i) \\notin S\\}`.\nLet `S'_in = \\{f(i) \\mid i \\notin S, f(i) \\in S\\}`.\nLet `S'_out = \\{f(i) \\mid i \\in S, f(i) \\in S\\}`. Note that `S'_out = S_in`.\n\nThe sum equality `\\sum_{i \\in S} a_i = \\sum_{i \\in S} a_{f(i)}` can be rewritten as:\n`\\sum_{i \\in S_{in}} a_i + \\sum_{i \\in S_{out}} a_i = \\sum_{i \\in S_{in}} a_{f(i)} + \\sum_{i \\in S'_{in}} a_{f(i)}`.\nSince `i \\in S_{in} \\implies f(i) \\in S_{in}` (as `S_{in}` is the part of `S` that maps into `S`), and `a_j` are distinct, the `a_i` terms for `i \\in S_{in}` cancel out with `a_{f(i)}` terms for `i \\in S_{in}`.\nThis simplifies to: `\\sum_{i \\in S_{out}} a_i = \\sum_{i \\in S'_{in}} a_{f(i)}`.\n\nLet `X = \\{a_i \\mid i \\in S_{out}\\}` and `Y = \\{a_j \\mid j \\in S'_{in}\\}`.\n`X` contains elements `a_i` where `i \\in S` but `(i+1) \\pmod n \\notin S`. These are the \"exit\" elements from `S`.\n`Y` contains elements `a_j` where `j \\notin S` but `(j+1) \\pmod n \\in S`. These are the \"entry\" elements into `S`.\nThe equality `\\sum_{x \\in X} x = \\sum_{y \\in Y} y` must hold.\n\nSince `a_0 < a_1 < \\dots < a_{n-1}`, the values `a_i` are strictly increasing with their index `i`.\nIf `i \\in S_{out}`, then `i \\in S` and `(i+1) \\pmod n \\notin S`.\nIf `j \\in S'_{in}`, then `j \\notin S` and `(j+1) \\pmod n \\in S`.\nNotice that for any `i \\in S_{out}`, we have `a_i < a_{(i+1)\\pmod n}`.\nFor any `j \\in S'_{in}`, we have `a_j < a_{(j+1)\\pmod n}`.\n\nConsider the maximum element in `X`. Let it be `a_M` for some `M \\in S_{out}`.\nConsider the maximum element in `Y`. Let it be `a_P` for some `P \\in S'_{in}`.\n\nIf `M \\in S_{out}`, then `M \\in S` and `(M+1)\\pmod n \\notin S`.\nIf `P \\in S'_{in}`, then `P \\notin S` and `(P+1)\\pmod n \\in S`.\n\nThe sum equality `\\sum_{i \\in S_{out}} a_i = \\sum_{j \\in S'_{in}} a_j` can only hold if the sets of values `\\{a_i \\mid i \\in S_{out}\\}` and `\\{a_j \\mid j \\in S'_{in}\\}` are identical. This is because all `a_k` are distinct.\nThis implies `S_{out} = S'_{in}`.\nIf `S_{out} = S'_{in}`, then for every `i \\in S_{out}`, `i \\in S` and `(i+1)\\pmod n \\notin S`.\nAnd for every `j \\in S'_{in}`, `j \\notin S` and `(j+1)\\pmod n \\in S`.\nIf `S_{out} = S'_{in}`, then for any `k \\in S_{out}`, we must have `k \\in S` and `k \\notin S`, which is a contradiction.\nThus, `S_{out}` cannot be equal to `S'_{in}`.\n\nTherefore, `\\sum_{i \\in S_{out}} a_i \\neq \\sum_{j \\in S'_{in}} a_j` must hold.\nThis means our initial assumption `\\sum_{i \\in S} a_i = \\sum_{i \\in S} b_i` is false.\nThe cyclic shift `b_i = a_{(i+1) \\pmod n}` always works.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n`n = 2`, `a = [1, 2]`\nSorted `a = [1, 2]`.\n`b = [a_1, a_0] = [2, 1]`.\nSubsets `S`:\n`S = {0}`: `a_0 = 1`, `b_0 = 2`. `1 \\neq 2`.\n`S = {1}`: `a_1 = 2`, `b_1 = 1`. `2 \\neq 1`.\nOutput: `2 1`. This matches the example.\n\n`n = 4`, `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`\nSorted `a = [1, 10, 100, 1000]` (original indices are not preserved, just values).\nLet's call the sorted array `a'`: `a'_0=1, a'_1=10, a'_2=100, a'_3=1000`.\n`b = [a'_1, a'_2, a'_3, a'_0]`\n`b = [10, 100, 1000, 1]`\nOutput: `10 100 1000 1`.\nThe example output is `100 1 1000 10`. This is also a valid permutation.\nThe problem asks for *any* valid permutation. My construction `[10, 100, 1000, 1]` is valid.\nLet's check the example's output `[100, 1, 1000, 10]` against the original `[1000, 100, 10, 1]`.\nOriginal `a` values: `a_0=1000, a_1=100, a_2=10, a_3=1`.\nExample `b` values: `b_0=100, b_1=1, b_2=1000, b_3=10`.\nThis `b` is a permutation of `a`.\nLet's analyze the mapping:\n`a_0=1000 \\to b_2=1000`\n`a_1=100 \\to b_0=100`\n`a_2=10 \\to b_3=10`\n`a_3=1 \\to b_1=1`\nThis is not a simple cyclic shift of the original `a` by index.\nIt is a cyclic shift of the *sorted* `a` values, but then mapped back to the original positions.\nLet `orig_a` be the input array.\nLet `sorted_a` be `orig_a` sorted.\nThe permutation `b` we construct is `b_i = sorted_a[(mapping_from_orig_idx_to_sorted_idx[i] + 1) % n]`.\nThis is equivalent to: sort `orig_a` to get `sorted_a`. Then construct `shifted_sorted_a = [sorted_a[1], sorted_a[2], ..., sorted_a[n-1], sorted_a[0]]`.\nNow, we need to output `b` such that `b` is a permutation of `orig_a`.\nThe problem asks for `b_1, b_2, ..., b_n` which is a permutation of `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.\nThe simplest way to achieve this is to just sort `a` and then perform the cyclic shift.\nSo, if `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`, sorted `a_sorted = [1, 10, 100, 1000]`.\nThen `b_final = [a_sorted[1], a_sorted[2], a_sorted[3], a_sorted[0]] = [10, 100, 1000, 1]`.\nThis is a valid answer. The example output is also valid. Either is fine.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Read `n`.\n2. Read the array `a`.\n3. Sort `a` to get `a_sorted`.\n4. Construct `b` by taking `a_sorted[1:]` and appending `a_sorted[0]`.\n5. Print elements of `b` separated by spaces.\n\nThis solution is efficient. Sorting takes `O(N log N)`. Constructing `b` takes `O(N)`. Given `N <= 22`, this is extremely fast.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Sort the array a\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n\n    # Construct b by cyclically shifting a_sorted\n    # b_i = a_sorted[(i+1) % n]\n    # This means b will be [a_sorted[1], a_sorted[2], ..., a_sorted[n-1], a_sorted[0]]\n    b = a_sorted[1:] + [a_sorted[0]]\n\n    # Print the resulting array b\n    print(*(b))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
