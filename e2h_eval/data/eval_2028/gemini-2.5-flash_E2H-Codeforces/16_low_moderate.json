Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Crazy Town Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Crazy Town\" problem, and it's essentially a geometric puzzle disguised as a graph traversal. I need a Python script to figure out the shortest path, but here's the core of it:\n\nI'm given the coordinates of home (`x1`, `y1`) and the university (`x2`, `y2`), plus a bunch of lines representing roads, each defined by an equation `ai*x + bi*y + ci = 0`. The goal is to find the *minimum* number of road crossings needed to get from home to the university.\n\nMy first thought is to analyze the input. It's pretty straightforward: I'll get the home and university coordinates, the number of roads `n`, and then `n` lines, each with three coefficients (`ai`, `bi`, `ci`) defining a road's equation.\n\nThe crucial part is the movement rule: I can only move from one block to another if they share a *non-zero length* border. Basically, I have to cross a road to get to an adjacent block. If they only touch at a point, no step is possible.\n\nNow, the math behind it. Each road divides the plane into two regions, or half-planes.  The value of `ai*x + bi*y + ci` determines which side a point `(x, y)` lies on.  A positive value means one side, a negative value the other. If the value is zero, the point is on the line. Since the problem guarantees home and university aren't on any roads, this sign is always clear.\n\nThe key insight is this: two points are in the *same* block if and only if they are on the *same side* of *every* road. That means for each road, `ai*x1 + bi*y1 + ci` and `ai*x2 + bi*y2 + ci` have the same sign. If the signs differ, they're in different blocks.\n\nSo, the problem boils down to this: Count how many roads separate the home and university blocks. If they're in the same block (same signs for *all* roads), the answer is zero. Otherwise, the number of crossings equals the *number of roads* where the expressions for home and university have *opposite signs*. This is my shortest path.  I can solve this with some simple sign comparisons for each road. Let's get coding!\n",
