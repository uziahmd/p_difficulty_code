Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the \"Selling Souvenirs\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Selling Souvenirs\" problem, which feels a lot like a knapsack variation. Let's break down my thought process.\n\nFirst, I've got to understand the givens: `n` souvenirs, each with a weight (`wi`) and cost (`ci`), and a maximum weight capacity, `m`. The goal is pretty straightforward: maximize the total cost without exceeding `m`.\n\nStraightaway, I see the sizes. `n` can hit 100,000, and `m` is up to 300,000.  If I were to try a standard O(n*m) dynamic programming approach, that's way too many operations – it'd be incredibly slow.  So, I need to find some clever optimization.\n\nThen I spot the key! The weights, `wi`, are tiny: just 1, 2, or 3. This is the breakthrough. With these limited weights, I can group the souvenirs. I'll create three lists: `items1`, `items2`, and `items3`, containing the costs of the souvenirs with weights 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n\nThe next step? Since I want to maximize cost, I'll sort each of these lists in *descending* order of cost.  The most expensive items for each weight are always the best choices.\n\nNow, it's about choosing how many items from each group to include. I need to pick `k1` from `items1`, `k2` from `items2`, and `k3` from `items3`, so that `k1*1 + k2*2 + k3*3` doesn't go over `m`. And the sum of their costs has to be maximized.\n\nThis still feels like knapsack, but simplified because of those grouped items. I can see the potential for a dynamic programming approach, but I need to be smart about it given how large `n` can be, even with these groups. I think precomputing prefix sums will be essential here. I'll calculate `prefix_sum1`, `prefix_sum2`, and `prefix_sum3`, where each index holds the sum of the top *i* most expensive items from that list.\n\nNow, my idea is to fix `k3`, the number of weight-3 items to include, and iterate through all possible values of `k3`. For a given `k3`, I've got a current weight usage (`k3 * 3`) and cost (`prefix_sum3[k3]`).  The remaining weight capacity is then `m - k3 * 3`.\n\nWith that remaining capacity, I now need to solve this smaller sub-problem, which is still a kind of knapsack: how many weight-1 items (`k1`) and weight-2 items (`k2`) to select, with a remaining capacity `M_prime = m - k3 * 3`. I can iterate on the possible values of k2 as well, but first I need to think through a way to solve this sub-problem efficiently.\n",
