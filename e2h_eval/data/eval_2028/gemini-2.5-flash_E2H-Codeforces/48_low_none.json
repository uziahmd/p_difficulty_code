He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through Base Conversion in Python**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to handle base conversion, taking a number `c` in base `a` and converting it to base `b`.  The input is pretty straightforward: `a` and `b` on the first line, then `c` on the second.  `a` and `b` are integers between 2 and 25, or `b` can be 'R' for Roman numerals. The input `c` is a string representing a non-negative integer.\n\nThe constraints are important.  If `b` is 'R', the decimal equivalent of `c` can be up to 3000, and it won't be zero. Otherwise, the decimal equivalent can be up to 10^15. The string `c` can have a maximum length of 1000 characters.\n\nThe core of the problem involves three steps:\n\n1.  **Parsing from base `a` to decimal (base 10).** This is the first hurdle.  Since `c` is a string, and `a` can be larger than 10,  I'll need to handle digits '0'-'9' and letters 'A'-'O'. 'A' represents 10, 'B' is 11, and so on.\n\n    I can create a helper function `char_to_int(char)` to convert each character to its integer value.  For digits, it's just `int(char)`.  For letters, I'll use `ord(char) - ord('A') + 10`.\n\n    The core conversion to decimal can be done with an iterative approach. I have two options: processing from right to left or left to right. Accumulating from left to right would be better as it is more efficient to accumulate the decimal value without having to reverse the number string.  I'll go with a function `to_decimal_efficient(num_str, base_a)`. This is a pretty standard algorithm: iterate through each digit (character) in the number string, convert the character to its integer value using `char_to_int`, and use the formula `decimal_value = decimal_value * base_a + digit_value`.\n\n2.  **Converting the decimal number to base `b`.**  This should be straightforward. I'll need a way to repeatedly divide the decimal number by `b` and keep track of the remainders. The remainders, in reverse order, will be the digits in the new base. If the base is greater than 10, digits greater than 9 will need to be represented by letters.\n3.  **Handling the special case where `b` is 'R'.**  This is the Roman numeral conversion, which is pretty distinct from standard base conversion.  I'll likely need a separate function for this. I'll need to define how to represent the values 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000, and how to combine them appropriately. The constraint of the maximum of 3000 will be considered here.\n",
