Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Vanya and the Lanterns: Devising a Python Solution**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling the \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. The core of it seems to be finding the smallest radius `d` each lantern needs to illuminate a street of length `l`. I've got `n` lanterns positioned at various points `a_i` along the street. The real trick here is making sure that every point on the street, from 0 to `l`, gets illuminated.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem deeply. It's about minimal 'd'. I think sorting the lantern positions is key.\n\nHere's my thought process:\n\n*   **Understanding the setup:** Street length is `l`, lanterns are at positions `a_i`.  The lanterns light segments `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`. My goal is to find the *smallest* possible `d`.\n\n*   **Break it down:**  Reading the input `n`, `l`, and the positions `a_i` is step one. But the crucial idea is to sort the positions.  The order matters when calculating distances.\n\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** Consider the start and end of the street. If the first lantern is at `a[0]`, then `d` needs to be at least `a[0]` to cover the segment from 0 to `a[0]`. Similarly, if the last lantern is at `a[n-1]`, I need `d` to be at least `l - a[n-1]` to cover the remaining part of the street.\n\n*   **Gaps:** Now, think about the spaces *between* the lanterns. If I have two lanterns, say at `a[i]` and `a[i+1]`, I'll need `d` large enough to bridge that gap. A little bit of algebra shows that the smallest such `d` needs to be at least half the distance between the two lanterns: `(a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2`.  I must find the largest of these \"half-gaps\" between *all* adjacent pairs.\n\n*   **Combining Requirements:** The minimal `d` has to satisfy *all* of these constraints simultaneously. I have three constraints:\n    *   `d >= a[0]` (cover the start)\n    *   `d >= l - a[n-1]` (cover the end)\n    *   `d >= (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2` for every pair (bridge the gaps)\n\n    Therefore, my overall minimum `d` is the maximum value I get from checking all these conditions.\n\n*   **Implementation Steps:**  So, here's my plan to build this Python script:\n\n    1.  Read `n` and `l`.\n    2.  Read the lantern positions `a_i` and store them.\n    3.  Sort the list `a`.\n    4.  Initialize `max_d = 0.0`. I'll use a float for `d`.\n    5.  Check the \"left end\": `max_d = max(max_d, float(a[0]))`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum light radius `d` such that the entire street, from coordinate `0` to `l`, is illuminated. We are given `n` lanterns at specific coordinates `a_i`. Each lantern at `a_i` illuminates the segment `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`.\n\nTo solve this, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Sort Lantern Positions:** First, sort the lantern positions `a_i` in ascending order. This makes it easier to consider adjacent lanterns and the street's ends. Let the sorted positions be `a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Maximum Gap Between Adjacent Lanterns:**\n    The most challenging part of the street to light is often the largest gap between two consecutive lanterns. If two lanterns are at `a[i]` and `a[i+1]`, they must collectively cover the segment `[a[i], a[i+1]]`.\n    The first lantern covers up to `a[i] + d`. The second lantern covers from `a[i+1] - d`. For the gap to be fully covered, these two illuminated segments must meet or overlap: `a[i] + d >= a[i+1] - d`.\n    This simplifies to `2d >= a[i+1] - a[i]`, or `d >= (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2`.\n    We need to find the maximum value of `(a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2` across all adjacent pairs `i` from `0` to `n-2`. Let's call this `max_internal_d`.\n\n3.  **Check Coverage at the Street's Beginning:**\n    The street starts at `0`. The first lantern is at `a[0]`. To light the segment `[0, a[0]]`, the first lantern must extend its light to `0`. This means `a[0] - d <= 0`, or `d >= a[0]`. This is the minimum `d` required for the left boundary.\n\n4.  **Check Coverage at the Street's End:**\n    The street ends at `l`. The last lantern is at `a[n-1]`. To light the segment `[a[n-1], l]`, the last lantern must extend its light to `l`. This means `a[n-1] + d >= l`, or `d >= l - a[n-1]`. This is the minimum `d` required for the right boundary.\n\n5.  **Determine Overall Minimum `d`:**\n    The minimum light radius `d` must satisfy all these conditions simultaneously. Therefore, `d` must be the maximum of:\n    *   `max_internal_d` (the largest half-gap between lanterns)\n    *   `a[0]` (distance from `0` to the first lantern)\n    *   `l - a[n-1]` (distance from the last lantern to `l`)\n\n    `d = max(max_internal_d, a[0], l - a[n-1])`\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Second Sample):**\n`n = 2, l = 5`\n`a = [2, 5]`\n\n1.  **Sorted `a`:** `[2, 5]` (already sorted)\n2.  **Maximum Gap Between Adjacent Lanterns:**\n    Only one pair: `a[1] - a[0] = 5 - 2 = 3`.\n    `max_internal_d = 3 / 2 = 1.5`.\n3.  **Coverage at Street's Beginning:**\n    `a[0] = 2`. Required `d >= 2`.\n4.  **Coverage at Street's End:**\n    `l - a[n-1] = 5 - 5 = 0`. Required `d >= 0`.\n5.  **Overall Minimum `d`:**\n    `d = max(1.5, 2, 0) = 2.0`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    a.sort()\n\n    max_d_required = 0.0\n\n    # 1.
