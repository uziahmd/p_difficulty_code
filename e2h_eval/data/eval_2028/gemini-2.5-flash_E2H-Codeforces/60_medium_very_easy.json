Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Dynamic Programming**\n\nMy initial thought is to tackle this as a dynamic programming problem. The core idea is that we're dealing with a string `S` that grows incrementally, and for each state, we need to count the number of valid sequences. I see potential in using a `dp` array, where `dp[i]` represents something related to decoding the substring starting at index `i`.\n\nInitially, I consider using a standard decoding `dp[i]` which would signify the number of ways to decode the substring `S[i:]`. However, the problem statement focuses on finding \"some substring,\" implying substrings of varying lengths.\n\nSo, I rephrase the approach using `dp[i]` as the total number of ways to decode the prefix `S[0:i]`. While this isn't exactly what the prompt requires directly, it's a helpful starting point, as it represents counting valid sequences that *end* at index `i`.\n\nI recognize the need to sum across various substrings, so I modify my thought process, considering an overall `dp[k]` that encompasses everything. Then, I try to devise a system where `f[k]` would signify the number of non-empty sequences that include the substring starting from index `k`.\n\nHowever, the problem wants *distinct* sequences of letters. This necessitates a change in strategy. The standard DP approach could lead to redundant counting. We have to consider duplicates and find a way to avoid counting the same sequence multiple times.\n\n**Distinct Sequence Counting and Hash-Based Approach**\n\nI shift my perspective to counting *distinct* sequences and explore different options. Storing these distinct substrings and sequences in a set data structure seems appropriate. This means that after decoding the substring, I will insert the result into a set. Still, this strategy could require storing and processing huge sets during each stage.\n\nI think about polynomial hashing, a technique that may let me map distinct sequences to distinct hash values, which could avoid using too much memory. To make this work, I would employ two different hash functions to reduce collision.\n\nIn this approach, I maintain `dp_hashes[k]` as a set of hash values that represent distinct sequences decodable from `S[k:]`. As the string grows with each append operation, `dp_hashes[k]` would be updated.\n\n**Refinement and Implementation**\n\nThe key to an efficient solution seems to lie in the right combination of hashing and incremental calculation to find the final number of valid sequences. The total answer would be the size of the union of all `dp_hashes[k]` sets from `0` to `N-1`, less the empty sequence.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate, after each character is appended to string `S`, the total number of *distinct* non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding *any substring* of `S`. The length of `S` can grow up to `m = 3000`.\n\nLet's first clarify the Morse code rules:\n1.  A dot is '0', a dash is '1'.\n2.  Morse codes for English letters have lengths 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n3.  There are 26 such valid codes. The four invalid codes are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". All other binary strings of length 1-4 correspond to distinct English letters.\n\nThe core challenge is counting *distinct* sequences. A naive approach of storing actual string sequences in a set would be too slow and memory-intensive, as sequences can be long and numerous. A standard technique for counting distinct strings/sequences is to use polynomial hashing. We'll use two hash functions to minimize collision probability.\n\nLet `S` be the current string of length `N`.\nWe are interested in all substrings `S[i:j]` (where `0 <= i < j <= N`). For each such substring, we want to find all possible non-empty sequences of English letters it can represent, and then count the total number of unique sequences across all substrings.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be a set of hash pairs `(h1, h2)`. Each hash pair represents a distinct sequence of English letters that can be formed by decoding the suffix `S[k:]`.\nThe base case is `dp[N] = { (0, 0) }`, representing the hash of an empty sequence.\nWe iterate `k` from `N-1` down to `0`. For each `k`:\n`dp[k]` is initialized as an empty set.\nFor `L` from 1 to 4 (representing possible Morse code lengths):\n  If `k+L <= N`:\n    Let `code = S[k:k+L]`.\n    If `code` is a valid Morse code (i.e., not one of \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"):\n      Let `letter_val` be a unique integer assigned to this `code` (e.g., 1 to 26).\n      For each hash pair `(h1_suffix, h2_suffix)` in `dp[k+L]`:\n        `new_h1 = (letter_val * P1 + h1_suffix) % M1`\n        `new_h2 = (letter_val * P2 + h2_suffix) % M2`\n        `dp[k].add((new_h1, new_h2))`\n\nAfter computing all `dp[k]` for `k = 0 ... N`, the total set of distinct sequences is the union of all `dp[k]` for `k = 0 ... N-1`. We then subtract 1 from the size of this union to exclude the empty sequence (represented by `(0,0)`).\n\n**Optimization for space and time:**\nThe number of sequences can still be large, potentially leading to `dp[k]` sets with many elements. `N` is up to 3000.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences that can be formed from `S[k:]` is `Fibonacci(N-k+1)`. For `N=3000`, this is too large.\n\nThe key observation is that `m` (the number of append operations) is up to 3000. When a new character is appended, `S` grows by one. Let the new character be `c`. The string becomes `S' = S + c`.\nWe need to calculate the answer for `S'`.\nThe new substrings are those ending at the new last position `N`. These are `S'[i:N]` for `i = 0 ... N-1`.\nThe `dp` values for `S[0:N-1]` are already computed. We need to compute `dp[N-1]` for `S'[N-1:]` and add its sequences to the total set.\nThis means we only need to compute `dp[N-1]` for the *new* string `S'` (which is `S` from previous step, plus the new char `c`).\nThe `dp` array should be conceptualized as `dp[k]` being the set of sequences from `S[k:]`.\n\nLet `current_S` be the string being built.\nLet `all_hashes` be a `set` to store all distinct hash pairs encountered so far.\nWhen a new character `char` is appended:\n  `current_S.append(char)`\n  Let `N = len(current_S)`.\n  We need to compute `dp[N-1]` (for `current_S[N-1:]`).\n  `dp[N-1]` will be a set of hash pairs.\n  We also need `dp[N]` (for `current_S[N:]`, which is empty string). `dp[N] = { (0,0) }`.\n  To compute `dp[N-1]`:\n    `dp_current_index = set()`\n    For `L` from 1 to 4:\n      If `N-1+L <= N`: (i.e., `L=1`)\n        `code = current_S[N-1:N-1+L]`\n        If `code` is valid:\n          `letter_val = get_letter_value(code)`\n          For `(h1_suffix, h2_suffix)` in `dp[N-1+L]`: (which is `dp[N]`)\n            `new_h1 = (letter_val * P1 + h1_suffix) % M1`\n            `new_h2 = (letter_val * P2 + h2_suffix) % M2`\n            `dp_current_index.add((new_h1, new_h2))`\n    `dp_values[N-1] = dp_current_index` (store this for future calculations)\n    `all_hashes.update(dp_values[N-1])`\n\nThis is still incorrect. The problem is that `dp[k]` depends on `dp[k+L]`. When `S` grows, `S[k:]` changes for all `k`.\nThis means we need to recompute all `dp[k]` from `N-1` down to `0` every time.\nNo, that's not right. When `S` becomes `S + c`, the old substrings `S[i:j]` are still there. The new substrings are those ending at the new last position.\nLet `S_prev` be the string before appending `c`. Let `N_prev = len(S_prev)`.\nLet `S_curr = S_prev + c`. Let `N_curr = N_prev + 1`.\nThe set of all distinct sequences for `S_curr` is `Union(all_sequences_from_S_prev, all_sequences_from_substrings_ending_at_N_curr-1)`.\nLet `dp[k]` be the set of sequences that can be formed by decoding `S_curr[k:]`.\nWe need to calculate `dp[k]` for `k` from `N_curr-1` down to `0`.\n`dp[N_curr] = {(0,0)}`.\nFor `k = N_curr-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp[k] = set()`\n  For `L` from 1 to 4:\n    If `k+L <= N_curr` and `S_curr[k:k+L]` is a valid code:\n      `letter_val = get_letter_value(S_curr[k:k+L])`\n      For `(h1, h2)` in `dp[k+L]`:\n        `new_h1 = (letter_val * P1 + h1) % M1`\n        `new_h2 = (letter_val * P2 + h2) % M2`\n        `dp[k].add((new_h1, new_h2))`\n  `all_hashes.update(dp[k])`\nFinally, `len(all_hashes) - 1` is the answer.\n\nThis approach requires recomputing `dp` from scratch for each append.\nFor each append: `N` iterations (from `N-1` down to `0`). Each iteration involves 4 checks. Each check involves iterating over elements in `dp[k+L]`.\nThe size of `dp[k]` can be up to `Fibonacci(N-k+1)`. Total elements in `all_hashes` can be `N * Fibonacci(N)`. This is too slow.\n\nThe constraint `m <= 3000` strongly suggests something like `O(m^2)` or `O(m^2 log m)`.\nIf `dp[k]` stores the set of hashes for `S[k:]`, then when `S` grows to `S+c`, all `dp[k]` for `k < N` are still valid for `S[k:]` (as `S[k:]` is unchanged).\nWe only need to compute `dp[N]` for the new string `S'` (where `N` is the new length).\nLet `S_str` be the actual string.\nLet `dp_sets[k]` store the set of hashes for `S_str[k:]`.\nLet `all_distinct_sequences` be a global set of all unique hashes.\nWhen `c` is appended to `S_str`:\n  `S_str.append(c)`\n  `N = len(S_str)`\n  `dp_sets[N] = { (0,0) }` (empty string)\n  `current_idx_dp = set()`\n  For `L` from 1 to 4:\n    If `N-L >= 0`:\n      `code = S_str[N-L:N]`\n      If `code` is valid:\n        `letter_val = get_letter_value(code)`\n        For `(h1, h2)` in `dp_sets[N]`: (this is `dp_sets[N]` from previous step, or `dp_sets[N-L+L]`)\n          `new_h1 = (letter_val * P1 + h1) % M1`\n          `new_h2 = (letter_val * P2 + h2) % M2`\n          `current_idx_dp.add((new_h1, new_h2))`\n  `dp_sets[N] = current_idx_dp`\n  `all_distinct_sequences.update(current_idx_dp)`\n\nThis is still wrong. `dp_sets[N]` is the set for the empty string.\nThe `dp[k]` should be computed for `S_str[k:]`.\nWhen `S_str` grows to `S_str + c`:\nThe string length becomes `N`.\nWe need to calculate `dp_sets[N-1]` (for `S_str[N-1:]`). This depends on `dp_sets[N]`.\nWe need to calculate `dp_sets[N-2]` (for `S_str[N-2:]`). This depends on `dp_sets[N-1]` and `dp_sets[N]`.\n...\nWe need to calculate `dp_sets[N-4]` (for `S_str[N-4:]`). This depends on `dp_sets[N-3]` to `dp_sets[N]`.\nAnd so on, up to `dp_sets[0]`.\n\nThe key insight for this problem is that we only need to compute `dp[i]` for `i` *close to* the end of the string.\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S`, forming `S' = S + c`:\nThe new substrings are of the form `S'[i:N']` where `N'` is the new length.\nFor each `i` from `0` to `N'-1`, we want to find all sequences of letters that decode `S'[i:N']`.\nLet `current_dp[i]` be the set of hashes for `S'[i:N']`.\n`current_dp[N'] = {(0,0)}`.\nFor `i` from `N'-1` down to `max(0, N'-4)`:\n  `current_dp[i] = set()`\n  For `L` from 1 to 4:\n    If `i+L <= N'` and `S'[i:i+L]` is a valid code:\n      `letter_val = get_letter_value(S'[i:i+L])`\n      For `(h1, h2)` in `current_dp[i+L]`:\n        `new_h1 = (letter_val * P1 + h1) % M1`\n        `new_h2 = (letter_val * P2 + h2) % M2`\n        `current_dp[i].add((new_h1, h2))`\n  `global_all_hashes.update(current_dp[i])`\n\nWait, the `current_dp[i]` calculation for `S'[i:N']` is exactly what I had before.\nThe problem statement: \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with *some substring* of S\".\nThis means for *every* substring `S[i:j]`, we find its decodings.\nLet `dp[k]` be the set of hashes of sequences that can be formed by decoding `S[k:]`.\nThis `dp[k]` is the set of hashes for `S[k:N]`.\nWhen `S` grows to `S+c`:\nThe string becomes `S'`. New length `N'`.\nThe `dp[k]` values for `k < N'` need to be recomputed because `S[k:]` now means `S'[k:N']`.\nThis is `O(N)` states, each state is a set of hashes.\nThe size of each set `dp[k]` can be up to `Fib(N-k+1)`. Total elements in `dp[k]` can be `O(Fib(N))`.\nThis is definitely too slow.\n\nThe example output `7` for `S=\"111\"` is exactly `g[0]` in my initial incorrect DP, which counted ways to decode the *entire* string `S`.\nIf the problem meant \"number of distinct sequences that can be formed by decoding the *entire string* `S`\", then the problem is easier.\nLet `dp_hashes[k]` be the set of distinct sequences that can decode `S[k:]`.\n`dp_hashes[N] = { (0,0) }` (empty string, 1 way, empty sequence).\nFor `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp_hashes[k] = set()`\n  For `L` from 1 to 4:\n    If `k+L <= N` and `S[k:k+L]` is a valid Morse code `C`:\n      Let `letter_val = get_letter_value(C)`.\n      For each `(h1, h2)` in `dp_hashes[k+L]`:\n        `new_h1 = (letter_val * P1 + h1) % M1`\n        `new_h2 = (letter_val * P2 + h2) % M2`\n        `dp_hashes[k].add((new_h1, new_h2))`\nThe answer for `S` would then be `len(dp_hashes[0]) - 1` (subtract 1 for empty sequence).\nFor `S=\"111\"`:\n`dp_hashes[3] = {(0,0)}`\n`dp_hashes[2]` (for \"1\"): `letter_val(\"1\")`\n  `new_h1 = (val_1 * P1 + 0) % M1`, `new_h2 = (val_1 * P2 + 0) % M2`.\n  `dp_hashes[2] = {(h1_1, h2_1)}`.\n`dp_hashes[1]` (for \"11\"):\n  `S[1:2] = \"1\"`: `(val_1 * P1 + h1_1) % M1`, `(val_1 * P2 + h2_1) % M2` -> `(h1_11, h2_11)`\n  `S[1:3] = \"11\"`: `letter_val(\"11\")`\n    `new_h1 = (val_11 * P1 + 0) % M1`, `new_h2 = (val_11 * P2 + 0) % M2` -> `(h1_M, h2_M)`\n  `dp_hashes[1] = {(h1_11, h2_11), (h1_M, h2_M)}`.

The example is listing \"TTT\" as a sequence from \"111\".\nMy `g[0]` logic is:\n`S[0:1]` (T) followed by decodings of `S[1:]` (T, TT, M) gives `T, TT, TTT, TM`. (4 sequences)\n`S[0:2]` (M) followed by decodings of `S[2:]` (T) gives `M, MT`. (2 sequences)\n`S[0:3]` (O) followed by decodings of `S[3:]` (empty) gives `O`. (1 sequence)\nTotal `4+2+1 = 7`. This matches the example!\n\nSo the problem is asking for the total number of *distinct* non-empty sequences that can be formed by decoding *any suffix* `S[i:]` of the string `S`.\nThis means we need to compute `dp_hashes[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `N-1`, and then take the union of all these sets.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1.

Add the newly computed `dp_sets[N-1]` to `global_all_hashes`.\n    e.  The answer is `len(global_all_hashes) - 1` (subtract 1 for empty sequence). Print it.\n\nThis is still not right! `dp_sets[N-1]` depends on `dp_sets[N]`.\n`dp_sets[N-2]` depends on `dp_sets[N-1]` and `dp_sets[N]`.\nThis means when `S` grows, `S[k:]` changes its length, so its `dp_sets[k]` changes.\nThe `dp_sets` array needs to be `dp_sets[k]` for `S_str[k:current_N]`.\nWhen `S_str` grows from `current_N-1` to `current_N` by appending `c`:\n`S_str` has length `current_N`.\nWe need to calculate `dp_sets[current_N-1]` (for `S_str[current_N-1 : current_N]`). This depends on `dp_sets[current_N]` (for `S_str[current_N : current_N]`).\n`dp_sets[current_N-2]` (for `S_str[current_N-2 : current_N]`). This depends on `dp_sets[current_N-1]` and `dp_sets[current_N]`.\n...\n`dp_sets[0]` (for `S_str[0 : current_N]`). This depends on `dp_sets[1]` to `dp_sets[4]`.\n\nSo for each append operation, we iterate `i` from `N-1` down to `0`.\nFor each `i`, we calculate `dp_sets[i]`.\n`dp_sets[i] = set()`\nFor `L` from 1 to 4:\n  If `i+L <= N` and `S_str[i:i+L]` is a valid code:\n    `letter_val = code_to_int[S_str[i:i+L]]`\n    For `(h1, h2)` in `dp_sets[i+L]`:\n      `new_h1 = (letter_val * P1 + h1) % M1`\n      `new_h2 = (letter_val * P2 + h2) % M2`\n      `dp_sets[i].add((new_h1, new_h2))`\n`global_all_hashes.update(dp_sets[i])`\n\nThis is `O(N)` iterations per append. Each iteration involves 4 checks. Each check involves iterating over `dp_sets[i+L]`.\nThe size of `dp_sets[i]` can be up to `Fib(N-i+1)`.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences for `S[i:]` is bounded. For length `L`, it's `Fib(L+1)`.\n`Fib(4) = 5`, `Fib(5) = 8`.\nThe max length of a substring that affects `dp_sets[i]` is 4.\nSo `dp_sets[i]` depends on `dp_sets[i+1], dp_sets[i+2], dp_sets[i+3], dp_sets[i+4]`.\nThe maximum size of any `dp_sets[k]` is `Fib(4+1) = Fib(5) = 8` if `N-k >= 4`.\nIf `N-k < 4`, the size is smaller. E.g., `dp_sets[N-1]` has `Fib(1+1)=1` element (for `S[N-1:N]`). `dp_sets[N-2]` has `Fib(2+1)=2` elements.\nThe maximum size of `dp_sets[k]` is small (at most 8 elements).\nSo for each `i`, the inner loop `for (h1,h2) in dp_sets[i+L]` runs at most 8 times.\nTotal complexity per append: `N * 4 * 8 = 32N`.\nTotal complexity for `m` appends: `sum_{N=1 to m} 32N = 32 * m * (m+1) / 2 = O(m^2)`.\n`m = 3000`, `m^2 = 9 * 10^6`. `32 * 9 * 10^6` is about `3 * 10^8`. This might be acceptable.\nA `set.update()` operation can be `O(k)` where `k` is the size of the set being updated. `global_all_hashes` can grow large, so `set.update` might be slow.\nThe `global_all_hashes` can contain up to `m * Fib(5) = 3000 * 8 = 24000` elements.\nA set of 24000 tuples, each update takes `O(8)` on average.\nThe `global_all_hashes.update(dp_sets[i])` is `O(size of dp_sets[i])`.\nSo, total complexity is `O(m^2 * max_dp_set_size)`.\n`3000^2 * 8 = 7.2 * 10^7`. This should be fine.\n\nLet's refine the `dp_sets` array.\n`dp_sets` should be an array of sets, `dp_sets[j]` stores hash pairs for `S_str[j:]`. Its size is `N+1`.\n`S_str` is a list of characters.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n    # Precompute valid Morse codes and their integer values\n    invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    code_to_int = {}\n    val = 1\n    for length in range(1, 5):\n        for i in range(2**length):\n            code_str = bin(i)[2:].zfill(length)\n            if code_str not in invalid_codes:\n                code_to_int[code_str] = val\n                val += 1\n    \n    # Polynomial hashing parameters\n    P1 = 31  # Prime base 1\n    M1 = 10**9 + 7 # Modulo 1\n    P2 = 37  # Prime base 2\n    M2 = 10**9 + 9 # Modulo 2\n\n    # S_str will store the current Morse code string\n    S_str = []\n\n    # dp_sets[k] will store a set of (h1, h2) tuples representing\n    # distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by decoding S_str[k:]\n    # The maximum length of S_str is m, so dp_sets needs to go up to m+1\n    dp_sets = [set() for _ in range(m + 1)]\n\n    # Base case: S_str[N:] (empty string) can be decoded into an empty sequence.\n    # Hash for empty sequence is (0,0).\n    # We initialize dp_sets[m] to represent the empty suffix for the maximum possible length.\n    # When N < m, dp_sets[N] will be used for the empty suffix S_str[N:].\n    dp_sets[m] = {(0, 0)}\n\n    # global_all_hashes stores all distinct (h1, h2) tuples found across all S_str[k:] suffixes\n    global_all_hashes = set()\n\n    results = []\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        char = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        S_str.append(char)\n        N = len(S_str)\n\n        # For the current string S_str of length N, the empty suffix is S_str[N:]\n        # So dp_sets[N] should be initialized for the empty suffix.\n        dp_sets[N] = {(0, 0)}\n\n        # We need to compute dp_sets[i] for i from N-1 down to 0.\n        # However, we only need to compute dp_sets[i] for i from N-1 down to max(0, N-4)\n        # because any S_str[i:] for i < N-4 would have been computed in previous steps\n        # and their values don't change relative to the suffix length.\n        # But this is not true.
