    "thought": "**The \"Gluttony\" Problem: A Python Solution**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling the \"Gluttony\" problem, which is giving me a bit of a workout. The gist is, I've got this array of distinct integers, and I need to re-arrange them – create a permutation, really – so that the sums of all the possible subsets are different between the original array and the re-arranged one. The catch? The subsets can't be empty, and they can't be the entire set.\n\nThe `n <= 22` constraint screams exponential time complexity to me. I'm thinking bitmasking or meet-in-the-middle might be useful here, but that \"proper subset\" restriction is a tricky nuance. I started by rephrasing the condition: find a permutation where, for every possible subset of *indices*, the sums of the elements at those positions are unequal in the original and permuted arrays.\n\nThe problem description calls it \"easy,\" which usually hints at a neat construction or clever trick. I tried some examples with small array sizes. For `n=1`, anything works, since there are no valid subsets to compare. For `n=2`, I realized I could just reverse the order of the numbers, and it'd satisfy the conditions. But `n=3` got complex pretty fast.\n\nI decided to sort the input array. That's usually a good starting point for these permutation puzzles. Then, a thought struck me: what if I create a cyclic shift?  If I take the sorted array and move each element to the next position (wrapping around), would that work? I tested this for `n=2` and `n=3`, and it seemed to hold up.\n\nMy intuition says this cyclic shift should work generally. Let's say `b_i = a[(i+1) % n]`. I need to prove that, for any proper subset `S`, the sum of elements in `S` is different in the original and the cyclically shifted array.\n\nI started trying to formalize this using sums and differences, defining `d_i = a_i - a_{(i+1) % n}`. Then, the problem becomes showing that the sum of these `d_i` for a given subset `S` is never zero. I noticed that, because the original array is sorted and distinct, the `d_i` values are almost all negative, except for the last one.\n\nI went through a case analysis. If a subset `S` doesn't include the last element (where `d` is positive), then all the `d` values in the sum are negative, and the sum can't be zero. If the subset *does* include the last element, the sum contains both positive and negative values. I couldn't immediately prove that this sum *cannot* be zero.\n\nSo I tried a new strategy: sorting. I realized the input array needs to be sorted. Now, I create a list of pairs (value, original index) to maintain the original positions. After sorting by value, I rearrange the elements according to the cyclic shift as proposed before. I tested with an example. I still have to prove that this sorting plus a cyclic shift will *always* result in a valid permutation, but it *seems* to be holding.\n\nOkay, so I need to go back and formalize the proof for the cyclic shift. The key is to show the cyclic permutation of the *sorted* numbers does indeed result in unique subset sums. I’ll express the sums using sorted indices and the differences between consecutive sorted elements. By doing so, I should be able to prove that the sum is always nonzero. I think this approach might finally be the key!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` such that for any proper non-empty subset of indices `S`, the sum of elements `a_i` for `i` in `S` is different from the sum of elements `b_i` for `i` in `S`. The size `n` of the array `a` is small (`1 <= n <= 22`).\n\nLet's denote the original array as `A`.\nThe problem states that `b` must be a permutation of `A`.\nThe condition is `sum_{i \\in S} A_i \\neq sum_{i \\in S} B_i` for `0 < |S| < n`.\nThis can be rewritten as `sum_{i \\in S} (A_i - B_i) \\neq 0`.\n\nConsider a simple construction:\n1. Pair each element `A_j` with its original index `j`. Let these pairs be `(A_j, j)`.\n2. Sort these pairs based on the `A_j` values in ascending order. Let the sorted pairs be `(s_0, p_0), (s_1, p_1), ..., (s_{n-1}, p_{n-1})`. Here, `s_k` is the `k`-th smallest value from `A`, and `p_k` is its original index in `A`. Since all `A_j` are distinct, we have `s_0 < s_1 < ... < s_{n-1}`.\n3. Construct the array `B` of size `n`. For each `k` from `0` to `n-1`, we want to place `s_{(k+1)%n}` at the original position `p_k`. That is, `B[p_k] = s_{(k+1)%n}`.\n\nLet's verify this construction.\nThe array `B` constructed this way is indeed a permutation of `A`, because `s_0, s_1, ..., s_{n-1}` are just the elements of `A` in sorted order, and each `s_k` is mapped to exactly one position `p_{(k-1+n)%n}` in `B`.\n\nNow, let `S` be any proper non-empty subset of indices. We need to show `sum_{j \\in S} (A_j - B_j) \\neq 0`.\nLet's define `S_k` as the set of indices `k` such that `p_k \\in S`. In other words, `S_k` contains the ranks (0 to n-1) of the elements of `A` whose original indices are in `S`.\nThen `sum_{j \\in S} A_j = sum_{k \\in S_k} s_k`.\nAnd `sum_{j \\in S} B_j = sum_{k \\in S_k} s_{(k+1)%n}`.\nSo we need to show `sum_{k \\in S_k} (s_k - s_{(k+1)%n}) \\neq 0`.\n\nLet `d_k = s_k - s_{(k+1)%n}`.\nSince `s_0 < s_1 < ... < s_{n-1}`:\n- For `k = 0, 1, ..., n-2`, `s_k < s_{k+1}`, so `d_k = s_k - s_{k+1} < 0`.\n- For `k = n-1`, `d_{n-1} = s_{n-1} - s_0 > 0`.\n\nWe are interested in `sum_{k \\in S_k} d_k`.\nSince `S` is a proper non-empty subset of original indices, `S_k` is also a proper non-empty subset of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`.\n\nCase 1: `n-1 \\notin S_k`.\nIn this case, all `k \\in S_k` satisfy `k < n-1`. Therefore, all `d_k` for `k \\in S_k` are negative.\nSince `s_k` are distinct, `d_k` are strictly negative.\nThus, `sum_{k \\in S_k} d_k` is a sum of strictly negative numbers, which must be strictly negative. Hence, `sum_{k \\in S_k} d_k \\neq 0`.\n\nCase 2: `n-1 \\in S_k`.\nIn this case, `d_{n-1}` is part of the sum. `d_{n-1} = s_{n-1} - s_0 > 0`.\nLet `X = S_k \\setminus \\{n-1\\}`.\nThe sum is `d_{n-1} + sum_{k \\in X} d_k`.\nAll `d_k` for `k \\in X` are negative (or `X` is empty).\nSuppose the sum is zero: `s_{n-1} - s_0 + sum_{k \\in X} (s_k - s_{k+1}) = 0`.\nThis implies `s_{n-1} - s_0 = - sum_{k \\in X} (s_k - s_{k+1}) = sum_{k \\in X} (s_{k+1} - s_k)`.\nSince `s_k < s_{k+1}`, `s_{k+1} - s_k > 0`.\nSo `s_{n-1} - s_0 = sum_{k \\in X} (s_{k+1} - s_k)`.\nThe set `X` is a subset of `{0, ..., n-2}`.\nThe sum `sum_{k \\in X} (s_{k+1} - s_k)` represents the sum of \"gaps\" between consecutive sorted elements `s_k` and `s_{k+1}` for `k \\in X`.\nThe total gap from `s_0` to `s_{n-1}` is `s_{n-1} - s_0 = (s_1 - s_0) + (s_2 - s_1) + ... + (s_{n-1} - s_{n-2}) = sum_{k=0}^{n-2} (s_{k+1} - s_k)`.\nSo if `sum_{k \\in S_k} d_k = 0`, it means `sum_{k=0}^{n-2} (s_{k+1} - s_k) = sum_{k \\in X} (s_{k+1} - s_k)`.\nSince all terms `(s_{k+1} - s_k)` are strictly positive, this equality can only hold if `X` contains all indices from `0` to `n-2`.\nThat is, `X = {0, 1, ..., n-2}`.\nIf `X = {0, 1, ..., n-2}` and `n-1 \\in S_k`, then `S_k = X \\cup \\{n-1\\} = \\{0, 1, ..., n-1\\}`.\nBut `S_k` must be a proper non-empty subset of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`. This means `S_k` cannot be the full set.\nTherefore, it's impossible for `sum_{k \\in S_k} d_k` to be zero.\n\nBoth cases show that `sum_{k \\in S_k} d_k \\neq 0`.\nThus, `sum_{j \\in S} A_j \\neq sum_{j \\in S} B_j` for any proper non-empty subset `S`.\nThis construction is valid.\n\nExample trace: `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`, `n=4`\n1. Pairs `(value, original_index)`: `[(1000, 0), (100, 1), (10, 2), (1, 3)]`\n2. Sorted pairs: `sorted_items = [(1, 3), (10, 2), (100, 1), (1000, 0)]`\n   `s_0=1, p_0=3`\n   `s_1=10, p_1=2`\n   `s_2=100, p_2=1`\n   `s_3=1000, p_3=0`\n3. Construct `B` array:\n   `B = [0, 0, 0, 0]` (initialized)\n   For `k=0`: `B[p_0] = s_{(0+1)%4} = s_1 = 10`. So `B[3] = 10`.\n   For `k=1`: `B[p_1] = s_{(1+1)%4} = s_2 = 100`. So `B[2] = 100`.\n   For `k=2`: `B[p_2] = s_{(2+1)%4} = s_3 = 1000`. So `B[1] = 1000`.\n   For `k=3`: `B[p_3] = s_{(3+1)%4} = s_0 = 1`. So `B[0] = 1`.\nResulting `B = [1, 1000, 100, 10]`.\nThis is a valid answer, even though it differs from the example output `[100, 1, 1000, 10]`. The problem allows any valid answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Step 1: Pair elements with their original indices\n    # items = [(value, original_index)]\n    items = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        items.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Step 2: Sort these pairs based on their values\n    # This gives us (s_k, p_k) where s_k is the k-th smallest value\n    # and p_k is its original index.\n    sorted_items = sorted(items)\n\n    # Step 3: Construct the result array b\n    # b_result will store the permutation\n    b_result = [0] * n\n\n    # For each element s_k (which was originally at p_k),\n    # assign it the value s_{(k+1)%n} in the b_result array at position p_k.\n    for k in range(n):\n        original_value_sk = sorted_items[k][0] # s_k\n        original_index_pk = sorted_items[k][1] # p_k\n\n        # The value to be placed at original_index_pk is s_{(k+1)%n}\n        next_value_sk_plus_1 = sorted_items[(k + 1) % n][0]\n\n        b_result[original_index_pk] = next_value_sk_plus_1\n\n    # Print the resulting array b\n    print(*(b_result))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
