After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the \"Marks\" Problem and Crafting a Python Solution**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Marks\" problem, and here's my thought process.  I need a Python script to solve it.  Essentially, we have `n` students and `m` subjects, and each student gets a mark from 1 to 9 in each subject.  The key is defining what makes a student \"successful.\" A student is successful if they are the best in *at least one* subject. \"Best\" means their mark is the highest for that *specific* subject.\n\nThe input is straightforward: `n` and `m` on the first line, followed by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters representing the marks.  The output will be a single integer: the count of successful students. The constraint of `1 <= n, m <= 100` keeps things manageable.\n\nI went through the example they gave, and that really solidified my understanding.  Let's deconstruct that example. First, find the maximum mark in each subject. Then, identify which students achieved that maximum mark for that subject.  If a student is the best in *any* subject, they're marked as successful.  Finally, count the successful students. Simple.\n\nNow, let's sketch out the algorithm in a more detailed fashion:\n\n1.  **Input:**  Read `n` and `m`.\n2.  **Gradebook:**  Store the marks in a 2D array or a list of lists. I can convert the characters to integers as I read them.  `gradebook[student_idx][subject_idx]` will be perfect.\n3.  **Success Tracker:** I'll initialize a set (or a boolean array) called `successful_students` to keep track of the successful students. A set is ideal, as it handles duplicates if a student is best in multiple subjects.\n4.  **Subject Iteration:** Loop through each subject (column) `j` from `0` to `m-1`.\n    *   **Max Finding:**  For each subject, find the maximum mark across all students.\n    *   **Best Student Identification:**  Iterate through each student `i` from `0` to `n-1`. If their mark `gradebook[i][j]` equals the maximum mark for that subject, add that student's index to the `successful_students` set.\n5.  **Final Count:** The length of the `successful_students` set will be the answer.\n\nI think the data structures I chose are spot on for efficiency. The nested loops look like the most straightforward way to process the data.  Now, I'll put this into Python code and see how it performs. Let's start with reading the input.\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngradebook = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    row = input()\n    gradebook.append([int(char) for char in row])\n```\nNow I'm ready to write the core logic.\n",
