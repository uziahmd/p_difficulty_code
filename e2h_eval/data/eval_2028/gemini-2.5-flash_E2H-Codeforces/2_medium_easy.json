Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this problem. I need to write a Python script to determine if a given `n x n` grid of characters forms an \"X\" shape, and it has to follow these rules:**\n\n*   **Diagonals**: All characters on both diagonals must be the same.\n*   **Non-diagonals**: All characters *not* on the diagonals must be the same.\n*   **Difference**: The character on the diagonals must be different from the character not on the diagonals.\n\nThe input `n` will be an odd number between 3 and 299.\n\nHere's how I'm going to approach it:\n\n1.  **Read Input:** First, I'll read the value of `n` (the grid size) from the input. Then, I'll read the grid itself: `n` lines, each containing `n` characters. I'll probably store this as a list of strings or a list of lists of characters.\n\n2.  **Define Diagonals:** I need to identify which cells are on the diagonals. A cell `(i, j)` is on the main diagonal if `i == j`, and it's on the anti-diagonal if `i + j == n - 1`. Since `n` is odd, the center cell will be on *both* diagonals (which is fine, it just counts as a diagonal cell).\n\n3.  **Check Rules Efficiently:** I'll initialize a flag, `is_x`, to `True` (assuming it's an \"X\" until proven otherwise). I'll also initialize `diag_char` and `other_char` to `None`. Then, I'll iterate through each cell of the grid.  For each cell:\n    *   **Diagonal Cell:** If the cell is on a diagonal, I'll check its character against `diag_char`. If `diag_char` hasn't been set yet, I'll set it to the current cell's character. If it *has* been set and the current character is different, I'll set `is_x` to `False` and break out of the loop immediately.\n    *   **Non-Diagonal Cell:** If the cell is not on a diagonal, I'll do the same process, but with `other_char`.\n\n4.  **Final Check:** After the loop, if `is_x` is still `True`, I need to make one last check: are `diag_char` and `other_char` different? If they're the same, I set `is_x` to `False` because the third rule is violated.\n\n5.  **Output:** Finally, I'll print \"YES\" if `is_x` is `True`, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n**Refinement:** I decided to refine the iteration to stop as soon as a rule is violated. I used `break` statements to exit the inner and outer loops as soon as a cell violates a rule.\n\n**Input and output handling:** For the actual code, I am using `sys.stdin.readline()` and `sys.stdout.write()` for potentially faster I/O operations.\n\n**Edge Cases:** I considered the edge case where `n=3` and all characters in the grid are the same.  The code correctly handles this case by returning \"NO\" (because the diagonal and non-diagonal characters *must* be different).\n\n**Final Check:** The logic seems sound and efficient. The nested loops run `n*n` times, so even with `n=299`, the code will run very fast. I've also checked the I/O methods. I tested it and all the results match the examples. I'm confident in this approach.\n",
