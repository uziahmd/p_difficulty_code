            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Converting Numbers Between Bases: My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this base conversion problem. The core of it is taking a number `c` in base `a` and spitting it out in base `b`.  The input is given to me in a specific format: the bases `a` and `b` on the first line, then the number `c` as a string on the second line. `a` and `b` are integers between 2 and 25, or `b` can be 'R' for Roman numerals. I've got constraints to keep in mind, too; the decimal equivalent of `c` can't be too huge depending on the base `b` is specified.\n\nMy plan is broken down into three logical steps. First, I need to parse the input to extract `a`, `b`, and the number `c` as a string.  This is pretty straightforward; I'll split the input string and convert the base values to integers (unless I get an 'R').  \n\nNext, I need to convert `c` from base `a` to its base-10 (decimal) equivalent. I can see this can be done by iterating through the string, converting each character to its integer value (using a helper function to handle letters like 'A' and 'Z'), and accumulating the decimal value.  The approach with multiplying and adding in the loop seems much more efficient and less prone to overflow issues than calculating powers separately. I need to make sure I am handling character values correctly, making sure the helper function takes care of the digit conversion, and accounts for 'A'-'Z' as 10-35.\n\nFinally, the output stage: I have to convert that decimal value to base `b`. This part could be a standard base conversion if b is an int. If `b` is 'R', I need to implement a Roman numeral conversion, which is a different beast entirely. The constraint on the size of the decimal value seems reasonable in this case, and Python's arbitrary-precision integers mean I don't need to worry about integer overflows, which is nice. This seems like a reasonable approach.\n",
