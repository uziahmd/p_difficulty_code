He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Prefix/Suffix Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem. They want me to figure out which of these strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some hidden string, $s$, of length $n$.  I'm given $2n-2$ strings, which are essentially all the *improper* prefixes and suffixes – those from length $1$ up to $n-1$. For each length, I know there's exactly one prefix and one suffix.\n\nLet's break down the notation real quick.  If $s$ is $s_1s_2...s_n$, the prefixes are $P_k = s_1s_2...s_k$, and the suffixes are $S_k = s_{n-k+1}...s_n$. The problem cleverly hides that the string $s$ is built from these prefixes and suffixes.\n\nThe real key here is focusing on the strings of length $n-1$. There are just two of them! Let's call them $str_A$ and $str_B$. Now, there are only two possibilities:\n\n*   **Case 1:** $str_A$ is the prefix of length $n-1$, which would be $P_{n-1}$, and $str_B$ is the suffix of length $n-1$, $S_{n-1}$. This means $s$ would be $str_A$ appended with the last character of $str_B$. To determine this case, I'd need to check if $str_A[1:]$ (everything in $str_A$ except the first character) is equal to $str_B[:n-2]$ (everything in $str_B$ except the last character). If that's true, I can build a candidate string, which I'll call $s_1$.\n\n*   **Case 2:** $str_B$ is the prefix, and $str_A$ is the suffix. I can basically flip the logic from Case 1 to verify and construct string $s$ in this manner.\n\nSo, the strategy seems to be identifying those two strings of length $n-1$, checking the necessary condition, and then constructing a potential solution. I'll need to figure out how to compare the remaining strings to confirm my guess. Seems doable.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify $2n-2$ given strings as either prefixes ('P') or suffixes ('S') of an unknown string $s$ of length $n$. We are guaranteed that for each length $k$ from $1$ to $n-1$, there are exactly two strings of length $k$ in the input: one is the prefix of length $k$, and the other is the suffix of length $k$.\n\nLet the unknown string be $s = s_1s_2...s_n$.\nThe prefixes are $P_k = s_1...s_k$ for $k=1, \\dots, n-1$.\nThe suffixes are $S_k = s_{n-k+1}...s_n$ for $k=1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nThe crucial observation involves the two strings of length $n-1$. Let these be $str_A$ and $str_B$.\nOne of them must be $P_{n-1} = s_1...s_{n-1}$ and the other must be $S_{n-1} = s_2...s_n$.\n\nThere are two possibilities for assigning $str_A$ and $str_B$:\n\n**Possibility 1: $str_A$ is $P_{n-1}$ and $str_B$ is $S_{n-1}$.**\nIf $P_{n-1} = s_1...s_{n-1} = str_A$ and $S_{n-1} = s_2...s_n = str_B$.\nThen the string $s$ must be $str_A$ followed by the last character of $str_B$.\nSo, $s = str_A + str_B[n-2]$. (Using 0-based indexing for strings)\nFor this to be consistent, the substring $s_2...s_{n-1}$ must be identical.\nThis means $str_A[1:]$ (the suffix of $str_A$ of length $n-2$) must be equal to $str_B[:n-2]$ (the prefix of $str_B$ of length $n-2$).\nIf this condition holds, we have a candidate string $s_1 = str_A + str_B[n-2]$.\n\n**Possibility 2: $str_B$ is $P_{n-1}$ and $str_A$ is $S_{n-1}$.**\nIf $P_{n-1} = s_1...s_{n-1} = str_B$ and $S_{n-1} = s_2...s_n = str_A$.\nThen the string $s$ must be $str_B$ followed by the last character of $str_A$.\nSo, $s = str_B + str_A[n-2]$.\nFor this to be consistent, $str_B[1:]$ must be equal to $str_A[:n-2]$.\nIf this condition holds, we have a candidate string $s_2 = str_B + str_A[n-2]$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that a consistent string exists. This means at least one of these two possibilities will yield a valid string $s$. We can pick either one.\n\nLet's outline the algorithm:\n1. Read $n$.\n2. Read all $2n-2$ strings and store them, perhaps along with their original indices to reconstruct the output string.\n3. Separate the strings by length. For length $n-1$, there will be two strings. Let's call them $str_A$ and $str_B$.\n4. **Try Candidate 1:**\n   a. Check if $str_A[1:] == str_B[:n-2]$.\n   b. If true, form $s_{cand} = str_A + str_B[n-2]$.\n   c. Verify if $s_{cand}$ generates the given set of prefixes and suffixes. To do this:\n      i. Generate all prefixes of $s_{cand}$ of lengths $1$ to $n-1$.\n      ii. Generate all suffixes of $s_{cand}$ of lengths $1$ to $n-1$.\n      iii. Put all $2n-2$ generated strings into a multiset (or frequency map).\n      iv. Put all $2n-2$ input strings into another multiset.\n      v. If the two multisets are identical, then $s_{cand}$ is a valid string. We can use this assignment.\n5. **If Candidate 1 failed (or we want to try Candidate 2 anyway):**\n   a. Check if $str_B[1:] == str_A[:n-2]$.\n   b. If true, form $s_{cand} = str_B + str_A[n-2]$.\n   c. Verify this $s_{cand}$ as in step 4c. This one must work if the first one didn't.\n\nOnce a valid $s_{cand}$ is found, we determine the 'P'/'S' assignment:\nIterate through the original input strings. For each input string $x$ at index $i$:\n- If $x$ is a prefix of $s_{cand}$ (i.e., $s_{cand}.startswith(x)$) AND $x$ is not a suffix of $s_{cand}$ (or if it is, we prefer prefix for this specific $x$ if it's the first time we see it), mark it as 'P'.\n- Otherwise, mark it as 'S'.\n\nA simpler approach for the 'P'/'S' assignment:\nAfter finding a valid $s_{cand}$, we know what all prefixes and suffixes *should* be.\nLet `found_prefixes` be a multiset of all prefixes of $s_{cand}$ of lengths $1$ to $n-1$.\nLet `found_suffixes` be a multiset of all suffixes of $s_{cand}$ of lengths $1$ to $n-1$.\n\nIterate through the original input strings in their given order. For each string `inp_str` at index `i`:\n- If `inp_str` is in `found_prefixes` (and we haven't used it up yet for a prefix), assign 'P' to `ans[i]` and remove one instance of `inp_str` from `found_prefixes`.\n- Else (it must be a suffix), assign 'S' to `ans[i]` and remove one instance of `inp_str` from `found_suffixes`.\nSince there are exactly two strings of each length, and we've identified one of them as a prefix and the other as a suffix, this greedy assignment works. The first time we encounter a string of a certain length, if it matches the prefix for that length, we assign 'P'. Otherwise, it must be the suffix. This ensures that for each length, one 'P' and one 'S' are assigned.\n\nExample Walkthrough (First example: n=5, \"ababa\")\nInput strings (with original indices):\n0: ba (len 2)\n1: a (len 1)\n2: abab (len 4)\n3: a (len 1)\n4: aba (len 3)\n5: baba (len 4)\n6: ab (len 2)\n7: aba (len 3)\n\nStrings of length $n-1=4$: `abab` (index 2) and `baba` (index 5).\nLet $str_A = \\text{`abab`}$, $str_B = \\text{`baba`}$.\n\n**Try Candidate 1:** $P_{n-1} = str_A$, $S_{n-1} = str_B$.\nCondition: $str_A[1:] == str_B[:n-2]$\n`abab`[1:] = `bab`\n`baba`[:3] = `bab`\nCondition holds!\n$s_{cand} = str_A + str_B[n-2] = \\text{`abab`} + \\text{`baba`}[3] = \\text{`abab`} + \\text{`a`} = \\text{`ababa`}$.\n\nVerify `ababa`:\nPrefixes: `a`, `ab`, `aba`, `abab`\nSuffixes: `a`, `ba`, `aba`, `baba`\n\nMultiset of generated strings: {`a`:2, `ab`:1, `aba`:2, `abab`:1, `ba`:1, `baba`:1}\nMultiset of input strings: {`a`:2, `ab`:1, `aba`:2, `abab`:1, `ba`:1, `baba`:1}\nThey match! So `ababa` is a valid string.\n\nNow assign 'P'/'S':\nInitialize `ans_chars = [''] * (2*n-2)`\n`prefix_counts = Counter({'a':1, 'ab':1, 'aba':1, 'abab':1})`\n`suffix_counts = Counter({'a':1, 'ba':1, 'aba':1, 'baba':1})`\n\nIterate through input strings:\n- 0: `ba` (len 2). Is `ba` in `prefix_counts`? No. Is `ba` in `suffix_counts`? Yes. `ans_chars[0] = 'S'`. `suffix_counts['ba'] -= 1`.\n- 1: `a` (len 1). Is `a` in `prefix_counts`? Yes. `ans_chars[1] = 'P'`. `prefix_counts['a'] -= 1`.\n- 2: `abab` (len 4). Is `abab` in `prefix_counts`? Yes. `ans_chars[2] = 'P'`. `prefix_counts['abab'] -= 1`.\n- 3: `a` (len 1). Is `a` in `prefix_counts`? No (count is 0). Is `a` in `suffix_counts`? Yes. `ans_chars[3] = 'S'`. `suffix_counts['a'] -= 1`.\n- 4: `aba` (len 3). Is `aba` in `prefix_counts`? Yes. `ans_chars[4] = 'P'`. `prefix_counts['aba'] -= 1`.\n- 5: `baba` (len 4). Is `baba` in `prefix_counts`? No. Is `baba` in `suffix_counts`? Yes. `ans_chars[5] = 'S'`. `suffix_counts['baba'] -= 1`.\n- 6: `ab` (len 2). Is `ab` in `prefix_counts`? Yes. `ans_chars[6] = 'P'`. `prefix_counts['ab'] -= 1`.\n- 7: `aba` (len 3). Is `aba` in `prefix_counts`? No. Is `aba` in `suffix_counts`? Yes. `ans_chars[7] = 'S'`. `suffix_counts['aba'] -= 1`.\n\nResult: `S P P S P S P S`. This matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    input_strings = []\n    # Store strings along with their original indices\n    for i in range(2 * n - 2):\n        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        input_strings.append((s, i))\n    \n    # Group strings by length\n    strings_by_length = {}\n    for s, idx in input_strings:\n        length = len(s)\n        if length not in strings_by_length:\n            strings_by_length[length] = []\n        strings_by_length[length].append((s, idx))\n            \n    # The two strings of length n-1 are crucial\n    str_n_minus_1_a, idx_a = strings_by_length[n-1][0]\n    str_n_minus_1_b, idx_b = strings_by_length[n-1][1]\n    \n    candidate_s = \"\"\n    is_candidate_a_prefix = False # True if str_n_minus_1_a is P_{n-1}, False if str_n_minus_1_b is P_{n-1}\n\n    # Try Possibility 1: str_n_minus_1_a is P_{n-1}, str_n_minus_1_b is S_{n-1}\n    # s = P_{n-1} + S_{n-1}[-1]\n    # Condition: P_{n-1}[1:] == S_{n-1}[:-1]\n    if str_n_minus_1_a[1:] == str_n_minus_1_b[:-1]:\n        temp_s = str_n_minus_1_a + str_n_minus_1_b[-1]\n        \n        # Verify if temp_s generates the given set of prefixes and suffixes\n        generated_strings = []\n        for k in range(1, n):\n            generated_strings.append(temp_s[:k]) # prefix\n            generated_strings.append(temp_s[n-k:]) # suffix\n        \n        # Compare multisets\n        input_str_values = [s for s, _ in input_strings]\n        if Counter(generated_strings) == Counter(input_str_values):\n            candidate_s = temp_s\n            is_candidate_a_prefix = True\n    \n    # If Possibility 1 didn't yield a valid string, try Possibility 2\n    # Possibility 2: str_n_minus_1_b is P_{n-1}, str_n_minus_1_a is S_{n-1}\n    # s = P_{n-1} + S_{n-1}[-1]\n    # Condition: P_{n-1}[1:] == S_{n-1}[:-1]\n    if not candidate_s: # Only try if a valid candidate wasn't found yet\n        if str_n_minus_1_b[1:] == str_n_minus_1_a[:-1]:\n            temp_s = str_n_minus_1_b + str_n_minus_1_a[-1]\n            \n            # Verify if temp_s generates the given set of prefixes and suffixes\n            generated_strings = []\n            for k in range(1, n):\n                generated_strings.append(temp_s[:k]) # prefix\n                generated_strings.append(temp_s[n-k:]) # suffix\n            \n            # Compare multisets\n            input_str_values = [s for s, _ in input_strings]\n            if Counter(generated_strings) == Counter(input_str_values):\n                candidate_s = temp_s\n                is_candidate_a_prefix = False # str_n_minus_1_b is P_{n-1} in this case\n    \n    # Now that we have a valid candidate_s, assign 'P' or 'S'\n    ans_chars = [''] * (2 * n - 2)\n    \n    # Generate the actual prefixes and suffixes from candidate_s\n    actual_prefixes = Counter()\n    actual_suffixes = Counter()\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        actual_prefixes[candidate_s[:k]] += 1\n        actual_suffixes[candidate_s[n-k:]] += 1\n        \n    for s_val, original_idx in input_strings:\n        if actual_prefixes[s_val] > 0:\n            ans_chars[original_idx] = 'P'\n            actual_prefixes[s_val] -= 1\n        elif actual_suffixes[s_val] > 0:\n            ans_chars[original_idx] = 'S'\n            actual_suffixes[s_val] -= 1\n        # It's guaranteed that each string will be either a prefix or a suffix (or both, but we prefer prefix first)\n        # This logic ensures that for each length, one P and one S is assigned.\n\n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(ans_chars) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
