    "thought": "**Triangle Counting with Constraints**\n\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out an efficient way to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, and `z`, given some constraints on the ranges of these sides.  I'm given that `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, and I need to find the number of triples `(x, y, z)` that satisfy these constraints *and* form a valid triangle.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the triangle inequality.  For a triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.  So, I have `x + y > z`, `x + z > y`, and `y + z > x`.  But, since `x <= y <= z`, the last two inequalities are always true! I can see that because, since x is the smallest side and z is the largest, `x + z > y` and `y + z > x` are inherently satisfied. The condition that remains, then, is `x + y > z`.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about how to actually count these triangles.  A triple nested loop iterating over `x`, `y`, and `z` would be O(B*C*D), which is far too slow given the maximum value of `D` is `5 * 10^5`. I need something better.\n\nThe clever approach seems to be iterating over `x` and `y` and then calculating a valid range for `z`.  For fixed `x` and `y`, `z` must be within the range `[C, D]` from the initial constraints, and must also satisfy `z < x + y`. Therefore,  `z` can range from `C` up to `min(D, x + y - 1)`.\n\nLet's say `x` and `y` are chosen. So, `z` lies in the range `[C, min(D, x + y - 1)]`.  I can calculate how many valid `z` values there are by subtracting the lower bound from the upper bound and adding 1, making sure the result is at least 0. I can represent it as `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nSo, the algorithm involves two nested loops for `x` and `y`, with an inner calculation for `z`. I start by iterating `x` from `A` to `B` and then `y` from `B` to `C`. Inside, I calculate the bounds for `z`, and add the number of valid `z` values (that's `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`) to a running total. This should give me the correct count of non-degenerate triangles within the specified constraints. This method should be a lot faster than the brute-force method! The implementation should look something like:\n\n```python\ntotal_triangles = 0\nfor x in range(A, B + 1):\n    for y in range(B, C + 1):\n        # Calculate bounds for z\n        lower_z_bound = C\n        upper_z_bound = min(D, x + y - 1)\n        count_z = max(0, upper_z_bound - lower_z_bound + 1)\n        total_triangles += count_z\n```\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, `z` such that `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D` holds.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the conditions for a non-degenerate triangle:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, we know that `x <= y <= z`.\nWith `x <= y <= z`, the conditions `x + z > y` and `y + z > x` are automatically satisfied:\n- `x + z > y` is true because `z >= y` and `x >= A >= 1`. Thus, `x + z >= y + x > y`.\n- `y + z > x` is true because `y >= x` and `z >= C >= B >= A >= 1`. Thus, `y + z >= x + z > x`.\n\nTherefore, the only condition we need to check for a non-degenerate triangle is `x + y > z`.\n\nSo, we need to count integer triples `(x, y, z)` satisfying:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z` (which is equivalent to `z < x + y`)\n\nWe can iterate over possible values of `x` and `y`, and for each pair `(x, y)`, count the number of valid `z` values.\n\nFor fixed `x` and `y`:\n- `z` must satisfy `C <= z <= D` (from the problem constraints).\n- `z` must satisfy `z < x + y` (from the triangle inequality).\n\nCombining these, `z` must be in the range `[C, min(D, x + y - 1)]`.\nThe number of valid `z` values for a given `(x, y)` pair is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nA naive approach would be to use nested loops for `x` and `y`:\n```python\ntotal_triangles = 0\nfor x in range(A, B + 1):\n    for y in range(B, C + 1):\n        lower_z_bound = C\n        upper_z_bound = min(D, x + y - 1)\n        count_z = max(0, upper_z_bound - lower_z_bound + 1)\n        total_triangles += count_z\n```\nThe maximum value for `D` is `5 * 10^5`. In the worst case, `A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5`, this would lead to `5e5 * 5e5` iterations, which is `2.5 * 10^11`, too slow.\n\nWe need a more efficient way to sum `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)` over all valid `x` and `y`.\nLet `s = x + y`. The term `x + y - 1` can be written as `s - 1`.\nThe number of `z` values is `max(0, min(D, s - 1) - C + 1)`.\nThis expression for `count_z` depends only on `s = x + y`.\nLet `f(s) = max(0, min(D, s - 1) - C + 1)`.\nWe need to calculate `sum_{x=A to B} sum_{y=B to C} f(x + y)`.\n\nThe minimum possible value for `s = x + y` is `A + B`.\nThe maximum possible value for `s = x + y` is `B + C`.\nSo `s` ranges from `A + B` to `B + C`.\n\nFor each possible sum `s` in this range, we need to find how many pairs `(x, y)` exist such that `x + y = s` and `A <= x <= B` and `B <= y <= C`.\nLet `count_pairs[s]` be the number of such pairs `(x, y)`.\nThen the total count of triangles is `sum_{s=A+B to B+C} count_pairs[s] * f(s)`.\n\nTo calculate `count_pairs[s]`:\nGiven `x + y = s`, we have `y = s - x`.\nSubstituting `y` into its constraints: `B <= s - x <= C`.\nThis gives `s - C <= x <= s - B`.\nCombining with `A <= x <= B`, we need `x` to satisfy:\n`max(A, s - C) <= x <= min(B, s - B)`.\nThe number of such `x` values is `max(0, min(B, s - B) - max(A, s - C) + 1)`.\n\nWe can precompute `count_pairs[s]` for all relevant `s`.\nThe maximum value for `s` is `B + C`, which can be up to `5 * 10^5 + 5 * 10^5 = 10^6`.\nIterating `s` from `A+B` to `B+C` (at most `5 * 10^5` values) and calculating `count_pairs[s]` for each, then multiplying by `f(s)` and summing, will be efficient enough.\n\nLet's refine `f(s)`:\n`f(s) = max(0, min(D, s - 1) - C + 1)`\nThis function `f(s)` can be split into cases:\n- If `s - 1 < C`: `min(D, s - 1)` is `s - 1`. `f(s) = max(0, (s - 1) - C + 1) = max(0, s - C)`. If `s - C <= 0`, `f(s)=0`. This happens when `s <= C`.\n- If `C <= s - 1 <= D`: `min(D, s - 1)` is `s - 1`. `f(s) = (s - 1) - C + 1 = s - C`. This happens when `C+1 <= s <= D+1`.\n- If `s - 1 > D`: `min(D, s - 1)` is `D`. `f(s) = D - C + 1`. This happens when `s > D+1`.\n\nSo, `f(s)`:\n- `0` if `s <= C`\n- `s - C` if `C < s <= D + 1`\n- `D - C + 1` if `s > D + 1`\n\nWe can compute the prefix sums of `count_pairs` to quickly sum `count_pairs[s]` over ranges.\nLet `P[k] = sum_{s=0 to k} count_pairs[s]`.\nLet `PS[k] = sum_{s=0 to k} s * count_pairs[s]`.\n\nThe total sum is:\n`sum_{s=C+1 to D+1} (s - C) * count_pairs[s] + sum_{s=D+2 to B+C} (D - C + 1) * count_pairs[s]`\n`= sum_{s=C+1 to D+1} s * count_pairs[s] - C * sum_{s=C+1 to D+1} count_pairs[s]`\n`+ (D - C + 1) * sum_{s=D+2 to B+C} count_pairs[s]`\n\nUsing prefix sums:\n`sum_{s=C+1 to D+1} s * count_pairs[s] = PS[D+1] - PS[C]`\n`sum_{s=C+1 to D+1} count_pairs[s] = P[D+1] - P[C]`\n`sum_{s=D+2 to B+C} count_pairs[s] = P[B+C] - P[D+1]`\n\nSo the total sum is:\n`(PS[D+1] - PS[C]) - C * (P[D+1] - P[C]) + (D - C + 1) * (P[B+C] - P[D+1])`\n\nThe maximum value for `B+C` is `5e5 + 5e5 = 10^6`.\nWe can use an array `count_pairs` of size `10^6 + 1`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize `count_pairs` array of size `B + C + 1` to all zeros.\n2. Iterate `x` from `A` to `B`.\n3. For each `x`, iterate `y` from `B` to `C`.\n4. Increment `count_pairs[x + y]`.\n   This is still `O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1))` which is `O(B*C)` in worst case.\n   The maximum `B*C` is `5e5 * 5e5 = 2.5e11`, this is too slow.\n\nThe `count_pairs` calculation needs to be optimized.\n`count_pairs[s]` is the number of `x` such that `max(A, s - C) <= x <= min(B, s - B)`.\nLet `L_x(s) = max(A, s - C)` and `R_x(s) = min(B, s - B)`.\n`count_pairs[s] = max(0, R_x(s) - L_x(s) + 1)`.\n\nNotice that `L_x(s)` and `R_x(s)` are piecewise linear functions of `s`.\n`R_x(s)` is `B` for `s <= B+B` and `s-B` for `s > B+B`.\n`L_x(s)` is `A` for `s <= A+C` and `s-C` for `s > A+C`.\nThe function `count_pairs[s]` is also piecewise linear.\nWe can compute `count_pairs[s]` directly for `s` from `A+B` to `B+C`.\nThis loop will run `(B+C) - (A+B) + 1 = C - A + 1` times.\nIn the worst case, `A=1, C=5e5`, so `5e5` iterations. This is feasible.\n\nDetailed steps for calculating `count_pairs[s]` and then the total sum:\n1. Read `A, B, C, D`.\n2. Initialize `count_pairs = [0] * (B + C + 1)`.\n3. Iterate `s` from `A + B` to `B + C`:\n   Calculate `L_x = max(A, s - C)`.\n   Calculate `R_x = min(B, s - B)`.\n   `count_pairs[s] = max(0, R_x - L_x + 1)`.\n   This step takes `O(C-A)` time. Max `5e5` operations.\n\n4. Initialize `P = [0] * (B + C + 1)` and `PS = [0] * (B + C + 1)`.\n5. Populate `P` and `PS` arrays:\n   `P[0] = 0`, `PS[0] = 0`.\n   For `s` from `1` to `B + C`:\n     `P[s] = P[s-1] + count_pairs[s]`\n     `PS[s] = PS[s-1] + s * count_pairs[s]`\n   This step takes `O(B+C)` time. Max `10^6` operations.\n\n6. Calculate the total sum using the formula:\n   `total_triangles = (PS[min(D + 1, B+C)] - PS[min(C, B+C)]) \\\n                   - C * (P[min(D + 1, B+C)] - P[min(C, B+C)]) \\\n                   + (D - C + 1) * (P[B+C] - P[min(D + 1, B+C)])`\n   Note: The upper bounds for `s` in the sums should not exceed `B+C`.\n   The `min(X, B+C)` ensures we don't go out of bounds for `P` and `PS` arrays and only sum up to the maximum possible `s`.\n   Also, `f(s)=0` for `s <= C`. So the first range starts from `C+1`.\n   The second range starts from `D+2`.\n   The `min(D+1, B+C)` and `min(C, B+C)` are important for correctness.\n   If `D+1 < C+1`, then the first sum `sum_{s=C+1 to D+1}` is empty, contributing 0. This is handled by `PS[min(D+1, B+C)] - PS[min(C, B+C)]` correctly.\n   For example, if `D+1 <= C`, then `min(D+1, B+C) <= min(C, B+C)`, so `P[min(D+1, B+C)] - P[min(C, B+C)]` would be 0 or negative.\n   We need to be careful with the indices. Let's define the ranges properly:\n   `s` runs from `A+B` to `B+C`.\n   The sum `sum_{s=A+B to B+C} f(s) * count_pairs[s]`\n   Cases for `f(s)`:\n   - `s <= C`: `f(s) = 0`\n   - `C < s <= D + 1`: `f(s) = s - C`\n   - `s > D + 1`: `f(s) = D - C + 1`\n\n   So, we need to sum `f(s) * count_pairs[s]` for `s` from `max(A+B, C+1)` to `B+C`.\n   The sum can be split into two parts:\n   Part 1: `s` from `max(A+B, C+1)` to `min(B+C, D+1)`\n     Contribution: `sum (s - C) * count_pairs[s]`\n   Part 2: `s` from `max(A+B, D+2)` to `B+C`\n     Contribution: `sum (D - C + 1) * count_pairs[s]`\n\n   Let `start_s = A + B`.\n   Let `end_s = B + C`.\n\n   `term1_start = max(start_s, C + 1)`\n   `term1_end = min(end_s, D + 1)`\n   `sum1 = 0`\n   `if term1_start <= term1_end:`\n     `sum1 = (PS[term1_end] - PS[term1_start - 1]) - C * (P[term1_end] - P[term1_start - 1])`\n\n   `term2_start = max(start_s, D + 2)`\n   `term2_end = end_s`\n   `sum2 = 0`\n   `if term2_start <= term2_end:`\n     `sum2 = (D - C + 1) * (P[term2_end] - P[term2_start - 1])`\n\n   `total_triangles = sum1 + sum2`\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of `O(C-A + B+C)` which is `O(max(C, B))` and a space complexity of `O(B+C)`.\nGiven `D <= 5 * 10^5`, `B+C` can be up to `10^6`. This is efficient enough.\n\nExample 1: `A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4`\n`start_s = A+B = 1+2 = 3`\n`end_s = B+C = 2+3 = 5`\n`count_pairs` array size `5+1 = 6`.\n\n`s=3`: `L_x = max(1, 3-3) = max(1,0) = 1`. `R_x = min(2, 3-2) = min(2,1) = 1`. `x=1`. `y=2`. `(1,2)`. `count_pairs[3] = 1`.\n`s=4`: `L_x = max(1, 4-3) = max(1,1) = 1`. `R_x = min(2, 4-2) = min(2,2) = 2`. `x=1,2`. `y=3,2`. `(1,3), (2,2)`. `count_pairs[4] = 2`.\n`s=5`: `L_x = max(1, 5-3) = max(1,2) = 2`. `R_x = min(2, 5-2) = min(2,3) = 2`. `x=2`. `y=3`. `(2,3)`. `count_pairs[5] = 1`.\n\n`count_pairs = [0,0,0,1,2,1]` (indices 0 to 5)\n\n`P` and `PS` arrays:\n`s` | `count_pairs[s]` | `P[s]` | `PS[s]`\n--|------------------|--------|--------\n0 | 0                | 0      | 0\n1 | 0                | 0      | 0\n2 | 0                | 0      | 0\n3 | 1                | 1      | 3\n4 | 2                | 3      | 3 + 4*2 = 11\n5 | 1                | 4      | 11 + 5*1 = 16\n\n`C=3, D=4`.\n`term1_start = max(3, 3+1) = max(3,4) = 4`\n`term1_end = min(5, 4+1) = min(5,5) = 5`\n`sum1 = (PS[5] - PS[3]) - C * (P[5] - P[3])`\n`     = (16 - 3) - 3 * (4 - 1)`\n`     = 13 - 3 * 3 = 13 - 9 = 4`\n\n`term2_start = max(3, 4+2) = max(3,6) = 6`\n`term2_end = 5`\nSince `term2_start > term2_end`, `sum2 = 0`.\n\n`total_triangles = 4 + 0 = 4`. This matches the example output.\n\nFinal check on edge cases for `P` and `PS` array indexing:\n`PS[term1_start - 1]` means `PS[3]` if `term1_start = 4`. This is correct.\nIf `term1_start = 0`, then `PS[-1]` would be an issue. But `start_s = A+B >= 1+1 = 2`. And `C+1 >= 1+1 = 2`. So `term1_start` will always be at least 2. `term1_start - 1` will be at least 1. So `PS[idx]` is always valid.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    max_s_val = B + C\n    \n    # Step 1: Calculate count_pairs[s] for s = x + y\n    # count_pairs[s] stores the number of (x, y) pairs such that A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, and x + y = s\n    count_pairs = [0] * (max_s_val + 1)\n\n    # s = x + y\n    # A <= x <= B\n    # B <= y <= C  =>  B <= s - x <= C  =>  s - C <= x <= s - B\n    # So, x must satisfy max(A, s - C) <= x <= min(B, s - B)\n    \n    for s in range(A + B, max_s_val + 1):\n        lower_x = max(A, s - C)\n        upper_x = min(B, s - B)\n        \n        if lower_x <= upper_x:\n            count_pairs[s] = upper_x - lower_x + 1\n        # else count_pairs[s] remains 0\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate prefix sums P[k] = sum_{s=0 to k} count_pairs[s]\n    # and PS[k] = sum_{s=0 to k} s * count_pairs[s]\n    P = [0] * (max_s_val + 1)\n    PS = [0] * (max_s_val + 1)\n\n    for s in range(1, max_s_val + 1):\n        P[s] = P[s-1] + count_pairs[s]\n        PS[s] = PS[s-1] + s * count_pairs[s]\n    \n    total_triangles = 0\n\n    # Step 3: Sum f(s) * count_pairs[s] using prefix sums\n    # f(s) = max(0, min(D, s - 1) - C + 1)\n    # This can be split into three cases for s:\n    # 1. s <= C: f(s) = 0\n    # 2.
