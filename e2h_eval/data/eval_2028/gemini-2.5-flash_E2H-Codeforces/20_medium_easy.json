For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Let's get this programming problem cracked!** My task is to write a Python script that chews through `n`, `k`, and `f`, then spits out the answer modulo 998244353. The challenge lies in a \"beautiful multiset\" of binary strings, where the number of strings with a certain prefix can't exceed a defined limit. My mission is to count the ways these limits can be set so that the multiset's largest possible size is exactly `f`.\n\nFirst, I'm visualizing these binary strings as leaves on a complete binary tree of depth `n`.  Each node represents a prefix, and the number of strings with that prefix must be less than or equal to `c_s` which is up to `k`.  My goal is to figure out the possible values for all these `c_s` values such that the total size of the set (which is equivalent to counting strings with an empty string as a prefix, the root of the tree) is equal to `f`.\n\nThe heart of the problem appears to be using dynamic programming on the prefix structure. I define `dp_s` as the largest possible count of strings whose prefix matches `s`, while maintaining the beauty criteria.  The DP recurrence emerges: `dp_s = min(c_s, dp_{s0} + dp_{s1})`, where `s0` and `s1` are the children of `s`. This beautifully captures how the count for a prefix is limited by its children and its own `c_s` value.  The maximum multiset size given a set of `c_s` values is `dp_\"\"`.\n\nThis leads to the crucial DP state: Let `dp[L][val]` represent the number of ways to pick `c_s` for the strings with length deeper than `L` and also including the nodes at depth `L` such that for any specific node `s` at depth `L-1`, `dp_{s_0} + dp_{s_1} = val`.\n\nFor a length `n` binary string, `dp[n][val]` is the number of ways to pick `c_s` such that `dp_s = val`.\nI can initialize the base case `dp[n][val]` easily because it's just the number of ways to choose c.\n\nFor `L < n`, I calculate `P_L`, which is the convolution of the DP table at the next deeper level.\n\nFinally, I reach the recurrence, which is the core of this DP algorithm.  Let `A_L[val]` be the number of ways to make `dp_s = val` for nodes at length `L`.\n`A_L[val] = (k - val) * P_L[val] + SufP_L[val]`. The size of the `P` and `A` array should be based on `f`.\nI'm careful to manage the possible `c_s` range.\n\nThe plan is to iterate from the leaves up to the root, calculating `P` by convolving `A` in each layer.  The final answer, the count of valid ways, will be stored at `A[0][f]`. All the operations use the specified modulo.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers `c_s` for all binary strings `s` of length `1` to `n`, such that `0 \\le c_s \\le k`, and the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful multiset\" is exactly `f`. We need to output this count modulo `998244353`.\n\nA multiset `M` of binary strings of length `n` is beautiful if for every string `s` of length `1` to `n`, the number of strings in `M` that have `s` as a prefix, let's call this `N_s`, satisfies `N_s \\le c_s`.\n\nThe maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset for a given set of `c_s` values can be found using dynamic programming. Let `dp_s` be the maximum number of strings of length `n` that can have `s` as a prefix, satisfying all constraints `c_t` for `t` being `s` or any descendant of `s`.\n1.  For a string `s` of length `n` (a leaf in the binary tree of strings): `dp_s = c_s`. This is because `s` itself is a string in the multiset, and `N_s` is just its count.\n2.  For a string `s` of length `L < n` (an internal node): `dp_s = \\min(c_s, dp_{s0} + dp_{s1})`. Here, `s0` and `s1` are the children of `s`. The `dp_{s0} + dp_{s1}` term represents the maximum count of strings prefixed by `s` that can be formed by its children. The `\\min(c_s, ...)` term ensures the constraint `N_s \\le c_s` is met.\n\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset is `dp_\"\"` (for the empty string, representing the root).\nCrucially, since `c_s \\le k` for all `s`, it follows that `dp_s \\le k` for all `s`. This is because `dp_s = \\min(c_s, dp_{s0} + dp_{s1}) \\le c_s \\le k`. This means the `dp` values will never exceed `k`.\n\nLet `A[L][val]` be the number of ways to choose `c_t` for all strings `t` that are descendants of a *fixed* string `s` of length `L` (including `s` itself), such that `dp_s` evaluates to `val`.\nThe `dp_s` values are always `\\le k`, so `val` ranges from `0` to `k`.\n\nWe can compute `A[L]` iteratively from `L=n` down to `L=0`.\n\n**Base Case: `L = n` (leaf nodes)**\nFor a string `s` of length `n`, `dp_s = c_s`. We choose `c_s` from `0` to `k`.\nSo, `A[n][val] = 1` if `0 \\le val \\le k`, and `0` otherwise.\n\n**Recursive Step: `L < n`**\nTo compute `A[L][val]`:\nLet `s` be a fixed string of length `L`. Its `dp_s` value depends on `c_s` and `dp_{s0}, dp_{s1}`.\n`dp_s = \\min(c_s, dp_{s0} + dp_{s1})`.\nLet `X = dp_{s0} + dp_{s1}`. The value `X` is determined by choices for `c_t` where `t` are descendants of `s0` or `s1`.\nThe number of ways to make `dp_{s0} = v_0` is `A[L+1][v_0]`.\nThe number of ways to make `dp_{s1} = v_1` is `A[L+1][v_1]`.\nSince these choices are independent, the number of ways to get `X = v_0 + v_1` is given by the convolution of `A[L+1]` with itself:\n`P[X] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=X} A[L+1][v_0] \\cdot A[L+1][v_1]`.\nThe maximum value for `v_0, v_1` is `k`, so `X` can range from `0` to `2k`.\n`P` is a polynomial `(A[L+1])^2` where `A[L+1]` is `\\sum A[L+1][i] x^i`.\n\nNow, we need to choose `c_s` (from `0` to `k`) and `X` (from `0` to `2k`) such that `\\min(c_s, X) = val`.\n`A[L][val] = \\sum_{c_s=0}^k \\sum_{X=0}^{2k} [ \\min(c_s, X) == val ] \\cdot P[X]`\nWe can simplify the sum:\nFor `\\min(c_s, X) == val` to hold:\n1.  If `c_s = val`: then `X` must be `\\ge val`. This contributes `P[X]` for `X \\ge val`.\n    Summing this for `c_s = val`: `\\sum_{X=val}^{2k} P[X]`.\n2.  If `c_s > val`: then `X` must be `val`. This contributes `P[val]`.\n    Summing this for `c_s` from `val+1` to `k`: `(k - (val+1) + 1) \\cdot P[val] = (k - val) \\cdot P[val]`.\n\nSo, `A[L][val] = (k - val) \\cdot P[val] + \\sum_{X=val}^{2k} P[X]`.\nLet `SufP[val] = \\sum_{X=val}^{2k} P[X]` be the suffix sum of `P`.\nThen `A[L][val] = (k - val) \\cdot P[val] + SufP[val]`.\nNote that `SufP[val] = P[val] + SufP[val+1]`.\nSo, `A[L][val] = (k - val + 1) \\cdot P[val] + SufP[val+1]`.\nAll calculations are modulo `998244353`.\n\nThe maximum value of `k` is `2 \\cdot 10^5`. The maximum size of `P` is `2k+1`.\nA direct convolution takes `O((2k)^2)` time. With `n` levels, this is `O(n \\cdot (2k)^2)`, which is too slow (`15 \\cdot (4 \\cdot 10^5)^2 \\approx 2.4 \\cdot 10^{12}`).\nWe need to use Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) for convolution. NTT takes `O(N \\log N)` time for polynomials of degree `N`. Here `N` is `2k`.\nSo, each convolution takes `O(2k \\log(2k))` time.\nThe overall complexity is `O(n \\cdot k \\log k)`.\n`15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log(2 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 18 \\approx 5.4 \\cdot 10^7`, which is feasible.\n\nAfter computing `A[0][val]` for all `val` from `0` to `k`, `A[0][val]` represents the number of ways to set `c_s` values such that `dp_\"\" = val`.\nWe need the count where `dp_\"\" = f`.\nSo, the final answer is `A[0][f]`.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n*   The modulus `998244353` is a prime number suitable for NTT. It can be written as `119 \\cdot 2^{23} + 1`.\n*   We need an NTT implementation. This typically involves `_ntt`, `_inv_ntt` functions and precomputing powers of roots of unity.\n*   The `A` array only needs to store `A[L+1]` to compute `A[L]`, so we can optimize space by using only two arrays, `curr_A` and `prev_A`.\n*   The `SufP` array can be computed in `O(k)` time after `P` is known.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Constants for NTT\nMOD = 998244353\nROOT = 3  # Primitive root modulo MOD\n\n# Precompute inverse for modular arithmetic\nINV_2 = pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)\n\ndef _ntt(a, inverse):\n    n = len(a)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    len_half = 1\n    while len_half < n:\n        w_n = pow(ROOT, (MOD - 1) // (len_half * 2), MOD)\n        if inverse:\n            w_n = pow(w_n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, len_half * 2):\n            w = 1\n            for j in range(len_half):\n                u = a[i + j]\n                v = (a[i + j + len_half] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + j + len_half] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * w_n) % MOD\n        len_half *= 2\n\n    if inverse:\n        inv_n = pow(n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * inv_n) % MOD\n\ndef multiply(poly1, poly2):\n    len1 = len(poly1)\n    len2 = len(poly2)\n    \n    # Find smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to len1 + len2 - 1\n    size = 1\n    while size < len1 + len2 - 1:\n        size <<= 1\n    \n    a = list(poly1) + [0] * (size - len1)\n    b = list(poly2) + [0] * (size - len2)\n\n    _ntt(a, False)\n    _ntt(b, False)\n\n    c = [(a[i] * b[i]) % MOD for i in range(size)]\n    _ntt(c, True)\n\n    return c\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # A[L] will store the current A_L values\n    # A_prev will store A_{L+1} values\n    \n    # Base case: L = n\n    # A_n[val] = 1 for 0 <= val <= k, 0 otherwise\n    A_prev = [0] * (k + 1)\n    for val in range(k + 1):\n        A_prev[val] = 1\n\n    # Iterate from L = n-1 down to 0\n    for L in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        # P = A_prev * A_prev (convolution)\n        # P[X] = sum_{v0+v1=X} A_prev[v0] * A_prev[v1]\n        P = multiply(A_prev, A_prev)\n        \n        # P can have length up to 2k+1.
