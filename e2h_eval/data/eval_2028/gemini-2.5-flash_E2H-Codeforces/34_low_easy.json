And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Calculating Average Sleep Time**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a problem: calculate the average sleep time over a Berland \"week,\" which is defined as *k* consecutive days, given a list of sleep times for *n* days. The goal is to develop an efficient Python script.\n\nLet's break this down systematically. I have the input: *n* (total days), *k* (week length), and the sleep time array *a*.  The initial thought is that there will be *n - k + 1* possible weeks. I'm going to need to calculate the sum of sleep times for each week, add those sums, and then divide by the number of weeks. The provided example clarifies the concept and is good for sanity checking as the code is built.\n\nA naive, brute-force approach would involve looping through each week and summing the sleep times within that window. But considering the constraints (*n* and *k* up to 2 * 10^5*), that simple method would result in O(n*k) time complexity. With values that size, that's almost certainly going to be too slow, approaching a complexity of *10^10* operations in the worst case.  Not good.\n\nThis problem screams \"sliding window\" or \"prefix sums\" to me. I've encountered similar situations before. The key is to avoid redundant calculations. Let's see...If I use prefix sums, let P[i] represent the sum of sleep times from index 0 to i-1. The sleep time from a[i] to a[j] could then be computed as P[j+1] - P[i]. The prefix sum approach is perfect because calculating the sum of each \"week\" then becomes a straightforward calculation.\n\nI'll start by precomputing the prefix sums. I'll initialize a prefix sum array P of size n+1.  Then, a simple loop builds the sums, like this: `P[i+1] = P[i] + a[i]`. Now, the sum for a week starting at index *i* is simply `P[i+k] - P[i]`. So, I'll loop from 0 to *n - k + 1*, using the prefix sums to efficiently calculate the sleep time sum for each week and add to a running total. Finally, divide by (*n - k + 1*) to get the average. This approach should give a linear time complexity (O(N)), which is much more efficient!  I'll implement this method; it looks sound, and I'll keep the example in mind to test my script with a simpler case to make sure it functions as expected.\n",
