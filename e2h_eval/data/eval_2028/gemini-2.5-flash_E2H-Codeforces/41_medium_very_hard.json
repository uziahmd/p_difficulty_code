There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**The Housing Profit Maximization Solution**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem, and my task is to figure out the best way to build houses to maximize profit, given some zoning restrictions. I've got `n` spots where I can build, each house can be a height `a_i` between 0 and `h`, and the profit is simply the square of the height, `a_i^2`. I also have `m` restrictions to deal with.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that the constraints on `n`, `h`, and `m` are really small, which makes me think that a simple approach with manageable time complexity is probably the way to go. No need to get fancy with dynamic programming or anything too complex here, at least not at first glance.\n\nLet's break down these restrictions. Each restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)` means that the tallest house in the range from `l_j` to `r_j` *must* be at most `x_j`. That's a key observation. This doesn't mean just one house has to be below a certain height, it means every single house in that range has to meet this height constraint.\n\nSo, I start thinking, for each spot `i`, I need to figure out the maximum height I can build. It's limited by two things: the global height limit `h`, and any restrictions that apply to that specific spot. In other words, for each spot `i`, its height is the minimum of two things: the global height limit (`h`) and the limits imposed by all the restrictions that cover that spot (`x_j` values where spot `i` is within the range `[l_j, r_j]`).\n\nTo make things easy, let's create a list, `max_allowed_height`, where each element is the maximum height I can build at that spot. I'll initialize everything to `h` and then adjust based on restrictions. I process each restriction one at a time. For a restriction `(l, r, x)`, I look at all the spots from `l` to `r` and update the allowed height. If the restriction limits a spot's height to some `x`, I update it to the `min` of the current allowed height for the spot and `x`.\n\nSince profit is `a_i^2`, and this function is increasing, to maximize my profit, I should build each house as tall as the restrictions allow. After I process all restrictions, for each spot `i`, the `max_allowed_height[i]` will hold the exact height I can build a house on the spot `i`.\n\nFinally, to get the total profit, I simply square each of those `max_allowed_height` values (since `a_i = max_allowed_height[i]`) and add them up. That's my answer!\n\nLet's test this with the examples given to make sure I'm right, and then consider the code. The core logic is to read in the restrictions, update the maximum allowed heights based on the restrictions, and then calculate the total profit based on those heights. The time complexity is O(`m * n`), which should be fast enough given the constraints.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the total profit from building houses on `n` spots. For each spot `i`, we can build a house of height `a_i` such that `0 <= a_i <= h`. The profit from a house of height `a_i` is `a_i^2`. We are also given `m` zoning restrictions. Each restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)` states that the tallest house in the range `[l_j, r_j]` (inclusive) must be at most `x_j`.\n\nThe key insight is in interpreting the restriction \"the tallest house from spots `l_j` to `r_j` must be at most `x_j`\". This means that for every spot `k` such that `l_j <= k <= r_j`, the height of the house at spot `k` (`a_k`) must be less than or equal to `x_j`. If any `a_k` in that range were greater than `x_j`, then `max(a_k)` would also be greater than `x_j`, violating the restriction.\n\nTherefore, for each individual spot `i`, its height `a_i` is constrained by:\n1. The global maximum height: `a_i <= h`.\n2. All zoning restrictions `(l_j, r_j, x_j)` that cover spot `i`: `a_i <= x_j` for all `j` where `l_j <= i <= r_j`.\n\nTo satisfy all constraints simultaneously, the maximum allowed height for a house at spot `i` is the minimum of `h` and all `x_j` values from restrictions that cover spot `i`.\nLet `max_allowed_height[i]` be this maximum possible height for spot `i`. We can compute this as follows:\n1. Initialize `max_allowed_height[i] = h` for all spots `i` from `0` to `n-1` (using 0-indexed spots for convenience).\n2. For each restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)`:\n   Iterate `k` from `l_j-1` to `r_j-1` (adjusting to 0-indexed).\n   Update `max_allowed_height[k] = min(max_allowed_height[k], x_j)`.\n\nAfter processing all `m` restrictions, `max_allowed_height[i]` will store the tightest upper bound for the height of the house at spot `i`.\n\nTo maximize the total profit `sum(a_i^2)`, we should choose the largest possible height for each house. Since `a^2` is an increasing function for `a >= 0`, choosing `a_i = max_allowed_height[i]` for each spot `i` will maximize its individual profit `a_i^2`, and thus maximize the total profit.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Read `n`, `h`, `m`.\n2. Create a list `max_allowed_height` of size `n`, initialized with `h` for all elements.\n3. For each of the `m` restrictions:\n   a. Read `l`, `r`, `x`.\n   b. Adjust `l` and `r` to be 0-indexed: `l_idx = l - 1`, `r_idx = r - 1`.\n   c. Iterate from `i = l_idx` to `r_idx` (inclusive):\n      Update `max_allowed_height[i] = min(max_allowed_height[i], x)`.\n4. Calculate the total profit: Initialize `total_profit = 0`. Iterate through `height` in `max_allowed_height`, and add `height * height` to `total_profit`.\n5. Print `total_profit`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nRestrictions: `(1, 1, 1)`, `(2, 2, 3)`, `(3, 3, 2)`\n\n1. Initialize `max_allowed_height = [3, 3, 3]` (for spots 1, 2, 3).\n2. Process restrictions:\n   - `(1, 1, 1)`: For spot 1 (index 0), `max_allowed_height[0] = min(3, 1) = 1`.\n     `max_allowed_height` is now `[1, 3, 3]`.\n   - `(2, 2, 3)`: For spot 2 (index 1), `max_allowed_height[1] = min(3, 3) = 3`.\n     `max_allowed_height` remains `[1, 3, 3]`.\n   - `(3, 3, 2)`: For spot 3 (index 2), `max_allowed_height[2] = min(3, 2) = 2`.\n     `max_allowed_height` is now `[1, 3, 2]`.\n3. Calculate total profit:\n   `1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- Time Complexity: Initialization takes O(`n`). Processing `m` restrictions, each potentially iterating over `n` spots, takes O(`m * n`). Calculating the final profit takes O(`n`). Total time complexity is O(`n + m*n + n`) = O(`m*n`). Given `n, m <= 50`, `50 * 50 = 2500` operations, which is very efficient.\n- Space Complexity: O(`n`) to store `max_allowed_height`. Given `n <= 50`, this is very small.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n, h, m from the first line\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize a list to store the maximum allowed height for each spot.\n    # Initially, every spot can have a house up to height 'h'.\n    # The list is 0-indexed, so max_allowed_height[i] corresponds to spot i+1.\n    max_allowed_height = [h] * n\n\n    # Process each of the m zoning restrictions\n    for _ in range(m):\n        # Read l_i, r_i, x_i for the current restriction\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        \n        # Adjust l and r to be 0-indexed for Python list access.\n        # l_idx is the starting index (inclusive)\n        # r_idx is the ending index (inclusive)\n        l_idx = l - 1\n        r_idx = r - 1\n        \n        # Apply the restriction: for every spot within the range [l, r],\n        # its height must be at most x.\n        # We update the max_allowed_height for these spots by taking the minimum\n        # of their current max_allowed_height and x.\n        for i in range(l_idx, r_idx + 1):\n            max_allowed_height[i] = min(max_allowed_height[i], x)\n            \n    # Calculate the total maximum profit.\n    # To maximize profit, each house should be built at its maximum allowed height.\n    # The profit for a house of height 'a' is a^2.\n    total_profit = 0\n    for height in max_allowed_height:\n        total_profit += height * height\n        \n    # Print the final maximum profit\n    print(total_profit)\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the program\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
