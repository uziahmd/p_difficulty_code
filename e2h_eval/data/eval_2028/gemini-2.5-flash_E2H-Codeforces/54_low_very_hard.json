Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the \"Mister B and Angle in Polygon\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem: we're given a regular *n*-gon and a target angle *a*, and we need to find three vertices that form an angle as close as possible to *a*. The core of this seems to be understanding the geometry of regular polygons and how angles relate to each other.\n\nFirst, I need to solidify the key properties. I know the central angle is 360/n, and each interior angle is (n-2)*180/n. But, the crucial piece is realizing that the angles we're looking for are *inscribed* angles, formed by the vertices of the polygon. An inscribed angle is half the central angle that subtends the same arc.\n\nNow, let's simplify things. Without loss of generality, I can fix one vertex, say vertex 1, as the vertex of the angle we're trying to form (let's call it v2). Then, the other two vertices (v1 and v3) determine the arc, and thus the angle. The number of sides (edges) between v1 and v3 determines the central angle, and consequently, the inscribed angle. I'll need to be careful about wrapping around the polygon; I'm dealing with indices 1 to n.\n\nSo, if v1 is at index *i* and v3 is at index *j*, with v2 fixed at 1. The key is to calculate the central angle (and inscribed angle) based on how many \"sides\" the arc between *i* and *j* covers. I think I need to figure out how to best handle the modulo arithmetic. My intuition says that the shortest path between the vertices will be important. It sounds like I need to calculate the number of sides (m) between *i* and *j*, and then calculate m * (180/n). I can then iterate through all possible vertex pairs and see which angle is closest to my target angle *a*. It's about finding that pair *i*, *j* (along with v2 = 1) that minimizes the difference between their formed angle and *a*.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 of a regular convex n-gon such that the angle v1-v2-v3 (with v2 as the vertex) is as close as possible to a given target angle `a`. We need to output the 1-indexed vertices.\n\n**Understanding Angles in a Regular Polygon:**\n\n1.  **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An angle formed by three vertices of a polygon (an inscribed angle) is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.\n2.  **Central Angle per Side:** In a regular n-gon, the angle subtended by each side at the center is `360/n` degrees.\n3.  **Possible Inscribed Angles:** If an inscribed angle subtends `k` sides of the polygon, its measure will be `k * (360/n) / 2 = k * (180/n)` degrees.\n    *   Here, `k` represents the number of sides between the two non-vertex points (v1 and v3) along the perimeter, *not* passing through the vertex point (v2).\n    *   Since v1, v2, v3 must be distinct, `k` can range from `1` (for adjacent sides) to `n-2` (for the longest possible arc).\n    *   The maximum possible angle is when `k = n-2`, which is `(n-2) * 180 / n`, which is the interior angle of the regular n-gon.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Fix v2:** Without loss of generality, let's fix one vertex as `v2`. A convenient choice is vertex 2.\n2.  **Fix v1:** Let `v1` be vertex 1. This is adjacent to vertex 2.\n3.  **Vary v3:** Now, `v3` must be a vertex distinct from `v1` (vertex 1) and `v2` (vertex 2). So, `v3` can be any vertex from 3 to `n`.\n    *   If `v2` is vertex 2 and `v1` is vertex 1, then `v3` is vertex `j` (where `j` ranges from 3 to `n`).\n    *   The arc between `v1` (vertex 1) and `v3` (vertex `j`) (not passing through `v2` (vertex 2)) consists of `j-2` sides.\n    *   For example, if `j=3`, the arc is from 1 to 3, consisting of one side (1-3). The angle is `1 * (180/n)`.\n    *   If `j=4`, the arc is from 1 to 4, consisting of two sides (1-3, 3-4). The angle is `2 * (180/n)`.\n    *   In general, for `v3` at index `j`, the number of sides `k` is `j-2`.\n    *   So, the possible angles are `(j-2) * (180/n)` for `j` from 3 to `n`.\n    *   This means `k` ranges from `1` to `n-2`.\n    *   The possible angles are `1 * (180/n), 2 * (180/n), ..., (n-2) * (180/n)`.\n\n4.  **Find the Best Angle:** We need to find an integer `k` (from 1 to `n-2`) such that `|k * (180/n) - a|` is minimized.\n    *   Let `angle_k = k * (180/n)`.\n    *   We are looking for `k` that minimizes `abs(angle_k - a)`.\n\n5.  **Optimization (Binary Search / Linear Scan):**\n    *   The function `f(k) = k * (180/n)` is monotonically increasing with `k`.\n    *   We can find `k` such that `k * (180/n)` is closest to `a`.\n    *   Let `target_k = a / (180/n) = a * n / 180`.\n    *   The optimal `k` will be either `floor(target_k)` or `ceil(target_k)`.\n    *   We need to check `k_floor = floor(target_k)` and `k_ceil = ceil(target_k)`.\n    *   We also need to ensure `k` is within the valid range `[1, n-2]`.\n    *   So, we consider `k_cand1 = max(1, min(n-2, floor(target_k)))` and `k_cand2 = max(1, min(n-2, ceil(target_k)))`.\n    *   If `k_cand1` and `k_cand2` are the same, we only need to check that one. Otherwise, we check both and pick the one that gives the minimum difference.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\nLet `n=4`, `a=67`.\nPossible angles are `k * (180/4) = k * 45`.\n`k` can be from `1` to `n-2 = 4-2 = 2`.\nPossible `k` values: `1, 2`.\nAngles:\n*   `k=1`: `1 * 45 = 45` degrees. `|45 - 67| = 22`.\n*   `k=2`: `2 * 45 = 90` degrees. `|90 - 67| = 23`.\nThe minimum difference is 22, achieved with `k=1`.\nSo we choose `k=1`.\nWith `v2=2`, `v1=1`, `v3` corresponds to `j` such that `j-2=k`.\nFor `k=1`, `j-2=1 => j=3`.\nSo, `v1=1, v2=2, v3=3`. Output: `1 2 3`.\n\nLet `n=4`, `a=68`.\nAngles:\n*   `k=1`: `45` degrees. `|45 - 68| = 23`.\n*   `k=2`: `90` degrees. `|90 - 68| = 22`.\nThe minimum difference is 22, achieved with `k=2`.\nSo we choose `k=2`.\nFor `k=2`, `j-2=2 => j=4`.\nSo, `v1=1, v2=2, v3=4`. Output: `1 2 4`.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n1.  Read `n` and `a`.\n2.  Calculate `angle_unit = 180 / n`.\n3.  Calculate `target_k_float = a / angle_unit`.\n4.  Consider `k1 = int(target_k_float)` and `k2 = k1 + 1`.\n5.  Initialize `min_diff = float('inf')` and `best_k = -1`.\n6.  Iterate `k` through `[k1, k2]`:\n    *   Check if `1 <= k <= n-2`. If not, skip.\n    *   Calculate `current_angle = k * angle_unit`.\n    *   Calculate `diff = abs(current_angle - a)`.\n    *   If `diff < min_diff`:\n        *   `min_diff = diff`\n        *   `best_k = k`\n7.  The vertices are `v1=1`, `v2=2`, `v3=best_k + 2`.\n8.  Print `v1 v2 v3`.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n*   `n=3`: `k` can only be `1`. Angle is `1 * (180/3) = 60` degrees.\n    *   `target_k_float = a / 60`.\n    *   `k_cand1 = max(1, min(1, floor(target_k))) = 1`.\n    *   `k_cand2 = max(1, min(1, ceil(target_k))) = 1`.\n    *   Always `best_k = 1`. `v1=1, v2=2, v3=1+2=3`. Output `1 2 3`. This is correct.\n*   `a` can be 1 or 180.\n    *   If `a=1`, `target_k_float` will be small, likely less than 1. `k1` will be 0. `k2` will be 1. `best_k` will be 1.\n    *   If `a=180`, `target_k_float` will be large. It might exceed `n-2`. `k1` and `k2` will be capped at `n-2`.\n*   The `min` and `max` operations for `k_cand1` and `k_cand2` correctly handle these bounds.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # The base angle unit for an inscribed angle subtending one side\n    # An inscribed angle subtending k sides has measure k * (180/n) degrees.\n    # The number of sides k can range from 1 to n-2.\n    # v1, v2, v3 are distinct vertices.\n    # Let v2 be vertex 2.\n    # Let v1 be vertex 1.\n    # Then v3 can be any vertex from 3 to n.\n    # If v3 is vertex j, the arc between v1 (vertex 1) and v3 (vertex j)\n    # (not passing through v2 (vertex 2)) consists of (j-2) sides.\n    # So, k = j-2.\n    # As j ranges from 3 to n, k ranges from 1 to n-2.\n\n    angle_per_side = 180.0 / n\n\n    # We are looking for an integer k in [1, n-2] that minimizes |k * angle_per_side - a|\n    \n    # Calculate the ideal k (not necessarily an integer)\n    target_k_float = a / angle_per_side\n\n    best_k = -1\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n\n    # Consider k values around target_k_float\n    # The two closest integers to target_k_float are floor(target_k_float) and ceil(target_k_float)\n    \n    # Candidate 1: floor(target_k_float)\n    k_cand1 = math.floor(target_k_float)\n    \n    # Candidate 2: ceil(target_k_float)\n    k_cand2 = math.ceil(target_k_float)\n\n    # We need to check k values within the valid range [1, n-2]\n    # It's possible that target_k_float is outside this range,\n    # so we clamp the candidates.\n    \n    # Ensure k is at least 1 and at most n-2\n    possible_ks = set()\n    if 1 <= k_cand1 <= n - 2:\n        possible_ks.add(k_cand1)\n    if 1 <= k_cand2 <= n - 2:\n        possible_ks.add(k_cand2)\n    \n    # If target_k_float is very close to an integer, k_cand1 and k_cand2 might be the same.\n    # If target_k_float is outside [1, n-2], we need to check the boundary values 1 or n-2.\n    # For example, if a is very small, target_k_float might be < 1, so k=1 is the best.\n    # If a is very large, target_k_float might be > n-2, so k=n-2 is the best.\n    if not possible_ks: # This happens if target_k_float is outside [1, n-2] and k_cand1/k_cand2 are outside after floor/ceil\n        if target_k_float < 1:\n            possible_ks.add(1) # Closest valid k is 1\n        elif target_k_float > n - 2:\n            possible_ks.add(n - 2) # Closest valid k is n-2\n\n    # Iterate through the relevant candidate k values\n    for k in possible_ks:\n        current_angle = k * angle_per_side\n        diff = abs(current_angle - a)\n\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        # If diff is equal, we can take any.
