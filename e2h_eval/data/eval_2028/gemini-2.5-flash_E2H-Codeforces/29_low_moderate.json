Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing a Tricky String Replacement Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm facing a competitive programming challenge that involves string manipulation and modular arithmetic. My goal is to write a Python script to efficiently handle this. The core is transforming a digit string 's' based on a series of queries and then calculating its final decimal value modulo 1000000007. I've got a string 's' of digits and 'n' queries. Each query is a replacement: \"di->ti,\" replacing all occurrences of digit `di` with the string `ti`. The real kicker is that 's' can explode in size with repeated replacements.\n\nIt's clear I can't construct the final, potentially huge, string. That's a performance killer.  I need a more clever strategy to avoid explicitly building and storing that monstrous result.  The constraints are fairly typical: string length, the number of queries and lengths of replacements. \n\nThe crux of the problem lies in the fact that applying a transformation can dramatically increase the length of 's' with each query. I have to avoid this.\n\nSo, I need a method to track how the numeric value changes with each query while keeping track of the length.  The modulo part is key: final value and the length of modified digit strings need to be modulo 1000000007 (MOD). I'll use the modular arithmetic properties.\n\nI can represent each digit (0-9) as a pair:  (value_d, length_d). `value_d` will be the numeric value of the digit, *after* transformations are applied, modulo MOD. `length_d` will be the length of the *transformed* digit, and critically, to calculate powers of 10 later, modulo (MOD - 1). This should let me compute the value of the final string without actually constructing it!  \n\nFor the powers of 10, Fermat's Little Theorem helps. Since 1000000007 is a prime, I can use the fact that `10^L mod MOD = 10^(L mod (MOD-1)) mod MOD`. This will allow me to compute large powers of 10 more efficiently.  Therefore I need the length of each digit to be mod (MOD-1). \n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to process a string of digits `s` through a series of replacement queries and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo 1000000007. The string `s` can become extremely long, so we cannot explicitly construct it. We need a way to track the value and length of the transformed string for each digit.\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`. This is a prime number.\nWhen calculating `10^L mod MOD`, if `L` is very large, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem. For a prime `P`, `a^L mod P = a^(L mod (P-1)) mod P` for `L > 0`. If `L=0`, `10^0 = 1`. So, we need to keep track of lengths modulo `MOD-1`.\n\nLet's define two arrays:\n1. `val[d]`: The numerical value of the string that digit `d` transforms into, modulo `MOD`.\n2. `length[d]`: The length of the string that digit `d` transforms into, modulo `MOD-1`.\n\nInitially, before any queries, each digit `d` transforms into itself.\nSo, for `d` from 0 to 9:\n- `val[d] = d`\n- `length[d] = 1`\n\nThe queries are processed in reverse order. This is a common technique when transformations depend on previous states. If we process `di -> ti` in forward order, `ti` might contain digits that are themselves subject to later transformations. By processing in reverse, when we consider `di -> ti`, all digits in `ti` (and `di` itself) will have their *final* transformation values and lengths already computed.\n\nLet's consider a query `di -> ti`. We want to update `val[di]` and `length[di]` based on the string `ti`.\nThe string `ti` is composed of digits `c_k c_{k-1} ... c_1 c_0`.\nThe value of `ti` is `val[c_k] * 10^(length[c_{k-1}] + ... + length[c_0]) + val[c_{k-1}] * 10^(length[c_1] + length[c_0]) + ... + val[c_0]`.\nThe total length of `ti` is `length[c_k] + length[c_{k-1}] + ... + length[c_0]`.\n\nWe can calculate these values by iterating through the characters of `ti` from right to left (or left to right, accumulating powers of 10). Let's iterate from right to left (least significant to most significant):\n\nFor `ti = t_0 t_1 ... t_k`:\n`new_val_di = 0`\n`new_len_di = 0`\n`current_power_of_10 = 1` (modulo MOD)\n\nFor each character `c` in `ti` (from right to left):\n  `digit = int(c)`\n  `new_val_di = (new_val_di + val[digit] * current_power_of_10) % MOD`\n  `new_len_di = (new_len_di + length[digit]) % (MOD - 1)`\n  `current_power_of_10 = (current_power_of_10 * pow(10, length[digit], MOD)) % MOD`\n\nAfter processing all characters in `ti`:\n`val[di] = new_val_di`\n`length[di] = new_len_di`\n\nSpecial case: If `ti` is an empty string, then `val[di] = 0` and `length[di] = 0`. Our loop correctly handles this as `new_val_di` and `new_len_di` remain 0.\n\nAfter processing all `n` queries in reverse order, `val[d]` and `length[d]` will store the final value and length for each digit `d`.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the value of the initial string `s`.\nLet `s = s_0 s_1 ... s_m`.\nSimilar to how we processed `ti`, we iterate through `s` from right to left:\n\n`final_ans = 0`\n`current_power_of_10 = 1` (modulo MOD)\n\nFor each character `c` in `s` (from right to left):\n  `digit = int(c)`\n  `final_ans = (final_ans + val[digit] * current_power_of_10) % MOD`\n  `current_power_of_10 = (current_power_of_10 * pow(10, length[digit], MOD)) % MOD`\n\nThe `final_ans` will be the result.\n\nExample Walkthrough: `s = 222`, queries: `2->0`, `0->7`\n\nInitial state:\n`val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\nQueries in reverse:\n1. `0->7`:\n   `di = 0`, `ti = \"7\"`\n   `new_val_0 = 0`, `new_len_0 = 0`, `current_power_of_10 = 1`\n   Process `c = '7'`:\n     `digit = 7`\n     `new_val_0 = (0 + val[7] * 1) % MOD = (0 + 7 * 1) % MOD = 7`\n     `new_len_0 = (0 + length[7]) % (MOD - 1) = (0 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 1`\n     `current_power_of_10 = (1 * pow(10, length[7], MOD)) % MOD = (1 * pow(10, 1, MOD)) % MOD = 10`\n   Update `val[0] = 7`, `length[0] = 1`.\n\n   Current state:\n   `val = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n   `length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n2. `2->0`:\n   `di = 2`, `ti = \"0\"`\n   `new_val_2 = 0`, `new_len_2 = 0`, `current_power_of_10 = 1`\n   Process `c = '0'`:\n     `digit = 0`\n     `new_val_2 = (0 + val[0] * 1) % MOD = (0 + 7 * 1) % MOD = 7`\n     `new_len_2 = (0 + length[0]) % (MOD - 1) = (0 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 1`\n     `current_power_of_10 = (1 * pow(10, length[0], MOD)) % MOD = (1 * pow(10, 1, MOD)) % MOD = 10`\n   Update `val[2] = 7`, `length[2] = 1`.\n\n   Final state after queries:\n   `val = [7, 1, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n   `length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\nCalculate value of `s = \"222\"`:\n`final_ans = 0`, `current_power_of_10 = 1`\nProcess `c = '2'` (rightmost):\n  `digit = 2`\n  `final_ans = (0 + val[2] * 1) % MOD = (0 + 7 * 1) % MOD = 7`\n  `current_power_of_10 = (1 * pow(10, length[2], MOD)) % MOD = (1 * pow(10, 1, MOD)) % MOD = 10`\nProcess `c = '2'` (middle):\n  `digit = 2`\n  `final_ans = (7 + val[2] * 10) % MOD = (7 + 7 * 10) % MOD = 77`\n  `current_power_of_10 = (10 * pow(10, length[2], MOD)) % MOD = (10 * pow(10, 1, MOD)) % MOD = 100`\nProcess `c = '2'` (leftmost):\n  `digit = 2`\n  `final_ans = (77 + val[2] * 100) % MOD = (77 + 7 * 100) % MOD = 777`\n  `current_power_of_10 = (100 * pow(10, length[2], MOD)) % MOD = (100 * pow(10, 1, MOD)) % MOD = 1000`\n\nResult: `777`. This matches the example.\n\nComplexity:\n- Initialization: O(1)\n- Processing `n` queries: Each query `di -> ti` involves iterating through `ti`. The sum of lengths of all `ti` is `S_L <= 10^5`. So, this part is O(S_L).\n- Final calculation for `s`: Iterating through `s`. Length of `s` is `|s| <= 10^5`. So, this part is O(|s|).\nTotal time complexity: O(|s| + S_L + n). Given the constraints, this is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        parts = line.split(\"->\")\n        d_char = parts[0]\n        t = parts[1]\n        queries.append((d_char, t))\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n    MOD_PHI = MOD - 1 # For Fermat's Little Theorem exponent\n\n    # Initialize val and length for each digit 0-9\n    # val[d]: numerical value of string d transforms into, modulo MOD\n    # length[d]: length of string d transforms into, modulo MOD_PHI (for exponent)\n    val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    length = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        d_char, t = queries[i]\n        d_int = int(d_char)\n\n        new_val_d = 0\n        new_len_d = 0\n        current_power_of_10 = 1 # This is 10^0 mod MOD\n\n        # Iterate through t from right to left\n        for char_t in reversed(t):\n            digit_t = int(char_t)\n            \n            # Add value of current digit's transformation\n            # val[digit_t] is the value of the string that `digit_t` transforms into\n            # current_power_of_10 is the multiplier for this block of digits\n            new_val_d = (new_val_d + val[digit_t] * current_power_of_10) % MOD\n            \n            # Add length of current digit's transformation\n            new_len_d = (new_len_d + length[digit_t]) % MOD_PHI\n            \n            # Update current_power_of_10 for the next (more significant) block of digits\n            # It needs to be multiplied by 10^(length[digit_t])\n            # pow(base, exp, mod) handles modular exponentiation efficiently\n            current_power_of_10 = (current_power_of_10 * pow(10, length[digit_t], MOD)) % MOD\n        \n        # Update the stored val and length for digit d_int\n        val[d_int] = new_val_d\n        length[d_int] = new_len_d\n\n    # Calculate the final value of the initial string s\n    final_ans = 0\n    current_power_of_10 = 1 # This is 10^0 mod MOD\n\n    # Iterate through the initial string s from right to left\n    for char_s in reversed(s):\n        digit_s = int(char_s)\n        \n        # Add value of current digit's transformation\n        final_ans = (final_ans + val[digit_s] * current_power_of_10) % MOD\n        \n        # Update current_power_of_10 for the next (more significant) block of digits\n        current_power_of_10 = (current_power_of_10 * pow(10, length[digit_s], MOD)) % MOD\n\n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_ans) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
