Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown for the TV Game**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"TV Game\" problem, and here's my thought process.  It's pretty clear this is a combinatorial optimization problem. Two players, Homer and Marge, are trying to maximize their combined prize by strategically taking digits from a large number.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand the constraints: `n` is limited to 18, which means the input number has a maximum of 36 digits.  Crucially, I need to realize that I *cannot* store the large numbers `S1` and `S2` as standard integers. These numbers can be absolutely massive. I'll have to represent them as strings or perhaps lists of digits for addition. Luckily, I'm working in Python, so the integer handling should be transparent, although I need to think carefully about the performance.\n\nThe core of the problem seems to be making a sequence of choices: whether Homer or Marge takes the next digit. This screams either dynamic programming or recursion with memoization at me. I'm leaning toward the latter initially to get a clearer understanding, since it directly mimics the decision tree.\n\nHere's how I envision the state: I'll need to keep track of the current position in the input number (`k`), how many moves Homer has made (`h_moves`), and how many moves Marge has made (`m_moves`).  The base case is when I've used up all the digits (`k == 2n`). At that point, I just need to calculate the sum of the resulting numbers (`S1` and `S2`).\n\nThe recursive step is the heart of it. From any given state, I check if Homer has moves left. If so, I \"simulate\" Homer taking the current digit, update the state, and recursively call the function. Then, I do the same for Marge.  I'll need to somehow keep track of the decisions (\"H\" or \"M\") to output the solution. It is also important to return the sequence of moves and the maximum possible sum `S1+S2` for each state.\n\nThe trickiest part is how to efficiently calculate that sum.  Forming the entire strings `S1` and `S2` and converting them to integers in *every* recursive call is a recipe for disaster in terms of time complexity. I'm going to have to think hard about how the digits' positions contribute to the final sum, because I only care about the total prize value. I need a more clever way to compute it, so it can be done efficiently at the end, maybe keeping track of the current contribution.\n",
