    "thought": "**A Lexicographical Sort with a Twist**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem and the goal is to get the lexicographically smallest string possible, given these weird swaps. I've got a string with '0's, '1's, and '2's, and the only swaps allowed are '0' with '1' and '1' with '2'. No direct '0' to '2' swaps!\n\nMy initial thought was that I could just sort everything - that's usually the go-to for lexicographical order. But I quickly realized that doesn't work here. The swaps are restricted; '0's and '2's can only change places if there's a '1' in between them. It's like '1's are these crazy wild cards! They can swap past '0's and '2's, almost like bubble sort but only with some elements. \n\nI started to think that the relative order of '0's and '2's should be preserved, that these two kinds of characters should keep their order in the original order because they can't swap directly. But then I saw examples where a '0' *did* end up after a '2', which showed me my initial assumption was wrong. It turned out, that it was due to '1's.\n\nIt finally clicked that '1's act as a crucial link between '0's and '2's.  I can group the '1's together, because they can move past everything. This means they can be moved around, acting like bridges or buffers for '0's and '2's to switch places indirectly. This made me think about blocks.  \n\nI can separate this into two components. First, there's the skeleton of the string - the '0's and '2's that can't move past each other. The order of '0's and '2's in this skeleton is important. It is preserved. \n\nThen, there are those '1's, this block, they can move to the optimal location. \nTo make it lexicographically smallest, the algorithm became clear. Collect all the '0's from before the first '2', add the '1's in the middle, and then add whatever is remaining in the `S_skeleton`. That's it! It seemed so intuitive once you get how the '1's work. It's a bit like a constrained bubble sort, only with a lot of '0's, '1's and '2's.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by swapping adjacent '0' and '1's, or adjacent '1' and '2's. Swapping '0' and '2' directly is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed operations:\n1. '0' and '1' can swap: `01 <-> 10`.\n2. '1' and '2' can swap: `12 <-> 21`.\n\nThis implies a few important properties:\n- A '1' can swap with any adjacent '0' or '2'. This means a '1' can effectively \"bubble\" past any '0' or '2'. Therefore, all '1's in the string can be moved to form a single contiguous block. For example, in \"0210\", the '1' can move: \"0210\" -> \"0120\" (swap 2-1) -> \"1020\" (swap 1-0). This demonstrates a '1' moving past a '2' and a '0'.\n- The relative order of '0's among themselves is preserved, and similarly for '2's among themselves. For example, if we have two '0's, the one that appeared first in the original string will still appear first among all '0's in the final string. This is because '0's can only swap with '1's, not with other '0's or '2's. (A '0' can swap with a '1', and that '1' can swap with another '0', effectively changing the order of two '0's, e.g., \"010\" -> \"100\" -> \"001\". However, this is not true for '0's and '2's.)\n\nThe critical observation concerns the interaction between '0's and '2's:\n- '0' and '2' cannot swap directly.\n- Can a '0' move past a '2' indirectly? Consider \"012\". We can transform it: \"012\" -> \"102\" (0-1 swap) -> \"120\" (1-2 swap). Here, the '0' has moved past the '2'.\n- Similarly, can a '2' move past a '0' indirectly? Consider \"210\". We can transform it: \"210\" -> \"120\" (2-1 swap) -> \"102\" (1-0 swap). Here, the '2' has moved past the '0'.\n\nThese examples show that a '0' and a '2' can change their relative order *if there is a '1' between them*. However, if there are no '1's between a '0' and a '2' (e.g., \"02\" or \"20\"), they cannot swap.\n\nThis leads to the following strategy:\n1. **Count the '1's**: Since all '1's can be grouped together, we just need to know how many there are. Let this be `count_ones`.\n2. **Identify '0's and '2's that cannot pass each other**: Extract all '0's and '2's from the original string, maintaining their relative order. Let's call this sequence `skeleton_string`. For example, if `S = \"100210\"`, `skeleton_string = \"0020\"`.\n   The crucial point is that any '0' and '2' that are adjacent in `skeleton_string` (i.e., they were never separated by a '1' in the original string, or any '1's that were between them have been moved away) cannot change their relative order.\n3. **Construct the lexicographically smallest string**:\n   To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place '0's as early as possible, then '1's, then '2's.\n   - All '0's that appear *before* any '2' in `skeleton_string` can be moved to the very beginning of the final string. These '0's can swap with any '1's that are initially to their left or between them and the beginning of the string.\n   - Any '0' that appears *after* a '2' in `skeleton_string` cannot move before that '2'. This is because there are no '1's in `skeleton_string` to facilitate such a swap. If there were '1's in the original string, they could only facilitate a swap if they were *between* the specific '0' and '2'. But since all '1's are gathered into one block, they won't be in arbitrary positions to mediate arbitrary swaps between '0's and '2's.\n   - The block of `count_ones` '1's should be placed after all the '0's that can be moved to the front.\n   - The remaining characters from `skeleton_string` (which will be all '2's and any '0's that appeared after the first '2' in `skeleton_string`) must follow the block of '1's, maintaining their original relative order.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1. Initialize an empty list `result_chars` to build the output string.\n2. Initialize `count_ones = 0`.\n3. Create an empty list `skeleton_chars` to store '0's and '2's.\n4. Iterate through the input string `s`:\n   - If `char == '1'`, increment `count_ones`.\n   - If `char == '0'` or `char == '2'`, append `char` to `skeleton_chars`.\n5. Find the index of the first '2' in `skeleton_chars`. If no '2' exists, all characters in `skeleton_chars` are '0's.\n   - Let `first_two_idx = -1`.\n   - Iterate `i` from `0` to `len(skeleton_chars) - 1`:\n     - If `skeleton_chars[i] == '2'`, set `first_two_idx = i` and break.\n6. Append '0's to `result_chars`:\n   - Iterate `i` from `0` to `len(skeleton_chars) - 1`:\n     - If `first_two_idx == -1` (no '2's in `skeleton_chars`) or `i < first_two_idx`:\n       - If `skeleton_chars[i] == '0'`, append '0' to `result_chars`.\n7. Append all '1's to `result_chars`:\n   - Append `count_ones` '1's to `result_chars`.\n8. Append the rest of `skeleton_chars`:\n   - Iterate `i` from `0` to `len(skeleton_chars) - 1`:\n     - If `first_two_idx == -1` (no '2's in `skeleton_chars`) or `i >= first_two_idx`:\n       - Append `skeleton_chars[i]` to `result_chars`.\n9. Join `result_chars` to form the final string and print it.\n\n**Example: `s = \"100210\"`**\n\n1. `count_ones = 0`, `skeleton_chars = []`\n2. Iterate `s`:\n   - '1': `count_ones = 1`\n   - '0': `skeleton_chars = ['0']`\n   - '0': `skeleton_chars = ['0', '0']`\n   - '2': `skeleton_chars = ['0', '0', '2']`\n   - '1': `count_ones = 2`\n   - '0': `skeleton_chars = ['0', '0', '2', '0']`\n   Result: `count_ones = 2`, `skeleton_chars = ['0', '0', '2', '0']`\n3. `first_two_idx = 2` (index of the first '2' in `skeleton_chars`).\n4. Append '0's before the first '2':\n   - `skeleton_chars[0] = '0'`, `0 < 2`, append '0'. `result_chars = ['0']`\n   - `skeleton_chars[1] = '0'`, `1 < 2`, append '0'. `result_chars = ['0', '0']`\n   - `skeleton_chars[2] = '2'`, `2 < 2` is false. Stop.\n5. Append `count_ones` (2) '1's:\n   - `result_chars = ['0', '0', '1', '1']`\n6. Append the rest of `skeleton_chars` (from `first_two_idx` onwards):\n   - `skeleton_chars[2] = '2'`, `2 >= 2`, append '2'. `result_chars = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '2']`\n   - `skeleton_chars[3] = '0'`, `3 >= 2`, append '0'. `result_chars = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '2', '0']`\n7. Final string: `\"001120\"`. This matches the example output.\n\nThis approach correctly handles cases with no '1's, no '0's, or no '2's, as well as mixed cases.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    count_ones = 0\n    skeleton_chars = []\n\n    # Separate '1's from '0's and '2's\n    for char_s in s:\n        if char_s == '1':\n            count_ones += 1\n        else:\n            skeleton_chars.append(char_s)\n\n    # Find the position where '1's should be inserted\n    # '1's should be inserted after all '0's that appear before any '2'\n    # in the skeleton string.\n    \n    result_list = []\n    \n    # Find the first '2' in the skeleton string\n    first_two_idx = -1\n    for i in range(len(skeleton_chars)):\n        if skeleton_chars[i] == '2':\n            first_two_idx = i\n            break\n            \n    # Append '0's that come before the first '2'\n    # If there are no '2's, all '0's come first.\n    if first_two_idx == -1: # No '2's in skeleton_chars\n        for char_sk in skeleton_chars:\n            if char_sk == '0':\n                result_list.append('0')\n    else: # There are '2's\n        for i in range(first_two_idx):\n            if skeleton_chars[i] == '0':\n                result_list.append('0')\n                \n    # Append all '1's\n    result_list.extend(['1'] * count_ones)\n    \n    # Append the rest of the skeleton string (all '2's, and any '0's that were after the first '2')\n    if first_two_idx == -1: # No '2's in skeleton_chars, so all remaining are '0's (already handled)\n        pass # All '0's were added in the first step\n    else:\n        for i in range(first_two_idx, len(skeleton_chars)):\n            result_list.append(skeleton_chars[i])\n\n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result_list) + \"\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
