After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Python Script for \"Marks\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Marks\" problem.  The goal is to count how many students are \"successful\", meaning they got the highest mark in at least one subject.  It seems pretty straightforward.  I'm thinking a Python script is the way to go here.\n\nFirst, I need to read in the input: the number of students (`n`) and subjects (`m`), and then the marks for each student. I'll represent the marks as a 2D list or maybe a list of strings, that's flexible.  Reading input is typically fast in Python, so I'm not worried about that part.\n\nNext, I need to figure out the maximum mark for *each* subject. I'll iterate through each subject and find the highest mark amongst all students for that subject. I'll probably store these max marks in a separate list.\n\nThen, I'll compare each student's mark in each subject to the maximum mark for that subject. If a student's mark matches the maximum, that student is \"best\" at that subject. If a student is \"best\" at *at least one* subject, they are successful.  I'll probably use a set to keep track of the indices of successful students, avoiding any duplicates.\n\nAn optimization I can use is to stop checking a student's marks once I've found that they are best in one subject.  This early exit will save some iterations but isn't critical.\n\nFinally, I just need to count the size of that set of successful students and print it to the console.  The time complexity seems like it'll be O(n*m), which is fine given the constraints. Space complexity is also O(n*m), also fine. Let's make sure to use `sys.stdin.readline` for faster input in competitive programming.  I'll use characters for marks and compare them as such, since `ord()` is a simple way to get around numbers vs characters.\nI think I have a solution that is simple and concise. And will correctly answer the question based on the input.\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    gradebook = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        gradebook.append(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n\n    max_marks_per_subject = ['0'] * m\n\n    for j in range(m):\n        current_subject_max = '0'\n        for i in range(n):\n            if gradebook[i][j] > current_subject_max:\n                current_subject_max = gradebook[i][j]\n        max_marks_per_subject[j] = current_subject_max\n\n    successful_students = set()\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks_per_subject[j]:\n                successful_students.add(i)\n                break \n    \n    print(len(successful_students))\n\nsolve()\n\n```\nYep, I'm satisfied.  It's efficient, readable, and handles the constraints well. Done.\n",
