The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Python Script for Xenia and Ringroad Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to solve the Xenia and Ringroad problem. Basically, I need to figure out the shortest amount of time Xenia needs to complete a series of tasks, moving clockwise around a ring of houses.  Let me break this down into actionable steps.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. That's the number of houses (`n`) and the number of tasks (`m`), followed by the list of houses Xenia needs to visit for each task (`a_i`). I'll use `sys.stdin.readline()` for efficiency.  Then, I need to initialize a few variables: Xenia starts at house 1, so `current_house = 1`, and the initial time is zero, `total_time = 0`.\n\nNow comes the core logic.  I'll iterate through each task. For each task, I have to figure out the time it takes to move from her current house to the target house for that task. Since movement is clockwise, the calculation is straightforward.  If the target house (`target_house`) is the same as or *ahead* of the current house, the time is simply the difference. If the target house is *behind* the current house, then she has to travel the remainder to the end and back around, so that's `n - current_house + target_house`. I can use a compact `if/else` for this: `total_time += (target_house - current_house) if target_house >= current_house else (n - current_house + target_house)`.\n\nAfter calculating the time for that move, I update Xenia's location to the target house, `current_house = target_house`, to prepare for the next task. I keep adding up the time in `total_time` as I go.\n\nFinally, after all tasks are done, I'll print the `total_time`. I'll use `sys.stdout.write()` for output because it's generally faster. I've considered potential integer overflow issues, but Python's integer handling makes that a non-issue here.  The code should be efficient with a time complexity of O(m), as I'm only iterating through the tasks once. The space complexity, too, is O(m) if I store the task list, which I probably will, though it can be O(1) by making the `a` a generator from the `map`. But it's really not an issue with the constraints provided. Alright, let's write the clean code.\n",
