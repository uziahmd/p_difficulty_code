Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Tackling a Tricky Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem, right? It's all about string replacements and then finding the final result modulo a prime number – a pretty standard competitive programming setup.  The core of it is I need to replace digits in a string (`s`) based on a series of queries, and then interpret the resulting string as a number, ignoring leading zeros, and taking the modulo.\n\nFirst, I realize I can't just build the final string. The length could blow up, potentially exponentially, with the replacements.  That's my initial \"Aha!\" moment. So, I have to think about how to *calculate* the value and length without actually constructing the final string.  Modulo arithmetic is a given, obviously.  And the decimal representation part is straightforward; it’s all about powers of ten.\n\nThe key observation is that when a digit is replaced, its position in the string matters.  Its power of 10 affects the final value.  When a digit, let's say 'd', is replaced by 't', the value gets changed, and all the digits to the right also shift their positions. It’s not just a simple substitution.\n\nThis leads me to the idea of maybe working backward from the final state or using dynamic programming. I'm thinking of defining `value[d]` and `length[d]` for each digit `d`. This will store the final numerical value and length of the replacement chain for each digit, respectively. We'll be updating those values iteratively.\n\nNow, here's where it gets interesting: the length needs to be taken modulo `MOD-1`, not `MOD`, because we're interested in the *power* of ten.  By Fermat's Little Theorem, `10^(MOD-1)` is congruent to 1 modulo `MOD` when `MOD` is prime (and 10 isn’t a multiple of `MOD`). Therefore, to determine the position that a digit affects, we just need the length modulo `MOD-1`. So, `length[d]` will store the length modulo `MOD-1`. That's the core idea! I need to trace the replacement steps of each digit to work out the values.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate string replacements and calculate the final numerical value of the string modulo 10^9 + 7. The key challenge is that the string can become extremely long, so we cannot explicitly construct it. We need to find a way to track the value and length of the transformed string for each digit.\n\nLet `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\nWe need to calculate `10^L mod MOD`. By Fermat's Little Theorem, `10^L mod MOD = 10^(L mod (MOD-1)) mod MOD` (since 10 is not a multiple of MOD). So, for lengths, we only care about `L mod (MOD-1)`. Let `MOD_PHI = MOD - 1 = 10^9 + 6`.\n\nWe can process the queries in reverse order. This is a common technique for replacement problems where the final state is complex.\nLet `val[d]` be the numerical value that a single digit `d` eventually transforms into, and `len[d]` be the length of the string that `d` eventually transforms into.\nInitially, before any queries, each digit `d` transforms into itself. So, for `d` from 0 to 9:\n`val[d] = d`\n`len[d] = 1`\n\nNow, let's process the queries from the last one to the first one. Suppose a query is `di -> ti`. When we process this query in reverse, it means we are determining how `di` transforms. The `ti` string itself might contain digits that have already been affected by later queries (which we've already processed in reverse).\n\nFor a query `di -> ti`:\nThe digit `di` will be replaced by the string `ti`. To find the final `val[di]` and `len[di]`, we need to consider the `val` and `len` of each character in `ti` (which are already updated by queries after this one).\n\nLet `new_val_di = 0` and `new_len_di = 0`.\nWe iterate through the characters `c` in `ti` from right to left (to correctly calculate powers of 10).\nFor each character `c` (which is a digit):\n1. Its value `val[c]` contributes to `new_val_di`.\n2. Its length `len[c]` contributes to `new_len_di`.\nThe contribution of `val[c]` to `new_val_di` is `val[c] * 10^(new_len_di)`.\n\nSo, for `c` in `ti` (from right to left):\n`new_val_di = (val[c] * pow(10, new_len_di, MOD) + new_val_di) % MOD`\n`new_len_di = (new_len_di + len[c]) % MOD_PHI`\n\nAfter iterating through all characters in `ti`, `new_val_di` and `new_len_di` will be the final value and length for the digit `di` *after* this query (and all subsequent queries). We then update `val[di] = new_val_di` and `len[di] = new_len_di`.\n\nAfter processing all `n` queries in reverse order, `val[d]` and `len[d]` will hold the final transformed value and length for each original digit `d`.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the value of the initial string `s`. We iterate through `s` from right to left:\nLet `final_ans = 0` and `current_power_of_10_len = 0`.\nFor each character `c` in `s` (from right to left):\n1. Its value `val[c]` contributes to `final_ans`.\n2. Its length `len[c]` contributes to `current_power_of_10_len`.\nThe contribution of `val[c]` to `final_ans` is `val[c] * 10^(current_power_of_10_len)`.\n\nSo, for `c` in `s` (from right to left):\n`final_ans = (val[c] * pow(10, current_power_of_10_len, MOD) + final_ans) % MOD`\n`current_power_of_10_len = (current_power_of_10_len + len[c]) % MOD_PHI`\n\nThe `final_ans` will be the required result.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n*   Empty `ti`: If `ti` is empty, `new_val_di` will be 0 and `new_len_di` will be 0. This correctly models replacing a digit with an empty string.\n*   Empty `s`: The problem states if `s` is empty, the number is 0. Our algorithm correctly handles this (loop won't run, `final_ans` remains 0).\n*   Leading zeros: \"ignore the leading zeroes\". Our modular arithmetic approach inherently handles this. For example, `007` is `7`. If `s` becomes `007`, `val['0']` will be `0`, so `0 * 10^X + 0 * 10^Y + val['7'] * 10^0` will result in `val['7']`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Initialization: O(10)\n*   Processing queries: `n` queries. For each query `di -> ti`, we iterate through `ti`. The sum of lengths of `ti` is `L_sum <= 10^5`. So, this part is O(`L_sum`).\n*   Final string processing: Iterate through `s`. Length of `s` is `|s| <= 10^5`. So, this part is O(`|s|`).\n*   Total time complexity: O(`|s| + L_sum + n`). This is efficient enough given the constraints.\n*   Space complexity: O(10) for `val` and `len` arrays, O(n) for storing queries.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries_raw = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        queries_raw.append(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n\n    # Parse queries into a list of (digit, replacement_string) tuples\n    queries = []\n    for q_str in queries_raw:\n        parts = q_str.split(\"->\")\n        d_char = parts[0]\n        t_str = parts[1]\n        queries.append((d_char, t_str))\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n    MOD_PHI = 1000000006 # For exponents: L mod (MOD-1)\n\n    # val[d] stores the numerical value that digit 'd' eventually transforms into.\n    # len[d] stores the length of the string that digit 'd' eventually transforms into.\n    # Lengths are modulo MOD_PHI for exponentiation.\n    val = [0] * 10\n    length = [0] * 10\n\n    # Initialize: each digit 'd' transforms into itself, with length 1.\n    for i in range(10):\n        val[i] = i\n        length[i] = 1\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        d_char, t_str = queries[i]\n        d_int = int(d_char)\n\n        current_val_for_d = 0\n        current_len_for_d = 0\n\n        # Iterate through t_str from right to left\n        # This is crucial for correctly calculating powers of 10\n        for char_in_t in reversed(t_str):\n            char_int = int(char_in_t)\n            \n            # The value of char_in_t, which is val[char_int], needs to be\n            # shifted by 10^(current_len_for_d) positions to the left.\n            term_val = (val[char_int] * pow(10, current_len_for_d, MOD)) % MOD\n            current_val_for_d = (current_val_for_d + term_val) % MOD\n            \n            # Add the length of char_in_t's transformed string\n            current_len_for_d = (current_len_for_d + length[char_int]) % MOD_PHI\n        \n        # Update val and length for the digit d_int\n        val[d_int] = current_val_for_d\n        length[d_int] = current_len_for_d\n\n    # Calculate the final value of the initial string s\n    final_ans = 0\n    current_power_of_10_len = 0 # This accumulates the total length of strings to the right\n\n    # Iterate through the initial string s from right to left\n    for char_s in reversed(s):\n        char_int = int(char_s)\n        \n        # The value of char_s, which is val[char_int], needs to be\n        # shifted by 10^(current_power_of_10_len) positions to the left.\n        term_val = (val[char_int] * pow(10, current_power_of_10_len, MOD)) % MOD\n        final_ans = (final_ans + term_val) % MOD\n        \n        # Add the length of char_s's transformed string\n        current_power_of_10_len = (current_power_of_10_len + length[char_int]) % MOD_PHI\n\n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_ans) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
