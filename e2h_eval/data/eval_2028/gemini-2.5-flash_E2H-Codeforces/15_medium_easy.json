They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Understanding Winning Skill Levels in a Tournament**\n\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out which skill levels, let's call them *x*, can actually win this tournament. This tournament has a very specific structure: 2^n teams, n phases, and the game outcome in each phase is determined by a string *s*. If *s_i* is '1', the higher skill wins in phase *i*; if it's '0', the lower skill wins. My goal is to find all the possible values of *x* that allow a team with that skill to win.\n\nThinking through this, a team with skill *x* has to win n games to take the title. The number of games where *x* must be the higher skill is *k* (number of '1's in *s*), and the number of games where it has to be the lower skill is *m* (number of '0's in *s*), and of course, *k + m = n*.\n\nTo win, *x* needs to beat opponents. In the *k* \"higher skill wins\" phases, *x* must be greater than those opponents; in the *m* \"lower skill wins\" phases, *x* must be less than those opponents. This means *x* must be larger than *k* specific values and smaller than *m* specific values.\n\nIt's tempting to think that the smallest *x* that can win is simply *k+1* and the largest is *2^n - m*. The idea is, if you need to be larger than *k* values, starting at 1, the smallest you can be is *k+1*. But my initial attempts with that didn't work.\n\nBut then, when thinking further, I've realized the *opponents* aren't just any numbers. They're the winners of sub-tournaments. A phase's winner comes from *smaller groups* of teams. The rules of each phase aren't really about assigning values to each round; they are always assigning relative skill to win games. The rules state, \"If the round is '1', higher value wins. If it is '0', lower value wins.\" The only thing that changes about a specific round is the set of possible entrants - so in this case, any skill level has a chance to win.\n\nSo, I had to revise my thinking. Let's start with the minimum skill. In order to win, I need *x* to be higher than *k* opponents and lower than *m* others. These have to come from different rounds, with smaller groups of contestants. I can make an assertion, that given an ordering of the skills from 1 to *2^n*, if a particular skill *x* has *k* values greater than it and *m* values less than it, you can create a permutation.\n\nSo, for a minimum, for *x* to win, it needs to be greater than *k* values and less than *m* values. This would mean the winning range of values is [k+1, *2^n - m*]. From this thought process, I figured out the winning skills. It is important to remember that *k + m = n*, where *k* is the number of '1's in *s* and *m* is the number of '0's. These ranges are what I was looking for. Now, I have what I needed to solve the problem.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all possible skill levels `x` that can win a playoff tournament, given a string `s` of length `n` describing the rules for each phase. The tournament has `2^n` teams, and `n` phases. In phase `i` (1-indexed), if `s_i = '0'`, the team with lower skill wins; if `s_i = '1'`, the team with higher skill wins.\n\nLet `num_zeros` be the count of '0's in the string `s`, and `num_ones` be the count of '1's in `s`.\nWe know that `num_zeros + num_ones = n`.\n\nConsider a team with skill `x` that wins the tournament. This team must win `n` games, one in each phase.\nFor each phase `i`:\n- If `s_i = '1'`, the champion `x` must have a higher skill than its opponent in that phase.\n- If `s_i = '0'`, the champion `x` must have a lower skill than its opponent in that phase.\n\nLet `O_1, O_2, ..., O_{num_ones}` be the skills of the opponents `x` faces in phases where `s_i = '1'`.\nLet `P_1, P_2, ..., P_{num_zeros}` be the skills of the opponents `x` faces in phases where `s_i = '0'`.\n\nFor `x` to win, it must satisfy:\n- `x > O_j` for all `j=1, ..., num_ones`.\n- `x < P_k` for all `k=1, ..., num_zeros`.\n\nAll `O_j` and `P_k` values must be distinct, and also distinct from `x`. In total, `x` needs to be greater than `num_ones` values and smaller than `num_zeros` values.\n\nLet's determine the minimum possible value for `x`.\nTo minimize `x`, we want `O_j` values to be as small as possible, and `P_k` values to be just above `x`.\nThe smallest `num_ones` distinct values are `1, 2, ..., num_ones`.\nSo, `x` must be at least `num_ones + 1`.\nThis is the minimum value `x` could possibly take if the opponents could be *any* values.\n\nHowever, the opponents are not arbitrary; they are winners of sub-tournaments.\nConsider the structure of the tournament. The `n` phases are indexed `1, ..., n`.\nA game in phase `i` involves two winners from sub-tournaments of `2^(i-1)` teams.\nThe rule `s_i` applies to all games in phase `i`.\n\nLet's analyze the properties of the winner of a sub-tournament.\nIf `s_i = '0'` for all `i` in a sub-tournament, the winner is the minimum skill in that sub-tournament.\nIf `s_i = '1'` for all `i` in a sub-tournament, the winner is the maximum skill in that sub-tournament.\n\nThe key insight for this problem is how the rules for each phase (`s_i`) affect the range of possible skills for the champion.\nLet `cnt0` be the number of '0's in `s`.\nLet `cnt1` be the number of '1's in `s`.\n\nThe minimum possible skill for a champion `x` is `2^cnt0 + 1` if `s` contains at least one '1'.\nIf `s` contains only '0's (i.e., `cnt1 = 0`), then the minimum skill is `1`.\nThis can be simplified: the minimum skill is `1` if `cnt1 = 0`, and `2^cnt0 + 1` otherwise.\nThis is equivalent to `2^cnt0`. No, this is not right.\n\nLet's re-examine the examples provided:\n1. `n=3, s=\"101\"`. `num_zeros = 1`, `num_ones = 2`. Output: `4 5 6 7`.\n   Minimum is `4`. `num_ones + 1 = 2+1 = 3`. `2^num_zeros + 1 = 2^1 + 1 = 3`.\n   The actual minimum is `2^num_ones + 1` if we reverse `s` and count `0`s. This is getting confusing.\n\nLet's use the definition of `k` as the count of '1's and `m` as the count of '0's.\nThe minimum winning value is `2^k`. No, this is not it.\nThe minimum possible skill for a champion `x` is `2^k + 1` where `k` is the number of '1's in `s`.\nNo, this is wrong.\n\nLet's consider the number of '0's (`zeros_count`) and '1's (`ones_count`) in `s`.\nThe minimum possible winning skill is `1 + zeros_count_in_prefix` where `zeros_count_in_prefix` is the count of '0's in `s`. No.\n\nThe correct logic for the range of winning skills `x` is:\nThe minimum winning skill is `2^num_zeros`.\nThe maximum winning skill is `2^n - 2^num_ones + 1`. This is `2^n - (2^n / 2^num_zeros) + 1`. No.\n\nLet `c0` be the count of '0's in `s`.\nLet `c1` be the count of '1's in `s`.\nThe minimum possible winning skill is `c1 + 1`. This is `1 + s.count('1')`.\nThe maximum possible winning skill is `2^n - c0`. This is `2^n - s.count('0')`.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n1. `n=3, s=\"101\"`. `c0 = 1`, `c1 = 2`.\n   Min: `c1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n   Max: `2^n - c0 = 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7`.\n   Proposed range: `[3, 7]`. Example output: `[4, 7]`. (Min doesn't match)\n\n2. `n=1, s=\"1\"`. `c0 = 0`, `c1 = 1`.\n   Min: `c1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n   Max: `2^n - c0 = 2^1 - 0 = 2`.\n   Proposed range: `[2, 2]`. Example output: `[2]`. (Matches)\n\n3. `n=2, s=\"01\"`. `c0 = 1`, `c1 = 1`.\n   Min: `c1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n   Max: `2^n - c0 = 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`.\n   Proposed range: `[2, 3]`. Example output: `[2 3]`. (Matches)\n\nThe hypothesis `[1 + s.count('1'), 2^n - s.count('0')]` works for two out of three examples. The only discrepancy is the lower bound for `n=3, s=\"101\"`. The example output is `4` while my formula gives `3`.\n\nThe actual minimum winning value is `2^(s.count('0'))`.\nThe actual maximum winning value is `2^n - 2^(s.count('1')) + 1`.\n\nLet `c0 = s.count('0')` and `c1 = s.count('1')`.\nMinimum winning skill: `2^c0`.\nMaximum winning skill: `2^n - 2^c1 + 1`.\n\nLet's test this new hypothesis:\n1. `n=3, s=\"101\"`. `c0 = 1`, `c1 = 2`.\n   Min: `2^c0 = 2^1 = 2`.\n   Max: `2^n - 2^c1 + 1 = 2^3 - 2^2 + 1 = 8 - 4 + 1 = 5`.\n   Proposed range: `[2, 5]`. Example output: `[4, 7]`. (Neither matches)\n\nThe problem is slightly tricky due to the structure and the \"it is possible to find a permutation p\" clause.\nLet's consider the number of teams that a champion `x` must be greater than, and the number of teams it must be smaller than.\nA champion `x` must win `n` games.\nIn `c1` games (where `s_i = '1'`), `x` must be greater than its opponent.\nIn `c0` games (where `s_i = '0'`), `x` must be smaller than its opponent.\n\nThe `c1` opponents must have distinct skills less than `x`.\nThe `c0` opponents must have distinct skills greater than `x`.\nThese `c0 + c1 = n` opponents must also be distinct from `x` and from each other.\nSo, `x` must be greater than `c1` values and smaller than `c0` values.\nThe smallest `x` can be is `c1 + 1`.\nThe largest `x` can be is `2^n - c0`.\n\nThis is the range `[c1 + 1, 2^n - c0]`.\nThis matches `n=1, s=\"1\"` (`[2, 2]`) and `n=2, s=\"01\"` (`[2, 3]`).\nFor `n=3, s=\"101\"`, it gives `[3, 7]`. The example output is `[4, 7]`.\nThis means `3` cannot win in `n=3, s=\"101\"`. Why?\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that are \"affected\" by `x` winning.\nIf `x` wins, it means `x` is the champion.\nThe champion `x` is one of `2^n` initial teams.\nThe number of teams that `x` must be greater than is `2^c1`.\nThe number of teams that `x` must be smaller than is `2^c0`.\nThis implies `x` must be at least `2^c1`.\nAnd `x` must be at most `2^n - 2^c0 + 1`.\n\nLet `c0 = s.count('0')` and `c1 = s.count('1')`.\nThe range of winning skills is `[2^c0, 2^n - 2^c1 + 1]`. Let's verify this.\n1. `n=3, s=\"101\"`. `c0 = 1`, `c1 = 2`.\n   Min: `2^c0 = 2^1 = 2`.\n   Max: `2^n - 2^c1 + 1 = 2^3 - 2^2 + 1 = 8 - 4 + 1 = 5`.\n   Proposed range: `[2, 5]`. Example output: `[4, 7]`. (Still doesn't match any example fully.)\n\nThe correct bounds are derived from considering the \"size\" of the sub-tournaments that the champion's direct opponents come from.\nLet `L` be the number of '0's in `s` and `R` be the number of '1's in `s`.\nThe minimum possible winning value is `2^L`.\nThe maximum possible winning value is `2^n - 2^R + 1`.\n\nLet's use `num_zeros = s.count('0')` and `num_ones = s.count('1')`.\nMinimum winning skill: `2^num_zeros`.\nMaximum winning skill: `2^n - 2^num_ones + 1`.\n\nThis is the formula that correctly matches all example outputs!\n1. `n=3, s=\"101\"`. `num_zeros = 1`, `num_ones = 2`.\n   Min: `2^1 = 2`.\n   Max: `2^3 - 2^2 + 1 = 8 - 4 + 1 = 5`.\n   This is `[2, 5]`. The example output is `[4, 7]`.\n   My formula is still wrong.\n\nLet's re-examine the example outputs and try to reverse engineer the formula.\n`n=3, s=\"101\"` -> `[4, 7]`\n`n=1, s=\"1\"` -> `[2, 2]`\n`n=2, s=\"01\"` -> `[2, 3]`\n\nLet `c0 = s.count('0')` and `c1 = s.count('1')`.\nFor `n=1, s=\"1\"`, `c0=0, c1=1`. Output `[2, 2]`.\nFor `n=2, s=\"01\"`, `c0=1, c1=1`. Output `[2, 3]`.\nFor `n=3, s=\"101\"`, `c0=1, c1=2`. Output `[4, 7]`.\n\nLet's look at the lower bounds: `2, 2, 4`.\n`2^1, 2^1, 2^2`.\nThis is `2^(c1_prime)` where `c1_prime` is the count of '1's in `s` if `s` is reversed? No.\nIt seems to be `2^(number of '1's in s)`. No.\nIt's `2^k` where `k` is the number of '1's in `s` for `n=1, s=\"1\"` (k=1, 2^1=2), and `n=2, s=\"01\"` (k=1, 2^1=2).\nBut for `n=3, s=\"101\"`, `k=2`, so `2^k=4`. This matches!\nSo, `min_winning_skill = 2^(s.count('1'))`.\n\nNow for the upper bounds: `2, 3, 7`.\n`2^1, 2^2-1, 2^3-1`.\nThis is `2^n - (2^0)` for `n=1`.\nThis is `2^n - (2^0)` for `n=2`.\nThis is `2^n - (2^0)` for `n=3`.\nThis is `2^n - 1` if `s` contains at least one '0'.\nFor `n=1, s=\"1\"`, `c0=0`. Max is `2^1 = 2`.\nFor `n=2, s=\"01\"`, `c0=1`. Max is `2^2 - 1 = 3`.\nFor `n=3, s=\"101\"`, `c0=1`. Max is `2^3 - 1 = 7`.\n\nSo, the maximum winning skill is `2^n` if `s` contains no '0's (i.e., `c0 = 0`).\nOtherwise, the maximum winning skill is `2^n - 2^0 = 2^n - 1`.\nThis can be written as `2^n - (1 if c0 > 0 else 0)`.\nNo, this is wrong for `n=1, s=\"1\"`. Here `c0=0`, max is `2^1=2`. This fits `2^n`.\nFor `n=2, s=\"01\"`, `c0=1`. Max is `2^2 - 1 = 3`. This fits `2^n - 1`.\nFor `n=3, s=\"101\"`, `c0=1`. Max is `2^3 - 1 = 7`. This fits `2^n - 1`.\n\nSo, the rules are:\n`min_winning_skill = 2^(s.count('1'))`\n`max_winning_skill = 2^n - (1 if s.count('0') > 0 else 0)`\n\nLet's recheck with the examples one last time:\n1. `n=3, s=\"101\"`. `c0 = 1`, `c1 = 2`.\n   Min: `2^c1 = 2^2 = 4`.\n   Max: `2^n - (1 if c0 > 0 else 0) = 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7`. (Since `c0=1 > 0`)\n   Range: `[4, 7]`. Matches example output.\n\n2. `n=1, s=\"1\"`. `c0 = 0`, `c1 = 1`.\n   Min: `2^c1 = 2^1 = 2`.\n   Max: `2^n - (1 if c0 > 0 else 0) = 2^1 - 0 = 2`. (Since `c0=0`)\n   Range: `[2, 2]`. Matches example output.\n\n3. `n=2, s=\"01\"`. `c0 = 1`, `c1 = 1`.\n   Min: `2^c1 = 2^1 = 2`.\n   Max: `2^n - (1 if c0 > 0 else 0) = 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`. (Since `c0=1 > 0`)\n   Range: `[2, 3]`. Matches example output.\n\nAll examples match this derived formula.\nThe winning integers are all integers in the range `[min_winning_skill, max_winning_skill]`.\n\nFinal formula:\nLet `c1 = s.count('1')` (number of phases where higher skill wins).\nLet `c0 = s.count('0')` (number of phases where lower skill wins).\n`min_val = 2^c1`\n`max_val = 2^n - (2^c0 - 1)`\nNo, this is not it.\n`max_val = 2^n - (1 if c0 > 0 else 0)` is simpler and matches.\n\nThe range of winning skills `x` is `[2^c1, 2^n - (2^c0 - 1)]`.\nLet's use the number of `0`s and `1`s.\n`num_ones = s.count('1')`\n`num_zeros = s.count('0')`\n\n`min_winning_skill = 2^num_ones`\n`max_winning_skill = 2^n - (2^num_zeros - 1)`\n\nLet's re-test this one more time.\n1. `n=3, s=\"101\"`. `num_zeros = 1`, `num_ones = 2`.\n   Min: `2^num_ones = 2^2 = 4`.\n   Max: `2^n - (2^num_zeros - 1) = 2^3 - (2^1 - 1) = 8 - (2 - 1) = 8 - 1 = 7`.\n   Range: `[4, 7]`. Matches example output.\n\n2. `n=1, s=\"1\"`. `num_zeros = 0`, `num_ones = 1`.\n   Min: `2^num_ones = 2^1 = 2`.\n   Max: `2^n - (2^num_zeros - 1) = 2^1 - (2^0 - 1) = 2 - (1 - 1) = 2 - 0 = 2`.\n   Range: `[2, 2]`. Matches example output.\n\n3. `n=2, s=\"01\"`. `num_zeros = 1`, `num_ones = 1`.\n   Min: `2^num_ones = 2^1 = 2`.\n   Max: `2^n - (2^num_zeros - 1) = 2^2 - (2^1 - 1) = 4 - (2 - 1) = 4 - 1 = 3`.\n   Range: `[2, 3]`. Matches example output.\n\nThis formula works for all examples.\n\nThe logic behind `min_winning_skill = 2^num_ones`:\nTo make `x` as small as possible, `x` should be greater than `num_ones` values and smaller than `num_zeros` values.\nThe `num_ones` opponents `O_j` must have skills less than `x`.\nThe `num_zeros` opponents `P_k` must have skills greater than `x`.\nThe minimum possible value for `x` is `2^num_ones`. This means `x` must be greater than at least `2^num_ones - 1` values.\nThis is because in `num_ones` phases, `x` wins by being greater. In these phases, its opponent is the winner of a sub-tournament. The size of the sub-tournament for an opponent in phase `i` is `2^(i-1)`.\nThe minimum skill `x` can have is `2^num_ones`. This means `x` can be `2^num_ones` and win. To do this, all `2^num_ones - 1` values smaller than `x` are assigned to positions such that they are eliminated by `x` or by other teams that `x` doesn't play.\n\nThe logic behind `max_winning_skill = 2^n - (2^num_zeros - 1)`:\nTo make `x` as large as possible, `x` should be smaller than `num_zeros` values and larger than `num_ones` values.\nThe `num_zeros` opponents `P_k` must have skills greater than `x`.\nThe `num_ones` opponents `O_j` must have skills less than `x`.\nThe maximum possible value for `x` is `2^n - (2^num_zeros - 1)`.\nThis means `x` must be smaller than at least `2^num_zeros - 1` values.\n\nThis seems to be the correct approach.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    num_ones = s.count('1')\n    num_zeros = s.count('0')\n\n    # The minimum winning skill is 2 raised to the power of the count of '1's in s.\n    min_winning_skill = 2**num_ones\n\n    # The maximum winning skill is 2^n minus (2 raised to the power of the count of '0's in s) plus 1.\n    # This can be rewritten as 2^n - (2^num_zeros - 1).\n    # Total teams = 2^n.\n    # If a team wins because it has lower skill (s_i = '0'), its opponent must have higher skill.\n    # The number of such \"higher skill\" opponents that can be constructed is 2^num_zeros.\n    # So, the champion must be smaller than 2^num_zeros values (or fewer, if some are not available).\n    # The largest x can be is 2^n - (2^num_zeros - 1).\n    max_winning_skill = (2**n) - (2**num_zeros - 1)\n\n    result = []\n    for x in range(min_winning_skill, max_winning_skill + 1):\n        result.append(str(x))\n\n    sys.stdout.write(\" \".join(result) + \"\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
