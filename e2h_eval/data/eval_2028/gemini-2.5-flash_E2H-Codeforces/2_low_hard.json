Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through an 'X' Shape Checker**\n\nOkay, I need to create a Python script to determine if a character grid forms a valid 'X'. The problem is well-defined, and the rules are clear.  I'm dealing with an `n x n` grid, where `n` is an odd number between 3 and 299.\n\nHere's my thought process:\n\nFirst, I'll need to read the grid size, `n`, and then read the grid itself, storing it in a suitable data structure – probably a list of lists or a list of strings, that will be easiest to index with row and column numbers.\n\nNow, let's break down the logic for checking the 'X' shape. The core idea is to verify the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements separately.\n\nI'll start by assuming the character at the top-left corner is the diagonal character, `diag_char`.  I'll then iterate through the grid, checking cells that belong to either of the main diagonals. A cell is on a diagonal if its row and column indices are the same (`r == c`) or if the sum of its indices equals `n-1` (`r == n - 1 - c`). If any diagonal cell doesn't match `diag_char`, the grid is definitely not an 'X', and I can immediately output \"NO\" and exit.\n\nNext, I need to check the non-diagonal cells.  I'll need to find the first non-diagonal character, `non_diag_char`. Then, I'll iterate through the rest of the grid and check if all non-diagonal cells match this character. If any non-diagonal cell has a character different from `non_diag_char`, it's not an 'X', and I'll output \"NO.\"\n\nFinally, after verifying the diagonals and non-diagonals, I need to ensure that the diagonal character and the non-diagonal character are *different*. If they are the same, it's not an 'X'. I'll print \"NO\" if they're equal.\n\nIf the diagonals all match, the non-diagonals all match, and the two sets of characters are different, then and only then is it a valid 'X', and I'll output \"YES\".\n\nI need to be mindful of a few edge cases. The center cell, given that `n` is always odd, always belongs to both diagonals. But this is okay, because all the diagonals must have the same value. The smallest possible value of n is 3, which is also a special case.\n",
