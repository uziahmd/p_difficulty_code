The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**The Challenge of Opening Chests**\n\nI'm faced with a competitive programming challenge. The objective is to maximize the number of chests I can open. I'm given `n` chests and `m` keys, each with a numerical value. A key can open a chest if the sum of their values is odd, meaning one must be even and the other odd. Each key can be used only once, and each chest can be opened only once. My task is to determine the maximum number of chest-key pairs I can create under these constraints.\n\nFirst, I categorize chests and keys by parity (even or odd). I count the even and odd chests (`count_a_even`, `count_a_odd`) and the even and odd keys (`count_b_even`, `count_b_odd`). The condition for a successful match is that an even chest must be opened with an odd key, and an odd chest with an even key.\n\nThis leads me to a critical insight: I can treat the pairings of even chests/odd keys and odd chests/even keys as independent optimization problems. The maximum number of matches is the sum of the maximum matches in each independent scenario.\n\nTo maximize matches, I recognize that I'm limited by the smaller count in each pair. For even chests and odd keys, I can open `min(count_a_even, count_b_odd)` chests. Similarly, for odd chests and even keys, I can open `min(count_a_odd, count_b_even)` chests. The total maximum number of chests I can open is the sum of these two minima: `min(count_a_even, count_b_odd) + min(count_a_odd, count_b_even)`.\n\nI've carefully considered several examples, including edge cases where there are no matching keys/chests. The logic holds up in each case. Furthermore, my approach involves a single pass through the input data to determine parities, followed by a few arithmetic operations. The time complexity is efficient: O(n+m), and the space is O(n+m) or O(1) depending on how the input is handled. The core of this solution represents an optimal matching strategy for these constraints. I am confident in this solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open given `n` chests with numbers `a_i` and `m` keys with numbers `b_j`. A key `b_j` can open a chest `a_i` if and only if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can be used at most once, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` means that the sum of `a_i` and `b_j` must be odd. This occurs if and only if one of the numbers is even and the other is odd.\nThere are two scenarios for a successful pairing:\n1. `a_i` is even and `b_j` is odd.\n2. `a_i` is odd and `b_j` is even.\n\nNotice that an even number plus an even number is even, and an odd number plus an odd number is even. Therefore, an even chest can only be opened by an odd key, and an odd chest can only be opened by an even key. These two types of pairings are mutually exclusive and independent.\n\nTo maximize the total number of opened chests, we can maximize the number of pairings for each scenario independently and then sum them up.\n\nLet's count the number of chests and keys of each parity:\n- `count_a_even`: Number of chests with an even number.\n- `count_a_odd`: Number of chests with an odd number.\n- `count_b_even`: Number of keys with an even number.\n- `count_b_odd`: Number of keys with an odd number.\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum pairings for each scenario:\n\n1.  **Even chests with odd keys**:\n    We have `count_a_even` even chests and `count_b_odd` odd keys. Each even chest requires one odd key, and each odd key can open one even chest. The maximum number of such pairings is limited by the minimum of the available even chests and odd keys.\n    So, `matches_even_chest_odd_key = min(count_a_even, count_b_odd)`.\n\n2.  **Odd chests with even keys**:\n    Similarly, we have `count_a_odd` odd chests and `count_b_even` even keys. The maximum number of such pairings is limited by the minimum of the available odd chests and even keys.\n    So, `matches_odd_chest_even_key = min(count_a_odd, count_b_even)`.\n\nSince these two types of pairings use different categories of chests and keys, they do not interfere with each other. The total maximum number of chests Neko can open is the sum of the maximums from these two scenarios:\n`total_max_chests = matches_even_chest_odd_key + matches_odd_chest_even_key`\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n` and `m`.\n2. Initialize `count_a_even = 0`, `count_a_odd = 0`, `count_b_even = 0`, `count_b_odd = 0`.\n3. Read the `n` chest numbers (`a_i`). For each `a_i`, check its parity: if `a_i % 2 == 0`, increment `count_a_even`; otherwise, increment `count_a_odd`.\n4. Read the `m` key numbers (`b_j`). For each `b_j`, check its parity: if `b_j % 2 == 0`, increment `count_b_even`; otherwise, increment `count_b_odd`.\n5. Calculate `result = min(count_a_even, count_b_odd) + min(count_a_odd, count_b_even)`.\n6. Print `result`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n=5, m=4`\n`a = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11]`\n`b = [8, 4, 7, 20]`\n\n1. **Count parities for chests (`a`):**\n   - `9` (odd)\n   - `14` (even)\n   - `6` (even)\n   - `2` (even)\n   - `11` (odd)\n   `count_a_even = 3` (`14, 6, 2`)\n   `count_a_odd = 2` (`9, 11`)\n\n2. **Count parities for keys (`b`):**\n   - `8` (even)\n   - `4` (even)\n   - `7` (odd)\n   - `20` (even)\n   `count_b_even = 3` (`8, 4, 20`)\n   `count_b_odd = 1` (`7`)\n\n3. **Calculate pairings:**\n   - Even chests with odd keys: `min(count_a_even, count_b_odd) = min(3, 1) = 1`\n   - Odd chests with even keys: `min(count_a_odd, count_b_even) = min(2, 3) = 2`\n\n4. **Total maximum chests:** `1 + 2 = 3`\n\nThis approach is efficient. It iterates through the chest numbers once (`O(n)`) and key numbers once (`O(m)`). The space complexity is `O(1)` as we only store counts, not the full lists (if we process the input streams directly). Given `n, m <= 10^5`, this solution will be well within typical time limits.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and m from the first line\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read chest numbers.
