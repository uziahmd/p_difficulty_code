Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**The Substitution Conundrum: A Deep Dive**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this competitive programming problem. We're given a string of digits, `s`, and a set of substitution rules: replace digit `d_i` with string `t_i`. The challenge is to determine the final value of the transformed string modulo 10^9 + 7.  The catch?  Directly performing the replacements could lead to a string that blows up in size exponentially.  No good.\n\nThe key insight? We only need the *final* result modulo 10^9 + 7. This means we can focus on the modular value and length of each digit after all transformations.  We'll represent these as `val[d]` and `len[d]`.\n\nInitially, `val[d] = d` and `len[d] = 1` for each digit.\n\nHere's the clever bit:  Instead of processing the queries in the order they're given, we work *backwards*. This \"cascading\" effect is handled neatly if we apply the substitutions in reverse. This ensures that the transformations are based on the *latest* definitions of the digits.  As we reverse the order, when we process a query `di -> ti`, we transform `ti` using the *current* state of the digits.  We'll iterate through the query in reverse, updating the `val[di]` and `len[di]` with the result of transforming `ti`.\n\nWe'll define  `MOD_VAL = 1000000007` and `MOD_LEN = 1000000006` to handle modular arithmetic efficiently.  Crucially, we'll use Fermat's Little Theorem.  We'll update `new_val_for_di` and `new_len_for_di` by iterating through the characters of `ti` and utilizing `pow(10, current_len[c], MOD_VAL)`. After processing the queries, we compute the answer.\n\nWe also have a few special scenarios: If a digit gets transformed into an empty string, both its value and length become 0.  This is a significant detail, making sure this implementation accounts for leading zeroes and empty strings.\n\nWith this approach, we can manage the length explosion by working solely with modular arithmetic. The time complexity is dominated by the string length and sum of lengths of the substitution strings (O(|s| + sum(|ti|)), so this solution is both efficient and robust. Let's start coding.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of digit replacements in a string `s` and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo `10^9 + 7`. The string `s` can grow very large, making direct string manipulation inefficient. The key is to realize that we only need the final numerical value and length for each digit (0-9) after all transformations.\n\nLet `MOD_VAL = 1000000007` be the modulus for the final numerical value.\nLet `MOD_LEN = 1000000006` be the modulus for the length when used as an exponent for powers of 10. This is because by Fermat's Little Theorem, `a^b % M = a^(b % (M-1)) % M` when `M` is a prime number, and `MOD_VAL` is prime.\n\nWe can maintain two arrays, `current_val` and `current_len`, each of size 10.\n*   `current_val[d]` will store the numerical value that digit `d` ultimately transforms into, modulo `MOD_VAL`.\n*   `current_len[d]` will store the length of the string that digit `d` ultimately transforms into, modulo `MOD_LEN`.\n\nInitially, for each digit `d` from 0 to 9:\n*   `current_val[d] = d` (a single digit `d` has value `d`).\n*   `current_len[d] = 1` (a single digit `d` has length 1).\n\nThe queries are given in chronological order. However, to correctly determine the final transformation for each digit, it's more convenient to process the queries in *reverse order*. This is because a query `di -> ti` defines how `di` transforms. If `ti` contains other digits `c`, their transformations `current_val[c]` and `current_len[c]` should reflect their *final* state after all subsequent (earlier in reverse order) queries. By processing in reverse, when we handle `di -> ti`, `current_val[c]` and `current_len[c]` for all `c` in `ti` will already represent their final transformations.\n\n**Processing queries in reverse order:**\nFor each query `di -> ti` (starting from the last query and going backwards to the first):\n1.  Initialize `new_val_for_di = 0` and `new_len_for_di = 0`.\n2.  Iterate through each character `c_char` in the string `ti`:\n    *   Convert `c_char` to an integer `c`.\n    *   Calculate `power_of_10 = pow(10, current_len[c], MOD_VAL)`. This represents `10` raised to the effective length of the string `c` transforms into.\n    *   Update `new_val_for_di`: `new_val_for_di = (new_val_for_di * power_of_10 + current_val[c]) % MOD_VAL`. This effectively concatenates the value of `c`'s transformation to the right of `new_val_for_di`.\n    *   Update `new_len_for_di`: `new_len_for_di = (new_len_for_di + current_len[c]) % MOD_LEN`. This accumulates the lengths.\n3.  After iterating through all characters in `ti`, update `current_val[di] = new_val_for_di` and `current_len[di] = new_len_for_di`.\n\n**Final calculation:**\nAfter all queries are processed, the `current_val` and `current_len` arrays hold the final transformation rules for each digit. Now, apply these rules to the initial string `s`:\n1.  Initialize `final_result_val = 0`.\n2.  Iterate through each character `c_char` in the original string `s`:\n    *   Convert `c_char` to an integer `c`.\n    *   Calculate `power_of_10 = pow(10, current_len[c], MOD_VAL)`.\n    *   Update `final_result_val`: `final_result_val = (final_result_val * power_of_10 + current_val[c]) % MOD_VAL`.\n\nThe value `final_result_val` will be the answer.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n*   **Empty `ti`**: If `ti` is an empty string, `new_val_for_di` will remain `0` and `new_len_for_di` will remain `0`. This correctly represents that the digit `di` effectively vanishes, contributing `0` to the value and `0` to the length. The calculation `(new_val * pow(10, 0, MOD_VAL) + 0)` correctly preserves `new_val`.\n*   **Leading zeros / Empty final string**: The modulo arithmetic naturally handles leading zeros. If the final string `s` (after transformations) becomes `007`, its value is `7`. Our calculation `(current_val * 10^len + digit_val)` correctly produces `7`. If the final string becomes empty (e.g., all digits map to empty strings), `final_result_val` will remain `0`, which is the specified behavior.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Initialization: O(1) for 10 digits.\n*   Processing queries: `N` queries. For each query `di -> ti`, we iterate through `ti`. The total length of all `ti` strings is `sum(|ti|)`. Each character processing involves a `pow` operation, which takes `O(log(MOD_VAL))` time. So, `O(sum(|ti|) * log(MOD_VAL))`.\n*   Final calculation: Iterate through the initial string `s`. Each character takes `O(log(MOD_VAL))` time. So, `O(|s| * log(MOD_VAL))`.\nGiven `|s| <= 10^5` and `sum(|ti|) <= 10^5`, the total complexity is `O((|s| + sum(|ti|)) * log(MOD_VAL))`, which is efficient enough (`(10^5 + 10^5) * log(10^9) approx 2 * 10^5 * 30 = 6 * 10^6` operations).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        di, ti = line.split(\"->\")\n        queries.append((di, ti))\n\n    MOD_VAL = 1000000007\n    # MOD_LEN is used for the exponent in pow(10, exp, MOD_VAL).\n    # By Fermat's Little Theorem, a^b % M = a^(b % (M-1)) % M if M is prime.\n    # Here M = MOD_VAL, so M-1 = 1000000006.\n    MOD_LEN = 1000000006 \n\n    # current_val[d] stores the numerical value that digit d transforms into, modulo MOD_VAL.\n    # current_len[d] stores the length of the string that digit d transforms into, modulo MOD_LEN.\n    # Initialize: each digit d transforms to itself, with length 1.\n    current_val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    current_len = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order to ensure that when a digit 'c' in ti is processed,\n    # current_val[c] and current_len[c] already reflect their final transformations.\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        di_char, ti = queries[i]\n        di = int(di_char)\n\n        new_val_for_di = 0\n        new_len_for_di = 0\n\n        # Calculate the transformed value and length for di based on ti.\n        # Each character c in ti will be replaced by its current_val[c] and current_len[c].\n        for c_char in ti:\n            c = int(c_char)\n            \n            # If current_len[c] is 0 (meaning 'c' transforms to an empty string),\n            # pow(10, 0, MOD_VAL) is 1.\n            # current_val[c] would also be 0 in this case.\n            # So, (new_val_for_di * 1 + 0) = new_val_for_di, correctly not changing the value.\n            power_of_10 = pow(10, current_len[c], MOD_VAL)\n            new_val_for_di = (new_val_for_di * power_of_10 + current_val[c]) % MOD_VAL\n            new_len_for_di = (new_len_for_di + current_len[c]) % MOD_LEN\n            \n        # Update the transformation rules for digit di.\n        current_val[di] = new_val_for_di\n        current_len[di] = new_len_for_di\n\n    # After processing all queries, calculate the final value of the initial string s.\n    final_result_val = 0\n    for c_char in s:\n        c = int(c_char)\n        # pow(10, current_len[c], MOD_VAL) calculates 10^(length of transformed c) % MOD_VAL.\n        # This is used to shift the existing final_result_val by the appropriate number of decimal places.\n        power_of_10 = pow(10, current_len[c], MOD_VAL)\n        final_result_val = (final_result_val * power_of_10 + current_val[c]) % MOD_VAL\n\n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_result_val) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
