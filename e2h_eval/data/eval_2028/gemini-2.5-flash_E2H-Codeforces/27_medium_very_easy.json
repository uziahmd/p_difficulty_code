On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them.

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Optimization for Maximum Non-Decreasing Subsequence Length**\n\nAlright, so I'm tackling this competitive programming challenge.  The gist is this: I've got a sequence of 1s and 2s, and I need to find the longest non-decreasing subsequence I can create after flipping a continuous section of the sequence. The sequence can be up to 2000 elements long, so I need an efficient solution, no brute force allowed.\n\nMy initial thought was to brute-force it, flipping every possible subsegment and then calculating the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence for each result. But that's a dead end, complexity would be O(n^4), too slow.  Given the constraints, I need an O(n^2) or O(n^2 * log(n)) approach.\n\nSince the sequence only contains 1s and 2s, a non-decreasing subsequence is simply a string of 1s followed by a string of 2s.  Finding the length then is just the number of 1s plus the number of 2s in that subsequence.  I need to figure out how the reversal affects this.\n\nFirst, I consider a prefix sum approach to quickly count 1s and 2s in segments of the original array to avoid repeating calculations. So, I will calculate prefix and suffix sums for the counts of 1s and 2s. I will need this to efficiently calculate the contribution of segments that are potentially reversed.\n\nNext, I need to analyze how reversal of subsegments affect the construction of the non-decreasing subsequence. When I flip a segment, I'm basically changing the order of the 1s and 2s within that segment.  Any 1s that were before the flipped segment, can still be part of the solution. Any 2s that are after the flipped segment can be part of the solution.\n\nSo here's my revised strategy: Fix a segment [l, r], flip it, and for each possible split point 'j' try to count the number of 1s before j and number of 2s after j. In the beginning, I thought the optimal 'j' may involve splitting the flipped segment but then I realized any choice will give me a simple max calculation.\n\nI need to compute `count1[j]` (number of 1s up to index `j`) and `count2[j+1]` (number of 2s from index `j+1` to end).\nNow for the computation of the two counts within the subsegment, I can precompute all possible values.\n\nThis means I can iterate through all possible values of l and r for the reversed segment, and then compute the max length for each l and r.\n\nThe core observation is that for a given reversal, the final solution is `(1s before) + (1s in the reversed part) + (2s in the reversed part) + (2s after)`. This is just the sum of the maximum number of 1s before an index and the number of 2s after that index.\n\nI can make this faster by precalculating prefix and suffix counts of 1s and 2s in the original array. With that, and by fixing l and r (O(n^2)), I need to find the optimum place, which is an easy O(n) iteration for all the possible 'j' splits. This leads me to an O(n^3) time complexity.\n\nThe tricky part here is getting the `O(n^2)` solution.  I figured I have a few parts for the final LNDS. I can fix an l and r and try and compute the values in O(1). From there, I need an efficient approach for counting the `1s` in the reversed segment as part of the overall process. This can be precomputed.\n\nLet's say `num1[i]` is the number of 1s and `num2[i]` the number of 2s in the array up to position `i`. The array can be broken down into: prefix `[1, l-1]`, reversed subsegment `[l, r]` and suffix `[r+1, n]`.\n\nFor `l, r`: I need to maximize the sum of 1s and 2s to yield the maximum LNDS length. I need to iterate j to count 1s and 2s. For l to j, they become 1s and from j to r they become 2s. Now, by splitting and fixing my segments, it leads to a simple solution. I can iterate through all possible l, r (O(n^2)) and then from [l, r] calculate the optimum split point.\n\nThe calculation of the split point is an O(n) loop",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum possible length of a non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing an arbitrary subsegment `[l, r]` of a given sequence `a`. The sequence `a` consists only of 1s and 2s, and its length `n` is up to 2000.\n\nA non-decreasing subsequence consisting only of 1s and 2s must be of the form `1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2`. This means we can find an index `j` (from `0` to `n`) such that all 1s in the LNDS are chosen from elements at indices `1` to `j`, and all 2s are chosen from elements at indices `j+1` to `n`. The length of such an LNDS is simply the count of 1s in `b_1, ..., b_j` plus the count of 2s in `b_{j+1}, ..., b_n`, where `b` is the modified sequence.\n\nLet's define `num1[i]` as the count of 1s in the original sequence `a_1, ..., a_i`, and `num2[i]` as the count of 2s in `a_1, ..., a_i`. These can be precomputed in O(N) time. `num1[0]` and `num2[0]` are 0.\n\nWhen we choose an interval `[l, r]` (1-indexed) to reverse:\n- Elements `a_1, ..., a_{l-1}` remain unchanged.\n- Elements `a_{r+1}, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.\n- Elements `a_l, ..., a_r` are reversed. The element `a_i` (original index) becomes `b_{l+r-i}`.\n\nWe need to maximize `(count of 1s in b[1...j]) + (count of 2s in b[j+1...n])` over all `1 <= l <= r <= n` and `0 <= j <= n`.\n\nLet's analyze the counts for a fixed `l, r` and a split point `j`:\n\n1.  **Case 1: `j < l`**\n    The split point `j` is before the reversed segment.\n    -   1s come from `b_1, ..., b_j`, which are `a_1, ..., a_j`. Count: `num1[j]`.\n    -   2s come from `b_{j+1}, ..., b_n`. This includes `a_{j+1}, ..., a_{l-1}` (original), `a_l, ..., a_r` (reversed, but effectively all 2s within this segment contribute), and `a_{r+1}, ..., a_n` (original).\n        Count: `(num2[l-1] - num2[j])` + `(num2[r] - num2[l-1])` + `(num2[n] - num2[r])` = `num2[n] - num2[j]`.\n    -   Total length: `num1[j] + num2[n] - num2[j]`.\n\n2.  **Case 2: `j >= r`**\n    The split point `j` is after the reversed segment.\n    -   1s come from `b_1, ..., b_j`. This includes `a_1, ..., a_{l-1}` (original), `a_l, ..., a_r` (reversed, but effectively all 1s within this segment contribute), and `a_{r+1}, ..., a_j` (original).\n        Count: `num1[l-1]` + `(num1[r] - num1[l-1])` + `(num1[j] - num1[r])` = `num1[j]`.\n    -   2s come from `b_{j+1}, ..., b_n`, which are `a_{j+1}, ..., a_n`. Count: `num2[n] - num2[j]`.\n    -   Total length: `num1[j] + num2[n] - num2[j]`.\n\n    Notice that in both Case 1 and Case 2, the total length is `num1[j] + num2[n] - num2[j]`. This is the LNDS length if *no segment was reversed*. So, these cases contribute to the baseline maximum LNDS of the original array. We can calculate `max_original_LNDS = max_{0 <= j <= n} (num1[j] + num2[n] - num2[j])` once.\n\n3.  **Case 3: `l <= j < r`**\n    The split point `j` is inside the reversed segment `[l, r]`.\n    -   1s come from:\n        -   `a_1, ..., a_{l-1}` (original prefix): `num1[l-1]`\n        -   Elements `a_x` such that `l <= l+r-x <= j` and `a_x = 1`. This means `l+r-j <= x <= r`. So, 1s from `a_{l+r-j}, ..., a_r`. Count: `num1[r] - num1[l+r-j-1]`.\n    -   2s come from:\n        -   Elements `a_x` such that `j+1 <= l+r-x <= r` and `a_x = 2`. This means `l <= x <= l+r-(j+1)`. So, 2s from `a_l, ..., a_{l+r-j-1}`. Count: `num2[l+r-j-1] - num2[l-1]`.\n        -   `a_{r+1}, ..., a_n` (original suffix): `num2[n] - num2[r]`.\n\n    Total length for `l <= j < r`:\n    `L(l, r, j) = num1[l-1] + (num1[r] - num1[l+r-j-1]) + (num2[l+r-j-1] - num2[l-1]) + (num2[n] - num2[r])`\n\n    Let `k = l+r-j-1`. As `j` goes from `l` to `r-1`, `k` goes from `r-1` down to `l`.\n    The expression becomes:\n    `L(l, r, k) = num1[l-1] + (num1[r] - num1[k]) + (num2[k] - num2[l-1]) + (num2[n] - num2[r])`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `L(l, r, k) = (num1[l-1] - num2[l-1]) + (num1[r] + num2[n] - num2[r]) + (num2[k] - num1[k])`\n\n    For fixed `l` and `r`, we need to maximize `L(l, r, k)` by choosing `k` in the range `[l, r-1]`.\n    The term `(num1[l-1] - num2[l-1]) + (num1[r] + num2[n] - num2[r])` is constant for fixed `l, r`.\n    So, we need to find `max_{l <= k <= r-1} (num2[k] - num1[k])`.\n\nThis leads to an `O(N^2)` algorithm:\n1.  Compute `num1` and `num2` prefix sum arrays. `num1[0]=0, num2[0]=0`.\n    For `i` from `1` to `n`:\n    `num1[i] = num1[i-1] + (1 if a[i-1] == 1 else 0)`\n    `num2[i] = num2[i-1] + (1 if a[i-1] == 2 else 0)`\n    (Using 0-indexed `a` for convenience, so `a[i-1]` is the i-th element. `num1[i]` means count up to index `i-1`.)\n\n2.  Initialize `max_LNDS = 0`.\n\n3.  Calculate `max_original_LNDS`:\n    For `j` from `0` to `n`:\n    `max_LNDS = max(max_LNDS, num1[j] + (num2[n] - num2[j]))`\n\n4.  Iterate over all possible `l` and `r` for the reversal segment:\n    For `l` from `1` to `n`:\n        For `r` from `l` to `n`:\n            // Calculate the maximum `num2[k] - num1[k]` for `k` in `[l, r-1]`\n            `max_diff_k = -infinity` (or a very small number)\n            If `l <= r-1` (i.e., the segment `[l, r-1]` is not empty):\n                For `k` from `l` to `r-1`:\n                    `max_diff_k = max(max_diff_k, num2[k] - num1[k])`\n            Else (if `l=r`, there is no `k` in `[l, r-1]`, this term is 0):\n                `max_diff_k = 0`\n\n            `current_LNDS = (num1[l-1] - num2[l-1]) + (num1[r] + num2[n] - num2[r]) + max_diff_k`\n            `max_LNDS = max(max_LNDS, current_LNDS)`\n\n5.  Print `max_LNDS`.\n\nThe maximum value of `num2[k] - num1[k]` for `k` in `[l, r-1]` can be computed efficiently. For a fixed `l`, as `r` increases, the range `[l, r-1]` expands. We can maintain the maximum `num2[k] - num1[k]` encountered so far for `k` in `[l, r-1]`.\n\nRefined Step 4:\nFor `l` from `1` to `n`:\n    `max_diff_k = -infinity`\n    For `r` from `l` to `n`:\n        If `l == r`: // Segment `[l, r]` has only one element. No `k` in `[l, r-1]`.\n            `current_LNDS = (num1[l-1] - num2[l-1]) + (num1[r] + num2[n] - num2[r])`\n            // This simplifies to `num1[l-1] + num1[r] - num1[l] + num2[l] - num2[l-1] + num2[n] - num2[r]`.\n            // If `a[l-1]` is 1, `num1[r]-num1[l-1]=1`, `num2[r]-num2[l-1]=0`.\n            // If `a[l-1]` is 2, `num1[r]-num1[l-1]=0`, `num2[r]-num2[l-1]=1`.\n            // This is `num1[l-1] + (a[l-1]==1) + (a[l-1]==2) + num2[n] - num2[r]`.\n            // This is `num1[l-1] + 1 + num2[n] - num2[r]`. Not quite.\n            // The formula `(num1[l-1] - num2[l-1]) + (num1[r] + num2[n] - num2[r]) + max_diff_k` is for `l <= j < r`.\n            // If `l=r`, there is no `j` such that `l <= j < r`. So `max_diff_k` should be 0.\n            // When `l=r`, the segment `[l, r]` has one element `a_l`. Reversing it doesn't change anything.\n            // So for `l=r`, the LNDS is just `max_original_LNDS`. We don't need to recompute it.\n            // The `max_LNDS` already handles this case.\n            pass\n        Else (`l < r`): // Segment `[l, r]` has at least two elements.\n            // `k` can be `r-1`.

Space complexity is `O(N)` for prefix sum arrays.\nGiven `N <= 2000`, `N^2 = 4 * 10^6` operations, which is well within typical time limits (usually `10^8` operations per second).\n\nExample 1: `a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`, `n = 4`\n`num1 = [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`\n`num2 = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]`\n\n`max_original_LNDS`:\nj=0: `num1[0] + (num2[4]-num2[0]) = 0 + (2-0) = 2`\nj=1: `num1[1] + (num2[4]-num2[1]) = 1 + (2-0) = 3`\nj=2: `num1[2] + (num2[4]-num2[2]) = 1 + (2-1) = 2`\nj=3: `num1[3] + (num2[4]-num2[3]) = 2 + (2-1) = 3`\nj=4: `num1[4] + (num2[4]-num2[4]) = 2 + (2-2) = 2`\n`max_LNDS = 3` (e.g., `1,2,2` from `a_1, a_2, a_4`)\n\nIterate `l, r`:\n`l=1`:\n  `r=1`: `max_LNDS` is 3.
