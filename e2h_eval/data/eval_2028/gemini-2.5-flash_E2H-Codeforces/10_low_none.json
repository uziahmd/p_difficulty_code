Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Decoding the Golorp's Diet: A Python Script Challenge**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem: \"Feed the Golorp.\" The goal is to write a Python script that figures out the lexicographically smallest set of variable values that satisfy the Golorp's \"diet,\" or, essentially, its program. My task is to solve it.\n\nThe Golorp's diet is represented by a string, its \"name,\" which looks something like `?(<expression>):-<conditions>`. This is where it gets interesting. I need to break down this string and understand what each part means to begin solving.\n\nFirst, I see the Golorp name structure is in a very specific format: `?(<expression>):-<conditions>`. It's like a function definition. The part before the colon is an expression involving variables represented as underscores (`_`) and arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /). The part after is a set of conditions that must be true for the Golorp to be \"fed.\"\n\nThe samples provided are crucial:  I've already analyzed them and I'm convinced the `_` within the expression represents input variables. The task is to calculate the expression using different variable values, check if the calculated expression values satisfy all the conditions, and then pick the lexicographically smallest sequence of variables.\n\nI need to parse the Golorp name into its expression and conditions components. The `):-` is the key separator.  Then, I'll need to work out a strategy to parse the expression itself and the conditions separately. The critical part is knowing that the variables `_` take values from 0 to 9.\n\nI need to come up with a plan to evaluate the expression for different variable assignments and check the conditions. I'll need a systematic way to try out combinations of variable values, starting with the lexicographically smallest and working upwards. Maybe recursion? Backtracking? I'm not sure yet. Ultimately, I need a reliable and efficient way to explore possible solutions.  It's definitely the key to this problem. I also need to be careful with integer division.\n\nOnce I have a satisfying variable assignment, I need to check whether it fits the Golorp diet. It also has to be in lexicographical order. The conditions appear to be simple comparisons, so that part looks straightforward.\n\nRight now, my main focus is on parsing the Golorp name correctly and creating a solid framework for evaluating the expression and conditions efficiently. This feels like an interesting problem, a combination of parsing and search. It's a nice challenge.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values (digits 0-9) that satisfies a given Golorp's \"diet\" defined by its name. The name consists of an arithmetic expression and a set of conditions.\n\n**1. Parsing the Golorp's Name:**\n\nA Golorp's name is structured as `?(<expression>):-<conditions>.`.\nWe first split the name into the expression part and the conditions part using `):-`.\n\n*   **Expression Part:** `?(<expression>)`\n    *   We extract the content inside the parentheses.\n    *   This expression consists of `_` (variables) and operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.\n    *   Each `_` represents a distinct input variable. We count the total number of `_` characters in the expression to determine `N`, the number of input variables.\n    *   We replace each `_` with a placeholder like `v[i]` where `i` is the index of the variable (0 to N-1). This allows us to evaluate the expression later with specific variable values. For example, `_-_` becomes `v[0]-v[1]`.\n    *   The result of this expression is the main value `R`.\n\n*   **Conditions Part:** `<condition1>,<condition2>,...`\n    *   Each condition is of the form `operand1 <operator> operand2`. Operators can be `>`, `<`, `=`.\n    *   Operands can be `_` (referring to input variables) or `R` (referring to the result of the main expression).\n    *   We replace `_` with `v[i]` (using a new counter for `_`s in conditions, distinct from the expression's `_`s if needed, though usually they refer to the same set of input variables).\n    *   We replace `R` with the actual calculated value of the expression.\n\n**Crucial Clarification on `_` and `R`:**\nThe problem implicitly defines `_` in the conditions as referring to the *input variables* that were first encountered in the expression, in order. `R` refers to the final result of the expression. This is a standard interpretation in such problems.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__`**\n\n1.  **Expression:** `_-_/___*__`\n    *   Count `_`: 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 7 `_`s. So, `N=7` input variables.\n    *   Replace `_` with `v[i]`: `v[0]-v[1]/v[2]v[3]v[4]*v[5]v[6]`\n    *   Wait, `___` is not `v[2]v[3]v[4]`. `___` means `_` * 3 times. This implies concatenation of digits to form a number. This is a common competitive programming convention for `_` sequences. `___` means a 3-digit number.\n    *   Correct Interpretation: Each sequence of `_`s forms a multi-digit number. `_` is a single-digit variable. `__` is a two-digit number `10*v[i] + v[i+1]`.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate based on samples:\n        *   `_-_/___*__`\n        *   `_` (1st var)\n        *   `-`\n        *   `_` (2nd var)\n        *   `/`\n        *   `___` (3rd, 4th, 5th vars)\n        *   `*`\n        *   `__` (6th, 7th vars)\n        *   Total `N=7` variables.\n        *   The expression becomes: `v[0] - v[1] / (100*v[2] + 10*v[3] + v[4]) * (10*v[5] + v[6])`.\n        *   This seems more robust.\n\n2.  **Conditions:** `___>__`\n    *   Count `_`: 3 + 2 = 5 `_`s. These refer to variables *after* the initial `N` variables from the expression. This is tricky.\n    *   Alternative: `_` in conditions refer to the *same* pool of `N` variables, re-indexed.\n    *   Yet another alternative (and likely correct, given problem context): The problem states \"Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9\". \"Output lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values\". This implies *all* `_` characters across the *entire* name (expression and conditions) are distinct input variables, and their order of appearance determines their index in the output sequence.\n\nLet's re-parse with this assumption: **All `_` characters encountered are distinct variables, indexed sequentially.**\n\n**Revised Parsing Strategy:**\n\n1.  Initialize `var_count = 0`.\n2.  Iterate through the Golorp's name string.\n3.  When an `_` is found:\n    *   Replace it with `v[var_count]`.\n    *   Increment `var_count`.\n4.  After all `_` are replaced, `var_count` is the total number of input variables `N`.\n5.  Now, the expression and conditions are transformed into Python-executable strings involving `v[i]` and operators.\n6.  The result of the expression part is `R`. This will be defined as `R = eval(<transformed_expression>)`.\n7.  The conditions will be evaluated using `eval(<transformed_condition>)`.\n\n**Example: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__`**\n\n1.  **Initial string:** `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__`\n2.  **Replace `_`:**\n    *   `v[0]` for 1st `_`\n    *   `v[1]` for 2nd `_`\n    *   `v[2]` for 3rd `_`\n    *   `v[3]` for 4th `_`\n    *   `v[4]` for 5th `_`\n    *   `v[5]` for 6th `_`\n    *   `v[6]` for 7th `_`\n    *   `v[7]` for 8th `_`\n    *   `v[8]` for 9th `_`\n    *   `v[9]` for 10th `_`\n    *   `v[10]` for 11th `_`\n    *   `v[11]` for 12th `_`\n    *   Total `N = 12` variables.\n3.  **Transformed string:** `?(v[0]-v[1]/v[2]v[3]v[4]*v[5]v[6]):-v[7]v[8]v[9]>v[10]v[11]`\n4.  **Expression part:** `v[0]-v[1]/v[2]v[3]v[4]*v[5]v[6]`\n    *   This still has `v[2]v[3]v[4]`. This needs to be `(100*v[2] + 10*v[3] + v[4])`.\n    *   And `v[5]v[6]` needs to be `(10*v[5] + v[6])`.\n    *   So, the expression is `v[0]-v[1]/(100*v[2]+10*v[3]+v[4])*(10*v[5]+v[6])`.\n5.  **Conditions part:** `v[7]v[8]v[9]>v[10]v[11]`\n    *   This needs to be `(100*v[7]+10*v[8]+v[9]) > (10*v[10]+v[11])`.\n6.  **Final `N` is 12.**\n\nThis revised strategy makes `N` explicit and handles multi-digit numbers correctly.\n\n**2. Generating and Testing Variable Sequences:**\n\n*   We need to find a sequence `v[0], v[1], ..., v[N-1]` where each `v[i]` is a digit from 0 to 9.\n*   We want the lexicographically smallest sequence. This means we should iterate through possible sequences in lexicographical order.\n*   A nested loop (or `itertools.product`) is suitable for this. `itertools.product(range(10), repeat=N)` will generate all sequences from `(0,0,...,0)` to `(9,9,...,9)`.\n\n**3. Evaluation Function:**\n\nFor each generated sequence `v_tuple` (e.g., `(0,0,1,0)`):\n\n1.  Create a dictionary or list `v` where `v[i]` holds `v_tuple[i]`.\n2.  **Evaluate the Expression:**\n    *   The expression string (e.g., `v[0]-v[1]/(100*v[2]+10*v[3]+v[4])*(10*v[5]+v[6])`) needs to be evaluated.\n    *   **Division by Zero Check:** If any denominator `(100*v[2]+10*v[3]+v[4])` becomes zero, this sequence is invalid. `eval()` would raise `ZeroDivisionError`. We should catch this and discard the sequence.\n    *   **Integer Division:** Python's `/` operator performs float division. The problem implies integer arithmetic (as variables are digits). We should use `//` for integer division.\n    *   **Result `R`:** Store the result of the expression.\n    *   **Constraints on `R`:** The problem states \"Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9\". This usually implies intermediate results must also be within a reasonable range, or at least not be fractional. If `R` is negative or outside 0-9, it might be an issue. However, the samples suggest `R` can be any integer, as long as conditions are met. Let's assume `R` can be any integer for now.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Conditions:**\n    *   For each condition string (e.g., `(100*v[7]+10*v[8]+v[9]) > (10*v[10]+v[11])`), evaluate it using `eval()`.\n    *   All conditions must evaluate to `True`. If any is `False`, this sequence is invalid.\n\n4.  If all checks pass (no division by zero, all conditions true), then `v_tuple` is a valid sequence. Since we iterate lexicographically, the first one found is the answer. Convert it to a string and print.\n\n**4. No Solution:**\n\nIf `itertools.product` finishes without finding any valid sequence, then it's impossible to feed the Golorp. Print \"false\".\n\n**Refined Parsing for Multi-digit Numbers:**\n\nInstead of replacing `_` with `v[i]` and then manually grouping them, it's better to parse the `_` sequences directly.\n\nLet's use a tokenizer-like approach:\n\n1.  Scan the input string.\n2.  If `_` is found, count consecutive `_`s to determine the number of digits.\n    *   For `k` consecutive `_`s, generate an expression `(10**(k-1)*v[idx] + 10**(k-2)*v[idx+1] + ... + v[idx+k-1])`.\n    *   Increment `idx` by `k`.\n3.  Operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, comparison operators `>`, `<`, `=`, and parentheses `(`, `)` are kept as is.\n4.  The special `R` in conditions is replaced by the evaluated expression string.\n\n**Example: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__`**\n\n1.  **Expression part:** `_-_/___*__`\n    *   `_`: `v[0]` (idx=0, k=1)\n    *   `-`: `-`\n    *   `_`: `v[1]` (idx=1, k=1)\n    *   `/`: `/`\n    *   `___`: `(100*v[2]+10*v[3]+v[4])` (idx=2, k=3)\n    *   `*`: `*`\n    *   `__`: `(10*v[5]+v[6])` (idx=5, k=2)\n    *   `current_var_idx` after expression: `7`.\n    *   **Transformed Expression:** `v[0]-v[1]/(100*v[2]+10*v[3]+v[4])*(10*v[5]+v[6])`\n\n2.  **Conditions part:** `___>__`\n    *   `___`: `(100*v[7]+10*v[8]+v[9])` (idx=7, k=3)\n    *   `>`: `>`\n    *   `__`: `(10*v[10]+v[11])` (idx=10, k=2)\n    *   `current_var_idx` after conditions: `12`.\n    *   **Transformed Condition:** `(100*v[7]+10*v[8]+v[9]) > (10*v[10]+v[11])`\n\n3.  Total `N = 12` variables.\n\nThis approach is much cleaner. We'll need a helper function to perform this transformation.\n\n**Python `eval()` and `exec()`:**\n\n*   `eval(expression_string, globals_dict, locals_dict)`: Evaluates a single expression. We can pass a dictionary `{'v': v_list}` as `locals_dict` to make `v[i]` accessible.\n*   `exec(statement_string, globals_dict, locals_dict)`: Executes a statement. Used for defining `R`.\n\n**Final Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **`parse_golorp_name(name_str)` function:**\n    *   Initializes `var_idx = 0`.\n    *   Splits `name_str` into `expression_raw` and `conditions_raw`.\n    *   Helper function `transform_part(part_str, current_var_idx)`:\n        *   Iterates through `part_str`.\n        *   If `_` is found, counts `k` consecutive `_`s.\n        *   Constructs `(10**(k-1)*v[idx] + ... + v[idx+k-1])` and appends to result. Updates `current_var_idx += k`.\n        *   Appends operators/parentheses as is.\n        *   Handles `R` by replacing it with a placeholder `__R_PLACEHOLDER__`.\n        *   Returns transformed string and updated `current_var_idx`.\n    *   Calls `transform_part` for `expression_raw` to get `transformed_expr_str` and `total_vars_needed`.\n    *   Calls `transform_part` for `conditions_raw` to get `transformed_conds_str` and `total_vars_needed` (this will update `total_vars_needed` if conditions introduce more `_`s).\n    *   Splits `transformed_conds_str` by `,` into a list of individual condition strings.\n    *   Returns `transformed_expr_str`, `list_of_transformed_cond_strs`, `total_vars_needed`.\n\n2.  **Main Logic:**\n    *   Read input `name_str`.\n    *   Call `parse_golorp_name`.\n    *   Iterate `v_tuple` using `itertools.product(range(10), repeat=total_vars_needed)`.\n        *   For each `v_tuple`:\n            *   Create `v = list(v_tuple)`.\n            *   Initialize `scope = {'v': v, 'R': None}`.\n            *   **Evaluate Expression:**\n                *   Use `try-except ZeroDivisionError`.\n                *   `R_val = eval(transformed_expr_str.replace('/', '//'), {}, scope)` (using integer division `//`).\n                *   `scope['R'] = R_val`.\n            *   **Evaluate Conditions:**\n                *   Assume `all_conditions_met = True`.\n                *   For each `cond_str` in `list_of_transformed_cond_strs`:\n                    *   Replace `__R_PLACEHOLDER__` with `str(scope['R'])` in `cond_str`.\n                    *   `if not eval(cond_str, {}, scope):`\n                        *   `all_conditions_met = False`\n                        *   `break`\n            *   If `all_conditions_met` is `True`:\n                *   Print `\"\".join(map(str, v_tuple))`.\n                *   Exit.\n    *   If loop finishes, print \"false\".\n\n**Edge Cases & Details:**\n\n*   **Empty conditions:** If `conditions_raw` is empty (e.g., `?(expr):-.`), `list_of_transformed_cond_strs` will be `['']`. An empty string evaluates to `False` in `eval()`, which is incorrect. An empty list of conditions should mean no conditions to check. Handle this by checking if `cond_str` is non-empty before evaluating.\n*   **Single `_` in conditions:** `R>_` is valid.\n*   **Order of operations:** `eval()` handles this correctly.\n*   **Integer division:** Essential for `/`.\n*   **Input string length:** Up to 1024 characters. `N` could be up to 1024. `10^1024` is too large to iterate. This indicates that `N` will be much smaller. The examples show `N` up to 12. `10^12` is feasible (1 trillion iterations). `10^13` is pushing it. Let's assume `N` will be around 10-13 max.\n\nLet's refine the `transform_part` function to handle `R` more robustly. Instead of replacing `__R_PLACEHOLDER__` in the final `eval`, we can use a custom dictionary for `eval`'s `locals` argument.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    name_str = input()\n\n    # Split into expression and conditions\n    parts = name_str[2:].split('):-')\n    expression_raw = parts[0]\n    conditions_raw = parts[1].strip('.')\n\n    transformed_expression = []\n    transformed_conditions = []\n    \n    var_idx_counter = 0\n\n    # Helper to process a segment (expression or condition part)\n    # It returns the transformed string and the updated var_idx_counter\n    def process_segment(segment_str, current_var_idx):\n        transformed_segment = []\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(segment_str):\n            if segment_str[i] == '_':\n                start_underscore = i\n                while i < len(segment_str) and segment_str[i] == '_':\n                    i += 1\n                num_underscores = i - start_underscore\n                \n                # Construct multi-digit number expression\n                # e.g., for '___' it's (100*v[idx] + 10*v[idx+1] + v[idx+2])\n                if num_underscores == 1:\n                    transformed_segment.append(f\"v[{current_var_idx}]\")\n                else:\n                    multi_digit_expr = []\n                    for k in range(num_underscores):\n                        power_of_10 = 10**(num_underscores - 1 - k)\n                        multi_digit_expr.append(f\"{power_of_10}*v[{current_var_idx + k}]\")\n                    transformed_segment.append(\"(\" + \"+\".join(multi_digit_expr) + \")\")\n                current_var_idx += num_underscores\n            elif segment_str[i] == 'R':\n                transformed_segment.append(\"R_val\") # Placeholder for R\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                # Operators, parentheses, etc.\n                if segment_str[i] == '/':\n                    transformed_segment.append('//') # Use integer division\n                else:\n                    transformed_segment.append(segment_str[i])\n                i += 1\n        return \"\".join(transformed_segment), current_var_idx\n\n    # Process expression part\n    transformed_expression_str, var_idx_counter = process_segment(expression_raw, var_idx_counter)\n    total_vars_needed = var_idx_counter # Number of variables from expression\n\n    # Process conditions part\n    # Split conditions by comma, then process each one\n    raw_conditions_list = conditions_raw.split(',')\n    for cond_raw in raw_conditions_list:\n        if not cond_raw.strip(): # Skip empty conditions\n            continue\n        transformed_cond_str, var_idx_counter = process_segment(cond_raw.strip(), var_idx_counter)\n        transformed_conditions.append(transformed_cond_str)\n    \n    total_vars_needed = var_idx_counter # Final total variables\n\n    # Iterate through all possible variable assignments\n    for v_tuple in itertools.product(range(10), repeat=total_vars_needed):\n        v = list(v_tuple) # Convert tuple to list for easier access in scope\n        \n        scope = {'v': v} # Local scope for eval\n\n        try:\n            # Evaluate the expression\n            # Python's eval needs the variable 'v' to be in its local scope\n            R_val = eval(transformed_expression_str, {}, scope)\n            scope['R_val'] = R_val # Store R_val in scope for conditions\n            \n            # Evaluate conditions\n            all_conditions_met = True\n            for cond_str in transformed_conditions:\n                if not eval(cond_str, {}, scope):\n                    all_conditions_met = False\n                    break\n            \n            if all_conditions_met:\n                print(\"\".join(map(str, v_tuple)))\n                return # Found the lexicographically smallest, exit\n                \n        except ZeroDivisionError:\n            # This sequence of variables results in division by zero, so it's invalid.\n            continue\n        except Exception: # Catch other potential eval errors (e.g., invalid syntax if parsing is wrong)\n            # For competitive programming, usually assume inputs are valid unless specified.\n            # But it's good practice to be aware.\n            continue\n\n    print(\"false\") # No valid sequence found\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
