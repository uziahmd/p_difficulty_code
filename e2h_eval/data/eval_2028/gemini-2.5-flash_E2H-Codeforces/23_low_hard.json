            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Mahjong Tile Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a mahjong problem where I need to figure out the fewest tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to make a valid group (a \"mentsu\"). I'm given three initial tiles and the goal is to form either a \"koutsu\" (a triplet of identical tiles) or a \"shuntsu\" (a sequence of consecutive numbered tiles in the same suit).  I'm thinking, \"Let's approach this systematically.\"\n\nFirst, I've got to consider the input – those three tile strings – and the expected output, which will be 0, 1, or 2 draws.  A zero-draw answer means I can make a mentsu with what I've got.\n\nMy initial thought is to analyze the simplest case first: *Can I create a mentsu right away?*  That is, with zero draws.  I need to check for either a koutsu (three of a kind) or a shuntsu (a sequence in the same suit).  To check for a koutsu, I just see if all three tiles are identical. For a shuntsu, I need to confirm the same suit and that the numbers are sequential.\n\nIf the zero-draw option fails, I've got to consider drawing one tile. With one draw, the question becomes: can I form a mentsu with any three of the four tiles? I must check every possible combination using those tiles. To do this, I am thinking of two possible scenarios: making a koutsu with one draw (having two tiles the same among the initial three) or making a shuntsu with one draw (having two tiles that are consecutive).\n\nSo, if I can't form a mentsu initially, I'll need to see if two of my initial three tiles, combined with a potential fourth tile, can form a koutsu or shuntsu.  That means checking to see if I have a pair in my starting hand for a koutsu.  If so, I can draw the matching tile. If that doesn't work, then I check if I have two tiles that can form a shuntsu by drawing a third.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra suited tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be either a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit). She starts with three tiles.\n\nLet the three input tiles be `t1, t2, t3`. We need to determine if 0, 1, or 2 draws are needed.\n\nFirst, let's parse the input tiles into a more manageable format, e.g., a list of tuples `(number, suit)`. For example, \"1s\" becomes `(1, 's')`. It's also helpful to sort the tiles to simplify sequence checks.\n\n**0 Draws:**\nCheck if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu.\n1.  **Koutsu**: Are all three tiles identical? `t1 == t2 == t3`.\n2.  **Shuntsu**: Are all three tiles of the same suit, and their numbers form a sequence (e.g., `x, x+1, x+2`)? To check this, sort the tiles by number. If they are `(n, s), (n+1, s), (n+2, s)`, it's a shuntsu.\nIf either condition is true, the answer is 0.\n\n**1 Draw:**\nIf 0 draws is not sufficient, check if one draw can form a mentsu. This means we need to find if any two of the initial three tiles (`t1, t2`, `t1, t3`, or `t2, t3`) can be combined with a single drawn tile to form a mentsu.\n\n1.  **Forming a Koutsu with 1 draw**:\n    This requires having two identical tiles initially. If any two of `t1, t2, t3` are identical (e.g., `t1 == t2`), she can draw a third tile identical to them to form a koutsu.\n    Example: `[1m, 1m, 2p]`. Draw `1m` to form `[1m, 1m, 1m]`.\n\n2.  **Forming a Shuntsu with 1 draw**:\n    This requires having two tiles of the same suit that are either consecutive or have a gap of 1.\n    Let the two tiles be `(n1, s)` and `(n2, s)` (where `n1 < n2`).\n    *   **Consecutive**: `n2 == n1 + 1`. She can draw `(n1 - 1, s)` (if `n1 > 1`) or `(n2 + 1, s)` (if `n2 < 9`).\n        Example: `[2m, 3m]`. Draw `1m` or `4m`.\n    *   **Gap of 1**: `n2 == n1 + 2`. She can draw `(n1 + 1, s)`.\n        Example: `[2m, 4m]`. Draw `3m`.\n\nIf any of these conditions (for koutsu or shuntsu with 1 draw) are met, the answer is 1.\n\n**2 Draws:**\nIf neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, then 2 draws will always be enough.\nWe can always form a koutsu by drawing two tiles identical to one of the tiles already in hand. For example, given `t1`, draw two more `t1`s to form `[t1, t1, t1]`.\nTherefore, if 0 and 1 draw are not enough, the answer is 2.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\nTo efficiently check these conditions:\n1.  Parse the input strings into `(number, suit)` tuples.\n2.  Sort the list of three tiles. This helps with shuntsu checks.\n3.  Use a `collections.Counter` or a similar frequency map to count identical tiles.\n\nLet's represent tiles as `(number, suit)`.\nExample: `['3p', '9m', '2p']` becomes `[(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]`.\nSorted: `[(2, 'p'), (3, 'p'), (9, 'm')]`.\n\n**Detailed Check Logic:**\n\nLet the three tiles be `T = [t1, t2, t3]`.\n\n**Check for 0 draws:**\n1.  `T` forms a koutsu: `t1 == t2 == t3`.\n2.  `T` forms a shuntsu:\n    *   All suits are the same: `t1[1] == t2[1] == t3[1]`.\n    *   Numbers are sequential: `t1[0] == t2[0] - 1` and `t2[0] == t3[0] - 1`.\n    If either is true, print 0.\n\n**Check for 1 draw:**\nIterate through all unique pairs of tiles from `T`: `(t1, t2)`, `(t1, t3)`, `(t2, t3)`. For each pair `(tx, ty)`:\n1.  **Form a koutsu**: If `tx == ty`, we can draw `tx` to form a koutsu.\n2.  **Form a shuntsu**: If `tx[1] == ty[1]` (same suit):\n    *   Let `n1 = tx[0]` and `n2 = ty[0]`. Assume `n1 < n2`.\n    *   If `n2 == n1 + 1` (consecutive): We can draw `(n1 - 1, tx[1])` (if `n1 > 1`) or `(n2 + 1, tx[1])` (if `n2 < 9`).\n    *   If `n2 == n1 + 2` (gap of 1): We can draw `(n1 + 1, tx[1])`.\nIf any of these conditions are true, print 1.\n\n**If neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, print 2.**\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    tiles_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    \n    # Parse tiles into (number, suit) tuples\n    tiles = []\n    for t_str in tiles_str:\n        num = int(t_str[0])\n        suit = t_str[1]\n        tiles.append((num, suit))\n    \n    # Sort tiles to simplify sequence checks\n    # Custom sort key: suit first, then number\n    tiles.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n\n    # Check for 0 draws\n    # Case 1: Koutsu (three identical tiles)\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] and tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Case 2: Shuntsu (three sequential tiles of the same suit)\n    if tiles[0][1] == tiles[1][1] and \\\n       tiles[1][1] == tiles[2][1] and \\\n       tiles[0][0] == tiles[1][0] - 1 and \\\n       tiles[1][0] == tiles[2][0] - 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Check for 1 draw\n    # We need to find if any two tiles can form a mentsu with one extra draw.\n    # This means checking all unique pairs (t1, t2), (t1, t3), (t2, t3).\n    \n    # Generate all unique pairs\n    pairs = []\n    pairs.append((tiles[0], tiles[1]))\n    pairs.append((tiles[0], tiles[2]))\n    pairs.append((tiles[1], tiles[2]))\n\n    for t_a, t_b in pairs:\n        # Sort the pair by number for easier shuntsu checks\n        if t_a[0] > t_b[0]:\n            t_a, t_b = t_b, t_a\n\n        # 1.
