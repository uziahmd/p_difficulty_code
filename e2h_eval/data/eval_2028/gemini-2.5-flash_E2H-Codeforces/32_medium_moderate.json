Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Finalized Thoughts for Python Array Stabilization Solution**\n\nOkay, here's my plan for tackling the \"Array Stabilization\" problem.  I need a Python script to minimize instability, defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values, after removing one element from a given integer array.\n\nMy immediate approach is to sort the input array. That gives me quick access to the smallest and largest elements, which is key.  I realized the core strategy lies in removing either the absolute smallest or the absolute largest element. If I remove any other element, the instability will likely be worse.\n\nTo be precise, if I sort the array, the instability after removing the smallest element will be the difference between the original largest element and the *second* smallest element.  If I remove the largest, the instability becomes the difference between the *second* largest element and the original smallest element.  I only have to calculate those two potential instabilities and pick the smaller one.\n\nI need to handle the edge case of an array with just two elements, but that's trivial: it results in zero instability if you remove one element.\n\nSince the problem constraints indicate `n <= 10^5`, a sorting algorithm with *O(n log n)* complexity is acceptable.  The remaining calculations are *O(1)*. So, sorting dominates the complexity. My space complexity will be *O(n)* to store the array, which is also within the limits.\n\nI'll write the code to read the input, sort the array, calculate the two candidate instabilities and print the minimum. I'll use `sys.stdin.readline` to read input quickly. I've double-checked my logic and the edge case, and I'm confident in this approach.  Here's the commented code, which I will remove before final submission:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Read n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n# Read the array a\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n# Sort the array to easily find min, max, second min, second max\na.sort()\n\n# Option 1: Remove the smallest element (a[0])\n# The remaining array will have elements from a[1] to a[n-1].\n# Its minimum will be a[1] and its maximum will be a[n-1].\n# Instability = max - min = a[n-1] - a[1]\ninstability_if_remove_min = a[n-1] - a[1]\n\n# Option 2: Remove the largest element (a[n-1])\n# The remaining array will have elements from a[0] to a[n-2].\n# Its minimum will be a[0] and its maximum will be a[n-2].\n# Instability = max - min = a[n-2] - a[0]\ninstability_if_remove_max = a[n-2] - a[0]\n\n# The minimum possible instability is the smaller of these two options.\nprint(min(instability_if_remove_min, instability_if_remove_max))\n```\n",
