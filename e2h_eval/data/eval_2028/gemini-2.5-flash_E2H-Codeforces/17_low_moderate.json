He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Prefix-Suffix Reconstruction**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm given this competitive programming problem where I need to figure out how to reconstruct an unknown string, `s`, of length `n`. I've been handed a set of `2n-2` strings – all the possible improper prefixes and suffixes.  That is, for each length `k` from 1 to `n-1`, I have a prefix and a suffix of that length, but I don't know which is which.  Essentially, for each length `k`, I get two strings, and I need to determine which represents the beginning (prefix) and which represents the end (suffix).\n\nThe crucial insight here is to look at the strings of length `n-1`.  These are the longest, and they hold the key.  Let's say the string is `s = s1s2...sn`. The prefixes will be `P1 = s1`, `P2 = s1s2`, and so on up to `Pn-1 = s1s2...sn-1`.  Similarly, the suffixes are `S1 = sn`, `S2 = sn-1sn`, up to `Sn-1 = s2s3...sn`.\n\nIf I can correctly identify `Pn-1` and `Sn-1`, I'm golden. Knowing these two, I can reconstruct `s`.  If I have `Pn-1` (let's call it 'A') and `Sn-1` (let's call it 'B'), then my original string will be `A` + the last character of `B` or the first character of `A` + `B`.  The overlapping middle part, `s2s3...sn-1`, which is the substring of 'A' starting from the second character and the substring of 'B' excluding the last character, must match for this to work.  `A[1:]` must be identical to `B[:-1]`.\n\nSo, I need to find those two strings of length `n-1`, say `X` and `Y`, from the input. There are only two possibilities to check:\n\n1.  `Pn-1 = X` and `Sn-1 = Y`. If this is correct, I can build `s` as `X + Y[-1]`.  The matching substring must hold; `X[1:]` must be equal to `Y[:-1]`.\n2.  `Pn-1 = Y` and `Sn-1 = X`. If this is correct, I can build `s` as `Y + X[-1]`. Similarly, `Y[1:]` should be equal to `X[:-1]`.\n\nOnce I identify the correct pairing (prefix and suffix of length `n-1`), I can deduce the entire string `s` and then work my way down to determine the correct prefix/suffix assignments for all other lengths. This seems to be the strategy. Let's start implementing this approach.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify $2n-2$ given strings as either prefixes ('P') or suffixes ('S') of an unknown string $s$ of length $n$. We are told that these strings are all improper prefixes and suffixes (lengths $1$ to $n-1$), and for each length $k \\in [1, n-1]$, there are exactly two strings of length $k$ in the input: one is the prefix of length $k$ and the other is the suffix of length $k$.\n\nLet the unknown string be $s = s_1s_2...s_n$.\nThe prefix of length $k$ is $P_k = s_1s_2...s_k$.\nThe suffix of length $k$ is $S_k = s_{n-k+1}...s_n$.\n\nThe key insight comes from considering the strings of length $n-1$. There are two such strings in the input. Let them be $str_A$ and $str_B$. One of them must be $P_{n-1} = s_1s_2...s_{n-1}$ and the other must be $S_{n-1} = s_2s_3...s_n$.\n\nThere are two possible assignments for these two strings:\n1. $P_{n-1} = str_A$ and $S_{n-1} = str_B$.\n2. $P_{n-1} = str_B$ and $S_{n-1} = str_A$.\n\nFor each assignment, we can attempt to reconstruct the original string $s$.\nIf $P_{n-1} = X$ and $S_{n-1} = Y$:\nThe string $s$ must be $X + Y[-1]$ (since $X$ is $s_1...s_{n-1}$ and $Y[-1]$ is $s_n$).\nAlso, $s$ must be $X[0] + Y$ (since $X[0]$ is $s_1$ and $Y$ is $s_2...s_n$).\nFor these two forms of $s$ to be consistent, we must have $X[1:] == Y[:-1]$. That is, the substring of $X$ from the second character to the end must be equal to the substring of $Y$ from the beginning to the second-to-last character. This common substring is $s_2...s_{n-1}$.\nIf this condition holds, then $s = X + Y[-1]$ is a candidate string.\n\nLet's call the candidate string derived from $P_{n-1}=str_A, S_{n-1}=str_B$ as $s_1$.\nLet's call the candidate string derived from $P_{n-1}=str_B, S_{n-1}=str_A$ as $s_2$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that a consistent string $s$ exists. Therefore, at least one of these two assignments must lead to a valid string $s$.\nOnce we have a candidate string $s_{cand}$, we can verify if it generates all the given prefixes and suffixes.\nFor a given $s_{cand}$:\n- The prefixes are $P_k = s_{cand}[0:k]$ for $k=1, \\dots, n-1$.\n- The suffixes are $S_k = s_{cand}[n-k:n]$ for $k=1, \\dots, n-1$.\nWe collect all these $2n-2$ strings. Then we check if this set of generated strings matches the multiset of input strings. Since the problem guarantees that the input strings are prefixes and suffixes of *some* existing string, and we found *a* string that generates them, this check is implicitly satisfied for the correct $s_{cand}$. The problem states \"Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it.\"\n\nSo, the strategy is:\n1. Read $n$ and all $2n-2$ input strings. Store them along with their original indices.\n2. Separate the strings by length. Find the two strings of length $n-1$. Let them be `str_A` and `str_B`.\n3. Test `hypothesis_1`: Assume $P_{n-1} = str_A$ and $S_{n-1} = str_B$.\n   a. Check if $str_A[1:] == str_B[:-1]$.\n   b. If true, form $s_{cand} = str_A + str_B[-1]$.\n   c. Generate all prefixes $P_k = s_{cand}[0:k]$ and suffixes $S_k = s_{cand}[n-k:n]$.\n   d. Count the occurrences of each generated string (e.g., using a dictionary or `collections.Counter`).\n   e. Count the occurrences of each input string.\n   f. If the counts match for all strings, this is a valid $s_{cand}$. Proceed to assign 'P'/'S' to the original input strings based on this $s_{cand}$.\n4. If `hypothesis_1` didn't work or we need to try the other one (if multiple answers are possible, any is fine, so the first working one is sufficient):\n   Test `hypothesis_2`: Assume $P_{n-1} = str_B$ and $S_{n-1} = str_A$.\n   a. Check if $str_B[1:] == str_A[:-1]$.\n   b. If true, form $s_{cand} = str_B + str_A[-1]$.\n   c. Perform steps 3c-3f for this $s_{cand}$.\n\nTo assign 'P' or 'S' to the input strings:\nOnce we have a valid $s_{cand}$:\n- Create a `Counter` for the required prefixes: `prefix_counts = Counter(s_cand[0:k] for k in range(1, n))`.\n- Initialize an answer list `ans` of length $2n-2$ with empty strings.\n- Iterate through the original input strings (with their indices).\n  - For each `input_str` at `original_idx`:\n    - If `prefix_counts[input_str] > 0`:\n      - Assign `ans[original_idx] = 'P'`.\n      - Decrement `prefix_counts[input_str]` (to handle duplicate strings correctly, e.g., if $P_k = S_j$).\n    - Else:\n      - Assign `ans[original_idx] = 'S'`.\n- Print `\"\".join(ans)`.\n\nExample walk-through: $n=3$, input: `a`, `aa`, `aa`, `a`.\nOriginal input with indices: `(a,0), (aa,1), (aa,2), (a,3)`.\nStrings of length $n-1=2$: `aa` (from index 1) and `aa` (from index 2).\nLet `str_A = \"aa\"` (from index 1), `str_B = \"aa\"` (from index 2).\n\nHypothesis 1: $P_2 = \\text{\"aa\"}$ (from index 1), $S_2 = \\text{\"aa\"}$ (from index 2).\nCheck $P_2[1:] == S_2[:-1]$: $\\text{\"a\"} == \\text{\"a\"}$. True.\nCandidate $s_{cand} = P_2 + S_2[-1] = \\text{\"aa\"} + \\text{\"a\"} = \\text{\"aaa\"}$.\nGenerated prefixes for \"aaa\": $P_1 = \\text{\"a\"}$, $P_2 = \\text{\"aa\"}$.\nGenerated suffixes for \"aaa\": $S_1 = \\text{\"a\"}$, $S_2 = \\text{\"aa\"}$.\nRequired strings: `{\"a\": 2, \"aa\": 2}`.\nInput strings: `{\"a\": 2, \"aa\": 2}`. Match!\nSo, $s = \\text{\"aaa\"}$ is a valid string.\n\nNow, assign 'P'/'S' based on $s=\\text{\"aaa\"}$:\n`prefix_counts = Counter({\"a\": 1, \"aa\": 1})` initially.\n`ans = [\"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"]`\n1. Input `(a,0)`: `prefix_counts[\"a\"] > 0`. `ans[0] = 'P'`. `prefix_counts[\"a\"]` becomes 0.\n2. Input `(aa,1)`: `prefix_counts[\"aa\"] > 0`. `ans[1] = 'P'`. `prefix_counts[\"aa\"]` becomes 0.\n3. Input `(aa,2)`: `prefix_counts[\"aa\"]` is 0. So it must be a suffix. `ans[2] = 'S'`.\n4. Input `(a,3)`: `prefix_counts[\"a\"]` is 0. So it must be a suffix. `ans[3] = 'S'`.\n\nResult: `PPSS`. This matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # Store input strings along with their original indices\n    input_strings_with_indices = []\n    strings_by_length = {}\n    for i in range(2 * n - 2):\n        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        input_strings_with_indices.append((s, i))\n        if len(s) not in strings_by_length:\n            strings_by_length[len(s)] = []\n        strings_by_length[len(s)].append(s)\n\n    # The two strings of length n-1 must be P_{n-1} and S_{n-1}\n    str_n_minus_1_options = strings_by_length[n - 1]\n    str_A = str_n_minus_1_options[0]\n    str_B = str_n_minus_1_options[1]\n\n    possible_s_candidates = []\n\n    # Hypothesis 1: P_{n-1} = str_A, S_{n-1} = str_B\n    if str_A[1:] == str_B[:-1]:\n        s_candidate = str_A + str_B[-1]\n        possible_s_candidates.append(s_candidate)\n\n    # Hypothesis 2: P_{n-1} = str_B, S_{n-1} = str_A\n    # Only try if str_A and str_B are different, or if they are the same\n    # but we haven't found a candidate yet (this implies the first case failed,\n    # or we need to consider both if they lead to different results, though problem says any is fine)\n    # If str_A == str_B, then str_A[1:] == str_B[:-1] implies str_B[1:] == str_A[:-1] as well,\n    # and s_candidate will be the same.
