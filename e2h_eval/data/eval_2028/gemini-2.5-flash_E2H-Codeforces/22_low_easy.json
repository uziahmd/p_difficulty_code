After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Marks\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Marks\" problem. It seems straightforward, but let's break it down methodically. I need a Python script for this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input. I'm given `n` students and `m` subjects, and then an `n x m` gradebook.  Each entry in the gradebook is a single digit representing a mark. A list of strings seems like the most natural way to represent this gradebook; it keeps things simple. `gradebook[i][j]` will give me the mark for student `i` in subject `j`.\n\nNow, the core idea is this \"best at a subject\" concept. A student is \"best\" if they got the maximum mark for a subject, meaning no one got higher. Then, a \"successful\" student has to be best at at least one subject. My output needs to be the total number of successful students.\n\nHere's my thought process on how to approach this. I'll need to iterate through each subject (the columns of the gradebook). For each subject, I need to find the maximum mark among all students for that subject. Then I can iterate through the students and see if anyone achieved that maximum mark for that subject.  I can use a boolean array, `is_successful`, to keep track of the successful students.\n\nMy algorithm will look something like this:\n\n1.  Read the input, storing the gradebook as a list of strings.\n2.  Initialize `is_successful` to all `False`.\n3.  Iterate through each subject (column).\n    *   Find the maximum mark for that subject.\n    *   Iterate through each student for that subject. If a student's mark matches the maximum, set `is_successful` for that student to `True`.\n4.  Finally, count the number of `True` values in `is_successful` and return that count.\n\nLet me trace an example:\n\nWith this input:\n```\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n```\n\nI'll iterate through each column. For column 0, the max mark is 2. Student 0 and 1 got a 2, so `is_successful[0]` and `is_successful[1]` become `True`. For column 1, the max is 3 and only student 1 got that. `is_successful[1]` remains `True`. For column 2, the max is 3, and only student 0 gets this. But `is_successful[0]` is already `True`. My final `is_successful` will be `[True, True, False]`, and my answer will be 2.\n\nI think I have a good plan now.  Let's start coding.\n",
