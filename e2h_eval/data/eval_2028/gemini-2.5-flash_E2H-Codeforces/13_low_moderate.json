For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Triad Classification Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem: I need to write a Python script to classify a set of three notes as major, minor, or \"strange.\" My initial thought is to structure this systematically, and I'm already seeing some clear steps.\n\nFirst, I need to represent these musical notes in a way that's computationally friendly. Since there are only 12 notes (C, C#, D... B, H) that loop, representing them as integers from 0 to 11 seems like the perfect solution. C is 0, C# is 1, and so on. This will make calculating semitone distances much easier with modulo arithmetic. I'll need a dictionary for this mapping.\n\nNext, I need a function to calculate the semitone distance between any two notes, taking into account that the scale is cyclical.  If I'm going from a lower note to a higher one, distance is straightforward. Going \"down\" a cycle needs to be considered.  I think `(note2_int - note1_int + 12) % 12` will do the trick.  This handles the wraparound nature of the notes.\n\nNow, with this infrastructure in place, the core logic becomes a matter of applying the definitions of major and minor triads.  A major triad has a specific interval pattern (4, 3 semitones), and a minor triad has a different pattern (3, 4 semitones).  I'll receive a set of three notes, convert them to their integer representations using the mapping I created.  Then, I'll need to figure out if there's *any* ordering of these three notes that fits the major or minor triad pattern.  The problem states that there'll always be an unambiguous classification.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify a given three-note chord (triad) as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\". We are given 12 notes in a cyclic order, and distances are measured in semitones (1 semitone between consecutive notes).\n\nFirst, we need to map the given musical notes to numerical values to facilitate distance calculations. We can assign C to 0, C# to 1, and so on, up to H as 11. The notes repeat cyclically, so we'll use modulo 12 arithmetic for distances.\n\nThe distance between two notes `note1` and `note2` (represented by their integer values `val1` and `val2`) is `(val2 - val1 + 12) % 12`. This correctly gives the upward distance along the musical scale. For example, C (0) to E (4) is `(4 - 0 + 12) % 12 = 4` semitones. E (4) to C (0) is `(0 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 8` semitones.\n\nA major triad is defined by three notes X, Y, Z that can be ordered such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones, and the distance from Y to Z is 3 semitones.\nA minor triad is defined by three notes X, Y, Z that can be ordered such that the distance from X to Y is 3 semitones, and the distance from Y to Z is 4 semitones.\n\nSince the input notes form an \"unordered set\", we need to check all possible orderings of the three given notes. For any three notes `n1, n2, n3`, there are 3! = 6 permutations. However, since we are only interested in the *intervals* between the notes in a specific sequence (X-Y and Y-Z), we can fix one note as X, and then try the other two as Y and Z.\n\nLet the three input notes be `A, B, C`. We convert them to their integer representations `valA, valB, valC`.\nWe then consider each note as a potential starting note (X) of the triad:\n\n1.  **If `valA` is X:**\n    *   Check `valB` as Y, `valC` as Z: `dist(valA, valB)` and `dist(valB, valC)`.\n    *   Check `valC` as Y, `valB` as Z: `dist(valA, valC)` and `dist(valC, valB)`.\n2.  **If `valB` is X:**\n    *   Check `valA` as Y, `valC` as Z: `dist(valB, valA)` and `dist(valA, valC)`.\n    *   Check `valC` as Y, `valA` as Z: `dist(valB, valC)` and `dist(valC, valA)`.\n3.  **If `valC` is X:**\n    *   Check `valA` as Y, `valB` as Z: `dist(valC, valA)` and `dist(valA, valB)`.\n    *   Check `valB` as Y, `valA` as Z: `dist(valC, valB)` and `dist(valB, valA)`.\n\nFor each of these 6 permutations (X, Y, Z):\n*   If `dist(X, Y) == 4` and `dist(Y, Z) == 3`, it's a major triad.\n*   If `dist(X, Y) == 3` and `dist(Y, Z) == 4`, it's a minor triad.\n\nThe problem guarantees that the answer will be unambiguous. So, as soon as we find a match for major or minor, we can print the result and exit. If none of the 6 permutations satisfy either condition, the triad is \"strange\".\n\nExample: \"C E G\"\nNotes: C(0), E(4), G(7)\nLet's try C as X:\n- C(0), E(4), G(7): dist(0,4)=4, dist(4,7)=3. This is a major triad. Output: \"major\".\n\nExample: \"C# B F\"\nNotes: C#(1), B(10), F(5)\nLet's try B as X:\n- B(10), C#(1), F(5): dist(10,1)=(1-10+12)%12=3. dist(1,5)=(5-1+12)%12=4. This is a minor triad. Output: \"minor\".\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    note_map = {\n        \"C\": 0, \"C#\": 1, \"D\": 2, \"D#\": 3, \"E\": 4, \"F\": 5,\n        \"F#\": 6, \"G\": 7, \"G#\": 8, \"A\": 9, \"B\": 10, \"H\": 11\n    }\n\n    notes_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n_vals = [note_map[n] for n in notes_str]\n\n    # Function to calculate semitone distance from note1 to note2\n    # (upwards along the scale)\n    def get_distance(val1, val2):\n        return (val2 - val1 + 12) % 12\n\n    # Iterate through all permutations of the three notes\n    # (X, Y, Z) represents the ordered triad\n    # There are 3! = 6 permutations\n    \n    # Using indices to represent permutations (0,1,2), (0,2,1), etc.\n    # This avoids actual list permutations and is more direct for 3 elements.\n    \n    # Possible permutations of indices (0, 1, 2)\n    permutations = [\n        (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 1),\n        (1, 0, 2), (1, 2, 0),\n        (2, 0, 1), (2, 1, 0)\n    ]\n\n    for p in permutations:\n        x_val = n_vals[p[0]]\n        y_val = n_vals[p[1]]\n        z_val = n_vals[p[2]]\n\n        dist_xy = get_distance(x_val, y_val)\n        dist_yz = get_distance(y_val, z_val)\n\n        if dist_xy == 4 and dist_yz == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        elif dist_xy == 3 and dist_yz == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
