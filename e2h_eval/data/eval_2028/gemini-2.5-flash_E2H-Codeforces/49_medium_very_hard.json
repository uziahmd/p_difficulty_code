They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**The Mushroom Strife: A Pythonic Quest**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this \"Mushroom Strife\" problem. My goal is to craft a Python script that cracks this competitive programming challenge.  It boils down to restoring mushroom counts on lawns, given some constraints based on GCDs and LCMs across roads connecting these lawns.\n\nMy initial thoughts are, this is a graph problem at heart. We've got `n` lawns (vertices) and `m` roads (edges). Each lawn harbors a certain number of mushrooms – let's call that `mushrooms[i]`. The tricky part? We're not given these values directly. Instead, for each road between lawns `u` and `v`, we're gifted with the GCD and LCM of `mushrooms[u]` and `mushrooms[v]`.  The catch? We have to figure out all the `mushrooms[i]` values, or report it's impossible.  The constraints? Mushroom counts are capped at `10^6`, as are the GCDs and LCMs. We're dealing with up to 10^5 lawns and roads, so we need an efficient solution.\n\nThe key insight is the inherent relationship between GCD and LCM. For any two positive integers, their product equals the product of their GCD and LCM.  If we have `a * b = g * l`, where `g` is the GCD and `l` is the LCM, the numbers can be expressed as multiples of `g`.  If `a = g * x` and `b = g * y`, then `x` and `y` are coprime. This implies that `x * y = l/g`.\n\nThis `l/g` is crucial. It tells me that for any edge,  the product of the factors representing the mushrooms is the result of dividing the LCM by the GCD. Let's call this `p`. Therefore, the pair `(mushrooms[u], mushrooms[v])` can be written as `(g*x, g*y)`, where x*y= p and GCD(x,y)=1. The GCD constraint ensures that the *exponent* of any prime in both numbers isn't greater than its exponent in their GCD, and the LCM is the *max* exponent for any prime between the two numbers.\n\nWhat this implies is that if `l/g`  has a prime factorization of  `p_1^{a_1} * p_2^{a_2} * ... * p_k^{a_k}`, then  `x` can only be made by choosing any subset of these factors (with their corresponding exponents) and multiplying them to arrive at the number `x`. The same will be done for the number `y`. Furthermore, all such valid choices will make sure that the GCD remains 1. These numbers x and y are the *unitary divisors* of `l/g`.\n\nSo for any road with a GCD `g` and LCM `l`, the mushroom counts are multiples of `g`.\nSpecifically, we can say `mushrooms[u] = g * x` and `mushrooms[v] = g * y`, where x * y = `l/g`, and GCD(x, y) = 1. We must make sure that it is possible to assign such values to all `m` edges of the graph.\n\nMy immediate instinct is to think in terms of a graph coloring problem. It looks like the constraint is on the exponents of each prime factor. If we factorize `g` and `l` for each edge into prime powers,  the prime factors for each number must \"match up\" in the proper way.\n\nLet's assume the highest value of mushrooms is 10^6. This implies the most number of prime factors is going to be small. Since the product of the first 7 primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17) is greater than 10^6, any value smaller than 10^6 can have at most 6 primes, each potentially raised to some power. Hence, the number of unitary divisors of `P` is small, about `2^k` (where `k` is the number of distinct prime factors of p).\n\nHere's my refined algorithm:\n\n1.  **Precompute**: I'll kick things off by precomputing a sieve to find primes and smallest prime factors up to 10^6. I'll also need a function to factorize a number into primes and another to get unitary divisors (the special factors that have no common prime divisors when divided into the quotient l/g).\n2.  **Graph Representation**: I'll set up an adjacency list `adj[u]` to store the roads connected to",
    "response": "The problem asks us to restore the number of mushrooms on `n` lawns, given `m` roads. For each road connecting lawns `u` and `v`, we are provided with `GCD(mushrooms[u], mushrooms[v])` and `LCM(mushrooms[u], mushrooms[v])`. The number of mushrooms on any lawn must be between 1 and `10^6`.\n\n**Key Mathematical Property:**\nFor any two positive integers `a` and `b`, the following relationship holds:\n`a * b = GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b)`.\n\nLet `g = GCD(mushrooms[u], mushrooms[v])` and `l = LCM(mushrooms[u], mushrooms[v])`.\nFrom the property, we know `mushrooms[u] * mushrooms[v] = g * l`.\n\nAlso, `mushrooms[u]` must be a multiple of `g`, say `mushrooms[u] = g * x`.\nSimilarly, `mushrooms[v]` must be a multiple of `g`, say `mushrooms[v] = g * y`.\nSubstituting these into the product equation:\n`(g * x) * (g * y) = g * l`\n`g^2 * x * y = g * l`\n`g * x * y = l`\nThis implies `x * y = l / g`.\nFurthermore, by definition of GCD, `GCD(mushrooms[u], mushrooms[v]) = GCD(g * x, g * y) = g * GCD(x, y)`.\nSince `GCD(mushrooms[u], mushrooms[v]) = g`, we must have `g * GCD(x, y) = g`, which simplifies to `GCD(x, y) = 1`.\n\nSo, for any edge `(u, v)` with given `g` and `l`:\n1. `l` must be divisible by `g`. If not, no solution exists.\n2. Let `P = l / g`.\n3. `mushrooms[u] = g * x` and `mushrooms[v] = g * y`, where `x * y = P` and `GCD(x, y) = 1`.\n\nThe condition `x * y = P` and `GCD(x, y) = 1` means that `x` and `y` must be \"coprime factors\" of `P`. If `P` has prime factorization `p_1^{a_1} * p_2^{a_2} * ... * p_k^{a_k}`, then `x` must be formed by multiplying a subset of the prime power factors `{p_1^{a_1}, ..., p_k^{a_k}}`, and `y` must be the product of the remaining prime power factors. Such `x` are called unitary divisors of `P`. The number of such `x` is `2^k`, where `k` is the number of distinct prime factors of `P`. Since `P <= 10^6`, the maximum number of distinct prime factors is small (e.g., `2*3*5*7*11*13*17 = 510510`, so at most 7 distinct prime factors). Thus, `2^7 = 128` is the maximum number of choices for `x`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\nThe problem can be solved by iterating through connected components of the graph. For each component, we try to assign a value to one node, and then propagate these values throughout the component using Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n\n1.  **Precomputation:**\n    *   **Sieve of Eratosthenes:** Precompute the smallest prime factor (SPF) for all numbers up to `10^6`. This allows efficient prime factorization.\n    *   **`get_prime_factors(n)` function:** Uses SPF to return a dictionary of prime factors and their exponents for `n`.\n    *   **`get_unitary_divisors(P)` function:** Takes `P` as input. It finds its prime factorization `p_1^{a_1} * ... * p_k^{a_k}`. Then it generates all `2^k` unitary divisors by taking all possible products of subsets of `{p_1^{a_1}, ..., p_k^{a_k}}`.\n\n2.  **Graph Representation:** Store the graph using an adjacency list, where `adj[u]` contains tuples `(v, g, l)` for each edge connecting `u` and `v` with `GCD=g` and `LCM=l`.\n\n3.  **Main Logic:**\n    *   Initialize an array `ans` of size `n+1` to all zeros (indicating unassigned values).\n    *   Iterate `i` from `1` to `n`:\n        *   If `ans[i]` is `0` (node `i` hasn't been assigned a value yet, meaning it's part of a new unvisited component):\n            *   **Handle isolated nodes:** If `adj[i]` is empty (node `i` has no roads), `ans[i] = 1`. Continue to the next `i`.\n            *   **Handle connected components:**\n                *   Pick an arbitrary edge `(i, j)` from `adj[i]` with `GCD=g_ij` and `LCM=l_ij`.\n                *   Calculate `P = l_ij / g_ij`. If `l_ij % g_ij != 0`, it's impossible, print \"NO\" and exit.\n                *   Get all `unitary_divs = get_unitary_divisors(P)`.\n                *   **Attempt assignments:** Iterate through each `x` in `unitary_divs`:\n                    *   Try `mushrooms[i] = g_ij * x`.\n                    *   Initialize a temporary `ans_candidate` array (copy of `ans` or a new array for this attempt).\n                    *   Perform a BFS starting from `i` to propagate this choice:\n                        *   Set `ans_candidate[i] = g_ij * x`.\n                        *   Maintain a list `component_nodes` to keep track of nodes visited in this BFS attempt.\n                        *   For each neighbor `v` of `u` (current node in BFS) with edge `(u, v, g_uv, l_uv)`:\n                            *   If `ans_candidate[v]` is `0` (unvisited):\n                                *   Calculate `expected_val_v = (g_uv * l_uv) // ans_candidate[u]`.\n                                *   **Validation:** Check the following conditions:\n                                    1.  `ans_candidate[u]` must be a multiple of `g_uv` (`ans_candidate[u] % g_uv == 0`).\n                                    2.  `g_uv * l_uv` must be divisible by `ans_candidate[u]` (for `expected_val_v` to be an integer).\n                                    3.  `1 <= expected_val_v <= 10^6` (within the valid range).\n                                    4.  `GCD(ans_candidate[u], expected_val_v)` must be equal to `g_uv`.\n                                *   If any validation fails, this `x` choice is invalid for `mushrooms[i]`. Break the BFS and try the next `x`.\n                                *   If valid, set `ans_candidate[v] = expected_val_v`, add `v` to queue and `component_nodes`.\n                            *   If `ans_candidate[v]` is not `0` (visited):\n                                *   Calculate `expected_val_v = (g_uv * l_uv) // ans_candidate[u]`.\n                                *   **Validation:** Check the same conditions as above, plus:\n                                    1.  `expected_val_v` must be equal to `ans_candidate[v]`.\n                                *   If any validation fails, this `x` choice is invalid. Break the BFS.\n                    *   If the BFS completes without any validation failures (`is_possible_path` is `True`):\n                        *   This `x` choice works for the component. Copy `ans_candidate` values for `component_nodes` into the global `ans` array. Break from the `for x in unitary_divs` loop and move to the next `i` in the outer loop.\n                    *   If `is_possible_path` is `False`: Reset `ans_candidate` for nodes in `component_nodes` to `0` and try the next `x`.\n                *   If all `x` choices for `mushrooms[i]` failed for this component, then no solution exists for the entire graph. Print \"NO\" and exit.\n\n4.  **Output:** If the loop finishes for all `i` without exiting, a valid assignment has been found. Print \"YES\" followed by the `n` values in the `ans` array.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Conceptual):**\nSuppose we have an edge `(1, 2)` with `GCD=1, LCM=6`.\n`P = 6/1 = 6`.\nPrime factors of 6 are `2^1, 3^1`. Unitary divisors are `{1, 2, 3, 6}`.\nTry `mushrooms[1] = 1 * 1 = 1`. Then `mushrooms[2] = (1*6)//1 = 6`. Check `GCD(1,6)=1`. Valid.\nIf there are other edges, say `(2, 3)` with `GCD=1, LCM=3`.\nNow `mushrooms[2]=6`. `P = 3/1 = 3`.\n`mushrooms[3] = (1*3)//mushrooms[2]` (this formula is wrong, `mushrooms[3] = (g_23 * l_23) // mushrooms[2]`).\n`mushrooms[3] = (1*3)//6`. This is not an integer. So `mushrooms[1]=1` fails.\n\nTry `mushrooms[1] = 1 * 2 = 2`. Then `mushrooms[2] = (1*6)//2 = 3`. Check `GCD(2,3)=1`. Valid.\nNow with `mushrooms[2]=3` and edge `(2,3)` with `GCD=1, LCM=3`.\n`mushrooms[3] = (1*3)//3 = 1`. Check `GCD(3,1)=1`. Valid.\nThis assignment `mushrooms[1]=2, mushrooms[2]=3, mushrooms[3]=1` might be a valid solution.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Constants\nMAX_VAL = 10**6\n\n# Precompute smallest prime factor (SPF) for numbers up to MAX_VAL\nspf = [0] * (MAX_VAL + 1)\nprimes = []\n\ndef sieve():\n    for i in range(2, MAX_VAL + 1):\n        if spf[i] == 0:  #
