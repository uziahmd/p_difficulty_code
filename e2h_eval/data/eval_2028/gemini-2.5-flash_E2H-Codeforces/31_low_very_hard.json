Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down Vanya and Cards**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Vanya and Cards\" problem, and the goal is to get the sum of all the numbers on the cards to zero. I'm given `n` cards initially, and the numbers on these cards, along with the maximum absolute value `x` that can appear on any card. I can add more cards, with values between `-x` and `x`, essentially an unlimited supply of those numbers.  My task is to figure out the *minimum* number of additional cards I need to get the total sum to zero.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the sum of the cards I already have, let's call it `S`. The problem reduces to finding additional cards that sum to `-S`.  This means I need to make the *absolute value* of `S` equal to 0, or in other words, to make `S` zero.\n\nMy strategy should be to minimize the number of additional cards, which means making each card contribute as much as possible to the target sum. If `S` is zero, I'm done – no additional cards are needed. But if `S` isn't zero, I have to figure out the most efficient way to get to zero.\n\nIf `S` is positive, I need to add negative numbers. To minimize the card count, I should use `-x` cards.  If `S` is negative, I need to add positive numbers; in this case, I should use `x` cards to minimize the number of cards.\n\nSo, in essence, I need to consider `abs(S)`.  The smallest number of cards I can add to reach `-S` would be the ceiling of `abs(S) / x`.  For example, if `S` is 5 and `x` is 2, I need to get to -5. Using -2 cards, I need three of them. `ceil(5/2) = 3`. This seems sound, and I can confirm it with other examples.  I can express this using integer division: `(abs(S) + x - 1) // x`.\n\nLet me re-check those input constraints real quick... `n` is up to 1000, and `x` is also up to 1000, and the values of the given cards are bounded by `x`. Okay, everything seems in order. I think I'm ready to write the script.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all cards (initial `n` cards + additional cards) is zero. Vanya can find cards with any integer value from `-x` to `x`, and he has an infinite supply of each.\n\nFirst, calculate the sum of the `n` cards Vanya has already found. Let this sum be `S`.\n\nVanya wants the final sum to be zero. This means the sum of the additional cards he finds must be `-S`.\n\nTo minimize the number of additional cards, he should choose cards that contribute the maximum possible absolute value towards the target sum `-S`. The maximum absolute value a single card can have is `x` (either `x` or `-x`).\n\nLet `target_absolute_sum = abs(S)`.\nIf `S` is positive, he needs to add cards that sum to `-S`. To do this with the minimum number of cards, he should repeatedly add cards with value `-x`.\nIf `S` is negative, he needs to add cards that sum to `-S` (which will be positive). To do this with the minimum number of cards, he should repeatedly add cards with value `x`.\nIn both cases, each additional card can contribute at most `x` to the `target_absolute_sum`.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of cards needed is `ceil(target_absolute_sum / x)`.\nThe `ceil(a / b)` operation for positive integers `a` and `b` can be computed using integer division as `(a + b - 1) // b`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n` and `x`.\n2. Read the `n` card values and calculate their sum, `S`.\n3. Calculate the absolute value of `S`: `abs_S = abs(S)`.\n4. The minimum number of additional cards needed is `(abs_S + x - 1) // x`.\n   (Note: If `abs_S` is 0, this formula correctly yields 0: `(0 + x - 1) // x` will be 0 for `x >= 1`).\n5. Print the result.\n\n**Example 1:**\n`n = 3, x = 2`\nCards: `-1, 1, 2`\nSum `S = -1 + 1 + 2 = 2`.\n`abs_S = abs(2) = 2`.\nMinimum cards = `(2 + 2 - 1) // 2 = 3 // 2 = 1`.\n(Vanya needs to add cards that sum to -2. One card with value -2 is sufficient.)\n\n**Example 2:**\n`n = 2, x = 3`\nCards: `-2, -2`\nSum `S = -2 + (-2) = -4`.\n`abs_S = abs(-4) = 4`.\nMinimum cards = `(4 + 3 - 1) // 3 = 6 // 3 = 2`.\n(Vanya needs to add cards that sum to 4. He can use two cards with value 2 (2 + 2 = 4).)\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and x from the first line\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read the card values from the second line\n    cards = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the found cards\n    current_sum = sum(cards)\n\n    # If the current sum is already zero, no additional cards are needed\n    if current_sum == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the absolute value of the current sum.\n    # This is the absolute value of the sum that needs to be achieved by additional cards.\n    target_abs_sum = abs(current_sum)\n\n    # To minimize the number of cards, each additional card should contribute\n    # the maximum possible absolute value, which is x.\n    # The number of cards needed is target_abs_sum divided by x, rounded up.\n    # This can be calculated using integer division as (a + b - 1) // b for ceil(a/b).\n    min_cards = (target_abs_sum + x - 1) // x\n\n    print(min_cards)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
