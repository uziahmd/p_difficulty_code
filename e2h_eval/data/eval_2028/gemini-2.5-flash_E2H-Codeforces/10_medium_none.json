Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Unraveling the Golorp's Diet: A Deep Dive into Lexicographical Feasts**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with cracking the \"Feed the Golorp\" problem, and frankly, it's got me scratching my head a bit. The goal is to come up with a Python script that can solve these quirky constraint satisfaction puzzles, where the \"golorp\" (which is just a fancy name for a program, really) has a very particular diet defined by a string.\n\nHere's the gist: the golorp \"eats\" a sequence of numbers (0-9), and we need to find the *smallest* sequence that satisfies its \"name\" (the input string). It's like a culinary lexicographical quest!\n\nThe input string is the key. I see it as having two parts separated by `:-`. The first part, before `:-`, is the golorp's \"jaws\" and \"stomach,\" or what I would call the main expression.  It defines how the numbers are processed. The second part, after `:-`, has constraints on the numbers. I think `_` represents variables. But I am not sure about this.\n\nMy initial thought was that the number of `_` characters in the *entire* string equals the variable count, but that doesn't quite work. I am starting to think that the number of `_` characters in the *jaws* part (the expression) directly relates to the number of digits in the output. This part seems to define the length of the output.\n\nA crucial twist is the lexicographical ordering: If there are multiple solutions, the golorp, being a picky eater, prefers the smallest sequence alphabetically.\n\nThe real challenge lies in parsing the expression. The `_` are the key, but their interpretation is subtle. Am I supposed to parse these as digits or as variables? I considered the problem statement that each `_` represented a digit, and a string of length `k` meant a `k`-digit number. This is starting to make sense now.\n\nSo, here's my current working hypothesis:\n\n1.  **Count the variables (digits):** The total number of variables needed is derived from the expression part.\n2.  **Parse the constraints:** the part after `:-` defines constraints.  The `_` within constraints likely refer back to elements of the number sequence.\n3.  **Find the sequence:** I need to systematically search for the lexicographically smallest sequence of digits that satisfies the constraints.\n\nThis feels like a constraint satisfaction problem, so backtracking or a similar systematic search could work. Given that the constraints are numerical comparisons (`>`, `<`, `=`, etc.), I can test combinations of variable values from 0 to 9, one by one.  This could be a bit computationally intensive, especially if the string length (and the variable count) is large. Still, it is the best starting point.\n\nI am not entirely confident about this new approach. It's a bit of a mind-bender. There are some nuances that still confuse me, particularly how the constraints relate to the expression.  I also am not sure about all cases. The outputs are not fully clear from the examples.\n\nI am going to keep going with this. Let's see if I can make it work!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values (digits 0-9) that satisfy a set of constraints defined by a \"golorp's name\". The name is a string with a specific structure: `?(EXPRESSION):-CONSTRAINTS.`.\n\nLet's break down the interpretation of the golorp's name based on the problem description and examples:\n\n1.  **Variables and `_`:** Each `_` character in the *entire* input string represents a single digit variable. These variables are assigned values from 0 to 9. The problem asks for the lexicographically smallest sequence of these variables. Let's call them `v_0, v_1, ..., v_{N-1}`, where `N` is the total count of `_` characters in the input string. They are assigned in the order they appear in the string.\n\n2.  **Multi-digit Numbers:** Consecutive `_` characters form multi-digit numbers. For example, `_` is `v_i`, `__` is `10*v_i + v_{i+1}`, `___` is `100*v_i + 10*v_{i+1} + v_{i+2}`, and so on. A multi-digit number like `10*v_i + v_{i+1}` is not allowed to have `v_i = 0` unless the number is `0` itself (e.g., `__` representing `00` is `0`, but `05` is `5`). This is a common rule in such problems, but the examples suggest that leading zeros *are* allowed for multi-digit numbers if they are explicitly composed of digits. For instance, `01` is `1`. For simplicity and to match common competitive programming interpretations, we'll allow leading zeros for multi-digit numbers unless it leads to issues. Given the output `0010` where `v_0=0, v_1=0`, it seems leading zeros are indeed allowed.\n\n3.  **Structure of the Name:**\n    *   `EXPRESSION`: This part contains arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and `_` sequences. The result of this expression is what the golorp \"eats\", but we are not asked for this value. The expression must be valid (e.g., no division by zero). The operators follow standard precedence (`*`, `/` before `+`, `-`).\n    *   `CONSTRAINTS`: This part contains comparison operators (`<`, `>`) and `_` sequences, separated by commas. Each comparison must evaluate to true.\n\n4.  **Goal:** Find the lexicographically smallest sequence `v_0 v_1 ... v_{N-1}` (as a string of digits) such that:\n    *   All `v_i` are between 0 and 9.\n    *   No division by zero occurs in `EXPRESSION`.\n    *   All `CONSTRAINTS` are satisfied.\n    *   If no such sequence exists, output \"false\".\n\n**Parsing Strategy:**\n\nWe need to parse the input string to extract the `EXPRESSION` and `CONSTRAINTS`. We'll also need a way to map `_` sequences to variable indices and build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for both parts.\n\n1.  **Tokenization:** Split the input string into tokens. Tokens can be operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `<`, `>`, `,`, `(`, `)`), `.` or sequences of `_`.\n2.  **Variable Mapping:** Iterate through the tokens. When a sequence of `k` `_` characters is encountered, assign `k` new variable indices (`v_i, v_{i+1}, ..., v_{i+k-1}`) to it. Store the starting index and length for each `_` sequence. This allows us to map `_` groups to specific parts of the `v` array.\n3.  **AST Construction:** Build an AST for the `EXPRESSION` and each `CONSTRAINT`. This will involve handling operator precedence. A common way is to convert to Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) or use a recursive descent parser.\n\n**Solving Strategy (Constraint Satisfaction):**\n\nSince `N` (the total number of variables) can be up to 1024, a brute-force `10^N` search is impossible. However, the examples show much smaller output lengths (4, 7). This implies that `N` is *not* the total count of `_` characters in the string, but rather a smaller number defined by some other rule.\n\nLet's re-examine the example outputs and try to find a consistent `N`:\n*   `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` -> `0010` (length 4)\n*   `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.` -> `false`\n*   `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.` -> `0250341` (length 7)\n*   `?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.` -> `0101` (length 4)\n\nThe output length *is* `N`. The problem states: \"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.\" This strongly suggests `N` is determined by the `EXPRESSION` part.\nThe most plausible interpretation to match the sample outputs is:\nThe `_` characters in the `EXPRESSION` part define the *variables* `v_0, ..., v_{N-1}`. The number `N` is the total count of `_` in the `EXPRESSION` part.\nThe `_` characters in the `CONSTRAINTS` part refer to *new* variables, but these variables are *not* part of the output sequence. Instead, their values are derived from the *result* of the `EXPRESSION` (or other parts of the system), or they are independent variables that are *not* outputted. This is highly unusual for competitive programming.\n\nLet's try a different interpretation based on the sample outputs:\nThe `_` characters in the `EXPRESSION` part are variables `v_0, ..., v_{N-1}`. `N` is the total count of `_` in the `EXPRESSION` part.\nThe `_` characters in the `CONSTRAINTS` part are *also* variables, but they are *re-using* the same `v_0, ..., v_{N-1}` sequence, continuing from where the `EXPRESSION` left off. So, `N` is the total count of `_` in the *entire string*. This was my first interpretation, which led to `N=12` for the first example, but the output was length 4. This is the core inconsistency.\n\nGiven the small output lengths, the most common pattern in such problems when `N` is small is a *backtracking search*. We try `v_0 = 0..9`, then `v_1 = 0..9`, and so on. To ensure lexicographical smallest, we iterate digits from 0 to 9 for each `v_i`.\n\nLet's assume the problem means `N` is the total count of `_` in the `EXPRESSION` part, and these are `v_0, ..., v_{N-1}`. The `_` in the `CONSTRAINTS` part are *also* variables, but they are *implicitly defined* as some function of the `v_i`s from the expression, or they are just *placeholders* for numbers that are *not* part of the output sequence. This is still not clear.\n\nAfter careful consideration of the problem's phrasing \"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\", the most consistent interpretation that matches the *output lengths* is that the `_` characters in the `EXPRESSION` part refer to the variables `v_0, ..., v_{N-1}` that we are searching for and outputting. The `_` characters in the `CONSTRAINTS` part refer to *additional* variables that are *not* part of the output sequence but are still digits from 0-9. This means the `CONSTRAINTS` part introduces *new* unknowns `w_0, ..., w_M-1`.\n\nThis makes the problem a mixed constraint satisfaction problem.\nThe problem statement's `N` being small (4 or 7) is key. The actual problem is likely to have a maximum `N` around 10-15, making backtracking feasible (`10^15` is too much, but `10^10` might be acceptable for a few seconds).\nThe maximum number of `_` in the expression part for the largest sample is 43. `10^43` is impossible.\n\nThe only way the sample outputs make sense is if the `_` characters in the `EXPRESSION` part are *not* individual variables. What if `_` represents `v0`, `__` represents `v1`, `___` represents `v2`, etc.? This means the *number of groups of underscores* in the `EXPRESSION` part defines `N`.\n\nLet's re-test this hypothesis:\n1. `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n   `EXPR`: `_`, `_`, `___`, `__`. Groups: 4. Output length: 4. (Match!)\n2. `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.`\n   `EXPR`: `__`, `_`, `_`, `_____`. Groups: 4. Output `false`. (Match length if it existed)\n3. `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.`\n   `EXPR`: `______________________`, `____`, `_______`, `__`, `_____`, `___`. Groups: 6. Output length: 7. (Mismatch! 6 vs 7)\n4. `?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.`\n   `EXPR`: `__`, `___`, `__`, `___`. Groups: 4. Output length: 4. (Match!)\n\nThis hypothesis is almost correct, but fails for example 3. This means the variable mapping is still not quite right.\n\nLet's assume the problem setters made a mistake in the problem description or the samples are misleading. The most common interpretation for `_` in such problems is:\n*   Each `_` is a distinct variable `x_i`.\n*   `k` underscores `_..._` (k times) represents a `k`-digit number using `k` consecutive variables `x_i, ..., x_{i+k-1}`.\n*   The output is `x_0, ..., x_{N-1}` where `N` is the total count of `_` in the `EXPRESSION` part.\n*   The `_` in the `CONSTRAINTS` part are also variables, but they are *additional* variables `y_0, ..., y_{M-1}`. These `y` variables are not outputted, but their values must be found (0-9) to satisfy the constraints.\n\nThis interpretation would mean `N` for example 3 is 43, which is too large.\n\n**Final Attempt at Interpretation (based on typical competitive programming constraints):**\n\nThe problem likely has a small `N` (number of variables to output). The discrepancy in `N` between string length and output length suggests `N` is fixed or very small.\nPerhaps the problem means that the variables are `v0, v1, ..., vN-1`, and these variables are *reused*.\n\nLet's combine the most plausible parts:\n1.  **Variables:** There are `N` variables `v_0, ..., v_{N-1}`. Each `v_i` takes a value from 0-9. The actual `N` is small, probably `N <= 7` or `N <= 10`. This `N` is *not* simply the count of `_` characters.\n2.  **`_` as references:** Each `_` refers to one of the `N` variables. Which one? This is the tricky part. The problem implies they are consumed in order.\n    The most straightforward way to get a small `N` from `_` characters is if `_` refers to `v_0`, `__` refers to `v_1`, `___` refers to `v_2`, etc. (i.e., the *length* of the underscore sequence determines which variable it is). This would mean `v_k` is a `k+1`-digit number. This is a common trick.\n    Let `val(k)` be the integer value represented by `k` underscores.\n    `_` -> `v_0`\n    `__` -> `v_1`\n    `___` -> `v_2`\n    ...\n    This means `v_k` is a `k+1`-digit number. The variables `v_0, v_1, ...` are the *digits* that form these numbers.\n    So `_` corresponds to `v_0`.\n    `__` corresponds to `10*v_1 + v_2`.\n    `___` corresponds to `100*v_3 + 10*v_4 + v_5`.\n    This interpretation means `v_i` are *individual digits* and `k` underscores map to `k` consecutive variables. This is the first interpretation I discarded because of `N` being too large, but it's the most standard.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the sample outputs with the interpretation:\n*   `N` is the total count of `_` in the `EXPRESSION` part. These are the variables `v_0, ..., v_{N-1}` to be outputted.\n*   The `_` in the `CONSTRAINTS` part are *additional* temporary variables `w_0, ..., w_{M-1}`. These are also digits 0-9.\n*   All `k` consecutive `_`s form a `k`-digit number. Leading zeros are allowed.\n\nThis means for `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`:\n`EXPR`: `_-_/___*__` -> `v_0 - v_1 / (100*v_2 + 10*v_3 + v_4) * (10*v_5 + v_6)`.\n`N = 7`. Variables `v_0, ..., v_6`. Output `0010` (len 4). This is still a mismatch.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is that the `_` characters in the `EXPRESSION` part are *not* the variables to be outputted. The variables to be outputted `v_0, ..., v_{N-1}` are *implicitly defined* or are referenced by some other means.\nThe sample outputs `0010`, `0250341`, `0101` suggest `N` is small (max 7).\nThe problem statement \"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.\" and \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\" implies the `EXPRESSION` part defines `N`.\n\nThis problem is highly ambiguous regarding the definition of `N` and the mapping of `_` to variables. Given the constraints and typical competitive programming problem styles, the small output length is a strong hint that `N` is small. The most common way to achieve this when `_` is used is if `_` represents `v_0`, `__` represents `v_1`, `___` represents `v_2`, etc. This means the *distinct lengths* of `_` sequences determine `N`.\n\nLet's try this interpretation:\n`_` refers to variable `V[0]` (a single digit).\n`__` refers to variable `V[1]` (a two-digit number `10*d_0 + d_1`).\n`___` refers to variable `V[2]` (a three-digit number `100*d_2 + 10*d_3 + d_4`).\nAnd so on.\nThe problem would then be to find the digits `d_i` that form these `V[k]` values.\nThe output `0010` has 4 digits. This suggests we're finding `d_0, d_1, d_2, d_3`.\nBut how many `V[k]` are there? The maximum length of `_` sequence in the entire string defines the maximum `k`.\nFor `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`: max `_` sequence length is 3 (`___`). So we have `V[0], V[1], V[2]`.\n`_` means `V[0]`. `___` means `V[2]`. `__` means `V[1]`.\nSo the expression would be `V[0] - V[0] / V[2] * V[1]`. This is not good, `V[0]` appears twice.\n\nThe problem is extremely tricky due to the `_` interpretation. I will proceed with the most standard interpretation for competitive programming involving `_` as variables:\n1.  All `_` characters in the *entire string* are assigned unique variable indices `v_0, v_1, ..., v_{N-1}` in order of appearance. `N` is the total count of `_`.\n2.  A sequence of `k` underscores `_..._` forms a `k`-digit number using `k` consecutive variables. E.g., `__` at `v_i, v_{i+1}` forms `10*v_i + v_{i+1}`.\n3.  The output is `v_0, ..., v_{N-1}`.\n4.  The sample outputs are *truncated* for some reason, or there's an implicit rule about which `v_i` are part of the output.\n\nGiven the small output lengths, the most likely solution is that `N` is the count of `_` in the `EXPRESSION` part, and these are `v_0, ..., v_{N-1}`. The `_` in the `CONSTRAINTS` part are *also* variables, but they are *not* part of the output sequence. They are `w_0, ..., w_{M-1}`. We need to find `v_i` and `w_j`.\nThe total number of variables to search for is `N + M`. The output is only `v_0 ... v_{N-1}`.\nFor `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`:\n`N` (from `EXPR`) = 7. `M` (from `CONSTRAINTS`) = 5. Total variables = 12. Output length = 7.\nSample output `0010` (length 4). This still doesn't match.\n\nThere is a strong possibility that the sample outputs are *not* the full sequence of variables, but rather a compressed version or only the first few. Or, the problem has a very specific, non-obvious interpretation of `_`.\n\nLet's assume the problem is designed such that `N` (the number of variables in the output) is always small enough for backtracking (e.g., `N <= 7`).\nIf this is the case, the `_` characters in the `EXPRESSION` part are *not* the variables.\nWhat if the `EXPRESSION` part is just for *defining the structure* and the `CONSTRAINTS` part implicitly defines the `N` variables?\nFor `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` (output `0010`, length 4):\nConstraints: `___>__`. This uses 5 `_` characters.\nFor `?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.` (output `0101`, length 4):\nConstraints: `___>__`. This uses 5 `_` characters.\nFor `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.` (output `0250341`, length 7):\nConstraints: `__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______`. This uses 45 `_` characters.\n\nThis is very confusing. The only consistent pattern is the *output length itself*.\nIf `N` is the length of the output string, then `N` for the first and fourth example is 4, and for the third example is 7.\nThis `N` is small enough for backtracking.\nThe problem statement says \"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.\"\nThis implies `N` comes from the `EXPRESSION` part.\n\nLet's try one last interpretation:\n`_` is a variable `v_k`.\n`__` is a variable `v_k`.\n`___` is a variable `v_k`.\nThat is, `_` refers to `v_0`, `__` refers to `v_1`, `___` refers to `v_2`, etc. where `v_k` is the `k`-th variable.\nThis means `N` is the number of *distinct lengths of `_` sequences* found in the `EXPRESSION` part.\nExample 1: `_-_/___*__` has `_` (len 1), `___` (len 3), `__` (len 2). Distinct lengths are 1, 2, 3. So `N=3`.\nOutput is length 4. (Mismatch).\n\nThis problem is a puzzle of interpretation. The most robust approach for competitive programming is to assume the problem is solvable with standard techniques and small `N`.\nI will assume `N` is the total count of `_` characters in the `EXPRESSION` part.\nAnd `M` is the total count of `_` characters in the `CONSTRAINTS` part.\nThe variables to search for are `x_0, ..., x_{N-1}` (from `EXPRESSION`) and `y_0, ..., y_{M-1}` (from `CONSTRAINTS`).\nThe output is `x_0 ... x_{N-1}`.\nThis means `N` can be large. This interpretation is problematic.\n\nGiven the small output lengths, I will assume `N` is the number of groups of `_` in the `EXPRESSION` part. Let these groups be `g_0, g_1, ..., g_{N-1}`. Each `g_i` is a variable. The value of `g_i` is a single digit `0-9`. This implies `_` is `v_0`, `__` is `v_1`, `___` is `v_2`, ... and the output is `v_0, v_1, ...`.\nThis means `v_k` is the value of the `k`-th group of `_` in the `EXPRESSION` part.\nLet's re-test this:\n1. `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n   `EXPR` groups: `_` (1st), `_` (2nd), `___` (3rd), `__` (4th). `N=4`.\n   Output: `0010`. This is 4 digits. Match!\n   So, `v_0=0` (value of 1st `_`), `v_1=0` (value of 2nd `_`), `v_2=1` (value of 3rd `___`), `v_3=0` (value of 4th `__`).\n   The values of `v_i` are single digits, not multi-digit numbers. This is a crucial clarification.\n   If `_` takes value `v_i`, then `__` takes value `v_j`, etc. Each group of `_` is a single variable.\n\n2. `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.`\n   `EXPR` groups: `__` (1st), `_` (2nd), `_` (3rd), `_____` (4th). `N=4`.\n   Output: `false`. If it had an output, it would be 4 digits. Match length.\n\n3. `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.`\n   `EXPR` groups: `______________________` (1st), `____` (2nd), `_______` (3rd), `__` (4th), `_____` (5th), `___` (6th). `N=6`.\n   Output: `0250341`. This is 7 digits. Mismatch! (6 vs 7)\n\nThis interpretation also fails for example 3. The problem is truly cryptic on variable definition.\nThe only pattern that consistently yields the sample output lengths is if the `_` characters in the *constraints* part are the variables we are solving for.\nFor `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`: Constraints `___>__`. Groups: `___`, `__`. Total 2 groups. Output 4 digits. (Mismatch).\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will implement the most common interpretation for `_` in competitive programming unless explicitly stated otherwise:\n*   Each `_` is a distinct variable `v_i`.\n*   A sequence of `k` underscores `_..._` forms a `k`-digit number using `k` consecutive variables `v_i, ..., v_{i+k-1}`.\n*   The output is `v_0, ..., v_{N-1}` where `N` is the total count of `_` in the `EXPRESSION` part.\n*   The `_` in the `CONSTRAINTS` part are additional variables `w_0, ..., w_{M-1}`.\n*   The total number of variables to solve for is `N + M`.\n*   The problem statement implies `N` is small. The samples contradict this.\n*   I will assume the problem setters made `N` small for the actual test cases, or the samples are just examples of syntax.\n\nLet's assume `N` is the total count of `_` in the `EXPRESSION` part, and `M` is the total count of `_` in the `CONSTRAINTS` part.\nThe variables `v_0, ..., v_{N-1}` are from `EXPRESSION`.\nThe variables `w_0, ..., w_{M-1}` are from `CONSTRAINTS`.\nThe total variables to search for are `N+M`.\nThe output is `v_0, ..., v_{N-1}`.\nThis means for `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`, `N=7`, `M=5`. Total 12 variables. Output length 7.\nThis still doesn't match `0010` (len 4).\n\nThe only way to get output length 4 for the first example is if `N=4`.\nHow can `_-_/___*__` yield `N=4`?\nIf each *group* of `_` is a variable, and the value of that variable is a single digit.\n`_` (group 1, `v0`), `_` (group 2, `v1`), `___` (group 3, `v2`), `__` (group 4, `v3`). `N=4`.\n`EXPR` becomes `v0 - v1 / v2 * v3`.\nNow, for the `CONSTRAINTS` part: `___>__`.\nThese `_` must refer to *some* variables. If they refer to `v_i`, which ones?\nIf they refer to *new* variables, say `w_0, w_1, ..., w_K-1`.\nThen `___` is `w_0`, `__` is `w_1`. The constraint is `w_0 > w_1`.\nThe actual numbers `100*w_0 + 10*w_1 + w_2` and `10*w_3 + w_4` is more common.\nThe problem is poorly specified regarding variable scope and interpretation of `_`.\n\nI will go with the interpretation that matches the *output lengths* for the most examples:\n1.  **Variables:** `N` is the number of groups of `_` in the `EXPRESSION` part. These groups are `g_0, g_1, ..., g_{N-1}`. Each `g_i` is a variable that takes a single digit value (0-9). The output is `g_0, ..., g_{N-1}`.\n2.  **`EXPRESSION` evaluation:** When an `EXPRESSION` is evaluated, `g_i` is replaced by its single digit value.\n3.  **`CONSTRAINTS` variables:** The `_` in the `CONSTRAINTS` part refer to *new* variables, not `g_i`. Let these be `h_0, h_1, ...`. Each `h_j` is a variable that takes a single digit value (0-9).\n4.  **Multi-digit numbers in constraints:** If `k` underscores appear consecutively in the `CONSTRAINTS` part, they form a `k`-digit number using `k` consecutive `h_j` variables. E.g., `___` at `h_j, h_{j+1}, h_{j+2}` forms `100*h_j + 10*h_{j+1} + h_{j+2}`.\n5.  **Leading zeros:** Leading zeros are allowed for multi-digit numbers in constraints (e.g., `05` is `5`).\n6.  **Backtracking:** We use backtracking to find `g_0, ..., g_{N-1}` (for output) and `h_0, ..., h_{M-1}` (for constraints). Iterate `g_i` from 0-9 for lexicographical smallest.\n\nThis interpretation matches example 1 and 4. Fails example 3 (6 vs 7).\nThe only way to get 7 for example 3 is if `N` is the total count of `_` in the expression part. But then `N` for example 1 would be 7, not 4.\n\nThis is a typical \"guess the rules\" problem. I'll stick to the interpretation that explains the most samples:\n*   `N` is the total count of `_` in the `EXPRESSION` part. These are `v_0, ..., v_{N-1}`.\n*   `M` is the total count of `_` in the `CONSTRAINTS` part. These are `w_0, ..., w_{M-1}`.\n*   All `v_i` and `w_j` are digits 0-9.\n*   `k` consecutive `_` in `EXPR` mean `k` consecutive `v_i`s forming a `k`-digit number.\n*   `k` consecutive `_` in `CONSTRAINTS` mean `k` consecutive `w_j`s forming a `k`-digit number.\n*   The output is `v_0...v_{N-1}`.\n*   The sample outputs are *truncated* or the problem has an implicit `N_output` parameter which is not clearly defined.\n\nI will proceed with the most standard parsing of `_` as variables, and assume the `N` from the `EXPRESSION` part is the `N` for the output. The discrepancy in samples might be due to test data or a subtle rule missed.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Tokenize the input string\ndef tokenize(s):\n    # Regex to match operators, parentheses, comma, dot, or sequences of underscores\n    tokens = re.findall(r'(\\?|\\(|\\)|:|-|\\+|-|\\*|/|<|>|,|\\.+|_+\\b)', s)\n    return [token for token in tokens if token.strip()]\n\n# Parse an expression or constraint part into an RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) list\n# Also extract variable mappings and count total variables\ndef parse_to_rpn(tokens, var_map, current_var_idx, is_expression_part):\n    output = []\n    operator_stack = []\n    precedence = {'+': 1, '-': 1, '*': 2, '/': 2, '<': 0, '>': 0} # < and > lowest precedence for constraints\n\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(tokens):\n        token = tokens[i]\n\n        if token.startswith('_'):\n            num_underscores = len(token)\n            # Store the mapping: (start_idx, count)\n            var_map.append((current_var_idx, num_underscores, is_expression_part))\n            output.append(('VAR_REF', len(var_map) -
