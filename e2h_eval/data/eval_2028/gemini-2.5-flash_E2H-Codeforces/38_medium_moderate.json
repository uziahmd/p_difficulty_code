    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Journey for a Competitive Programming Challenge**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this intriguing problem. I'm tasked with finding two crucial values related to a `p`-reachable directed graph: the bare minimum number of nodes (`n`) and the maximum number of unidirectional pairs within such a graph.\n\nFirst, let's nail down the definitions. A unidirectional pair means two nodes, `u` and `v`, are linked with a one-way street—a path from `u` to `v` but no return trip. The term `p`-reachable is key: It signifies exactly `p` pairs of nodes where `u` comes before `v` and they can reach each other. This is all about strongly connected components (SCCs); `u` and `v` are reachable if and only if they're buddies within the same SCC.\n\nNow, I zero in on the `p`-reachable condition. Within an SCC of size `k`, any two distinct nodes form a mutually reachable pair. The count of such unordered pairs is `k * (k - 1) / 2`. The problem's rule `u < v` implies that for each unordered pair, we're only counting one direction. So, this gives us `k * (k - 1) / 2` pairs for each SCC.\n\nTo minimize `n` (the number of nodes) while satisfying `p` (the number of reachable pairs), I need to maximize the size of these SCCs. The function `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2` has a quadratic growth—larger SCCs are more efficient. The strategy is to build the largest SCC possible, contributing as much as possible towards the target `p`. I iteratively determine the largest `k` where the number of pairs for SCC of that size doesn't overshoot the current required `p` value.\n\nSo, I start with `k=1`, and go up, finding a maximal `k_max` where `k_max * (k_max - 1) / 2` is still at most equal to the required `p`. This becomes the largest SCC, and the remaining pairs go to the new value of `p`. This greedy approach of picking the largest possible `k` at each step minimizes the number of nodes.\n\nMathematically, `k = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2)` gives this largest `k`.\n\nIf `p` isn't exactly a triangular number (`k*(k-1)/2`), I have leftover pairs. The best I can do here is create additional SCCs of decreasing size. So, I will re-iterate with remaining `p` to calculate next `k`. This is repeated recursively till all pairs are covered.\n\nThis provides the optimal structure of the graph in terms of minimum nodes.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, I have the goal of maximizing unidirectional pairs. Since these pairs involve nodes from different SCCs, I need to make the SCCs ordered to promote one-way relationships. To do this, I arrange the SCCs in a line—a total order. I then draw edges from each node in an SCC to all nodes in the next SCC. In this configuration, for every `u` in an SCC `C_i` and `v` in a subsequent SCC `C_j` (with `i < j`), the pair `(u, v)` becomes unidirectional.\n\nSo, I calculate `(n^2 - sum(k_i^2)) / 2`. `k_i` values are sizes of individual strongly connected components which I calculated in the first part and `n` is the total number of nodes calculated in the first part. This is the final answer! I'm now done and ready to code!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values for a given integer `p`:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. The maximum number of unidirectional pairs of nodes among all such `p`-reachable directed graphs with the minimum number of nodes `n`.\n\nLet's break down the definitions and requirements:\n\n**1. `p`-reachable graph:**\nA graph is `p`-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\nNodes `u` and `v` are reachable from each other if and only if they belong to the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).\nIf an SCC has `k` nodes, any two distinct nodes `u, v` within this SCC are mutually reachable. The number of unordered pairs `{u, v}` within this SCC is `k * (k - 1) / 2`. Each such unordered pair corresponds to exactly one ordered pair `(u, v)` with `u < v` (or `(v, u)` with `v < u`) that satisfies the `p`-reachable condition.\nTherefore, if a graph has SCCs of sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`, the total number of `p`-reachable pairs is `sum(k_i * (k_i - 1) / 2)` over all SCCs. The total number of nodes is `n = sum(k_i)`.\n\n**Minimizing `n` for a given `p`:**\nTo minimize the total number of nodes `n` while achieving a target `p`, we want to maximize the \"efficiency\" of nodes in contributing to `p`. The function `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2` (pairs from `k` nodes) grows quadratically. The average number of pairs per node, `(k-1)/2`, increases with `k`. This means larger SCCs are more efficient.\nThus, a greedy strategy is optimal: repeatedly choose the largest possible SCC size `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2` does not exceed the remaining `p`.\n\nAlgorithm for minimum `n`:\n1. Initialize `min_n = 0` and an empty list `scc_sizes` to store the sizes of the chosen SCCs.\n2. While `p > 0`:\n   a. Find the largest integer `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= p`.\n      This can be found by solving `k^2 - k - 2p <= 0` for `k`. The positive root of `k^2 - k - 2p = 0` is `(1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2`. So, `k = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2)`.\n   b. Add `k` to `min_n`.\n   c. Add `k` to `scc_sizes`.\n   d. Subtract `k * (k - 1) / 2` from `p`.\n3. The final `min_n` is the minimum number of nodes.\n\n**Special case for `p=0`:**\nIf `p=0`, we need zero pairs `(u,v)` with `u<v` that are mutually reachable. This can be achieved with a single node (an SCC of size 1). A graph with 1 node has no distinct pairs `u,v`, so no `p`-reachable pairs.\nThe formula `k = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8*0)) / 2)` gives `k=0`. If we treat `k=0` as contributing 0 pairs and 0 nodes, the loop won't terminate or will result in `n=0`.\nThus, for `p=0`, the minimum number of nodes is `1`.\n\n**2. Maximizing unidirectional pairs:**\nAn ordered pair `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u != v`, there's a path `u -> v`, and there are no paths `v -> u`. This means `u` and `v` are in different SCCs, and there's a path from `SCC(u)` to `SCC(v)` in the condensation graph (the DAG of SCCs).\nLet the SCCs found by the greedy strategy be `C_1, C_2, ..., C_m` with sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`. To maximize unidirectional pairs, we arrange these SCCs in a linear chain. For example, we can add edges from every node in `C_i` to every node in `C_{i+1}` for all `i = 1, ..., m-1`.\nWith this construction:\n- For any `u` in `C_i` and `v` in `C_j` where `i < j`, there is a path `u -> v`.\n- There is no path `v -> u` because the condensation graph is a DAG (a simple path).\nTherefore, all `k_i * k_j` pairs `(u, v)` with `u \\in C_i, v \\in C_j` for `i < j` are unidirectional.\nThe total number of unidirectional pairs is `sum_{1 <= i < j <= m} (k_i * k_j)`.\nThis sum can be computed more efficiently using the identity:\n`(sum k_i)^2 = sum(k_i^2) + 2 * sum_{i < j} (k_i * k_j)`\nSo, `sum_{i < j} (k_i * k_j) = ( (sum k_i)^2 - sum(k_i^2) ) / 2`.\nSince `sum k_i = min_n`, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is `(min_n^2 - sum(k_i^2)) / 2`.\n\n**Example `p=3`:**\n1. `p=3`.\n   `k = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8*3)) / 2) = floor((1 + sqrt(25)) / 2) = floor((1 + 5) / 2) = 3`.\n   `min_n = 3`. `scc_sizes = [3]`. `p = 3 - (3 * 2 / 2) = 3 - 3 = 0`.\n2. Loop terminates. `min_n = 3`.\n3. `sum(k_i^2) = 3^2 = 9`.\n4. Max unidirectional pairs = `(3^2 - 9) / 2 = (9 - 9) / 2 = 0`.\nOutput: `3 0`.\n\n**Example `p=4`:**\n1. `p=4`.\n   `k = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8*4)) / 2) = floor((1 + sqrt(33)) / 2) = floor((1 + 5.74) / 2) = 3`.\n   `min_n = 3`. `scc_sizes = [3]`. `p = 4 - (3 * 2 / 2) = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n2. `p=1`.\n   `k = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8*1)) / 2) = floor((1 + sqrt(9)) / 2) = floor((1 + 3) / 2) = 2`.\n   `min_n = 3 + 2 = 5`. `scc_sizes = [3, 2]`. `p = 1 - (2 * 1 / 2) = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n3. Loop terminates. `min_n = 5`.\n4. `sum(k_i^2) = 3^2 + 2^2 = 9 + 4 = 13`.\n5. Max unidirectional pairs = `(5^2 - 13) / 2 = (25 - 13) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6`.\nOutput: `5 6`.\n\n**Complexity:**\nThe `while` loop runs a small number of times (`m`). The value of `p` decreases very rapidly, roughly `p_{new} = O(\\sqrt{p_{old}})` in the worst case, so `m` is `O(log log p)`. The loop for `sum(k_i^2)` runs `m` times. Overall complexity is very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    p = int(input())\n\n    if p == 0:\n        # For p=0, the minimum number of nodes is 1 (a single node graph).\n        # A single node graph has no pairs (u,v) with u != v, so no unidirectional pairs.\n        print(\"1 0\")\n        return\n\n    min_n = 0\n    scc_sizes = [] # To store k_i values (sizes of strongly connected components)\n\n    current_p = p\n    while current_p > 0:\n        # Find the largest integer k such that k * (k - 1) / 2 <= current_p.\n        # This is derived from the quadratic equation k^2 - k - 2*current_p = 0.\n        # The positive root is (1 + sqrt(1 + 8*current_p)) / 2.\n        # Since k must be an integer, we take the floor.\n        # For current_p > 0, k will always be at least 2 (f(2)=1).\n        k_float = (1 + math.sqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)) / 2\n        k = int(k_float)\n\n        # Calculate the number of pairs contributed by an SCC of size k.\n        pairs_from_k = k * (k - 1) // 2\n\n        # Add k nodes to the total minimum nodes.\n        min_n += k\n        # Store the size of this SCC.\n        scc_sizes.append(k)\n        # Reduce the remaining pairs needed.\n        current_p -= pairs_from_k\n\n    # Calculate the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n    # This is achieved by arranging the SCCs in a linear chain.\n    # The formula is ( (sum k_i)^2 - sum (k_i^2) ) / 2.\n    \n    sum_of_k_i_squared = 0\n    for k_val in scc_sizes:\n        sum_of_k_i_squared += k_val * k_val\n    \n    max_unidirectional_pairs = (min_n * min_n - sum_of_k_i_squared) // 2\n\n    print(min_n, max_unidirectional_pairs)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
