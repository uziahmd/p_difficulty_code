They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Mushroom Strife Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Mushroom Strife\" problem, and it's a classic graph problem with some number theory mixed in.  We've got `n` lawns (nodes) and `m` roads (edges), and each road tells us the GCD and LCM of the mushroom counts on the connected lawns. The goal is to figure out if there's *any* valid mushroom count assignment that satisfies all the GCD and LCM constraints.  If there is, we need to output the counts; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\nFirst, let's break down the core constraints. For each edge,  `gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = a * b`.  `gcd` divides both `a` and `b`, while both `a` and `b` divide `lcm`.  Also, and this is crucial, `gcd` must divide `lcm` or we have an immediate NO.  The mushroom counts are between 1 and 10^6, which is small enough to play with.\n\nThinking about it, we have an edge with `g = gcd` and `l = lcm`. From the relationship `a*b = g*l`, it's clear that if `g` doesn't divide `l`, we can stop immediately – there's no solution. If `g` divides `l`, and we let `P = l / g`, and if our two numbers are `x_u` and `x_v`, then  `x_u = g * a'` and `x_v = g * b'`, where  `a' * b' = P` and `gcd(a', b') = 1`.  So, we're looking for factor pairs of `P` that are co-prime.\n\nThis sounds like a graph problem, so I'm thinking of building a graph where each lawn is a node.  An edge between two nodes gives us this relationship between their mushroom counts.  Since it's not a decision problem (we just need *a* valid assignment), maybe we can approach this constructively.  I'll start with some initial value and then see how constraints propagate.\n",
