Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Vanya and the Lanterns: Finding the Optimal Radius**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for Vanya's lantern problem. Let's break this down. We have a street of length *l* and *n* lanterns at specific positions *a<sub>i</sub>*. Each lantern has a radius *d*, lighting a segment of the street. The goal is to find the *minimum* radius *d* required to illuminate the entire street.\n\nFirst, understanding the problem is key. It's about ensuring every point from 0 to *l* is covered by at least one lantern's light. The given positions *a<sub>i</sub>* and the street length *l* are our constraints.\n\nThe crucial idea here is that sorting the lantern positions is going to simplify the analysis. Let's sort the `a_i` values. This will allow us to easily identify and consider the gaps between the lanterns.\n\nNow, let's analyze how to calculate the minimum radius *d*.  We've got three areas to look at.\n\n1.  **Gaps between lanterns:**  The biggest challenge lies in the spaces between the lanterns. If we have two adjacent lanterns at *a<sub>i</sub>* and *a<sub>i+1</sub>*, we have to light the space between them.  We need to ensure that the light from at least one of them reaches the midpoint between them; i.e., we are interested in *d >= (a<sub>i+1</sub> - a<sub>i</sub>) / 2*.  To cover *all* gaps, we need to find the largest of these midpoints, which gives us *d<sub>1</sub> = max((a<sub>i+1</sub> - a<sub>i</sub>) / 2)*.\n\n2.  **The Left End:** The point 0 has to be lit. The leftmost lantern, *a<sub>0</sub>*, has to cover 0. Thus, *d >= a<sub>0</sub>*. That's our *d<sub>2</sub> = a<sub>0</sub>*.\n\n3.  **The Right End:** Finally, we have the right end of the street, *l*. The rightmost lantern, *a<sub>n-1</sub>*, has to cover *l*. This is straightforward: d >= (l - a<sub>n-1</sub>).\n\nThe critical part now is combining these requirements. We need to handle all three constraints simultaneously. The biggest radius *d* from these three is the one that works: *d = max(d<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>2</sub>, d<sub>3</sub>)*. This *d* guarantees full street coverage. We need to express this in Python: sort the input, calculate the gaps, get the maximum midpoint between lanterns, consider the distance to the left end of the street, and also the distance to the right end of the street, then take the maximum! This should give us the minimal value.\n",
