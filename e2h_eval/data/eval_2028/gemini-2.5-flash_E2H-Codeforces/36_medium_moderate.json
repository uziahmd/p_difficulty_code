The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of this competitive programming problem.** My goal is to determine the probability of a valid signal power assignment. I need to handle some specific constraints.\n\nFirst, I define the key components.  There are towns numbered 0 through n+1. Towns 1 to n can have a tower with a 50% probability.  Each tower has a power *p* that determines its range, and that range is affected by towns with those towers. I note a couple of constraints on the power and placement of the towers.  Towns 0 and n+1 should not receive any signal, and all towns 1 to n must be covered by *exactly one* tower.\n\nI then consider how to represent this. I let *S* be the set of towns containing towers. I need to determine a signal power, *p_i*, for each tower *i* in *S*. The towers must satisfy some conditions. First, the power must be within certain bounds dictated by the town’s location and the no-signal zones at 0 and n+1.  Specifically, the tower at *i* can’t have power greater than *i* or *n+1-i*.\n\nCrucially, the ranges of the towers must form a partition of towns 1 through n; each town must be covered by precisely one tower. I also consider the covered intervals using *L_i* and *R_i*, the left and right endpoints of a tower at location *i*. These intervals need to fit together perfectly, without overlaps, and must cover the entire range. I define *L_i = i-p_i+1* and *R_i = i+p_i-1*. The constraints mean that *1 <= p_i <= min(i, n+1-i)*.\n\nI see that the union of these intervals has to be {1, …, n} and each interval is disjoint. This translates to the following condition on the boundaries, *R_i + 1 = L_{j}* for adjacent towers. This means that if there is a tower at *i* with power *p*, then the next tower must begin precisely after *i*’s coverage ends. Further, the length of each interval is *2p_i-1* for a tower at location *i*. The sum of these lengths must be *n*, which helps me frame the problem in terms of combinatorics or dynamic programming.\n\nI consider the case where the covered intervals are formed in sequence, and define a sequence of towns. It can be characterized by a set *S* containing tower locations, along with corresponding power assignments. The endpoints of intervals are symmetric, because *L_i = i-(p_i-1)* and *R_i = i+(p_i-1)*.\n\nThe fact that the intervals must not overlap means that for towers at *i* and *j*, where *i < j*, it must be the case that *R_i < L_j*.\n\nI also consider a constraint for the positions of the towers, and the powers. If *i* and *j* are tower locations and *p_i*, *p_j* are powers. Then *i+p_i* has to be less than *j-p_j+1*.\n\nI then formalize the constraints for the interval structure.  If towers are in locations *i_1, …, i_k*, they can cover the range [1, *n*], so *L_{i_1} = 1* and *R_{i_k} = n* and *R_{i_j} + 1 = L_{i_{j+1}}* for all *j*.\n\nThe formulas translate into constraints on powers:  *p_{i_1} = i_1* and *p_{i_k} = n-i_k+1*. For all other values, *p_{i_j} + p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1}-i_j+1*. I’ll define a new term *x_j* as right endpoint location. So *x_j = i_j+p_i-1*. Since the right endpoint of the next is *x_j + 1*, then *x_j = (i_j+p_{i_j} - 1)*, implying a relationship between all variables.\n\nI revisit constraints on *p_j* values. Then, *1 <= p_j <= min(j, n+1-j)*. For the initial power assignments *p_{i_1} = i_1*, so *i_1 <= (n+1)/2*. For the last interval, *n+1 >= 2i_k*.\n\nNext, I review",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the probability that, given $n$ potential tower locations (towns $1$ to $n$), a valid assignment of signal powers exists for the towers that are built. Each tower is built with probability $1/2$. The constraints for signal power assignment are:\n1. Towns $0$ and $n+1$ receive no signal.\n2. Towns $1, \\dots, n$ receive signal from exactly one tower.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built. For each $i \\in S$, we choose a signal power $p_i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. A tower at town $i$ with power $p_i$ covers towns $c$ such that $|c - i| < p_i$. This means it covers the interval of towns $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\n\nLet $L_i = i-p_i+1$ and $R_i = i+p_i-1$.\nThe first constraint (towns $0$ and $n+1$ receive no signal) implies that for all $i \\in S$:\n* $L_i \\ge 1 \\implies i-p_i+1 \\ge 1 \\implies p_i \\le i$.\n* $R_i \\le n \\implies i+p_i-1 \\le n \\implies p_i \\le n-i+1$.\nCombining these, $p_i \\le \\min(i, n-i+1)$. Note that $p_i \\ge 1$ is also required.\n\nThe second constraint (towns $1, \\dots, n$ receive signal from exactly one tower) means that the intervals $[L_i, R_i]$ for $i \\in S$ must form a partition of the set of towns $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nIf we sort the towns in $S$ as $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$, then the conditions are:\n1. $L_{i_1} = 1 \\implies i_1 - p_{i_1} + 1 = 1 \\implies p_{i_1} = i_1$.\n2. $R_{i_k} = n \\implies i_k + p_{i_k} - 1 = n \\implies p_{i_k} = n - i_k + 1$.\n3. For $j = 1, \\dots, k-1$: $R_{i_j} + 1 = L_{i_{j+1}} \\implies (i_j+p_{i_j}-1)+1 = (i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1) \\implies i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1$.\n\nLet's substitute $p_{i_1}=i_1$ into the third condition for $j=1$:\n$i_1+i_1 = i_2-p_{i_2}+1 \\implies 2i_1 = i_2-p_{i_2}+1 \\implies p_{i_2} = i_2-2i_1+1$.\nSubstitute this into the third condition for $j=2$:\n$i_2+(i_2-2i_1+1) = i_3-p_{i_3}+1 \\implies 2i_2-2i_1+1 = i_3-p_{i_3}+1 \\implies p_{i_3} = i_3-2i_2+2i_1$.\nIn general, for $j \\ge 2$: $p_{i_j} = i_j - 2i_{j-1} + 2i_{j-2} - \\dots + (-1)^{j-2}2i_2 + (-1)^{j-1}2i_1$.\nThis can be written as $p_{i_j} = i_j + \\sum_{t=1}^{j-1} (-1)^{j-t} 2i_t$.\n\nNow, substitute $p_{i_k}$ into the last equation ($p_{i_k} = n-i_k+1$):\n$n-i_k+1 = i_k + \\sum_{t=1}^{k-1} (-1)^{k-t} 2i_t$.\n$n+1 = 2i_k + \\sum_{t=1}^{k-1} (-1)^{k-t} 2i_t = 2 \\left( i_k + \\sum_{t=1}^{k-1} (-1)^{k-t} i_t \\right)$.\n$n+1 = 2 \\left( i_k - i_{k-1} + i_{k-2} - \\dots + (-1)^{k-1} i_1 \\right)$.\nThis implies that $n+1$ must be an even number, so $n$ must be odd.\nIf $n$ is even, there is no way to set signal powers to satisfy all conditions. The probability is $0$.\n\nLet's verify this with the example $n=2$. $n$ is even. The output is $1/4$. This contradicts my derivation.\nWhat went wrong? The definition of \"reach\" is $|c-i|<p$. This means $c \\in (i-p, i+p)$. The values $i-p$ and $i+p$ are *not* included.\nThe towns covered are $i-p+1, \\dots, i+p-1$.\nThe interval of *coordinates* covered is $(i-p, i+p)$.\nThe conditions $L_{i_1}=1$ and $R_{i_k}=n$ are correct for towns.\nThe condition $R_{i_j}+1 = L_{i_{j+1}}$ means the towns covered are exactly $1, \\dots, n$.\nThe coordinates $i-p_i$ and $i+p_i$ are the \"boundaries\" of the signal range.\nLet $B_0 = 0$.\nThe first tower at $i_1$ covers $(B_0, B_1)$ where $B_1 = i_1+p_{i_1}$. $p_{i_1}$ must be $i_1-B_0 = i_1$.\nThe $j$-th tower at $i_j$ covers $(B_{j-1}, B_j)$, where $B_{j-1} = i_j-p_{i_j}$ and $B_j = i_j+p_{i_j}$.\nThe last tower at $i_k$ covers $(B_{k-1}, B_k)$ where $B_k = n+1$. $p_{i_k}$ must be $B_k-i_k = n+1-i_k$.\nSo we have:\n1. $p_{i_1} = i_1$.\n2. $p_{i_k} = n+1-i_k$.\n3. For $j=1, \\dots, k-1$: $i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$. (This is $B_j = B_{j-1}'$ for $j+1$-th tower).\n\nThese are the same equations as before.\n$p_{i_j} = i_j - 2i_{j-1} + 2i_{j-2} - \\dots + (-1)^{j-2}2i_2 + (-1)^{j-1}2i_1$. (for $j \\ge 2$)\nAnd $n+1 = 2(i_k - i_{k-1} + i_{k-2} - \\dots + (-1)^{k-1} i_1)$.\nThis implies $n+1$ must be even, so $n$ must be odd.\n\nThe example $n=2$ (even) with output $1/4$ means my conclusion that $n$ must be odd is incorrect.\nLet's re-evaluate the constraints $p_i \\le \\min(i, n-i+1)$.\n$p_{i_1}=i_1$: $i_1 \\le \\min(i_1, n-i_1+1) \\implies i_1 \\le n-i_1+1 \\implies 2i_1 \\le n+1$.\n$p_{i_k}=n-i_k+1$: $n-i_k+1 \\le \\min(i_k, n-i_k+1) \\implies n-i_k+1 \\le i_k \\implies n+1 \\le 2i_k$.\n\nThe recurrence $p_{i_j} + p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1}-i_j+1$ (from the problem statement's example $n=5$, $2,4,5$ with $p_2=2, p_4=1, p_5=1$) is different from my $p_{i_j} + p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1}-i_j$.\nLet's use the problem description's example $n=5$, towers $2,4,5$.\n$i_1=2, i_2=4, i_3=5$.\n$p_2=2, p_4=1, p_5=1$.\n$L_2=2-2+1=1, R_2=2+2-1=3$. Interval $[1,3]$.\n$L_4=4-1+1=4, R_4=4+1-1=4$. Interval $[4,4]$.\n$L_5=5-1+1=5, R_5=5+1-1=5$. Interval $[5,5]$.\nThese intervals are $[1,3], [4,4], [5,5]$. They partition $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$.\nLet's check the conditions:\n1. $p_{i_1}=i_1 \\implies p_2=2$. This holds.\n2. $p_{i_k}=n-i_k+1 \\implies p_5=5-5+1=1$. This holds.\n3. For $j=1$: $i_1+p_{i_1} = i_2-p_{i_2}+1 \\implies 2+p_2 = 4-p_4+1 \\implies 2+2=4-p_4+1 \\implies 4=5-p_4 \\implies p_4=1$. This holds.\n4. For $j=2$: $i_2+p_{i_2} = i_3-p_{i_3}+1 \\implies 4+p_4 = 5-p_5+1 \\implies 4+1=5-p_5+1 \\implies 5=6-p_5 \\implies p_5=1$. This holds.\n\nSo the correct conditions are:\n$p_{i_1} = i_1$.\n$p_{i_k} = n-i_k+1$.\nFor $1 \\le j < k$: $p_{i_j} + p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1}-i_j+1$.\n\nFrom $p_{i_j} + p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1}-i_j+1$, we get $p_{i_{j+1}} = (i_{j+1}-i_j+1)-p_{i_j}$.\nLet $S_j = i_j+p_{i_j}$ and $D_j = i_j-p_{i_j}$.\nThe condition $i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1$ means $S_j = D_{j+1}+1$.\nThe total length of covered towns is $n$. The length of interval for $i_j$ is $2p_{i_j}-1$.\n$\\sum_{j=1}^k (2p_{i_j}-1) = n$.\n\nLet's analyze $p_j$ values:\n$p_{i_1} = i_1$.\n$p_{i_2} = (i_2-i_1+1) - p_{i_1} = i_2-i_1+1 - i_1 = i_2-2i_1+1$.\n$p_{i_3} = (i_3-i_2+1) - p_{i_2} = i_3-i_2+1 - (i_2-2i_1+1) = i_3-2i_2+2i_1$.\nIn general, $p_{i_j} = i_j - 2i_{j-1} + 2i_{j-2} - \\dots + (-1)^{j-2}2i_2 + (-1)^{j-1}2i_1 + (-1)^{j-1}$.\nThis can be written as $p_{i_j} = i_j + \\sum_{t=1}^{j-1} (-1)^{j-t} 2i_t + (-1)^{j-1}$.\nThe final condition is $p_{i_k} = n-i_k+1$.\n$n-i_k+1 = i_k + \\sum_{t=1}^{k-1} (-1)^{k-t} 2i_t + (-1)^{k-1}$.\n$n+1 = 2i_k + \\sum_{t=1}^{k-1} (-1)^{k-t} 2i_t + (-1)^{k-1} - 1 + 1$\n$n+1 = 2i_k - 2i_{k-1} + 2i_{k-2} - \\dots + (-1)^{k-1}2i_1 + (-1)^{k-1} + 1$.\n$n = 2(i_k - i_{k-1} + i_{k-2} - \\dots + (-1)^{k-1}i_1) + (-1)^{k-1}$.\nLet $S = i_k - i_{k-1} + \\dots + (-1)^{k-1}i_1$.\nThen $n = 2S + (-1)^{k-1}$.\nIf $k$ is odd, $n = 2S+1$. This means $n$ must be odd.\nIf $k$ is even, $n = 2S-1$. This means $n$ must be odd.\nSo $n$ must always be odd. This again contradicts $n=2$ example.\n\nThis means that the towers $i_1, \\dots, i_k$ and their powers $p_{i_1}, \\dots, p_{i_k}$ are not uniquely determined by the choice of $i_j$. Instead, there must be some flexibility.\nThe problem statement says \"you will have a way to set signal powers\". This means *existence*.\n\nLet's look at the structure of intervals again.\nIf we have towers at $i_1, \\dots, i_k$.\nThe interval covered by $i_j$ is $[i_j-p_{i_j}+1, i_j+p_{i_j}-1]$.\nLet $x_0=0, x_1, \\dots, x_k=n$. These are the boundaries.\nThe $j$-th tower covers $[x_{j-1}+1, x_j]$.\nThe town $i_j$ must be in its covered interval: $x_{j-1}+1 \\le i_j \\le x_j$.\nThe power $p_{i_j}$ is determined by $x_{j-1}$ and $x_j$:\n$i_j-p_{i_j}+1 = x_{j-1}+1 \\implies p_{i_j} = i_j-x_{j-1}$.\n$i_j+p_{i_j}-1 = x_j \\implies p_{i_j} = x_j-i_j+1$.\nFor these two to be consistent, $i_j-x_{j-1} = x_j-i_j+1 \\implies 2i_j = x_j+x_{j-1}+1$.\nThis means $x_j+x_{j-1}$ must be odd. So $x_j$ and $x_{j-1}$ must have different parities.\n\nSo we need to find a sequence of towns $0=x_0 < i_1 < x_1 < i_2 < x_2 < \\dots < i_k < x_k=n$ such that:\n1. $i_j \\in S$ for $j=1, \\dots, k$.\n2. For each $j$, $x_j$ and $x_{j-1}$ have different parities.\n3. For each $j$, $x_{j-1}+1 \\le i_j \\le x_j$.\n4. The powers $p_{i_j} = i_j-x_{j-1}$ (or $x_j-i_j+1$) must satisfy $1 \\le p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n-i_j+1)$.\n   $i_j-x_{j-1} \\ge 1 \\implies i_j > x_{j-1}$. This is guaranteed by $x_{j-1}+1 \\le i_j$.\n   $x_j-i_j+1 \\ge 1 \\implies i_j \\le x_j$. This is guaranteed by $i_j \\le x_j$.\n   $i_j-x_{j-1} \\le i_j \\implies -x_{j-1} \\le 0 \\implies x_{j-1} \\ge 0$. This is true.\n   $i_j-x_{j-1} \\le n-i_j+1 \\implies 2i_j \\le n+1+x_{j-1}$.\n   $x_j-i_j+1 \\le i_j \\implies x_j+1 \\le 2i_j$.\n   $x_j-i_j+1 \\le n-i_j+1 \\implies x_j \\le n$. This is true.\n\nThe crucial condition is $2i_j = x_j+x_{j-1}+1$. This implies $x_j+x_{j-1}$ must be odd, so $x_j$ and $x_{j-1}$ must have different parities.\nSince $x_0=0$ (even), $x_1$ must be odd, $x_2$ must be even, $x_3$ must be odd, and so on.\nTherefore, $x_j$ must have parity $j \\pmod 2$.\nSince $x_k=n$, $n$ must have parity $k \\pmod 2$.\nThis means $k \\equiv n \\pmod 2$. The number of intervals must have the same parity as $n$.\n\nAlso, from $2i_j = x_j+x_{j-1}+1$, we have $i_j = (x_j+x_{j-1}+1)/2$.\nSo, for each $j$, the tower $i_j$ must be located at the midpoint of the interval $(x_{j-1}, x_j)$ (including endpoints).\nThe set $S$ must be exactly $\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$.\nThis means that a valid configuration exists if and only if there exists a sequence $0=x_0 < x_1 < \\dots < x_k=n$ such that:\n1. $x_j$ and $x_{j-1}$ have different parities for all $j=1, \\dots, k$.\n2. For each $j=1, \\dots, k$, the town $i_j = (x_j+x_{j-1}+1)/2$ must exist (i.e., be an integer) and a tower must be built at $i_j$.\n3. No other towers are built.\n\nThe second condition means $x_j+x_{j-1}+1$ must be even. Since $x_j, x_{j-1}$ have different parities, $x_j+x_{j-1}$ is odd, so $x_j+x_{j-1}+1$ is even. This is always satisfied.\nThe conditions simplify to:\nA valid configuration exists iff there is a sequence $0=x_0 < x_1 < \\dots < x_k=n$ such that:\n1. $x_j$ and $x_{j-1}$ have different parities for all $j=1, \\dots, k$.\n2. For each $j=1, \\dots, k$, a tower is built at $i_j = (x_j+x_{j-1}+1)/2$.\n3. No tower is built at any town $t \\notin \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$.\n\nThe positions $i_j$ are integers from $1$ to $n$.\nThe condition $x_j$ and $x_{j-1}$ have different parities implies $x_j - x_{j-1}$ is odd.\nAlso, $i_j = (x_j+x_{j-1}+1)/2$.\nThe distance $x_j-x_{j-1}$ must be at least $1$.\nSince $x_j-x_{j-1}$ is odd, it must be at least $1$.\nSo $x_j \\ge x_{j-1}+1$.\nThe smallest possible value for $i_j$ is $(x_{j-1}+(x_{j-1}+1)+1)/2 = x_{j-1}+1$.\nThe largest possible value for $i_j$ is $((x_j-1)+x_j+1)/2 = x_j$.\nSo $x_{j-1}+1 \\le i_j \\le x_j$. This is a valid town in the interval.\n\nConsider the towns $1, \\dots, n$.\nWe are looking for a sequence $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$ (where towers are built).\nLet $i_0 = 0$ and $i_{k+1}=n+1$.\nThe condition $p_{i_j} + p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1}-i_j+1$ can be rewritten as $p_{i_j} - (i_j-i_{j-1})/2 = (i_{j+1}-i_j)/2 - p_{i_{j+1}}$.\nLet $L_j = i_j - p_{i_j} + 1$ and $R_j = i_j + p_{i_j} - 1$.\nThe conditions are $L_1=1, R_k=n, R_j+1=L_{j+1}$.\nThe values $i_j$ are the centers of the intervals.\nThe sequence of towns where towers are built must be $i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_k$.\nThe condition $2i_j = x_j+x_{j-1}+1$ means $i_j$ is the midpoint of $x_{j-1}+1$ and $x_j$.\nThis means $i_j$ is the center of the interval $[x_{j-1}+1, x_j]$.\nThe length of this interval is $x_j-x_{j-1}$.\nThe power $p_{i_j}$ is $(x_j-x_{j-1}+1)/2$.\nSo $x_j-x_{j-1}$ must be odd.\nLet $d_j = x_j-x_{j-1}$. Then $d_j$ must be odd.\nAlso, $i_j = x_{j-1} + (d_j+1)/2$.\nThe set of towns where towers are built must be precisely $\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ where $i_j = x_{j-1} + (d_j+1)/2$.\nAll other towns $t \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ such that $t \\notin \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ must not have a tower.\n\nThis is a known problem structure related to compositions of $n$ into odd parts.\nLet $d_j = x_j-x_{j-1}$. Then $d_j$ must be odd and $d_j \\ge 1$.\n$d_1+d_2+\\dots+d_k = (x_1-x_0)+(x_2-x_1)+\\dots+(x_k-x_{k-1}) = x_k-x_0 = n-0=n$.\nSo we are partitioning $n$ into $k$ odd positive integers $d_1, \\dots, d_k$.\nFor each such composition, we define $x_0=0, x_j = x_{j-1}+d_j$.\nThen $i_j = x_{j-1} + (d_j+1)/2$.\nThe set of towns where towers must be built is $T = \\{ (x_{j-1} + (d_j+1)/2) \\mid j=1, \\dots, k \\}$.\nThe probability is the sum over all such compositions $(d_1, \\dots, d_k)$ of $P(\\text{towers built in } T \\text{ and nowhere else})$.\nThis probability is $(1/2)^{|T|} \\cdot (1/2)^{n-|T|} = (1/2)^n$. This is because $|T|=k$ and the total number of possible tower locations is $n$.\nNo, this is wrong. $|T|=k$ is the number of towers built. The number of towns where towers are *not* built is $n-k$.\nSo the probability for a specific set $T$ is $(1/2)^k \\cdot (1/2)^{n-k} = (1/2)^n$.\nThis means that for *any* valid choice of $k$ tower locations $i_1, \\dots, i_k$, the probability of that exact configuration (these $k$ towers built, and the other $n-k$ not built) is $(1/2)^n$.\n\nSo we just need to count the number of valid sequences $(d_1, \\dots, d_k)$ such that $d_j$ is odd, $d_j \\ge 1$, and $\\sum d_j = n$.\nThis is the number of compositions of $n$ into odd parts.\nLet $a_n$ be this number.\n$a_n = a_{n-1}$ (if $d_k=1$) $+ a_{n-3}$ (if $d_k=3$) $+ \\dots$.\n$a_n = \\sum_{j \\text{ odd}, j \\ge 1} a_{n-j}$.\n$a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-3} + \\dots + a_{n-(n \\text{ or } n-1)}$.\n$a_1=1$ (composition is (1)). $i_1=(0+(1+1)/2)=1$. Tower at 1. $k=1$.\n$a_2=1$ (composition is (1,1)). $k=2$. $x_0=0, d_1=1 \\implies x_1=1$. $i_1=(0+(1+1)/2)=1$. $x_1=1, d_2=1 \\implies x_2=2$. $i_2=(1+(1+1)/2)=2$. Towers at 1, 2.\n$a_3=2$ (compositions are (3), (1,1,1)).\nFor (3): $k=1$. $x_0=0, d_1=3 \\implies x_1=3$. $i_1=(0+(3+1)/2)=2$. Tower at 2.\nFor (1,1,1): $k=3$. $x_0=0, d_1=1 \\implies x_1=1$. $i_1=1$. $x_1=1, d_2=1 \\implies x_2=2$. $i_2=2$. $x_2=2, d_3=1 \\implies x_3=3$. $i_3=3$. Towers at 1,2,3.\n\nThe recurrence is $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ for $n \\ge 2$, with $a_0=1$.\n$a_0=1$ (empty sum for $n=0$, represents base case for recursion, no parts sum to 0).\n$a_1=1$ (composition (1)).\n$a_2=a_1+a_0 = 1+1=2$. (Compositions (1,1) and (2) - but 2 is not odd. How does this work?)\nThe sum of odd parts implies $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-3} + \\dots$.\n$a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-3} + a_{n-5} + \\dots$\n$a_{n-1} = a_{n-2} + a_{n-4} + a_{n-6} + \\dots$\nSubtracting the second from the first: $a_n - a_{n-1} = a_{n-1} + a_{n-3} + \\dots - (a_{n-2} + a_{n-4} + \\dots)$.\n$a_n - a_{n-1} = a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}$ (if $n$ is even, last term $a_0$; if $n$ is odd, last term $a_1$).\nThis is $a_n = 2a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}$. This is not Fibonacci.\n\nLet's re-derive $a_n$.\nThe last part $d_k$ can be $1, 3, 5, \\dots$.\nIf $d_k=1$, the sum for the first $k-1$ parts is $n-1$. There are $a_{n-1}$ ways.\nIf $d_k=3$, the sum for the first $k-1$ parts is $n-3$. There are $a_{n-3}$ ways.\nSo $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-3} + a_{n-5} + \\dots + a_{n-m}$ where $m$ is the largest odd number $\\le n$.\nBase cases:\n$a_0 = 1$ (empty composition for 0)\n$a_1 = a_0 = 1$ (composition (1))\n$a_2 = a_1 = 1$ (composition (1,1))\n$a_3 = a_2+a_0 = 1+1=2$ (compositions (1,1,1), (3))\n$a_4 = a_3+a_1 = 2+1=3$ (compositions (1,1,1,1), (1,3), (3,1))\n$a_5 = a_4+a_2 = 3+1=4$ (compositions (1,1,1,1,1), (1,1,3), (1,3,1), (3,1,1), (5))\nThis sequence is $1,1,1,2,3,4,6, \\dots$\nLet $F_m$ be the $m$-th Fibonacci number with $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nThen $a_n = F_{n+1}$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n$a_1 = F_2 = 1$.\n$a_2 = F_3 = 2$. Oh, my $a_2$ was 1, now it's 2.\nLet's check $a_2$. Compositions of 2 into odd parts: (1,1). Only one. So $a_2=1$.\nWhere is the error?\nThe definition $i_j = x_{j-1} + (d_j+1)/2$.\nFor $n=2$, composition $(1,1)$. $d_1=1, d_2=1$.\n$x_0=0, d_1=1 \\implies x_1=1$. $i_1=(0+(1+1)/2)=1$.\n$x_1=1, d_2=1 \\implies x_2=2$. $i_2=(1+(1+1)/2)=2$.\nTowers must be at $1$ and $2$. This is a valid configuration. Probability $(1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\nMy $a_2=1$ is correct.\n\nFor $n=3$, compositions $(3)$, $(1,1,1)$.\nFor (3): $d_1=3$. $x_0=0, d_1=3 \\implies x_1=3$. $i_1=(0+(3+1)/2)=2$. Tower at $2$.\nFor (1,1,1): $d_1=1, d_2=1, d_3=1$.\n$x_0=0, d_1=1 \\implies x_1=1$. $i_1=1$.\n$x_1=1, d_2=1 \\implies x_2=2$. $i_2=2$.\n$x_2=2, d_3=1 \\implies x_3=3$. $i_3=3$.\nTowers at $1,2,3$.\nThese are two distinct sets of towers.\nSo for $n=3$, there are 2 valid configurations. Probability is $2 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$.\nMy $a_3=2$ is correct.\n\nFor $n=5$, compositions are:\n(5) -> tower at $(0+(5+1)/2)=3$. $T=\\{3\\}$.\n(1,1,1,1,1) -> towers at $1,2,3,4,5$. $T=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$.\n(1,1,3) -> $x_0=0, d_1=1 \\implies x_1=1, i_1=1$. $x_1=1, d_2=1 \\implies x_2=2, i_2=2$. $x_2=2, d_3=3 \\implies x_3=5, i_3=(2+(3+1)/2)=4$. $T=\\{1,2,4\\}$.\n(1,3,1) -> $x_0=0, d_1=1 \\implies x_1=1, i_1=1$. $x_1=1, d_2=3 \\implies x_2=4, i_2=(1+(3+1)/2)=3$. $x_2=4, d_3=1 \\implies x_3=5, i_3=(4+(1+1)/2)=5$. $T=\\{1,3,5\\}$.\n(3,1,1) -> $x_0=0, d_1=3 \\implies x_1=3, i_1=2$. $x_1=3, d_2=1 \\implies x_2=4, i_2=(3+(1+1)/2)=4$. $x_2=4, d_3=1 \\implies x_3=5, i_3=(4+(1+1)/2)=5$. $T=\\{2,4,5\\}$. (This is the example from the problem!)\nThere are 5 such compositions.\nSo for $n=5$, $a_5=5$. Probability is $5 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5/32$.\nMy $a_5=4$ was wrong. It should be $a_5 = a_4+a_2+a_0 = 3+1+1=5$.\n\nThe recurrence for $a_n$ is:\n$a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-3} + \\dots + a_{n-m}$ where $m$ is the largest odd number $\\le n$.\n$a_0=1$.\n$a_1=a_0=1$.\n$a_2=a_1=1$.\n$a_3=a_2+a_0=1+1=2$.\n$a_4=a_3+a_1=2+1=3$.\n$a_5=a_4+a_2+a_0=3+1+1=5$.\n$a_6=a_5+a_3+a_1=5+2+1=8$.\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence $F_{n+1}$ shifted.\n$a_n = F_{n+1}$ for $n \\ge 0$, if we define $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, \\dots$.\nSo for $n=0, a_0=F_1=1$.\nFor $n=1, a_1=F_2=1$.\nFor $n=2, a_2=F_3=2$. Wait, $a_2=1$ from my derivation.\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence $F_{n}$ where $F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, F_7=13, \\dots$.\n$a_n = F_{n+1}$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n$a_1 = F_2 = 1$.\n$a_2 = F_3 = 2$.\n$a_3 = F_4 = 3$.\n$a_4 = F_5 = 5$.\n$a_5 = F_6 = 8$.\n\nLet's check $a_2$. Compositions of 2 into odd parts: (1,1). Only one. So $a_2=1$.\nLet's check $a_4$. Compositions of 4 into odd parts: (1,1,1,1), (1,3), (3,1). Three compositions. So $a_4=3$.\nIt seems $a_n$ is $F_n$ for $n \\ge 1$ using $F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$ if $n$ is odd, and $F_{n+1}$ if $n$ is even? No.\n\nLet's use the definition $a_n = \\sum_{j \\text{ odd}, j \\ge 1} a_{n-j}$ with $a_0=1$.\n$a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-3} + a_{n-5} + \\dots$\n$a_{n-1} = a_{n-2} + a_{n-4} + a_{n-6} + \\dots$\nSubtracting the second from the first gives $a_n - a_{n-1} = a_{n-1} + (a_{n-3}-a_{n-2}) + (a_{n-5}-a_{n-4}) + \\dots$.\nThis is not $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$.\n\nLet $f(n)$ be the number of compositions of $n$ into odd parts.\n$f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-3) + f(n-5) + \\dots + f(1 \\text{ or } 0)$.\n$f(n-2) = f(n-3) + f(n-5) + \\dots$.\nSo $f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)$. This is the Fibonacci recurrence.\nBase cases:\n$f(0)=1$ (empty composition).\n$f(1)=1$ (composition (1)).\n$f(2)=f(1)+f(0)=1+1=2$. (Compositions (1,1), (2) -- but 2 is not odd!)\nThis is the standard Fibonacci sequence $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, F_3=3, F_4=5, \\dots$ starting with $F_0=1, F_1=1$.\nLet's use $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, \\dots$.\nThen $f(n) = F_{n+1}$.\n$f(0)=F_1=1$.\n$f(1)=F_2=1$.\n$f(2)=F_3=2$.\n$f(3)=F_4=3$.\n$f(4)=F_5=5$.\n$f(5)=F_6=8$.\n\nThe example outputs are:\n$n=2 \\implies 1/4$. $f(2)=2$. Probability $2 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 2/4 = 1/2$. This does not match.\n$n=3 \\implies 1/4$. $f(3)=3$. Probability $3 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 3/8$. This does not match.\n$n=5 \\implies 5/32$. $f(5)=8$. Probability $8 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 8/32 = 1/4$. This does not match.\n\nThe problem statement's example $n=2$:\n\"with probability $1/4$, the towers are built in both towns $1$ and $2$, so we can set their signal powers to $1$.\"\nThis corresponds to composition $(1,1)$. $i_1=1, i_2=2$.\n$p_1=1-0=1$. $p_2=2-1=1$. $1 \\le p_j \\le \\min(j, n-j+1)$.\n$p_1=1 \\le \\min(1, 2-1+1=2)$. OK.\n$p_2=1 \\le \\min(2, 2-2+1=1)$. OK.\nThis is one valid configuration. The probability for this is $(1/2)^2=1/4$.\nMy $f(2)=2$ means there's another one.\nWhat is the other composition for $n=2$? The $f(2)=2$ implies compositions of 2 into odd parts are (1,1) and something else. There is no other composition of 2 into odd parts.\nThe number of compositions of $n$ into odd parts is $F_{n/2}$ if $n$ is even, and $F_{(n+1)/2}$ if $n$ is odd, using $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nNo, this is for partitions, not compositions.\n\nThe number of compositions of $n$ into odd parts is $F_n$ (where $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, F_3=3, F_4=5, \\dots$).\n$n=1$: (1). $f(1)=1$.\n$n=2$: (1,1). $f(2)=1$.\n$n=3$: (1,1,1), (3). $f(3)=2$.\n$n=4$: (1,1,1,1), (1,3), (3,1). $f(4)=3$.\n$n=5$: (1,1,1,1,1), (1,1,3), (1,3,1), (3,1,1), (5). $f(5)=5$.\nThis sequence $1,1,2,3,5$ is $F_{n+1}$ starting from $n=1$ if $F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nSo $f(n) = F_{n+1}$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n$f(1)=F_2=1$.\n$f(2)=F_3=2$. This is the issue. $f(2)$ should be 1.\n\nThe correct sequence for $f(n)$ (number of compositions of $n$ into odd parts) is $F_n$ where $F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\n$f(1)=1$.\n$f(2)=1$.\n$f(3)=2$.\n$f(4)=3$.\n$f(5)=5$.\nThis is $F_n$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nLet's check this with the examples:\n$n=2$: $f(2)=1$. Prob $1 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 1/4$. Matches example!\n$n=3$: $f(3)=2$. Prob $2 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$. Matches example!\n$n=5$: $f(5)=5$. Prob $5 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5/32$. Matches example!\n\nSo the probability is $F_n \\cdot (1/2)^n \\pmod{998244353}$.\nWe need to calculate $F_n$.\nThe Fibonacci sequence: $F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, \\dots$.\nFor $n=1$, $F_1=1$. Prob $1 \\cdot (1/2)^1 = 1/2$.\nFor $n=2$, $F_2=1$. Prob $1 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\nFor $n=3$, $F_3=2$. Prob $2 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$.\nFor $n=4$, $F_4=3$. Prob $3 \\cdot (1/2)^4 = 3/16$.\nFor $n=5$, $F_5=5$. Prob $5 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5/32$.\n\nThis is the solution.\nWe need to compute $F_n \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$n$ can be up to $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nWe can compute $F_n$ using matrix exponentiation in $O(\\log n)$ time.\nThe matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\begin{pmatrix} F_{k+1} \\\\ F_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^k \\begin{pmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nUsing $F_0=0, F_1=1$:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} F_{k+1} \\\\ F_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^k \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSo $F_n$ is the $(1,0)$ element of $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{n-1}$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nLet $M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Then $M^{n-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} F_n & F_{n-1} \\\\ F_{n-1} & F_{n-2} \\end{pmatrix}$ for $n \\ge 2$.\nSo we need $F_n$.\nWe also need $(1/2)^n \\pmod{998244353}$. This is $2^{-n} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$2^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$ is $499122177$.\nWe can compute $2^{-n} = (2^{-1})^n \\pmod{998244353}$ using modular exponentiation in $O(\\log n)$ time.\n\nModular inverse for $2$: $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$998244353$ is a prime number.\n$2^{-1} = (998244353+1)/2 = 499122177$.\n\nLet's implement matrix exponentiation.\nMOD = 998244353.\n\nMatrix multiplication function:\n`multiply(A, B)` returns `C` where $C_{ij} = \\sum_k A_{ik} B_{kj}$.\nFor $2 \\times 2$ matrices:\n$A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$, $B = \\begin{pmatrix} e & f \\\\ g & h \\end{pmatrix}$\n$C = \\begin{pmatrix} ae+bg & af+bh \\\\ ce+dg & cf+dh \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nMatrix power function:\n`matrix_power(A, p)` returns $A^p$.\nIf $p=0$, return identity matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nIf $p=1$, return $A$.\nIf $p$ is even, $A^p = (A^{p/2})^2$.\nIf $p$ is odd, $A^p = A \\cdot A^{p-1}$.\n\nBase case $n=1$: $F_1=1$. $(1/2)^1 = 1/2$. Result $1/2 \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$499122177$.\nMatrix exponentiation for $F_1$: $M^{1-1} = M^0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The $(0,0)$ element is $1$.\nSo $F_n$ is $(M^{n-1})_{0,0}$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nFinal check for $n=1$:\n$F_1=1$. Probability is $1 \\cdot (1/2)^1 = 1/2$.\nExample input $N=1$ is not given, but it should be $1/2$.\nIf $n=1$, town $1$ can have a tower. $p_1=1$.\n$1 \\le p_1 \\le \\min(1, 1-1+1=1)$. So $p_1=1$.\nThis is a valid configuration. So $F_1=1$.\n\nThe logic seems solid.\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef matrix_mult(A, B):\n    C = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            for k in range(2):\n                C[i][j] = (C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j]) % MOD\n    return C\n\ndef matrix_pow(A, p):\n    res = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] # Identity matrix\n    A_copy = A\n    while p > 0:\n        if p % 2 == 1:\n            res = matrix_mult(res, A_copy)\n        A_copy = matrix_mult(A_copy, A_copy)\n        p //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # F_n is the (0,0) element of M^(n-1) where M = [[1,1],[1,0]]\n    # (F_n, F_{n-1}) = M^(n-1) * (F_1, F_0)\n    # F_1 = 1, F_0 = 0\n    # M^(n-1) = [[F_n, F_{n-1}], [F_{n-1}, F_{n-2}]] for n >= 2\n    # So F_n is actually M^(n-1)[0][0]\n    \n    T = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]\n    T_n_minus_1 = matrix_pow(T, n - 1)\n    return T_n_minus_1[0][0]\n\ndef power(base, exp):\n    res = 1\n    base %= MOD\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * base) % MOD\n        base = (base * base) % MOD\n        exp //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef mod_inverse(n):\n    return power(n, MOD - 2)\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    if n == 0: # Though problem says 1 <= n <= 2e5, handle for completeness.\n        print(1) # Empty set of towns, 0 and 1 not covered, 1..0 covered by 0 towers.\n        return\n\n    # Calculate F_n (using F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, ...)\n    Fn = fibonacci(n)\n\n    # Calculate (1/2)^n mod MOD\n    inv_2 = mod_inverse(2)\n    inv_2_pow_n = power(inv_2, n)\n\n    # Result is F_n * (1/2)^n mod MOD\n    ans = (Fn * inv_2_pow_n) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\n# Call the solve function\nsolve()\n\n```",
