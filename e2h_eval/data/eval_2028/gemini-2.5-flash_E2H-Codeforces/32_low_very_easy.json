Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Array Stabilization Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Array Stabilization\" problem.  The goal is pretty clear: I have an array, and I need to remove one element to minimize the \"instability,\" which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the remaining array.  Given the input constraints, it seems like a fairly straightforward problem.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. The input is an array `a` with `n` integers. The instability is the range between the largest and smallest elements. The task is to remove *exactly* one element and find the minimal achievable instability among the resulting `n-1` element arrays.\n\nI've got the constraints memorized, too:  `2 <= n <= 10^5` and `1 <= a_i <= 10^5`. I'm starting to visualize a Python script.\n\nLet me break down the logic further, using the examples. If I remove the minimum, the new minimum becomes the next smallest. If I remove the maximum, the new maximum becomes the next largest. Now, the key insight is that removing something other than the minimum or maximum is *never* optimal. If I remove an element that is not the smallest or the largest, then the new minimum will remain the smallest, and the new maximum will still be the largest. This will result in an instability that is at least as large as the original, meaning removing the smallest or largest elements is always the best strategy.\n\nIn other words, the optimal solution is obtained by removing either the smallest element or the largest element. I have to find the minimum instability between removing the smallest and removing the largest element in the original array.\n",
