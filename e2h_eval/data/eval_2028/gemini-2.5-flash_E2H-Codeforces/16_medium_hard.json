Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Solution Synthesis: Crazy Town Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We need to find the minimum steps from a home to a university in this Crazy Town scenario, which is essentially about counting line crossings. The core insight is that each \"step\" is crossing a line.  The problem gives us the home (x1, y1), university (x2, y2), and equations for 'n' infinite lines (ax + by + c = 0).  The trick is realizing that if two points are in *different* blocks, they are separated by a line; if in the *same* block, they are not.\n\nThe key is this function: f(x, y, a, b, c) = a*x + b*y + c.  If we evaluate this for our home and university for a particular line, and the results have *opposite* signs (val1 * val2 < 0), it means the points are on different sides of that line, so we need to step. If the signs are the same, they're in the same block relative to that line; no step is needed.  The code simply iterates through each line, calculates this product, and increments the step counter if it's negative.\n\nThe constraints are manageable; integer overflow isn't a concern, and the n <= 300 means an O(n) solution is perfectly fine. The approach directly addresses the problem's geometric nature and is easy to code. The code efficiently reads the inputs, performs the simple calculations, and prints the result - the number of lines that 'separate' the home and the university. No tricky edge cases really exist, due to the problem definition itself. Essentially the algorithm is: Read the input, for each line count the separation, print the sum of separations.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of steps to travel from a starting block (containing your home) to a target block (containing the university). A step involves moving from one block to an adjacent block, which means crossing a common border of non-zero length. Each such move corresponds to crossing exactly one road (line).\n\nThe key insight is that two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are in the same \"block\" with respect respect to a single line `ax + by + c = 0` if they lie on the same side of that line. Conversely, they are on opposite sides if the line separates them.\n\nA line `ax + by + c = 0` divides the plane into two half-planes:\n1. `ax + by + c > 0`\n2. `ax + by + c < 0`\n\nFor any given point `(x, y)`, the sign of `ax + by + c` determines which side of the line it lies on. Since neither the home nor the university is located on any road, `ax + by + c` will never be zero for these points.\n\nLet `f(x, y, a, b, c) = a*x + b*y + c`.\n- If `f(x1, y1, a, b, c)` and `f(x2, y2, a, b, c)` have the same sign, then both points are on the same side of the line. This means this particular road does not separate the home and the university.\n- If `f(x1, y1, a, b, c)` and `f(x2, y2, a, b, c)` have opposite signs, then the points are on opposite sides of the line. This means this road separates the block containing the home from the block containing the university.\n\nTo move from a block on one side of a line to a block on the other side of that line, you *must* cross that line. Each such crossing counts as one step. Therefore, the minimum number of steps required to get from the home block to the university block is simply the total count of roads that separate the home and university points.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Read the coordinates of the home `(x1, y1)`.\n2. Read the coordinates of the university `(x2, y2)`.\n3. Read the number of roads `n`.\n4. Initialize a counter `steps = 0`.\n5. For each of the `n` roads:\n   a. Read the coefficients `a, b, c` for the line equation `ax + by + c = 0`.\n   b. Calculate `val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c`.\n   c. Calculate `val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c`.\n   d. If `val1` and `val2` have opposite signs (which can be checked by `val1 * val2 < 0`), increment `steps`.\n6. Print the final value of `steps`.\n\nThe maximum possible value for `a*x + b*y + c` is roughly `10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6` which is around `2 * 10^12`. Python's integers handle arbitrary precision, so overflow is not an issue. The product `val1 * val2` can be up to `(2 * 10^12)^2 = 4 * 10^24`, which is also handled by Python's integers. The number of roads `n` is small (up to 300), making this `O(N)` approach very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read coordinates of home (x1, y1)\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read coordinates of university (x2, y2)\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read the number of roads (lines)\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Initialize the counter for the minimum number of steps.\n    # Each step corresponds to crossing a road that separates the home and university.\n    steps = 0\n\n    # Iterate through each of the n roads\n    for _ in range(n):\n        # Read the coefficients (a, b, c) for the current line equation: ax + by + c = 0\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n        # Evaluate the expression ax + by + c for the home coordinates (x1, y1).\n        # The sign of this value determines which side of the line the home is on.\n        # It's guaranteed that the home is not on any road, so val1 will never be 0.\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n        # Evaluate the expression ax + by + c for the university coordinates (x2, y2).\n        # The sign of this value determines which side of the line the university is on.\n        # It's guaranteed that the university is not on any road, so val2 will never be 0.\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        # If val1 and val2 have opposite signs, it means the home and university\n        # are on opposite sides of the current line.\n        # This line effectively separates the block containing the home from the block\n        # containing the university.
