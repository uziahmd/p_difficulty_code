He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my plan to tackle the \"Prefixes and Suffixes\" problem.**  First, I need to really understand the problem. I'm given an integer `n` that's the length of a hidden string `s`, and a list of `2n-2` strings. These strings are all the *improper* prefixes and suffixes of `s`. Crucially, I don't know which is which!  The goal is to determine, for each of the given strings, whether it's a prefix or a suffix of `s`.\n\nI immediately see that for each length `k` (from `1` to `n-1`), there are exactly two strings in the input. One is a prefix, the other a suffix. The longest two strings, of length `n-1`, are the key. They nearly reveal the original string `s`.\n\nI need to output a string of \"P\"s and \"S\"s, indicating if each input string is a prefix (\"P\") or a suffix (\"S\"). The output must be consistent with *at least one* possible string `s`. If multiple solutions exist, any valid solution is okay.\n\nMy key insight: the two strings of length `n-1` are *critical*.  I can construct candidate strings for `s` using these. If `L1` and `L2` are these length `n-1` strings, I can try two cases:  either `L1` is a prefix and `L2` is a suffix, or vice versa. I'll need to check if `L1[1:] == L2[:-1]` for the first case, and `L2[1:] == L1[:-1]` for the second.\n\n**Here's my detailed strategy.**\n\n1.  **Input Reading**: I'll read `n` and store all the `2n-2` input strings. I must keep track of the *original* index of each string because I'll need to output the \"P\" and \"S\" based on this order. I can use a list of tuples `(string, original_index)` or a list of strings and refer to the original list. Grouping strings by their length will also be helpful, maybe a dictionary `dict_by_length`.\n\n2.  **Longest Strings**: I'll find the two strings of length `n-1`, and store them as `L1` and `L2`, along with their original indices.\n\n3.  **Candidate String Generation and Verification**: This is the core. I'll create a *function* `check_candidate` to do the heavy lifting. I'll pass a candidate string `s` to this function, along with a list or a map to track the input strings' original indices.\n    *   **Inside `check_candidate`:** This function will initialize an array to hold the \"P\"s and \"S\"s. Then, it will iterate through each length `k` from `1` to `n-1`. For each `k`:\n        *   Calculate the expected prefix and suffix of length `k` from the candidate string.\n        *   Locate the two input strings of length `k`. One *must* be the prefix, the other the suffix.\n        *   If the correct strings are not found, or there's an inconsistency, I'll return `None` (or an empty string, an exception - depends how the code is structured).\n\n    *   **Main Logic:**\n        *   **Attempt 1:** I'll assume `L1` is the prefix and `L2` is the suffix. Check the consistency condition `L1[1:] == L2[:-1]`. If it holds, I can build a candidate string `s` as `L1 + L2[-1]`.  Then I'll call `check_candidate` with this `s`. If `check_candidate` returns a valid \"P\"/'S' string, I'm done!\n        *   **Attempt 2:** If Attempt 1 fails (or if I just want to be thorough - it *is* guaranteed there's *some* answer!), I'll assume `L2` is the prefix and `L1` is the suffix. I check `L2[1:] == L1[:-1]`. If true, I create `s` as `L2 + L1[-1]`.  Call `check_candidate` with this. This *should* work if the problem has a valid solution.\n\n4.  If I reach the end without finding a valid `s`, something has gone wrong in the logic somewhere, or the constraints of the problem are violated. That shouldn't happen, according to the problem statement.\n\nI'll need to refine",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine, for each of `2n-2` given strings, whether it is an improper prefix ('P') or an improper suffix ('S') of a hidden string `s` of length `n`. We are guaranteed that there are exactly two strings of each length `k` (from `1` to `n-1`), and that these strings are indeed the prefix and suffix of some existing string `s`.\n\n**Key Idea:**\n\nThe most crucial insight comes from the two strings of length `n-1`. Let these be `L1` and `L2`.\nThese two strings *must* correspond to `s[0:n-1]` (the prefix of length `n-1`) and `s[1:n]` (the suffix of length `n-1`).\n\nThere are two possible assignments for `L1` and `L2`:\n\n1.  `L1` is `s[0:n-1]` and `L2` is `s[1:n]`.\n2.  `L2` is `s[0:n-1]` and `L1` is `s[1:n]`.\n\nFor a given assignment to be valid, the two parts must be consistent.\nIf `L1 = s[0:n-1]` and `L2 = s[1:n]`:\n*   The string `s` can be reconstructed as `L1 + L2[-1]` (append the last character of `L2` to `L1`).\n*   Alternatively, `s` can be reconstructed as `L2[0] + L1` (prepend the first character of `L2` to `L1`).\n*   For these two constructions to yield the same `s`, it must be that `L1[1:] == L2[:-1]`. This is because `L1[1:]` is `s[1:n-1]` and `L2[:-1]` is also `s[1:n-1]`.\n*   If this condition holds, we have a candidate string `s_candidate = L1 + L2[-1]`.\n\nOur strategy will be:\n\n1.  **Identify `L1` and `L2`**: Read all `2n-2` input strings. Store them, keeping track of their original indices. Group them by length. Find the two strings of length `n-1`. Let them be `str_n_minus_1_a` and `str_n_minus_1_b`, along with their original input indices `idx_a` and `idx_b`.\n\n2.  **Test Candidate `s`:**\n    *   **Attempt 1:** Assume `str_n_minus_1_a` is `s[0:n-1]` (prefix) and `str_n_minus_1_b` is `s[1:n]` (suffix).\n        *   Check if `str_n_minus_1_a[1:] == str_n_minus_1_b[:-1]`.\n        *   If consistent, form `s_candidate1 = str_n_minus_1_a + str_n_minus_1_b[-1]`.\n        *   Now, verify if `s_candidate1` is consistent with *all* other `2n-4` input strings.\n            *   For each length `k` from `1` to `n-1` (excluding `n-1` itself, which is already assigned):\n                *   Calculate `expected_prefix = s_candidate1[0:k]`.\n                *   Calculate `expected_suffix = s_candidate1[n-k:n]`.\n                *   Find the two input strings of length `k`. One must match `expected_prefix` and the other `expected_suffix`.\n                *   Crucially, we need to handle duplicate string values (e.g., if `s=\"aaa\"`, both `s[0:1]` and `s[2:3]` are \"a\"). We must assign 'P' to one occurrence of \"a\" and 'S' to the other.\n                *   If all checks pass, we have found a valid assignment. Construct the 'P'/'S' output string and print it.\n    *   **Attempt 2:** If Attempt 1 fails (or yields an invalid `s_candidate`), assume `str_n_minus_1_b` is `s[0:n-1]` (prefix) and `str_n_minus_1_a` is `s[1:n]` (suffix).\n        *   Repeat the consistency check and verification process as in Attempt 1.\n        *   The problem guarantees that at least one valid `s` exists, so one of these attempts will succeed.\n\n**Detailed Implementation Notes:**\n\n*   To manage duplicate strings and their original indices, we can use a dictionary `string_to_original_indices = {string_value: [list_of_original_indices]}`. When assigning 'P' or 'S' to an input string, remove its original index from this list to ensure each input string is used exactly once.\n*   The `verify_and_assign` helper function takes a `candidate_s` and the indices of the `n-1` length strings that are assumed to be prefix/suffix. It then tries to assign 'P'/'S' to all other strings. If it finds any inconsistency (e.g., an expected prefix/suffix doesn't match any available input string of that length), it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the final 'P'/'S' string.\n*   For `k=1` to `n-2`:\n    *   If `expected_prefix == expected_suffix`: We need two distinct occurrences of this string value from the input. We assign 'P' to one and 'S' to the other.\n    *   If `expected_prefix != expected_suffix`: We need one occurrence of `expected_prefix` and one of `expected_suffix`. We assign 'P' to the former and 'S' to the latter.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`n=3`, input: `a, aa, aa, a`):**\n\n1.  `n=3`. Input strings: `['a', 'aa', 'aa', 'a']`.\n    `all_input_strings_ordered = ['a', 'aa', 'aa', 'a']`.\n    `string_to_original_indices = {'a': [0, 3], 'aa': [1, 2]}`.\n2.
