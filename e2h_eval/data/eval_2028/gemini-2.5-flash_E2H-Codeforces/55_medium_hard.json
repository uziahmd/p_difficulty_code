Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's my thought process:**\n\nI need to find the lexicographically smallest string after applying certain swaps. I realize '0's and '1's can freely swap, as can '1's and '2's. However, '0's and '2's have a fixed relative order; they can't cross. This is the crucial insight. A '1' can effectively move past any character.\n\nI reason that if a '0' is initially before a '2', it must stay before that '2' in the final string, and vice-versa. This defines a fixed 'backbone' of '0's and '2's. All '1's are completely mobile and I should consolidate them. To minimize lexicographically, I want '0's, then '1's, then '2's. The problem comes down to sorting the '1's.\n\nI conclude that I need to count '0's, '1's, and '2's. All the '1's can be grouped together. '0's before the first '2' can go to the start. The rest ('0's and '2's after the first '2') should be in their original relative positions. The '1's then go between the '0's and the '2's/remaining '0's. Thus, the solution is the number of '0's before the first '2', then the grouped '1's, then the rest. This logic seems correct and optimal.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by repeatedly swapping adjacent '0's and '1's, or adjacent '1's and '2's. Swapping '0's and '2's directly is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed operations:\n1.  **'0' and '1' swaps**: \"01\" $\\leftrightarrow$ \"10\". This means '0's and '1's can freely change their relative order. A '0' can move past a '1' and vice-versa.\n2.  **'1' and '2' swaps**: \"12\" $\\leftrightarrow$ \"21\". This means '1's and '2's can freely change their relative order. A '1' can move past a '2' and vice-versa.\n\nWhat about '0's and '2's?\nThere is no direct swap between '0' and '2'. Can they swap indirectly?\nConsider the sequence \"012\".\n-   If we swap '0' and '1': \"102\". The '0' is still before the '2'.\n-   If we swap '1' and '2': \"021\". The '0' is still before the '2'.\nIt appears that a '0' cannot move past a '2', and a '2' cannot move past a '0'. This is the crucial invariant: **the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed.** If a '0' appears before a '2' in the original string, it must appear before that same '2' in any reachable string. Similarly, if a '0' appears after a '2', it remains after it.\n\nThis invariant has significant implications:\n*   All '1's are completely mobile. A '1' can move past any '0' (01 $\\leftrightarrow$ 10) and any '2' (12 $\\leftrightarrow$ 21). This means all '1's can be grouped together into a contiguous block, and this block can be placed anywhere in the string without affecting the relative order of '0's and '2's.\n*   The '0's and '2's form a \"backbone\" whose relative order cannot change.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place '0's as far left as possible, then '1's, then '2's.\n\nGiven the invariant, we can devise the following strategy:\n1.  **Identify \"free\" '0's**: Any '0' that appears in the original string *before* the first '2' encountered is \"free\". It is not blocked by any '2' to its left. Since it can move past any '1's, these '0's can be moved to the very beginning of the final string.\n2.  **Identify \"trapped\" '0's and '2's**: Any '0' that appears *after* the first '2' in the original string is \"trapped\". It cannot move past that '2'. All '2's, by definition, are part of this fixed \"backbone\" and cannot move to the left of any '0' that was originally to their left. These characters (trapped '0's and all '2's) must maintain their original relative order among themselves.\n3.  **Place all '1's**: Since '1's are completely mobile, to achieve the lexicographically smallest string, they should be placed after all the \"free\" '0's and before all the \"trapped\" '0's and '2's.\n\nThis leads to the structure of the minimum string:\n`(all '0's that appear before the first '2' in the original string) + (all '1's from the original string) + (all '2's and '0's that appear after the first '2' in the original string, in their original relative order)`\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Initialize an empty list `prefix_zeros_chars` to store '0's that can move to the front.\n2.  Initialize `num_ones = 0` to count all '1's.\n3.  Initialize an empty list `suffix_chars` to store '2's and '0's that are \"trapped\" or come after the first '2'.\n4.  Initialize a boolean flag `found_two = False`. This flag will be set to `True` once the first '2' is encountered.\n5.  Iterate through the input string `s` character by character:\n    *   If the character `char` is '0':\n        *   If `found_two` is `False`, append '0' to `prefix_zeros_chars`.\n        *   If `found_two` is `True`, append '0' to `suffix_chars`.\n    *   If `char` is '1':\n        *   Increment `num_ones`.\n    *   If `char` is '2':\n        *   Set `found_two = True`.\n        *   Append '2' to `suffix_chars`.\n6.  Construct the final string by concatenating:\n    `\"\".join(prefix_zeros_chars)` + `('1' * num_ones)` + `\"\".join(suffix_chars)`.\n\n**Example: `s = \"100210\"`**\n\n1.  `prefix_zeros_chars = []`, `num_ones = 0`, `suffix_chars = []`, `found_two = False`.\n2.  Iterate:\n    *   `char = '1'`: `num_ones = 1`.\n    *   `char = '0'`: `found_two` is `False`. `prefix_zeros_chars = ['0']`.\n    *   `char = '0'`: `found_two` is `False`. `prefix_zeros_chars = ['0', '0']`.\n    *   `char = '2'`: `found_two = True`. `suffix_chars = ['2']`.\n    *   `char = '1'`: `num_ones = 2`.\n    *   `char = '0'`: `found_two` is `True`. `suffix_chars = ['2', '0']`.\n3.  Result: `\"\".join(['0', '0'])` + `('1' * 2)` + `\"\".join(['2', '0'])`\n    `\"00\"` + `\"11\"` + `\"20\"` = `\"001120\"`.\n\nThis matches the example output.
