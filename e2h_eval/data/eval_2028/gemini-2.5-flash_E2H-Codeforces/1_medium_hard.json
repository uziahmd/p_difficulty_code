    "thought": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of this coding challenge.**\n\nMy goal is to create a Python script to calculate the number of \"gilded\" cells on a rectangular plate. The dimensions of the plate are `w` (width) and `h` (height). There are `k` gilded rings. Each ring borders an inner rectangle, shrinking with each ring by 4 cells (2 from each side). The `i`-th ring's inner rectangle size is `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`.  Crucially, I need to compute the total count of border cells across all the rings, and I know that the number of border cells for a rectangle is `2W + 2H - 4` (except when the W or H is less than two).\n\nFirst, I define the width and height of the `i`-th inner rectangle as `W_i` and `H_i`. This makes the calculation generalizable. The number of cells in ring `i` is then simply `2W_i + 2H_i - 4`. My main task is to sum the number of border cells for each of the `k` rings.\n\nSo, I need the formula for the sum: `sum_{i=1 to k} (2W_i + 2H_i - 4)`. I then expand this to `sum_{i=1 to k} (2(w - 4(i - 1)) + 2(h - 4(i - 1)) - 4)`. This then simplifies to the arithmetic progression, `k * (2w + 2h - 4) - 8 * k * (k - 1)`.\n\nTo ensure correctness and avoid edge-case errors, I carefully check the constraints given in the problem. The formula works as long as the dimensions of the inner rectangles don't become less than two, which would invalidate the `2W+2H-4` formula. The constraint is that `k` is less or equal to `floor((min(w,h)+1)/4)`. By carefully checking the relationship between `k` and the size of the inner rectangles, I make sure the dimension are always good enough for my formula.\nI'll create the Python script, making sure to read in the inputs (w, h, k), calculate the sum using the formula, and output the total number of cells.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate has dimensions `w` (width) and `h` (height). There are `k` gilded rings.\n\nLet's break down the structure of the `i`-th ring:\nThe problem states that the `i`-th ring consists of all bordering cells on an inner rectangle of size `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`.\nLet `W_i = w - 4(i - 1)` and `H_i = h - 4(i - 1)` be the width and height of this inner rectangle for the `i`-th ring.\n\nThe number of cells forming the border of a rectangle with dimensions `W_i` by `H_i` is given by the formula `2 * W_i + 2 * H_i - 4`. This formula is valid when both `W_i` and `H_i` are at least 2.\n\nLet's check if this condition (`W_i >= 2` and `H_i >= 2`) holds for all `i` from 1 to `k`.\nThe problem constraints are `3 <= w, h <= 100` and `1 <= k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)`.\nLet `m = min(w, h)`. The constraint on `k` implies `k <= (m + 1) / 4`, which means `4k <= m + 1`.\nFor the `k`-th ring, the dimensions are `W_k = w - 4(k - 1)` and `H_k = h - 4(k - 1)`.\nThe smallest of these dimensions will be `m - 4(k - 1)`.\nWe need to show `m - 4(k - 1) >= 2`.\n`m - 4k + 4 >= 2`\n`m + 2 >= 4k`\nSince we know `m + 1 >= 4k`, and `m + 2` is strictly greater than `m + 1`, it follows that `m + 2 >= 4k` is always true.\nTherefore, `W_i` and `H_i` will always be at least 2 for any `i` from 1 to `k`, and the formula `2 * W_i + 2 * H_i - 4` is always applicable.\n\nNow, let's express the number of cells for the `i`-th ring, `C_i`:\n`C_i = 2 * W_i + 2 * H_i - 4`\n`C_i = 2 * (w - 4(i - 1)) + 2 * (h - 4(i - 1)) - 4`\n`C_i = 2w - 8(i - 1) + 2h - 8(i - 1) - 4`\n`C_i = (2w + 2h - 4) - 16(i - 1)`\n\nWe need to find the total number of gilded cells, which is the sum of `C_i` for `i` from 1 to `k`:\n`Total_cells = sum_{i=1 to k} C_i`\n`Total_cells = sum_{i=1 to k} [(2w + 2h - 4) - 16(i - 1)]`\n\nThis is a sum of an arithmetic progression. We can split the sum:\n`Total_cells = sum_{i=1 to k} (2w + 2h - 4) - sum_{i=1 to k} 16(i - 1)`\nThe first part is `k` times `(2w + 2h - 4)`:\n`k * (2w + 2h - 4)`\nThe second part involves the sum `sum_{i=1 to k} (i - 1)`, which is `0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (k - 1)`.\nThis is the sum of the first `k - 1` non-negative integers, which has a well-known formula: `(k - 1) * k / 2`.\nSo, the second part is `16 * ((k - 1) * k / 2) = 8 * k * (k - 1)`.\n\nCombining these, the total number of gilded cells is:\n`Total_cells = k * (2w + 2h - 4) - 8 * k * (k - 1)`\n\nThis formula can be directly used to compute the result.\n\nExample 1: `w=3, h=3, k=1`\n`Total_cells = 1 * (2*3 + 2*3 - 4) - 8 * 1 * (1 - 1)`\n`Total_cells = 1 * (6 + 6 - 4) - 0`\n`Total_cells = 1 * 8 = 8`\n\nExample 2: `w=7, h=9, k=1`\n`Total_cells = 1 * (2*7 + 2*9 - 4) - 8 * 1 * (1 - 1)`\n`Total_cells = 1 * (14 + 18 - 4) - 0`\n`Total_cells = 1 * (32 - 4) = 28`\n\nExample 3: `w=7, h=9, k=2`\n`Total_cells = 2 * (2*7 + 2*9 - 4) - 8 * 2 * (2 - 1)`\n`Total_cells = 2 * (14 + 18 - 4) - 16 * 1`\n`Total_cells = 2 * (28) - 16`\n`Total_cells = 56 - 16 = 40`\n\nAll examples match the derived formula.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the three integers w, h, and k from a single line of standard input.\n    # sys.stdin.readline() reads a line including the newline character.\n    # .split() splits the string by whitespace and returns a list of strings.\n    # map(int, ...) converts each string in the list to an integer.\n    w, h, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # The number of cells for the i-th ring (1-indexed) is given by:\n    # C_i = (2w + 2h - 4) - 16(i - 1)\n    # The total number of gilded cells is the sum of C_i for i from 1 to k.\n    # Total_cells = sum_{i=1 to k} [(2w + 2h - 4) - 16(i - 1)]\n    # This sum simplifies to:\n    # Total_cells = k * (2w + 2h - 4) - 8 * k * (k - 1)\n\n    total_gilded_cells = k * (2 * w + 2 * h - 4) - 8 * k * (k - 1)\n\n    # Print the result to standard output, followed by a newline.\n    sys.stdout.write(str(total_gilded_cells) + '\\n')\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the program.\nsolve()\n\n```",
