You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing a Number Through Strategic Digit Replacement**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The problem is about taking a number `a` and, using digits from another set `s`, making `a` as large as possible.  The core idea is to think greedily: bigger digits on the left (most significant) positions lead to a bigger number.\n\nFirst, I need to get organized. Reading `a` and `s` as strings is fine, but I'll convert them to lists of characters for easy modification. To make selecting the largest available digit simple, sorting `s` in descending order is crucial. This lets me just take the first digit and move on.\n\nNow, I iterate through the digits of `a` from left to right. For each digit in `a`, I compare it to the largest remaining digit in the sorted `s`. If the digit from `s` is greater, *boom!* Replace it. This guarantees I'm maximizing that specific position. The trick is, if the `s` digit isn't greater than the current `a` digit, I *don't* replace.  Since `s` is sorted, any remaining `s` digits won't do any better, and it's better to keep `a`'s digit as it is, possibly even stopping further comparisons, if appropriate.  I'm basically trying to replace each digit of `a` with a larger digit from `s`, if I can.  This prevents us from making a smaller number.\n\nThe code reflects this: I iterate through `a`, check if there's a digit left in `s`, compare, and replace if necessary.  If I run out of digits in `s`, or the digits I have don't help, I break the loop. Finally, I just convert the modified list back into a string and print the result. The complexity is O(m log m + n), where m and n are the lengths of s and a respectively, which is efficient for constraints. I'm confident in the approach.\n",
