            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Tokitsukaze and Mahjong Problem: A Python Solution**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem: \"Tokitsukaze and Mahjong.\" It's about figuring out the fewest tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to make a \"mentsu\" (either a triplet or sequence) from her initial three tiles. We're assuming an infinite supply of any tile she wants.\n\nFirst things first, let's nail down these definitions. A \"tile\" is a number (1-9) and a suit (m, p, s), like \"1m\" or \"9s.\" A \"mentsu\" is either a \"koutsu\" (a triplet of identical tiles) or a \"shuntsu\" (a sequence of three consecutive tiles in the same suit).  Remember, no wraparound allowed in a shuntsu, and the suits *must* match!\n\nThe challenge is to find the minimum number of extra tiles, *k*, she needs (0, 1, or 2).  If *k* is 0, she already has a mentsu.  If *k* is 1, she needs to draw one more. If *k* is 2, well, that's the most she'll ever need.\n\nMy initial approach is to represent the tiles efficiently. A list of tuples like `[(number, suit), (number, suit), (number, suit)]` seems ideal.  So,  \"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\" would become `[(1, 's'), (2, 's'), (3, 's')]`.\n\nNow, let's break down the logic step-by-step. First, I want to handle the easiest case: **k = 0**, where she already has a mentsu.  I'll need to check for both koutsu and shuntsu configurations.  For a koutsu (triplet), it's straightforward: all three tiles must be identical. For a shuntsu (sequence), I'll need to confirm they are the same suit and the numbers are consecutive.  I'll sort the numbers to make it simple; if the sorted numbers are sequential, bingo!\n\nNext, the **k = 1** scenario is where she needs to draw one tile to create a mentsu. I'll have to examine pairs of her starting tiles against the possibility of one more tile. It is looking like a brute-force approach may work here. I'll hold off on details as I continue to break down the logic.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (meld). A mentsu can be either a koutsu (triplet of three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (sequence of three sequential tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles.\n\nThe minimum number of tiles to draw can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\n1.  **Check for 0 draws:**\n    This means her initial three tiles already form a mentsu.\n    *   **Koutsu:** Check if all three tiles are identical.\n    *   **Shuntsu:** Check if all three tiles are of the same suit, and their numbers form a sequence (e.g., 1-2-3, 5-6-7). To do this, sort the numbers and check if `num[1] == num[0] + 1` and `num[2] == num[1] + 1`.\n\n    If either condition is met, the answer is 0.\n\n2.  **Check for 1 draw:**\n    This means she can form a mentsu using two of her initial tiles and one drawn tile. We need to consider all pairs of tiles from her hand: `(t1, t2)`, `(t1, t3)`, `(t2, t3)`.\n    *   **Koutsu:** For any pair of identical tiles (e.g., `t_a, t_a`), she can draw a third `t_a` to form a koutsu.\n    *   **Shuntsu:** For any pair of tiles of the same suit:\n        *   If they are sequential (e.g., 2m, 3m), she can draw the tile before (1m) or after (4m) to form a shuntsu.\n        *   If they are separated by one number (e.g., 2m, 4m), she can draw the middle tile (3m) to form a shuntsu.\n\n    If any of these conditions are met for any pair of tiles, the answer is 1.\n\n3.  **If neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, then 2 draws are needed.**\n    This is always possible. For example, she can pick any one of her tiles (say, `t1`) and draw two more identical `t1` tiles to form a koutsu. Or, she can pick any one of her tiles (say, `1m`) and draw `2m` and `3m` to form a shuntsu. Since the problem states she can draw any tiles and there's an infinite supply, 2 draws are always sufficient.\n\nThe algorithm will be:\n1.  Parse the three input tile strings into a more manageable format (e.g., `[(number, suit), ...]`).\n2.  Implement `check_0_draws()`:\n    *   Check for triplet: `t1 == t2 == t3`.\n    *   Check for sequence: same suit, sorted numbers `n, n+1, n+2`.\n    *   If true, return 0.\n3.  Implement `check_1_draw()`:\n    *   Iterate through all unique pairs of tiles from the hand.\n    *   For each pair `(t_a, t_b)`:\n        *   If `t_a == t_b`: a third `t_a` makes a koutsu.\n        *   If `t_a.suit == t_b.suit`:\n            *   Let `n_a, n_b` be their numbers. Sort them.\n            *   If `n_b == n_a + 1`: `(n_a, n_a+1)` can form a shuntsu with `n_a-1` (if `n_a > 1`) or `n_a+2` (if `n_a+1 < 9`).\n            *   If `n_b == n_a + 2`: `(n_a, n_a+2)` can form a shuntsu with `n_a+1`.\n        *   If any of these conditions are met, return 1.\n4.  If `check_0_draws()` and `check_1_draw()` both return false (meaning no mentsu can be formed with 0 or 1 draw), then return 2.\n\nTo handle tile comparisons and sorting easily, it's best to convert tiles like \"1s\" to `(1, 's')`. Sorting a list of such tuples will sort by number first, then by suit, which is convenient for grouping.\n\nExample walkthrough: `3p 9m 2p`\nTiles: `[(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]`\n\n1.  **Check 0 draws:**\n    *   Are they all identical? No.\n    *   Are they all same suit? No (p, m, p).\n    *   Result: Not 0.\n\n2.  **Check 1 draw:**\n    Pairs:\n    *   `((3, 'p'), (9, 'm'))`: Different suits, not identical. No koutsu/shuntsu possible with 1 draw.\n    *   `((3, 'p'), (2, 'p'))`: Same suit ('p'). Numbers are 3 and 2. Sorted: `(2, 3)`.\n        *   They are sequential (`3 == 2 + 1`).\n        *   Can form shuntsu with `1p` (`1p, 2p, 3p`) or `4p` (`2p, 3p, 4p`).\n        *   Yes, 1 draw is sufficient.\n    *   `((9, 'm'), (2, 'p'))`: Different suits, not identical. No koutsu/shuntsu possible with 1 draw.\n\n    Result: 1 draw needed.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    tiles_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    \n    # Parse tiles into a list of (number, suit) tuples\n    tiles = []\n    for t_str in tiles_str:\n        num = int(t_str[0])\n        suit = t_str[1]\n        tiles.append((num, suit))\n    \n    # Sort tiles for easier checking of sequences and identical pairs\n    # Sorting by number then suit helps group similar tiles\n    tiles.sort()\n\n    # Helper function to check for a mentsu in a given list of three tiles\n    def is_mentsu(t1, t2, t3):\n        # Check for Koutsu (triplet)\n        if t1 == t2 and t2 == t3:\n            return True\n        \n        # Check for Shuntsu (sequence)\n        # They must be of the same suit\n        if t1[1] == t2[1] and t2[1] == t3[1]:\n            # Their numbers must be sequential\n            if t2[0] == t1[0] + 1 and t3[0] == t2[0] + 1:\n                return True\n        return False\n\n    # 0 Draws needed?\n    # The initial three tiles already form a mentsu.\n    if is_mentsu(tiles[0], tiles[1], tiles[2]):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # 1 Draw needed?\n    # This means we can form a mentsu using two of the initial tiles and one drawn tile.\n    \n    # Check all pairs of tiles\n    # Pair 1: tiles[0], tiles[1]\n    # Pair 2: tiles[0], tiles[2]\n    # Pair 3: tiles[1], tiles[2]\n    \n    # We use a set to store unique pairs to avoid redundant checks if tiles are identical\n    unique_pairs = set()\n    unique_pairs.add(tuple(sorted((tiles[0], tiles[1]))))\n    unique_pairs.add(tuple(sorted((tiles[0], tiles[2]))))\n    unique_pairs.add(tuple(sorted((tiles[1], tiles[2]))))\n\n    for p1, p2 in unique_pairs:\n        # Case 1: Form a Koutsu with 1 draw\n        # If two tiles are identical, draw a third one.\n        if p1 == p2:\n            print(1)\n            return\n        \n        # Case 2: Form a Shuntsu with 1 draw\n        # Tiles must be of the same suit\n        if p1[1] == p2[1]:\n            n1, n2 = p1[0], p2[0]\n            # Ensure n1 <= n2\n            if n1 > n2:\n                n1, n2 = n2, n1\n\n            # If numbers are sequential (e.g., 2, 3), we can draw 1 or 4\n            if n2 == n1 + 1:\n                # Can draw n1-1 (if n1 > 1) or n2+1 (if n2 < 9)\n                # Either way, one draw makes a shuntsu.\n                print(1)\n                return\n            \n            # If numbers are separated by one (e.g., 2, 4), we can draw 3\n            if n2 == n1 + 2:\n                # Can draw n1+1\n                print(1)\n                return\n\n    # If neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, then 2 draws are needed.\n    # This is always possible (e.g., draw two copies of tiles[0] to make a koutsu,\n    # or draw tiles[0].num+1 and tiles[0].num+2 of the same suit to make a shuntsu).\n    print(2)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
