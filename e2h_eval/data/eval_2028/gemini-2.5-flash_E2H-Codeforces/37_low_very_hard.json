    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Gluttony Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Gluttony\" problem. The core of it is building a permutation `b` of an input array `a` such that the sums of elements in any non-empty, proper subset of indices are different between `a` and `b`.  The constraints on `n` and the values in `a` seem manageable, with `n` up to 22. My initial instinct is to really understand that subset sum condition.\n\nThe problem specifically says to exclude the empty set and the entire set of indices from consideration.  That simplifies things a bit. Clearly, if `b` is identical to `a`, it's an immediate fail, as the sums would be equal for all subsets. Sorting or reversing `a` seems like a potential starting point, but I need to be careful with this approach.\n\nLet's start with small cases to build intuition.  For `n=1`, there are no subsets to even check, so any permutation of `a` works.  Now, the example for `n=2` is interesting: `a = [1, 2]` gives `b = [2, 1]`. So it implies, I need to make sure that the elements at each index are different in a and b.\n\nSo, for `n=2`, and `a = [a0, a1]`.  The only possible subsets are `S = {0}` and `S = {1}`. Therefore, `a[0] != b[0]` and `a[1] != b[1]` must hold true. This works for the example `a = [1, 2]`.\n\nI need a systematic way to think about this permutation.  Maybe a construction approach where I try to build `b` step-by-step, ensuring that at each step, the subset sums remain distinct.  Or possibly some kind of backtracking, though with the size of n, I may need something more efficient. It seems like the constraints on the array elements might be important here - perhaps there is some property with the subset sums based on the numbers themselves.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S`, the sum of elements of `a` at these positions is different from the sum of elements of `b` at these positions. That is, `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]`. The array size `n` is up to 22.\n\nLet's analyze the condition: `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]`.\nThis condition must hold for all `S` such that `0 < |S| < n`.\n\nConsider a specific permutation strategy: sort `a` and then rotate it.\nLet `a_sorted` be the array `a` sorted in ascending order.\nLet `b` be `a_sorted` rotated by one position to the left. That is, `b[i] = a_sorted[(i+1) % n]`.\nSo `b` is `[a_sorted[1], a_sorted[2], ..., a_sorted[n-1], a_sorted[0]]`.\n\nLet's check this strategy.\nThe values in `a_sorted` are `x_0 < x_1 < ... < x_{n-1}`.\nSo `a_sorted[i] = x_i`.\nThe array `b` would be `[x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n-1}, x_0]`.\n\nFor any subset of indices `S = {idx_1, ..., idx_k}`:\n`sum_{j=1 to k} a_sorted[idx_j]`\n`sum_{j=1 to k} b[idx_j] = sum_{j=1 to k} a_sorted[(idx_j+1) % n]`\n\nThe problem statement asks for `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]`, where `a` is the original input array.\nIf we sort the original array `a` to get `a_sorted`, and then construct `b_sorted` by rotating `a_sorted`, then `b_sorted` is a permutation of `a_sorted`. Since `a_sorted` is a permutation of `a`, `b_sorted` is also a permutation of `a`.\nSo, let's just sort the input array `a` first. Let `a` now denote the sorted version of the input array.\nThen construct `b` such that `b[i] = a[(i+1)%n]`.\n\nThe condition becomes: `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} a[(i+1)%n]` for all `S` with `0 < |S| < n`.\n\nConsider the difference `D_S = sum_{i in S} (a[(i+1)%n] - a[i])`.\nWe need `D_S != 0` for all `S`.\n\nLet `d_i = a[(i+1)%n] - a[i]`.\nSo `D_S = sum_{i in S} d_i`.\nWe need `sum_{i in S} d_i != 0` for all `S` with `0 < |S| < n`.\n\nThe values `d_i` are:\n`d_0 = a[1] - a[0]`\n`d_1 = a[2] - a[1]`\n...\n`d_{n-2} = a[n-1] - a[n-2]`\n`d_{n-1} = a[0] - a[n-1]`\n\nSince `a` is sorted, `a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1]`.\nThis means `d_i > 0` for `i = 0, ..., n-2`.\nAnd `d_{n-1} = a[0] - a[n-1] < 0`.\n\nThe sum of all `d_i` is `sum_{i=0 to n-1} (a[(i+1)%n] - a[i]) = (a[1]-a[0]) + (a[2]-a[1]) + ... + (a[0]-a[n-1]) = 0`.\nThis means that if we take `S` to be the set of all indices `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`, then `sum_{i in S} d_i = 0`.\nHowever, the problem statement explicitly excludes `S` being the set of all indices (`k < n`). So this case is fine.\n\nNow, we need to show that for any proper non-empty subset `S`, `sum_{i in S} d_i != 0`.\nSince `d_i > 0` for `i < n-1`, if `n-1` is not in `S`, then all `d_i` in the sum are positive, so `sum_{i in S} d_i > 0`.\nThus, `sum_{i in S} d_i != 0` if `n-1` is not in `S`.\n\nWhat if `n-1` is in `S`?\nThen `S = S' U {n-1}` where `S'` is a subset of `{0, 1, ..., n-2}`.\n`sum_{i in S} d_i = (sum_{i in S'} d_i) + d_{n-1}`.\nLet `P_S' = sum_{i in S'} d_i`. Since all `d_i` for `i in S'` are positive, `P_S' > 0` (assuming `S'` is not empty).\nSo we need `P_S' + d_{n-1} != 0`.\n\nLet's consider the specific values:\n`d_0 = a_1 - a_0`\n`d_1 = a_2 - a_1`\n...\n`d_{n-2} = a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}`\n`d_{n-1} = a_0 - a_{n-1}`\n\nThe sum `P_S' = sum_{i in S'} (a_{i+1} - a_i)`.\nThis is a sum of consecutive differences. For example, if `S' = {0, 1, 3}`, `P_S' = (a_1 - a_0) + (a_2 - a_1) + (a_4 - a_3)`.\nAll `P_S'` are positive integers.\nWe need `P_S' + (a_0 - a_{n-1}) != 0`.\nThis is equivalent to `P_S' != a_{n-1} - a_0`.\n\nThe maximum possible value for `P_S'` occurs when `S' = {0, 1, ..., n-2}`.\nIn this case, `P_S' = (a_1 - a_0) + (a_2 - a_1) + ... + (a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}) = a_{n-1} - a_0`.\nSo if `S' = {0, 1, ..., n-2}`, then `P_S' = a_{n-1} - a_0`.\nThen `sum_{i in S} d_i = (a_{n-1} - a_0) + (a_0 - a_{n-1}) = 0`.\nThis `S` is `{0, 1, ..., n-2, n-1}`, which is the set of all indices. This is excluded by `k < n`. So this case is fine.\n\nFor any other `S'` (i.e., `S'` is a proper non-empty subset of `{0, 1, ..., n-2}`), `P_S' = sum_{i in S'} (a_{i+1} - a_i)`.\nSince `a_i` are distinct, all `a_{i+1} - a_i >= 1`.\n`P_S'` is a sum of some of these positive differences.\nThe largest possible value for `P_S'` (when `S'` is a proper subset of `{0, ..., n-2}`) is when `S'` contains all but one element from `{0, ..., n-2}`.\nFor example, if `S' = {0, ..., n-3}`, then `P_S' = a_{n-2} - a_0`.\nSince `a_{n-2} - a_0 < a_{n-1} - a_0`, `P_S' < a_{n-1} - a_0`.\nSince all `d_i` for `i < n-1` are positive, `P_S' > 0`.\nAlso, `a_i` are integers, so `P_S'` is an integer.\nSince `0 < P_S' < a_{n-1} - a_0` (for `S'` a proper non-empty subset of `{0, ..., n-2}`), it cannot be that `P_S' = a_{n-1} - a_0`.\nTherefore, `P_S' + (a_0 - a_{n-1}) != 0`.\n\nThis logic implies that `sum_{i in S} d_i != 0` for all `S` with `0 < |S| < n`.\nThis construction always works.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n`.\n2. Read the array `a`.\n3. Sort `a` in ascending order.\n4. Construct `b` by rotating `a` to the left by one position: `b[i] = a[(i+1)%n]`.\n5. Print `b`.\n\n**Example 1: `n=2`, `a=[1, 2]`**\n1. `n=2`\n2. `a=[1, 2]`\n3. `a` is already sorted: `a=[1, 2]`\n4. `b[0] = a[(0+1)%2] = a[1] = 2`\n   `b[1] = a[(1+1)%2] = a[0] = 1`\n   So `b=[2, 1]`\n5. Print `2 1`. This matches the example output.\n\n**Example 2: `n=4`, `a=[1000, 100, 10, 1]`**\n1. `n=4`\n2. `a=[1000, 100, 10, 1]`\n3. Sort `a`: `a_sorted=[1, 10, 100, 1000]`\n4. Construct `b`:\n   `b[0] = a_sorted[(0+1)%4] = a_sorted[1] = 10`\n   `b[1] = a_sorted[(1+1)%4] = a_sorted[2] = 100`\n   `b[2] = a_sorted[(2+1)%4] = a_sorted[3] = 1000`\n   `b[3] = a_sorted[(3+1)%4] = a_sorted[0] = 1`\n   So `b=[10, 100, 1000, 1]`\n5. Print `10 100 1000 1`. The example output is `100 1 1000 10`.\nMy output `[10, 100, 1000, 1]` is a valid answer. The example output `[100, 1, 1000, 10]` is also a valid answer.\nLet's check the example output `b_example = [100, 1, 1000, 10]` with `a_sorted = [1, 10, 100, 1000]`.\n`b_example` is `[a_sorted[2], a_sorted[0], a_sorted[3], a_sorted[1]]`.\nThis is a specific permutation. It's not a simple rotation.\nHowever, the problem states \"If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\" So my construction is fine.\n\nThe logic holds for `n >= 1`.\nFor `n=1`, `a=[x]`. `a_sorted=[x]`. `b[0] = a_sorted[(0+1)%1] = a_sorted[0] = x`. So `b=[x]`.\nThe condition `0 < k < n` means no subsets `S` need to be checked for `n=1`. So `b=[x]` is a valid answer.\n\nThe constraints `n <= 22` and `a_i <= 10^9` are well within limits for this approach. Sorting takes `O(N log N)`, and constructing `b` takes `O(N)`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Sort the array a\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n\n    # Construct b by rotating a_sorted to the left by one position\n    # b[i] = a_sorted[(i+1)%n]\n    b = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        b[i] = a_sorted[(i + 1) % n]\n\n    # Print the resulting array b\n    print(*(b))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
