He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**The \"Prefixes and Suffixes\" Problem: My Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this competitive programming problem. The goal is to reconstruct a string `s` of length `n` given its improper prefixes and suffixes, which are provided in an arbitrary order. The key insight here is that the two strings of length `n-1` are *crucial*. They almost give away the entire original string `s`.\n\nI need a Python script to do this. First, I'll read the input and store all the strings along with their original indices. Then, I will filter the input to get the two strings of length `n-1`. These will be my starting points to form the string `s`.\n\nHere's my logic: there are two possibilities for the strings of length `n-1`. One will be the prefix of `s` (minus its last character), and the other will be the suffix (minus its first character). So I will call these `cand1` and `cand2`. There are two possibilities to create a candidate `s`: either `cand1` is the prefix or `cand2`. I form the `s` by checking if the two can form a string. These strings must overlap, if `cand1` starts the string, then the last character of `s` is added to `cand1`. The suffix of length `n-1` starts the string.\n\nTo reconstruct `s`, I check for consistency by verifying that the input substrings can be generated from my reconstructed string `s`.  If a substring is not consistent, then that is not a valid `s` string.\n\nSince the problem guarantees a solution, I'm confident that at least one of my two `s` candidates will work. If they are consistent, I use the strings from one of the options.\n\nOnce I have a valid `s`, the final step is to assign 'P' or 'S' to the input strings. If the input matches a prefix of my reconstructed `s`, I assign 'P', otherwise I assign 'S'. I'll need to keep track of already-used prefixes and suffixes to handle duplicates correctly.\n\nThe main data structure will be a dictionary to hold all strings by their lengths.  I will iterate through the input strings and, with the string, retain the original index. Then, based on the length, and if the strings match the prefixes, the string is a prefix. Otherwise, it is a suffix.\n\nLet's start coding this up efficiently! I think this approach is correct and should solve the problem.\n",
