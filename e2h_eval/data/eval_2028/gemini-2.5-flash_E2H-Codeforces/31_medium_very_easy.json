            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Vanya and Cards\n\nVanya loves playing. He even has a special set of cards to play with. Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving Vanya's Card Problem: My Approach**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to figure out how many extra cards Vanya needs to get the sum of his cards to zero. I've broken this down step-by-step. First, I need to know the initial sum of the cards Vanya already has. That's a straightforward sum.  Then, I'm thinking, if the sum is positive, he needs cards that add up to a negative value, and vice-versa.  If the sum is zero, then he's done!\n\nNow, the core idea is minimizing the *number* of new cards. This means using cards with the biggest possible absolute value. The problem says Vanya can find cards with values from `-x` to `x`. So, I'm thinking, if the *current* sum is, say, positive, the most efficient way is to use `-x` cards, repeatedly. It's essentially about how many times `x` (or `-x`) goes into making up the *absolute* value of the current sum.\n\nMathematically, if the current sum is `s`, I need `-s` to get to zero. If `s` is positive, then I need to sum negative numbers. If `s` is negative, then I need to sum positive numbers. So, I take the absolute value of the sum. The trick to finding the minimum number of cards is to use the ceiling function; `ceil(abs(s) / x)`. Using the integer division trick `(a + b - 1) // b`, simplifies the math for us.\n\nI've tested this on a few examples to make sure it's working. I'm using Python because of its built-in list summation and the useful `//` operator (integer division), with the `sys` import to read the data using `stdin`. It's a pretty straightforward implementation of that logic.  The solution seems pretty solid.\n",
