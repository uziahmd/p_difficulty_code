There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for Maximizing House Profit**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem that boils down to maximizing profit from building houses. We have `n` spots, and for each spot, I can choose a house height, `a_i`, which is limited by a global maximum, `h`.  My goal is to maximize the sum of the squared heights, which represents the total profit.\n\nThe catch?  Zoning restrictions.  I have `m` of these, and each restriction specifies a range of spots `[l_j, r_j]` and a maximum height `x_j` that the *tallest* house in that range can be.  Initially, this felt a bit tricky, but I think I've cracked it.\n\nFirst off, the small values for `n`, `h`, and `m` (all up to 50) are a good sign; dynamic programming might not be necessary, perhaps a simpler approach is feasible. Let me see... the objective is straightforward, I need to maximize `sum(a_i^2)`, respecting the constraints: `0 <= a_i <= h` for each spot and `max(a_k) <= x_j` within each range `[l_j, r_j]`.\n\nOkay, the crucial insight hit me: the \"maximum\" height constraint within a range actually applies to *every* house within that range. If `max(a_k)` from `l_j` to `r_j` is less than or equal to `x_j`, then *every* `a_k` within that range must individually be less than or equal to `x_j`. This means that if a spot falls under multiple zoning restrictions, I need to take the *minimum* of those maximum height limits for that spot. This is my key to simplify.\n\nSo, I'll calculate the maximum allowable height `max_h_i` for *each* spot `i`. For each spot `i`, my initial height is the global maximum `h`. Then, for *each* zoning restriction `j`, if spot `i` is within the range `[l_j, r_j]`, I update `max_h_i` to be the minimum of its current value and the restriction's height limit `x_j`.\n\nNow, the problem becomes trivial. Once I have `max_h_i` for each spot, the optimal solution for `a_i` is simply `max_h_i`.  Since `a_i^2` increases as `a_i` increases, I'll build each house as tall as I can without violating any constraints, and that will maximize the overall profit.  I'm confident this will result in the optimal solution. I think I have it. Let's code this up!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the total profit from building `n` houses. For each house `i`, if its height is `a_i`, the profit is `a_i^2`. The height `a_i` must be an integer between `0` and `h` (inclusive). There are `m` zoning restrictions. Each restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)` states that the tallest house in the range `[l_j, r_j]` must be at most `x_j`.\n\nLet's analyze the restrictions. A restriction `max(a_k for k in range(l_j, r_j+1)) <= x_j` implies that *every* house `a_k` within the range `[l_j, r_j]` must satisfy `a_k <= x_j`.\n\nFor each individual house `i`, its height `a_i` is subject to several constraints:\n1. **Global maximum height:** `a_i <= h`.\n2. **Zoning restrictions:** For every restriction `j` such that house `i` is within its range (i.e., `l_j <= i <= r_j`), `a_i` must be at most `x_j`.\n\nCombining these, for each house `i`, its maximum allowed height `max_allowed_height_i` is `h` initially. Then, for every restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)` that covers spot `i`, we update `max_allowed_height_i = min(max_allowed_height_i, x_j)`. This ensures that `a_i` satisfies all relevant restrictions simultaneously.\n\nAfter determining `max_allowed_height_i` for each spot `i`, the problem for each spot becomes independent. For a given spot `i`, we want to choose `a_i` such that `0 <= a_i <= max_allowed_height_i` and `a_i^2` is maximized. Since `a_i^2` is an increasing function for non-negative `a_i`, to maximize `a_i^2`, we should choose the largest possible `a_i`. Therefore, the optimal height for house `i` is `a_i = max_allowed_height_i`.\n\nThe total maximum profit is then the sum of `a_i^2` for all `i` from `1` to `n`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1. Initialize an array `max_heights` of size `n`, where `max_heights[k]` will store the maximum allowed height for the house at spot `k+1`. Initialize all elements to `h`.\n2. For each restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)`:\n   Iterate from `k = l_j-1` to `r_j-1` (using 0-based indexing for the array).\n   Update `max_heights[k] = min(max_heights[k], x_j)`.\n3. Initialize `total_profit = 0`.\n4. Iterate through the `max_heights` array. For each `height` in `max_heights`:\n   Add `height * height` to `total_profit`.\n5. Print `total_profit`.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nRestrictions:\n1. `(1, 1, 1)`\n2. `(2, 2, 3)`\n3. `(3, 3, 2)`\n\n1. Initialize `max_heights = [3, 3, 3]` (all `h`).\n\n2. Process restrictions:\n   - For `(1, 1, 1)`:\n     `max_heights[0] = min(max_heights[0], 1) = min(3, 1) = 1`.\n     `max_heights` is now `[1, 3, 3]`.\n   - For `(2, 2, 3)`:\n     `max_heights[1] = min(max_heights[1], 3) = min(3, 3) = 3`.\n     `max_heights` is still `[1, 3, 3]`.\n   - For `(3, 3, 2)`:\n     `max_heights[2] = min(max_heights[2], 2) = min(3, 2) = 2`.\n     `max_heights` is now `[1, 3, 2]`.\n\n3. Calculate total profit:\n   `total_profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n**Constraints:**\n`n, h, m <= 50`.\nThe initialization of `max_heights` takes `O(n)` time.\nProcessing `m` restrictions: each restriction involves iterating up to `n` spots. So, this step takes `O(m * n)` time.\nCalculating total profit takes `O(n)` time.\nThe overall time complexity is `O(n + m*n + n) = O(m*n)`. Given `n, m <= 50`, `m*n` is at most `50 * 50 = 2500`, which is very efficient and well within typical time limits.\nThe space complexity is `O(n)` for storing `max_heights`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize max_allowed_height for each spot to h\n    # Using 0-based indexing for spots, so spot i is at index i-1\n    max_heights = [h] * n\n\n    # Process each restriction\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        \n        # Apply the restriction to all spots within the range [l, r]\n        # Adjust l and r to 0-based indexing\n        for i in range(l - 1, r):\n            max_heights[i] = min(max_heights[i], x)\n\n    # Calculate the total profit\n    total_profit = 0\n    for height in max_heights:\n        total_profit += height * height\n\n    print(total_profit)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the solution\nsolve()\n\n```",
