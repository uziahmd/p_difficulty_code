Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Feed the Golorp\" Problem: My Thought Process**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Feed the Golorp\" problem, and my initial thought is: Python script, let's go!  Here's my breakdown of what needs to happen to get this done efficiently.\n\nFirst off, it's about finding the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values (0-9) that satisfies the golorp's diet, represented as a string.  The format's pretty straightforward: `?(<expression>):-<conditions>`. That format is super important.\n\nThe core of this problem is definitely parsing the input string. I'll need to split it into two parts: the mathematical expression and the conditions, which will contain things like `___>__` and so on. The number of underscores (`_`) in the expression tells me how many variables I'm dealing with.  I'm thinking I'll parse the expression into either an AST or RPN to make evaluation easier. I'm leaning toward RPN, but I can decide that later.  And for the conditions, I need to break those down into manageable comparisons.\n\nNow, for actually *solving* it, the lexicographical constraint screams \"backtracking\" to me.  I'll go variable by variable, starting with the first one and trying values from 0 to 9.  If an assignment works, I've got a solution. If not, I backtrack and try the next value for that variable. It is a depth-first search.\n\nWhen I have a potential variable assignment, I'll need to evaluate the expression using those assigned values. Then, I check if the conditions are satisfied. If both expression and conditions check out, I've found a solution.\n\nSince the input is guaranteed to be valid (thank goodness!), I don't need to worry about error handling in parsing.  All that is left to determine if equality (\"=\") is an allowable conditional operator based on examples.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of digits (0-9) that satisfies a given set of conditions. The conditions are derived from a \"golorp name\" string, which has two main parts: an arithmetic expression and a list of comparison constraints.\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n1.  **Parsing the Golorp Name:**\n    The input string has the format `?(<expression>):-<conditions>`.\n    *   We first locate the `):-` separator to split the string into the expression part and the conditions part.\n    *   **Expression Parsing:** The expression contains `_` characters, which represent variables. Each `_` corresponds to a unique variable. We count the total number of `_` characters to determine `N`, the number of variables we need to assign values to. The expression uses standard arithmetic operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`. We need to parse this expression into a form that can be evaluated. A common approach is to convert it to Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) or build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). For this problem, given the small number of variables (max 1024 chars, so max ~500 variables) and simple operators, a direct recursive descent parser or shunting-yard algorithm for RPN is suitable. We'll use a simple shunting-yard-like approach.\n    *   **Conditions Parsing:** The conditions are a comma-separated list of comparisons like `___>__` or `___<____`. Each operand in a comparison (e.g., `___`) represents a sum of variable values. The number of `_` in an operand indicates how many variables are summed. For example, `___` means `v0 + v1 + v2`. The problem statement is slightly ambiguous about *which* variables are summed. Based on competitive programming conventions and the lexicographical requirement, it's most likely that `_` in conditions refer to the *same* variables as in the expression, but their sum is taken. The simplest interpretation is that `_` within a condition operand (e.g., `___` in `___>__`) represents a sum of *distinct* variables, specifically `v_0 + v_1 + ... + v_k-1` where `k` is the count of `_`. This is a crucial assumption.\n        *   Example: If the expression has 4 variables (`v0, v1, v2, v3`), and a condition is `___>__`, it means `(v0+v1+v2) > (v0+v1)`. This seems overly restrictive.\n        *   A more common interpretation in similar problems is that `_` in conditions simply represents the *count* of `_`'s. E.g., `___` means the integer `3`, and `__` means `2`. So `___>__` means `3 > 2`. This makes the conditions constant and trivial, which contradicts the problem's difficulty.\n        *   The most plausible interpretation is that `_` in conditions represent *sums of variables*, where each `_` in the condition refers to one of the *input* variables. For example, `___` means `v_0 + v_1 + v_2`, if there are at least 3 variables. This matches the examples where conditions are non-trivial. The problem statement says \"Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9\", implying the `_` in conditions refer to these variables. The example `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.` has `__>__` and `_____<__`. If `_` means 1, then `2>2` (false) and `5<2` (false), making it impossible. But the output is `false`, suggesting this interpretation for `_` as counts of variables is correct for conditions. Let's re-examine.\n        *   The example `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.` output `false`. If `__` means 2, and `_____` means 5, then the conditions are `2 > 2` (false) and `5 < 2` (false). Both are false, so it's impossible. This strongly suggests that `_` in conditions simply represents the integer value of the count of `_`s. This is the simplest interpretation and makes conditions static checks. Let's proceed with this.\n        *   No, on second thought, `___>__` in `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.` being `2>2` or `5<2` makes the problem too simple. The wording \"Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9\" means the `_` in the expression are the *only* variables. The `_` in the conditions must refer to these variables. The most reasonable interpretation for `___` in a condition is `v0 + v1 + v2`, or perhaps the sum of the *first* `k` variables, where `k` is the number of underscores. This is consistent with how variables are introduced sequentially.\n\n    *   **Revised Interpretation for Conditions:** An operand like `___` in a condition evaluates to the sum of the first `k` variables, where `k` is the number of underscores. For example, if we have `N` variables `v_0, v_1, ..., v_{N-1}`, then `___` in a condition would evaluate to `v_0 + v_1 + v_2`. This means the variables are used in their input order for sums in conditions.\n\n2.  **Evaluating Expressions and Conditions:**\n    *   **Expression Evaluation:** We need to evaluate the main expression given assigned values for `v_0, ..., v_{N-1}`. Since `_` can represent variables, we can replace them with placeholders (e.g., `x0, x1, ...`) and then substitute values.\n    *   **Condition Evaluation:** For each condition `operand1 operator operand2`:\n        *   `operand1` and `operand2` are sums of variables (e.g., `v_0 + v_1 + ... + v_k-1`).\n        *   Evaluate these sums and then check the comparison (`>`, `<`).\n\n3.  **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Sequence:**\n    This is a classic backtracking (depth-first search) problem.\n    *   We have `N` variables, `v_0, ..., v_{N-1}`.\n    *   We try to assign values to `v_0`, then `v_1`, and so on.\n    *   For each variable `v_i`, we iterate through possible values from `0` to `9`.\n    *   Since we want the lexicographically smallest sequence, we try `0` first, then `1`, etc. The first complete assignment that satisfies all conditions will be our answer.\n    *   The search can be pruned:\n        *   If at any point during variable assignment, a condition involving only *already assigned* variables becomes false, we can immediately backtrack. This is important for efficiency.\n        *   If the main expression involves division, we must ensure the divisor is not zero. This check should happen during evaluation.\n\n**Detailed Implementation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Parse `N` (number of variables):** Count `_` in the expression part.\n2.  **Parse Expression:**\n    *   Replace `_` with unique identifiers, e.g., `_0`, `_1`, ...\n    *   Use a simple parser (e.g., shunting-yard) to convert to RPN or directly evaluate using operator precedence. A recursive descent parser is also good. Given the simple structure, we can just tokenise and evaluate.\n    *   Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`. Integer division for `/`.\n3.  **Parse Conditions:**\n    *   Split by `,`.\n    *   For each condition (e.g., `___>__`):\n        *   Identify the operator (`>` or `<`).\n        *   Split into left and right operands.\n        *   For each operand (e.g., `___`): Count `_`s. This count `k` means the sum `v_0 + ... + v_{k-1}`. Store this as `(k, operator, k')`.\n4.  **Backtracking Function `solve(k, current_values)`:**\n    *   `k`: The index of the variable we are currently trying to assign (from `0` to `N-1`).\n    *   `current_values`: A list storing the assignments for `v_0, ..., v_{k-1}`.\n    *   **Base Case:** If `k == N`: All variables have been assigned.\n        *   Evaluate the main expression using `current_values`. Handle division by zero. If division by zero occurs, this path is invalid.\n        *   If the expression evaluates successfully, return `current_values` as a valid solution.\n    *   **Recursive Step:** For `value` from `0` to `9`:\n        *   `current_values[k] = value`\n        *   **Pruning:** Check all conditions that *only* involve variables `v_0, ..., v_k`.\n            *   For each condition `(count_left, op, count_right)`:\n                *   If `count_left <= k+1` and `count_right <= k+1`:\n                    *   Calculate `sum_left = v_0 + ... + v_{count_left-1}`.\n                    *   Calculate `sum_right = v_0 + ... + v_{count_right-1}`.\n                    *   If `(sum_left op sum_right)` is false, then this `value` for `v_k` is invalid. `continue` to the next `value`.\n        *   Recursively call `solve(k + 1, current_values)`.\n        *   If `solve()` returns a result (not `None`), that's our lexicographically smallest solution. Return it.\n    *   If no `value` leads to a solution, return `None`.\n\n5.  **Main Function:**\n    *   Initialize `current_values` as a list of size `N`.\n    *   Call `solve(0, current_values)`.\n    *   If a solution is found, print it as a string of digits. Otherwise, print \"false\".\n\n**Example Walkthrough: `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.`**\n\n1.  **Parse:**\n    *   Expression: `__-_+_/_____`\n    *   Conditions: `__>__,_____<__`\n2.  **`N` (variables):** Count `_` in expression. `N=7`. Variables: `v0, v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6`.\n3.  **Parsed Expression (tokens):** `v0`, `v1`, `-`, `v2`, `+`, `v3`, `/`, `v4`, `v5`, `v6`\n    *   (Note: The expression `__-_+_/_____` has `_` as variables. The first `_` is `v0`, second `_` is `v1`, etc. So `__` is `v0, v1`. `_` is `v2`. `_` is `v3`. `_____` is `v4, v5, v6`.)\n    *   Tokens: `v0`, `v1`, `-`, `v2`, `+`, `v3`, `/`, `v4`, `v5`, `v6`\n    *   This tokenization is tricky. `__` means two variables. `_` means one.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate tokenization. A `_` is a variable. `__` is two variables *concatenated*. This is not standard.\n    *   The problem states \"Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive.\" and \"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.\" \"Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.\" This implies *each* `_` is a distinct variable.\n    *   So, `__-_+_/_____` means `_` (v0), `_` (v1), `-`, `_` (v2), `+`, `_` (v3), `/`, `_` (v4), `_` (v5), `_` (v6).\n    *   This gives 7 variables.\n    *   The expression is `v0 - v1 + v2 / v3 / v4 / v5 / v6`. This is odd. Operator precedence.\n    *   It's `(v0 - v1) + (v2 / v3) / v4 / v5 / v6`. Or `(v0 - v1) + v2 / (v3 / v4 / v5 / v6)`.\n    *   Standard precedence: `*`, `/` before `+`, `-`. Left-to-right for same precedence.\n    *   So, `v0 - v1 + v2 / v3 / v4 / v5 / v6` is `((v0 - v1) + (((v2 / v3) / v4) / v5)) / v6`. This is still ambiguous without full grammar.\n    *   The examples suggest simpler expressions: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` -> `v0 - v1 / v2 * v3`. Here `v2` is `_`, `v3` is `_`.\n    *   Let's assume `_` means a variable, and `__` means `v0, v1`. This is inconsistent.\n    *   **Crucial Clarification:** \"Variables consumed by golorps... For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name.\" \"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.\" This means the *count* of `_` symbols in the expression defines `N`. The variables are then `v_0, v_1, ..., v_{N-1}` in the order they appear.\n    *   Example: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n        *   Expression: `_-_/___*__`\n        *   Variables: `_` (v0), `_` (v1), `_` (v2), `_` (v3), `_` (v4). So `N=5`.\n        *   The expression is `v0 - v1 / v2 * v3 * v4`.\n        *   Conditions: `___>__`\n            *   Left operand `___`: `v0+v1+v2`\n            *   Right operand `__`: `v0+v1`\n            *   Condition: `v0+v1+v2 > v0+v1` which simplifies to `v2 > 0`.\n\nThis interpretation makes sense and is consistent with typical competitive programming problem styles.\n\n**Revised Parsing for `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.`**\n\n1.  **Expression:** `__-_+_/_____`\n    *   `_` (v0), `_` (v1), `-`, `_` (v2), `+`, `_` (v3), `/`, `_` (v4), `_` (v5), `_` (v6).\n    *   Total `N = 7` variables.\n    *   Expression: `v0 - v1 + v2 / v3 / v4 / v5 / v6`\n2.  **Conditions:** `__>__,_____<__`\n    *   Condition 1: `__>__`\n        *   Left: `v0+v1`\n        *   Right: `v0+v1`\n        *   Comparison: `(v0+v1) > (v0+v1)` which is `False`.\n    *   Condition 2: `_____<__`\n        *   Left: `v0+v1+v2+v3+v4`\n        *   Right: `v0+v1`\n        *   Comparison: `(v0+v1+v2+v3+v4) < (v0+v1)` which simplifies to `v2+v3+v4 < 0`.\n\nSince Condition 1 `(v0+v1) > (v0+v1)` is always `False`, this golorp is impossible to feed. This matches the example output `false`.
