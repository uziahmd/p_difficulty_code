You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the \"Replacing Digits\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Replacing Digits\" problem, and I need to come up with a Python solution. The input is a number `a` (as a string) and a sequence of digits `s` (also as a string). The goal is to maximize the value of `a` by replacing some of its digits with digits from `s`, with the constraint that each digit in `s` can only be used once.\n\nMy initial thought is to tackle this with a greedy approach. To maximize the resulting number, I need to make the most significant digits as large as possible. This means I'll iterate through `a` from left to right, and for each digit, I'll check if I can improve it using a digit from `s`.\n\nThe core strategy is: For each digit in `a`, I'll look through the available digits in `s` and try to find the *largest* digit that's greater than the current digit in `a`. If I find one, I replace the digit and consume that digit from `s`. If there's no larger digit in `s` for the current position or if the available digits are all smaller, I just keep the current digit in `a` and move on.\n\nEssentially, I'm trying to find the first position from the left in 'a' where I can place a digit from 's' that is greater than what is currently at that position. It doesn't matter what digits are to the right of this position because, for two numbers of the same length, if a digit is greater in the first position that differs, that number is greater. I am therefore making the most significant positions as large as I can and, since this is a greedy algorithm, then I should have the correct answer.\n\nThe examples are helpful for making sure I get this implementation right.\n",
