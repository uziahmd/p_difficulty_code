    "thought": "**The core challenge here is a string manipulation problem, where we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible through a series of allowed swaps.** The allowed swaps are: swapping adjacent '0' and '1', or adjacent '1' and '2'. Swapping '0' and '2' is directly forbidden.\n\nMy initial thought process involved analyzing the \"reach\" of each character type.  I reasoned that '0' can effectively move past '1' (and vice versa), and '1' can move past '2' (and vice versa).  A key observation was the inability to directly swap '0' and '2'.\n\nI initially thought that this restriction meant the relative order of '0's and '2's would be *fixed* (unchangeable) because '0' and '2' can only indirectly change position through the mediation of 1. If '0' appears before '2', it should always stay before '2'. However, by analyzing swap permutations, it's possible to change the relative position of 0 and 2.\n\nThis led me to consider a \"bubble sort\" perspective. Because characters are free to move past 1s, the solution must involve prioritizing the characters with smaller weights. Also, there are no special cases for the ordering of 0s and 2s that can't be ordered by considering 1s.\n\nI formulated the following strategy: the relative order of '0's and '2's must be preserved. If they are in the sequence \"0...2\" at the start, they must stay that way. The '1's, however, are highly mobile and can be inserted to different parts of the string. So the optimal arrangement would be '0's first, '1's next, and finally, the '2's.\n\nI then designed an algorithm that iterates through the string, extracting the '1's and forming a new string. The algorithm counts '1's, and builds a result that considers the ordering of the 0s and 2s, and correctly inserts the '1's to find a lexicographically smallest ordering.  This approach appeared to handle all scenarios: strings with/without '1's and different placements of '0' and '2'. My code ensures that these are inserted such that we create a sorted string. The final step involves merging the ordered characters such that the '0's are inserted at the beginning, then the required number of '1's, and then the '2's.\n\nFinally, I tested the algorithm against several examples, and ensured that the algorithm could construct the proper output that is correct.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by repeatedly swapping adjacent '0' and '1', or adjacent '1' and '2'. Swapping '0' and '2' is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed swaps:\n1. '0' can swap with '1': \"01\" $\\leftrightarrow$ \"10\"\n2. '1' can swap with '2': \"12\" $\\leftrightarrow$ \"21\"\n\nThe crucial observation is about the relative order of '0's and '2's.\nA '0' cannot directly swap with a '2'. If we have \"02\", it cannot become \"20\". Similarly, \"20\" cannot become \"02\".\nWhat if there's a '1' in between? For example, \"012\". Can this become \"210\"?\nLet's try:\n\"012\" $\\xrightarrow{1 \\leftrightarrow 2}$ \"021\"\n\"021\" $\\xrightarrow{0 \\leftrightarrow 1}$ \"201\"\n\"201\" $\\xrightarrow{0 \\leftrightarrow 1}$ \"210\"\nSo, \"012\" can indeed become \"210\". This means a '0' can move past a '2' if there is a '1' acting as a \"bridge\". This implies that if there's at least one '1' in the string, all '0's and '2's can effectively swap their relative positions.\n\nIf all characters ('0', '1', '2') can effectively swap positions with each other (via '1's), then we can sort the entire string. The lexicographically smallest string would be all '0's, then all '1's, then all '2's. For example, if the input is \"100210\", and it contains '1's, then it should become \"000112\".\n\nHowever, the example output for \"100210\" is \"001120\". This contradicts the idea that all '0's can move past all '2's. In \"001120\", the '2' appears before the last '0'. If we could fully sort, it would be \"000112\".\n\nThis implies my understanding of \"012\" $\\rightarrow$ \"210\" is not applicable in the general sense for all '0's and '2's. Let's re-evaluate the \"fixed relative order\" more carefully.\n\nThe key property is that '0's and '2's cannot swap directly. This means that if you consider the subsequence formed by only '0's and '2's (ignoring '1's), their relative order is invariant.\nFor example, in \"100210\", the subsequence of '0's and '2's is \"0020\". In any reachable string, the first '0' must appear before the second '0', which must appear before the '2', which must appear before the last '0'.\n\nThe '1's are special. They can swap with both '0's and '2's. This means a '1' can move past any '0' or any '2'. Consequently, all '1's can be grouped together into a contiguous block.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string:\n1. We want to place as many '0's as possible at the beginning.\n2. Then, we want to place '1's.\n3. Finally, '2's.\n\nConsidering the invariant relative order of '0's and '2's:\n- All '0's that appear before any '2' in the original string can be moved to the very beginning (before any '1's or '2's).\n- All '2's (and any '0's that appear after them in the original string) must maintain their relative order.\n- All '1's can be grouped together and placed anywhere. To minimize lexicographically, they should be placed after all the initial '0's and before the first '2' (if any '2' exists).\n\nThis leads to the following strategy:\n1. Count all occurrences of '1's in the input string `s`. Let this be `count_ones`.\n2. Build two lists: `prefix_zeros` and `suffix_twos_and_zeros`.\n   - `prefix_zeros` will store '0's that appear before the first '2' in the original string.\n   - `suffix_twos_and_zeros` will store all '2's, and any '0's that appear after the first '2'.\n3. Iterate through the input string `s` character by character:\n   - If the character is '1', increment `count_ones`.\n   - If the character is '0':\n     - If we have not yet encountered a '2', append '0' to `prefix_zeros`.\n     - If we have already encountered a '2', append '0' to `suffix_twos_and_zeros`.\n   - If the character is '2':\n     - Mark that we have encountered the first '2'.\n     - Append '2' to `suffix_twos_and_zeros`.\n\n4. The final lexicographically smallest string is formed by concatenating:\n   - The characters in `prefix_zeros` (joined into a string).\n   - `count_ones` number of '1's (e.g., `'1' * count_ones`).\n   - The characters in `suffix_twos_and_zeros` (joined into a string).\n\nLet's trace the examples with this strategy:\n\n**Example 1: `s = \"100210\"`**\n- `count_ones = 0`\n- `prefix_zeros = []`\n- `suffix_twos_and_zeros = []`\n- `found_first_two = False`\n\n1. `s[0] = '1'`: `count_ones = 1`\n2. `s[1] = '0'`: `found_first_two` is `False`. `prefix_zeros.append('0')`. `prefix_zeros = ['0']`\n3. `s[2] = '0'`: `found_first_two` is `False`. `prefix_zeros.append('0')`. `prefix_zeros = ['0', '0']`\n4. `s[3] = '2'`: `found_first_two = True`. `suffix_twos_and_zeros.append('2')`. `suffix_twos_and_zeros = ['2']`\n5. `s[4] = '1'`: `count_ones = 2`\n6. `s[5] = '0'`: `found_first_two` is `True`. `suffix_twos_and_zeros.append('0')`. `suffix_twos_and_zeros = ['2', '0']`\n\nAfter loop:\n`prefix_zeros = ['0', '0']`\n`count_ones = 2`\n`suffix_twos_and_zeros = ['2', '0']`\n\nResult: `\"\".join(['0', '0']) + ('1' * 2) + \"\".join(['2', '0'])`\n        `\"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\" = \"001120\"` (Matches example output)\n\n**Example 2: `s = \"11222121\"`**\n- `count_ones = 0`\n- `prefix_zeros = []`\n- `suffix_twos_and_zeros = []`\n- `found_first_two = False`\n\n1. `s[0] = '1'`: `count_ones = 1`\n2. `s[1] = '1'`: `count_ones = 2`\n3. `s[2] = '2'`: `found_first_two = True`. `suffix_twos_and_zeros.append('2')`. `suffix_twos_and_zeros = ['2']`\n4. `s[3] = '2'`: `suffix_twos_and_zeros.append('2')`. `suffix_twos_and_zeros = ['2', '2']`\n5. `s[4] = '2'`: `suffix_twos_and_zeros.append('2')`. `suffix_twos_and_zeros = ['2', '2', '2']`\n6. `s[5] = '1'`: `count_ones = 3`\n7. `s[6] = '2'`: `suffix_twos_and_zeros.append('2')`. `suffix_twos_and_zeros = ['2', '2', '2', '2']`\n8. `s[7] = '1'`: `count_ones = 4`\n\nAfter loop:\n`prefix_zeros = []`\n`count_ones = 4`\n`suffix_twos_and_zeros = ['2', '2', '2', '2']`\n\nResult: `\"\".join([]) + ('1' * 4) + \"\".join(['2', '2', '2', '2'])`\n        `\"\" + \"1111\" + \"2222\" = \"11112222\"` (Matches example output)\n\n**Example 3: `s = \"20\"`**\n- `count_ones = 0`\n- `prefix_zeros = []`\n- `suffix_twos_and_zeros = []`\n- `found_first_two = False`\n\n1. `s[0] = '2'`: `found_first_two = True`. `suffix_twos_and_zeros.append('2')`. `suffix_twos_and_zeros = ['2']`\n2. `s[1] = '0'`: `found_first_two` is `True`. `suffix_twos_and_zeros.append('0')`. `suffix_twos_and_zeros = ['2', '0']`\n\nAfter loop:\n`prefix_zeros = []`\n`count_ones = 0`\n`suffix_twos_and_zeros = ['2', '0']`\n\nResult: `\"\".join([]) + ('1' * 0) + \"\".join(['2', '0'])`\n        `\"\" + \"\" + \"20\" = \"20\"` (Matches example output)\n\nThis strategy correctly reproduces all example outputs and handles various edge cases (like strings with no '1's, or no '0's, or no '2's). The time complexity will be O(N) for iterating through the string and O(N) for string concatenation (if done efficiently using `\"\".join()`), where N is the length of the string. Space complexity is O(N) for storing the lists.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    count_ones = 0\n    prefix_zeros = []\n    suffix_twos_and_zeros = []\n    found_first_two = False\n\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            count_ones += 1\n        elif char == '0':\n            if found_first_two:\n                suffix_twos_and_zeros.append('0')\n            else:\n                prefix_zeros.append('0')\n        elif char == '2':\n            found_first_two = True\n            suffix_twos_and_zeros.append('2')\n    \n    # Construct the result string\n    result = []\n    result.extend(prefix_zeros)\n    result.extend(['1'] * count_ones)\n    result.extend(suffix_twos_and_zeros)\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result) + \"\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
