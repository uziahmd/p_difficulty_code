    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this \"Gluttony\" problem. My goal is to find a permutation `b` of an input array `a` such that no proper subset sums of `a` and `b` are equal. The constraint `n <= 22` hints at a potentially exponential solution, but permutations, with `n!` possibilities, are definitely off the table.**\n\n**I start by analyzing the key condition: `sum(a, S) != sum(b, S)` for all subsets `S`. Since the total sum of `a` and `b` must be equal (because `b` is a permutation), it helps to exclude the full set. Trying to get an intuition, sorting `a` and using a cyclic shift permutation, where `b[i] = a[i+1]`, seems like a good starting point to test.**\n\n**Testing this on small cases like `n=2` and `n=3` quickly shows it could work, but then trying `n=4` I run into a potential issue. A sum of a subset could match even with the cyclic shift. I realize this approach needs a more generalized strategy to prevent matching subset sums.**\n\n**I formalize the condition to involve `c_i = a[i] - b[i]`. So `sum(c,S)` for all `S` need to be not zero. This suggests that the constructed `b` needs to ensure the `c` array avoids zero subset sums. The sorting approach suggests I can work with the sorted input values now. Let `b[i] = a[j]` for some `j`, so the elements in `b` will be in another order.**\n\n**I move to the original problem statement again. I need to make the subset sums different. I need to find a suitable permutation. An example from the problem shows a more complex mapping than a cyclic shift. So I go back to analyzing the examples to figure it out.**\n\n**I revisit the original example to work backwards and realize I can map the cyclic shifted value to the original index. I construct `b` such that `b[original_indices[k]] = sorted_a[(k+1) % n]`. In other words, I'm doing a cyclic shift on the sorted `a`, but mapping the shifted values back to their original positions. This can be expressed as `c_j = sorted_a[k] - sorted_a[(k+1) % n]`. I call it `d_k = sorted_a[k] - sorted_a[(k+1) % n]` and this gives `sum d_k = 0`.`**\n\n**The critical part is ensuring subset sums of `c` don't equal zero. I have positive and negative `c_i`s. I have `d_i = a_i - b_i`. In all these cases, `c_i= d_i = sorted_a[k] - sorted_a[(k+1) %n]`. Because the sorted `s` values are in increasing order, the only positive `d_i` is the last one where it loops back to the beginning. To prevent a sum equals zero, the only way is to ensure `d_{n-1} + sum(d_{neg}) != 0`. So, can `s_{n-1} - s_0` be formed by summing a subset `s_1-s_0`, `s_2-s_1` , etc... ?**\n\n**It's looking like this cyclic-shift approach, combined with the mapping back to original positions, could lead to a solution. I am almost there. I will implement this now.**\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S`, the sum of elements of `a` at these positions is different from the sum of elements of `b` at these positions. That is, `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]`. The array size `n` is up to 22.\n\nLet's define `c[i] = a[i] - b[i]`. The condition becomes `sum_{i in S} c[i] != 0` for all `0 < |S| < n`.\nSince `b` is a permutation of `a`, the sum of all elements in `a` is equal to the sum of all elements in `b`. Thus, `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c[i] = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (a[i] - b[i]) = (sum a[i]) - (sum b[i]) = 0`. This means the condition for `S` being the full set of indices is naturally satisfied (it sums to 0, but the problem statement explicitly excludes the full set).\n\nThe problem now is to find a permutation `b` such that the array `c` (derived from `a` and `b`) has no proper non-empty subset that sums to zero. This is a variant of the subset sum problem.\n\nA common strategy for problems involving `n <= 22` is to use meet-in-the-middle or bitmask DP. However, here we need to *construct* such a permutation, not just check existence.\n\nLet's try a constructive approach.\n1. Store the original values along with their indices: `(a[i], i)`.\n2. Sort these pairs based on the values `a[i]`. Let the sorted values be `s_0 < s_1 < ... < s_{n-1}`, and their corresponding original indices be `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`. So `s_k = a[p_k]`.\n3. Construct `b` by performing a cyclic shift on the sorted values. Specifically, we want `b[p_k] = s_{(k+1) % n}`.\n   This means if `a[original_index]` was the `k`-th smallest element `s_k`, then `b[original_index]` will be the `(k+1)%n`-th smallest element `s_{(k+1)%n}`.\n   So, `b` will be `[s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n-1}, s_0]` when arranged according to the sorted order of `a`.\n   To be precise: Initialize `b_result` as an array of size `n`. For each `k` from `0` to `n-1`, set `b_result[p_k] = s_{(k+1)%n}`.\n\nLet's analyze the values `c[i]` generated by this construction.\nFor each `i`, `a[i]` corresponds to some `s_k` (i.e., `a[i] = s_k` where `i=p_k`).\nThen `b[i]` will be `s_{(k+1)%n}`.\nSo `c[i] = a[i] - b[i] = s_k - s_{(k+1)%n}`.\nLet `d_k = s_k - s_{(k+1)%n}`. The set of values `{c[0], ..., c[n-1]}` is precisely the set `{d_0, ..., d_{n-1}}`.\nThe sum of these `d_k` values is `(s_0 - s_1) + (s_1 - s_2) + ... + (s_{n-2} - s_{n-1}) + (s_{n-1} - s_0) = 0` (a telescoping sum).\n\nNow we need to check if any proper non-empty subset of `{d_0, ..., d_{n-1}}` sums to zero.\nThe values `s_k` are strictly increasing: `s_0 < s_1 < ... < s_{n-1}`.\nTherefore:\n`d_0 = s_0 - s_1 < 0`\n`d_1 = s_1 - s_2 < 0`\n...\n`d_{n-2} = s_{n-2} - s_{n-1} < 0`\n`d_{n-1} = s_{n-1} - s_0 > 0`\n\nSo, we have `n-1` negative values and exactly one positive value (`d_{n-1}`).\nFor a subset sum to be zero, it must contain `d_{n-1}`. If it doesn't, the sum of negative values will be negative (or zero if the subset is empty, which is excluded).\nLet `S'` be a proper non-empty subset of `{d_0, ..., d_{n-1}}`.\nIf `sum_{x in S'} x = 0`, then `d_{n-1}` must be in `S'`.\nSo `S'` must be of the form `T union {d_{n-1}}`, where `T` is a subset of `{d_0, ..., d_{n-2}}`.\nThe condition `sum_{x in S'} x = 0` becomes `d_{n-1} + sum_{x in T} x = 0`.\nThis is equivalent to `d_{n-1} = -sum_{x in T} x`.\nLet `N_k = -d_k = s_{k+1} - s_k` for `k=0, ..., n-2`. These `N_k` are all positive.\nThen `d_{n-1} = sum_{x in T} N_x`.\nSo we need to check if `s_{n-1} - s_0` can be expressed as a sum of a subset of `{s_1-s_0, s_2-s_1, ..., s_{n-1}-s_{n-2}}`.\nThis is a standard subset sum problem for which `n-1` elements. Since `n <= 22`, `n-1 <= 21`. We can solve this using a bitmask approach.\n\nWe can generate all possible subset sums of `N = {N_0, ..., N_{n-2}}`.\nLet `target = s_{n-1} - s_0`.\nIf `target` is found among the subset sums of `N`, then a solution does not exist for this construction. Otherwise, this construction is valid.\n\nThe number of subsets of `N` is `2^(n-1)`. For `n=22`, `2^21` is about `2 * 10^6`. Generating these sums and storing them in a hash set is feasible.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n` and array `a`.\n2. Create `indexed_a = [(a[i], i) for i in range(n)]`.\n3. Sort `indexed_a` to get `sorted_indexed_a`. This will be `[(s_0, p_0), (s_1, p_1), ..., (s_{n-1}, p_{n-1})]`.\n4. Extract `s_k` values: `s = [val for val, _ in sorted_indexed_a]`.\n5. Extract `p_k` values (original indices): `p = [idx for _, idx in sorted_indexed_a]`.\n6. Calculate `N_k = s_{k+1} - s_k` for `k=0, ..., n-2`. Store these in a list `diffs`.\n7. Calculate `target = s_{n-1} - s_0`.\n8. Generate all subset sums of `diffs`:\n   Initialize a `set` called `subset_sums` and add `0` to it.\n   For each `x` in `diffs`:\n     Create a `new_sums` set.\n     For each `current_sum` in `subset_sums`:\n       Add `current_sum + x` to `new_sums`.\n     Add all elements from `new_sums` to `subset_sums`.\n9. If `target` is in `subset_sums`:\n   This construction fails. In this specific problem, it turns out this simple cyclic shift *always* works. The problem statement guarantees that if there's a solution, print it. The example output `[100, 1, 1000, 10]` for `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]` is actually produced by this cyclic shift strategy when `a` is pre-sorted. Let's verify for the example `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`.\n   `indexed_a = [(1000,0), (100,1), (10,2), (1,3)]`\n   `sorted_indexed_a = [(1,3), (10,2), (100,1), (1000,0)]`\n   `s = [1, 10, 100, 1000]`\n   `p = [3, 2, 1, 0]`\n   `diffs`:\n     `N_0 = s_1 - s_0 = 10 - 1 = 9`\n     `N_1 = s_2 - s_1 = 100 - 10 = 90`\n     `N_2 = s_3 - s_2 = 1000 - 100 = 900`\n   `diffs = [9, 90, 900]`\n   `target = s_3 - s_0 = 1000 - 1 = 999`\n   Subset sums of `diffs`:\n   `{0}`\n   `{0, 9}`\n   `{0, 9, 90, 99}`\n   `{0, 9, 90, 99, 900, 909, 990, 999}`\n   `target = 999` is in `subset_sums`. This means `d_{n-1} = N_0 + N_1 + N_2`.\n   This means that `c[p_3] = c[p_0] + c[p_1] + c[p_2]` (with `c[p_k] = -N_k` for `k<n-1`).\n   So `sum_{i in {p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3}} c[i] = 0` but this is the full set.\n   The specific subset `S' = {p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3}` (which corresponds to `d_0, d_1, d_2, d_3` where `d_3` is `s_3-s_0`) sums to zero.\n   The condition is `d_{n-1} = sum_{x in T} N_x` where `T` is a *proper* subset of `{d_0, ..., d_{n-2}}`.\n   In our example, `target = 999` is `9 + 90 + 900`. This corresponds to `T = {d_0, d_1, d_2}`.\n   So `S' = {d_0, d_1, d_2, d_3}`. This is the set of all `d_k` values. This is *not* a proper subset.\n   The values `N_k` are `s_{k+1}-s_k`.\n   `d_k = s_k - s_{k+1}` for `k < n-1`.\n   `d_{n-1} = s_{n-1} - s_0`.\n   We are looking for `sum_{j in S'} d_j = 0` for `0 < |S'| < n`.\n   If `d_{n-1} in S'`, then `d_{n-1} = -sum_{j in S' \\setminus \\{d_{n-1}\\}} d_j`.\n   Let `S'_neg = S' \\setminus \\{d_{n-1}\\}`. `S'_neg` is a subset of `{d_0, ..., d_{n-2}}`.\n   So we need `s_{n-1} - s_0 = sum_{j in S'_neg} (s_{j+1} - s_j)`.\n   The `N_k` values are `s_{k+1}-s_k`.\n   So we are checking if `target = s_{n-1} - s_0` can be formed by summing a *proper* subset of `{N_0, ..., N_{n-2}}`.\n   The sum `N_0 + N_1 + ... + N_{n-2} = (s_1-s_0) + (s_2-s_1) + ... + (s_{n-1}-s_{n-2}) = s_{n-1}-s_0`.\n   This is exactly `target`.\n   So if `target` is found in `subset_sums`, it means `target` can be formed.\n   If `target` is formed by summing *all* `N_k` values (i.e., `N_0 + ... + N_{n-2}`), then `S'_neg` must be `{d_0, ..., d_{n-2}}`. In this case, `S' = {d_0, ..., d_{n-1}}`, which is the full set. This is excluded by the problem definition.\n   So, the cyclic shift construction *always* works. The only case where `sum_{j in S'} d_j = 0` could happen is if `S'` is the full set of indices, which is explicitly excluded.\n   The check `if target in subset_sums` is actually checking if `target` can be formed by a *strict* subset of `diffs`. If `target` is formed by all `diffs`, that means `sum(diffs) = target`. But `sum(diffs)` is `s_{n-1}-s_0`. This is always true.\n   The concern is if `target` can be formed by a *proper non-empty* subset of `diffs`.\n   If `target = sum_{k in K} N_k` for some `K \\subset \\{0, ..., n-2\\}` and `K` is not the full set `{0, ..., n-2}` and `K` is not empty, then the construction fails.\n   The `subset_sums` set will contain `target` because `target` is the sum of all elements in `diffs`. We need to ensure that `target` is *only* the sum of all elements in `diffs` and not a sum of a proper non-empty subset.\n   This means we are checking for the uniqueness of subset sum `target`.\n   If `target` is in `subset_sums` and the subset `K` that formed it is not the full `diffs` list, then the construction fails.\n\nIt turns out this cyclic shift construction *always* works. The only way `sum_{j in S} c_j = 0` is if `S` corresponds to the full set of `d_k` values.\nLet `S'` be a proper non-empty subset of `{d_0, ..., d_{n-1}}`.\nIf `d_{n-1} \\notin S'`, then `sum_{j \\in S'} d_j < 0` because all `d_j` for `j < n-1` are negative. So it cannot be 0.\nIf `d_{n-1} \\in S'`, then `sum_{j \\in S'} d_j = d_{n-1} + sum_{j \\in S'_neg} d_j`, where `S'_neg \\subset \\{d_0, ..., d_{n-2}\\}$.\nThis sum is `(s_{n-1} - s_0) + sum_{j \\in S'_neg} (s_j - s_{j+1})`.\nThis is equal to `(s_{n-1} - s_0) - sum_{j \\in S'_neg} (s_{j+1} - s_j)`.\nLet `N_j = s_{j+1} - s_j`.\nWe need `(s_{n-1} - s_0) - sum_{j \\in S'_neg} N_j = 0`.\nSo `s_{n-1} - s_0 = sum_{j \\in S'_neg} N_j`.\nSince `S'` is a proper subset of `{d_0, ..., d_{n-1}}`, `S'_neg` must be a proper subset of `{d_0, ..., d_{n-2}}`.\nThis means `S'_neg` is a proper subset of indices `{0, ..., n-2}`.\nThe sum `sum_{j=0}^{n-2} N_j = (s_1-s_0) + ... + (s_{n-1}-s_{n-2}) = s_{n-1}-s_0`.\nSo we are asking if `s_{n-1}-s_0` can be formed by a *proper* subset of `N_0, ..., N_{n-2}`.\nSince all `N_j > 0`, if `sum_{j \\in S'_neg} N_j = s_{n-1}-s_0`, and `S'_neg` is a proper subset, this would mean that `sum_{j \\notin S'_neg} N_j` (where `j \\in \\{0, ..., n-2\\}`) must be 0, which is impossible as all `N_j > 0`.\nTherefore, the only way `sum_{j \\in S'_neg} N_j = s_{n-1}-s_0` is if `S'_neg = \\{0, ..., n-2\\}`.\nBut if `S'_neg = \\{0, ..., n-2\\}`, then `S' = \\{d_0, ..., d_{n-1}\\}`, which is the full set of `d` values. This is excluded by the problem.\nThus, the cyclic shift construction *always* works for `n > 1`.\nFor `n=1`, there are no proper non-empty subsets, so `b=a` works. The cyclic shift `b_0 = a_0` also works.\n\nSo the algorithm simplifies:\n1. Read `n` and array `a`.\n2. Create `indexed_a = [(a[i], i) for i in range(n)]`.\n3. Sort `indexed_a` to get `sorted_indexed_a`. This will be `[(s_0, p_0), (s_1, p_1), ..., (s_{n-1}, p_{n-1})]`.\n4. Initialize `b_result` as an array of size `n`.\n5. For `k` from `0` to `n-1`:\n   Set `b_result[p_k] = s_{(k+1)%n}`.\n6. Print `b_result`.\n\nExample `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`\n1. `n=4`, `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`\n2. `indexed_a = [(1000,0), (100,1), (10,2), (1,3)]`\n3. `sorted_indexed_a = [(1,3), (10,2), (100,1), (1000,0)]`\n   `s = [1, 10, 100, 1000]`\n   `p = [3, 2, 1, 0]`\n4. `b_result = [0, 0, 0, 0]`\n5. Loop:\n   `k=0`: `p_0=3`, `s_{(0+1)%4}=s_1=10`. `b_result[3] = 10`. `b_result = [0,0,0,10]`\n   `k=1`: `p_1=2`, `s_{(1+1)%4}=s_2=100`. `b_result[2] = 100`. `b_result = [0,0,100,10]`\n   `k=2`: `p_2=1`, `s_{(2+1)%4}=s_3=1000`. `b_result[1] = 1000`. `b_result = [0,1000,100,10]`\n   `k=3`: `p_3=0`, `s_{(3+1)%4}=s_0=1`. `b_result[0] = 1`. `b_result = [1,1000,100,10]`\n6. Print `1 1000 100 10`. This is a valid output.\n\nThe logic is simpler than anticipated because the specific structure of `d_k` values (all negative except one positive, which is the sum of magnitudes of all others) prevents any proper subset from summing to zero.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    if n == 1:\n        print(a[0])\n        return\n\n    # Store (value, original_index) pairs\n    indexed_a = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        indexed_a.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Sort based on values\n    indexed_a.sort()\n\n    # s_k will be the sorted values, p_k will be their original indices\n    # indexed_a[k] = (s_k, p_k)\n    \n    # Initialize b_result array\n    b_result = [0] * n\n\n    # Construct b such that b[p_k] = s_{(k+1)%n}\n    # This means the element originally at index p_k (which has value s_k)\n    # will be replaced by the value s_{(k+1)%n} in the new array b.\n    for k in range(n):\n        s_k = indexed_a[k][0]          # The k-th smallest value\n        p_k = indexed_a[k][1]          # Its original index\n\n        s_next = indexed_a[(k + 1) % n][0] # The (k+1)%n-th smallest value\n\n        b_result[p_k] = s_next\n\n    # Print the resulting array b\n    print(*(b_result))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
