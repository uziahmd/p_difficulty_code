    "thought": "**Calculating Gilded Cells on a Rectangular Plate**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to calculate the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate, given its width (`w`), height (`h`), and the number of rings (`k`). This seems straightforward, but I need to make sure I'm precise with my ring definition.\n\nEssentially, each ring is a border around a shrinking inner rectangle. The `i`-th ring's inner rectangle has dimensions `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`.  The trick is efficiently calculating the number of cells in each ring, which is the perimeter of that inner rectangle.\n\nThe initial perimeter formula, `2 * (W + H) - 4`, is almost correct but I had a few edge case problems, specifically when either `W` or `H` are small, say 1. It turns out I really need to handle the perimeter calculation in pieces to get this right.  \n\nIf either dimension is less than or equal to 0, then the number of gilded cells is zero, if one dimension is one, then the total number of gilded cells is `W*H`, and for dimensions of 2 or more, `2 * W + 2 * H - 4` is a good formula.\n\nI think I have a clear strategy now: iterate through each ring from 1 to `k`. For each ring `i`, calculate the dimensions of the inner rectangle. Then, use the correct formula, considering edge cases, to get the number of gilded cells in that ring. Sum those cell counts up, and that's the total. I need to make sure my logic can accurately represent the shrinking rectangles, and specifically the edge cases of really small plates. I'm ready to translate this into Python now.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of gilded cells for `k` rings on a `w x h` plate. Each ring `i` (1-indexed) is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle of size `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`.\n\nLet's denote the dimensions of the inner rectangle for the `i`-th ring as `current_w` and `current_h`.\nSo, `current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)` and `current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)`.\n\nThe number of cells in the border of a rectangle with dimensions `W x H` depends on `W` and `H`:\n1.  If `W <= 0` or `H <= 0`, there are no cells, so the count is 0. This case is implicitly handled by the problem constraints on `k`, which ensure `current_w` and `current_h` remain positive.\n2.  If `W = 1` or `H = 1`, the entire rectangle forms the border. The number of cells is `W * H`.\n3.  If `W >= 2` and `H >= 2`, the border cells form the outer perimeter. The number of cells is `2 * W + 2 * H - 4`. This can also be expressed as `W * H - (W - 2) * (H - 2)`.\n\nWe need to iterate from `i = 1` to `k`, calculate `current_w` and `current_h` for each `i`, find the number of gilded cells for that ring, and add it to a running total.\n\nLet's trace an example: `w=7, h=9, k=2`\n\n**For i = 1 (first ring):**\n`current_w = 7 - 4 * (1 - 1) = 7 - 0 = 7`\n`current_h = 9 - 4 * (1 - 1) = 9 - 0 = 9`\nSince `current_w = 7 >= 2` and `current_h = 9 >= 2`, we use the formula `2 * W + 2 * H - 4`.\nCells for ring 1 = `2 * 7 + 2 * 9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28`.\nTotal gilded cells = 28.\n\n**For i = 2 (second ring):**\n`current_w = 7 - 4 * (2 - 1) = 7 - 4 = 3`\n`current_h = 9 - 4 * (2 - 1) = 9 - 4 = 5`\nSince `current_w = 3 >= 2` and `current_h = 5 >= 2`, we use the formula `2 * W + 2 * H - 4`.\nCells for ring 2 = `2 * 3 + 2 * 5 - 4 = 6 + 10 - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12`.\nTotal gilded cells = 28 (from ring 1) + 12 (from ring 2) = 40.\n\nThe final answer for `w=7, h=9, k=2` is 40, which matches the example output.\n\nThe constraints `3 <= w, h <= 100` and `1 <= k <= floor((min(n, m) + 1) / 4)` ensure that `current_w` and `current_h` will always be at least 1 for all valid `i` up to `k`. Specifically, `min(current_w, current_h)` will be at least `min(w, h) - 4(k-1)`. The maximum value for `4(k-1)` is `4 * (floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) - 1)`. For example, if `min(w,h)=3`, `k=1`. `4(k-1)=0`. `min(w,h)-0 = 3`. If `min(w,h)=4`, `k=1`. `4(k-1)=0`. `min(w,h)-0 = 4`. If `min(w,h)=5`, `k=1`. `4(k-1)=0`. `min(w,h)-0 = 5`. If `min(w,h)=6`, `k=1`. `4(k-1)=0`. `min(w,h)-0 = 6`. If `min(w,h)=7`, `k=2`. `4(k-1)=4`. `min(w,h)-4 = 3`. In all cases, `min(current_w, current_h)` remains positive.\n\nThe solution involves a simple loop and arithmetic operations, making it very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    w, h, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    total_gilded_cells = 0\n\n    for i in range(k):\n        # Calculate dimensions for the i-th ring (0-indexed loop, so it's (i+1)-th ring)\n        # For the 1st ring (i=0), offset is 0\n        # For the 2nd ring (i=1), offset is 4\n        # For the (i+1)-th ring, offset is 4 * i\n        current_w = w - 4 * i\n        current_h = h - 4 * i\n\n        # Calculate cells for the current ring\n        # Based on problem constraints and k definition, current_w and current_h will always be >= 1.\n        # If current_w or current_h is 1, the entire rectangle is the border.\n        # Otherwise, it's 2*W + 2*H - 4.\n        if current_w == 1 or current_h == 1:\n            cells_in_ring = current_w * current_h\n        else:\n            cells_in_ring = 2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4\n        \n        total_gilded_cells += cells_in_ring\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(str(total_gilded_cells) + '\\n')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
