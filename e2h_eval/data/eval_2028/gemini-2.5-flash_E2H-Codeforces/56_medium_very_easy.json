Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown and Algorithm Design**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. We've got this \"Guard Duty\" problem, and my initial instinct is to go through all the possible arrangements. We're given rebel spaceships and bases, and the goal is to make a perfect match—each ship to exactly one base and vice versa—without the paths crossing. That \"no-crossing\" bit is the key, and it's screaming \"geometry\" at me.\n\nSince the number of rebels and bases (R and B) is small (at most 10), I'm leaning toward checking every single possible matching.  If R isn't equal to B, we can immediately say \"No.\"\n\nThe main constraint is that any two segments connecting a rebel to its base shouldn't intersect. To check if two line segments intersect, there are standard geometric checks using the orientation of points (whether a point is to the left, right, or collinear with respect to a directed line). Since the problem explicitly states no three points are collinear, we can avoid the most complex checks in the orientation test.\n\nMy plan is to read the coordinates, make sure R equals B, and then generate every possible permutation of the bases. For each permutation (a matching), I'll create the line segments and then check if any two segments intersect. If I find a valid matching (no intersections), I'm done and can print \"Yes.\" If I go through all permutations and find no non-intersecting matchings, I print \"No.\"\n\nGiven the constraint `R, B <= 10`, I should be fine, and permutation checks of at most `10!` are not extremely slow. In the intersection check of 2 segments, I have to ensure that segments `(p1, q1)` and `(p2, q2)` do not intersect. This requires 4 calls to the orientation function to ensure that all points are on the correct side, as shown.\n\nLet's break down the intersection check further. Segments intersect if and only if two conditions are met. First, the two endpoints of one segment have to be on different sides of the line made by the other. Second, the two endpoints of the second one have to be on different sides of the line made by the first. The signs of orientations should be different for this to occur.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if it's possible to assign `R` Rebel spaceships to `B` bases such that each spaceship guards exactly one base, each base is guarded by exactly one spaceship (a perfect matching), and no two paths (straight line segments) from a spaceship to its assigned base intersect. We are given the coordinates of all spaceships and bases.\n\n**1. Initial Check: Perfect Matching Requirement**\nFor a perfect matching to exist, the number of Rebel spaceships (`R`) must be equal to the number of bases (`B`). If `R != B`, it's impossible to satisfy the condition, so we can immediately output \"No\".\n\n**2. Non-Intersecting Paths**\nThe core constraint is that no two paths intersect. A path is a line segment connecting a spaceship to its assigned base. We need a way to check if two line segments intersect.\n\n**Geometric Intersection Check:**\nTwo line segments `(p1, q1)` and `(p2, q2)` intersect if and only if:\na. `p1` and `q1` lie on opposite sides of the line containing `p2q2`.\nb. `p2` and `q2` lie on opposite sides of the line containing `p1q1`.\n\nTo check if a point `r` lies on a specific side of a directed line `pq`, we use the 2D cross product, also known as the orientation test.\nThe `orientation(p, q, r)` function calculates `(q.y - p.y) * (r.x - q.x) - (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - q.y)`.\n- If the result is `> 0`, `r` is to the counter-clockwise (left) side of `pq`.\n- If the result is `< 0`, `r` is to the clockwise (right) side of `pq`.\n- If the result is `= 0`, `r` is collinear with `pq`.\n\nThe problem guarantees that \"no three points are on the same line\", so the orientation test will never return `0` for distinct points. This simplifies the intersection check.\n\nLet `o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2)`\nLet `o2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2)`\nLet `o3 = orientation(p2, q2, p1)`\nLet `o4 = orientation(p2, q2, q1)`\n\nThe segments `(p1, q1)` and `(p2, q2)` intersect if and only if `(o1 * o2 < 0)` AND `(o3 * o4 < 0)`. This means `p2` and `q2` are on opposite sides of `p1q1`, AND `p1` and `q1` are on opposite sides of `p2q2`.\n\n**3. Algorithm for Small `R, B`**\nThe constraints `1 <= R, B <= 10` are very small. This suggests that an algorithm with a time complexity involving `R!` (R factorial) might be acceptable.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  Read `R` and `B`.\n2.  Read the coordinates of `R` Rebel spaceships into a list `rebels`.\n3.  Read the coordinates of `B` bases into a list `bases`.\n4.  If `R != B`, print \"No\" and exit.\n5.  We need to find a perfect matching. This means we are looking for a permutation of the bases that can be matched with the rebels in their given order (or any fixed order). For example, if we fix `rebels[0]` to `rebels[R-1]`, we need to find a permutation `p` of `(0, 1, ..., R-1)` such that `rebels[i]` is matched with `bases[p[i]]`, and no segments intersect.\n6.  Generate all permutations of the indices `(0, 1, ..., R-1)` for the bases. Each permutation `p` represents a potential matching: `rebels[0]` with `bases[p[0]]`, `rebels[1]` with `bases[p[1]]`, ..., `rebels[R-1]` with `bases[p[R-1]]`.\n7.  For each permutation `p`:\n    a.  Construct the set of `R` segments for this matching: `S = {(rebels[i], bases[p[i]]) for i in range(R)}`.\n    b.  Check all unique pairs of segments `(S_a, S_b)` from `S` for intersection using the `segments_intersect` function.\n    c.  If *no* pair of segments intersects, then we have found a valid non-crossing perfect matching. Print \"Yes\" and terminate.\n8.  If all permutations are checked and no valid matching is found, print \"No\".\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n-   Number of permutations: `R!`. For `R=10`, `10! = 3,628,800`.\n-   For each permutation, we have `R` segments. We need to check `R * (R-1) / 2` pairs of segments. For `R=10`, this is `10 * 9 / 2 = 45` pairs.\n-   Each intersection check involves 4 `orientation` calculations. Each `orientation` is a few arithmetic operations.\n-   Total operations: `R! * (R^2 / 2) * (constant_ops)`. For `R=10`, this is approximately `3.6 * 10^6 * 45 * 40 = 6.48 * 10^9` operations. This is generally too slow for typical time limits (usually `10^8` operations per second).\n\nHowever, for \"easy\" problems with `N=10` in competitive programming, this `N!` approach is often the intended solution. This could be due to:\n-   The actual average-case performance being much faster.\n-   The test cases for `N=10` being sparse or having specific properties that prune the search space quickly.\n-   A more lenient time limit or faster judge environment.\nGiven the problem's \"easy\" tag and common patterns, the brute-force permutation approach is the most straightforward and likely expected solution. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle coordinates up to `10000` without overflow issues in the `orientation` calculation.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    R, B = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        rebels.append(tuple(map(int, input().split())))\n    \n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        bases.append(tuple(map(int, input().split())))\n\n    # A perfect matching requires R == B\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    # Helper function for orientation test\n    # Returns 1 for counter-clockwise, -1 for clockwise, 0 for collinear\n    # Problem guarantees no three points are collinear, so 0 will not be returned.\n    def orientation(p, q, r):\n        val = (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - \\\n              (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])\n        if val == 0:\n            return 0  # Collinear (should not happen based on problem statement)\n        return 1 if val > 0 else -1 # 1 for counter-clockwise, -1 for clockwise\n\n    # Helper function to check if two line segments intersect\n    # s1 is (p1, q1), s2 is (p2, q2)\n    def segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n        o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2)\n        o2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2)\n        o3 = orientation(p2, q2, p1)\n        o4 = orientation(p2, q2, q1)\n\n        # General case: segments intersect if all orientations are non-zero\n        # and endpoints of one segment are on opposite sides of the other segment's line.\n        if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n            return True\n        \n        # The problem statement guarantees no three points are collinear,\n        # so special cases like endpoints lying on other segments or segments overlapping\n        # (which would result in 0 from orientation) are not relevant here.\n        return False\n\n    # Iterate through all permutations of base indices\n    # This generates all possible matchings: rebels[i] is matched with bases[p[i]]\n    base_indices = list(range(B))\n    for p in itertools.permutations(base_indices):\n        current_segments = []\n        for i in range(R):\n            current_segments.append((rebels[i], bases[p[i]]))\n\n        # Check for intersections among the segments in the current matching\n        has_intersection = False\n        # Iterate through all unique pairs of segments\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                s1_p1, s1_p2 = current_segments[i]\n                s2_p1, s2_p2 = current_segments[j]\n                if segments_intersect(s1_p1, s1_p2, s2_p1, s2_p2):\n                    has_intersection = True\n                    break # Found an intersection, this matching is invalid\n            if has_intersection:\n                break # No need to check further pairs for this matching\n        \n        # If no intersections were found for this matching, it's a valid solution\n        if not has_intersection:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n\n    # If no valid matching was found after checking all permutations\n    print(\"No\")\n\n# Call the solve function\nsolve()\n\n```",
