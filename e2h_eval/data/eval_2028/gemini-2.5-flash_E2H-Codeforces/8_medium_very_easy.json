Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Game Plan for \"Flawed Flow\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm staring down this competitive programming problem, \"Flawed Flow\". It's about directing flow in an undirected graph to make it a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), while also maintaining flow conservation at all intermediate nodes. I've got this undirected graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges, each edge having a specific flow capacity. Vertex 1 is the source, and vertex `n` is the sink.  The rules are: no cycles, and the amount of flow entering each intermediate node (anything except 1 and `n`) must equal the amount of flow leaving it.\n\nI'm thinking, this \"no cycles\" thing is the big clue.  Since I need a DAG, there must be some topological ordering, which implies a natural flow direction from source to sink. The fact that a solution *always* exists is also a major hint; it means I don't have to worry about complex edge cases that would make this impossible.\n\nMy first thought is to calculate flow balance at each vertex. Let's call the net flow out of a vertex `balance[v]`.  For any intermediate vertex `v`, `balance[v]` needs to be 0 (flow in = flow out).  The source will have a positive `balance[1]` (all flow going out), and the sink will have a negative `balance[n]` (all flow coming in).\n\nNow, the classic trick to ensure no cycles in a flow network is to direct edges in a way that aligns with a topological order.  I'm envisioning a DFS (Depth First Search) from the source (vertex 1) that helps me create this topological order.\n\nSo here's what I'm going to try. I'll maintain a `current_balance[v]` for each vertex. It's initialized to 0. During my DFS traversal, when I encounter an edge `(u, v, c)`:\n\n1. **If `v` is unvisited:** Recursively call DFS on `v`. Then I'll use `v`'s `current_balance` value after recursion to determine the direction of the edge `(u,v)`\n2. **If `v` is visited** this will be a cross-edge. No matter whether the edge goes `u -> v` or `v->u`, it must be directed. I should ensure that these edges are directed in the manner that doesn't cause a cycle.\n\nThe key to balance: I will process edges in a DFS manner, the last edge processed to the vertex will have its direction decided based on how much flow the DFS has \"received\" in the other edges. This can be achieved because the \"total incident flow\" of intermediate vertices must be an even number. So for a node, once all but the last edge are decided the direction of the last edge must be determined by the previous edges.",
    "response": "The problem asks us to direct each edge of a given undirected graph, along with its associated flow volume, such that three conditions are met:\n1.  **Flow Conservation:** For any intermediate vertex `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), the sum of flow volumes of incoming edges equals the sum of flow volumes of outgoing edges.\n2.  **Source Condition:** Vertex 1 (the source) has no incoming edges.\n3.  **Acyclicity:** The resulting directed graph must not contain any cycles.\n\nWe are guaranteed that a solution always exists and the graph is connected.\n\nLet's analyze the flow conservation condition for an intermediate vertex `v` (1 < `v` < `n`). If `sum(incoming_flow)` = `sum(outgoing_flow)`, and `S_v` is the total sum of flow volumes of all edges incident to `v`, then `S_v = sum(incoming_flow) + sum(outgoing_flow) = 2 * sum(outgoing_flow)`. This implies that `S_v` must be an even number. We need to direct edges such that exactly `S_v / 2` flow exits `v` and `S_v / 2` flow enters `v`.\n\nFor the source (vertex 1), it must have no incoming edges. This means all flow on its incident edges must be outgoing.\nFor the sink (vertex `n`), although not explicitly stated, by flow conservation principle, all flow must eventually reach it, so it will have no outgoing edges.\n\nThe \"no cycles\" condition is very strong. A common technique to ensure acyclicity in problems involving directing edges in a graph is to use a Depth First Search (DFS). A DFS naturally builds a tree (or forest). If we direct all tree edges away from the source (or root of the DFS tree), and handle non-tree edges carefully, we can often avoid cycles.\n\nHere's a strategy using DFS:\n\n1.  **Precompute Total Incident Flow:** For each vertex `v`, calculate `total_incident_flow[v]`, which is the sum of flow volumes `c_i` for all edges incident to `v`. Store edges along with their original index.\n\n2.  **DFS Traversal:** Perform a DFS starting from vertex 1. We'll maintain a `current_balance[v]` for each vertex `v`, representing the net flow *out* of `v` from edges whose directions have already been decided. Initially, all `current_balance[v]` are 0. We also need a `visited` array to keep track of visited vertices and `ans` array to store the direction for each edge.\n\n    Let `dfs(u, parent)` be the DFS function:\n    *   Mark `u` as visited.\n    *   For each edge `(u, v, c, edge_idx)` incident to `u`:\n        *   If `v` is the `parent` of `u` in the DFS tree, skip this edge (it's the edge through which we arrived at `u`).\n        *   If `v` has already been `visited`: This is a cross-edge or a back-edge. To avoid cycles, we must direct it from `u` to `v` (since `u` was visited later than `v` or `u` is not an ancestor of `v`).\n            *   Set `ans[edge_idx] = 0` (direction `u -> v`).\n            *   Update `current_balance[u] += c` and `current_balance[v] -= c`.\n        *   If `v` has *not* been `visited`: This is a tree edge. Recursively call `dfs(v, u)`.\n            *   After `dfs(v, u)` returns, all edges incident to `v` *except* `(u, v)` have been processed, and `current_balance[v]` reflects the net flow from those edges.\n            *   Now, we need to decide the direction of `(u, v)` to satisfy `v`'s flow conservation.\n            *   **Case 1: `v` is an intermediate vertex (1 < `v` < `n`)**:\n                `v` needs `total_incident_flow[v] / 2` flow to go out.\n                If `current_balance[v]` (net flow out from its children) is less than `total_incident_flow[v] / 2`: `v` still needs to send `total_incident_flow[v] / 2 - current_balance[v]` flow out. This flow must come from the edge `(u, v)`. So, we direct `v -> u`.\n                    *   Set `ans[edge_idx] = 1` (direction `v -> u`).\n                    *   Update `current_balance[v] += c` and `current_balance[u] -= c`.\n                If `current_balance[v]` is greater than `total_incident_flow[v] / 2`: `v` has sent too much flow out; it needs to receive `current_balance[v] - total_incident_flow[v] / 2` flow. This flow must come from the edge `(u, v)`. So, we direct `u -> v`.\n                    *   Set `ans[edge_idx] = 0` (direction `u -> v`).\n                    *   Update `current_balance[u] += c` and `current_balance[v] -= c`.\n                (Note: The problem guarantees a solution, so `current_balance[v]` will never be exactly `total_incident_flow[v] / 2` at this point, unless `c=0`, which is not possible as `c >= 1`. The difference will always be `c` or `-c`.)\n            *   **Case 2: `v` is the sink (`v = n`)**:\n                The sink must only receive flow. All flow must be directed towards `n`. So, we direct `u -> v`.\n                    *   Set `ans[edge_idx] = 0` (direction `u -> v`).\n                    *   Update `current_balance[u] += c` and `current_balance[v] -= c`.\n                (The source `v=1` cannot be reached from `u` as a child in a DFS starting from 1, so this case for `v=1` is not needed here.)\n\n3.  **Output:** Print the directions stored in `ans`.\n\n**Why this works:**\n*   **Acyclicity:** The DFS approach naturally avoids cycles. Tree edges are directed away from the source. Cross-edges and back-edges are directed from an already visited node to another already visited node in a way that respects their discovery order, effectively preventing cycles. Specifically, if `u` is visited before `v`, and `(u,v)` is a non-tree edge, directing `u->v` is safe. Our DFS ensures that when we encounter `v` already visited, `v` is not an ancestor of `u` (otherwise it would be a back-edge to an ancestor, which would form a cycle if directed `u->v`). If we consistently direct `visited_node -> already_visited_node` for non-tree edges, it ensures acyclicity.\n*   **Flow Conservation (1 < `v` < `n`):** For any intermediate vertex `v`, when `dfs(v, u)` returns, `v` has processed all its children and its non-tree edges. The direction of the last edge `(u, v)` is chosen precisely to make `v`'s `current_balance` equal to `total_incident_flow[v] / 2` (net flow out), thus satisfying flow conservation.\n*   **Source Condition (`v = 1`):** Vertex 1 is the starting point of the DFS. It has no parent. All its incident edges will be either tree edges (directed `1 -> v`) or non-tree edges to already visited nodes (also directed `1 -> v` if `v` is not 1's ancestor). Thus, all flow from vertex 1 will be outgoing.\n*   **Sink Condition (`v = n`):** When `dfs(n, u)` returns, the edge `(u, n)` is directed `u -> n`. All other edges incident to `n` would have been directed `x -> n` because `n` is the sink. This ensures all flow is incoming to `n`.\n\n**Edge Case and Parity:**\nThe condition that `total_incident_flow[v]` must be even for `1 < v < n` is crucial. The problem statement guarantees a solution exists, implying this parity condition will always hold. The `current_balance[v]` will always be an integer, and the difference `total_incident_flow[v] / 2 - current_balance[v]` will always be an integer multiple of `c` (specifically, `c` or `-c` for the last edge).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the direction choice for `v=n` (sink). If `dfs(n, u)` returns, `current_balance[n]` reflects the sum of flows from its children. We need to direct `(u,n)` such that `n` has no outgoing flow. So, `u -> n` is the only option. This is simpler than using the `total_incident_flow[n]/2` logic.\n\nFinal refined strategy for `dfs(u, parent)`:\n`visited[u] = true`\nFor each edge `(u, v, c, edge_idx)`:\n  If `edge_idx` is already decided (e.g., if `v` processed this edge when `u` was its child, or `v` was already visited and `u` directed it earlier), continue.\n  If `v == parent`: continue.\n  If `visited[v]`: (cross-edge or back-edge)\n    // `v` was visited before `u` in the DFS tree, or it's a cross edge.\n    // Direct `u -> v` to prevent cycles.\n    `ans[edge_idx] = 0`\n    `current_balance[u] += c`\n    `current_balance[v] -= c`\n  Else (`v` not visited):\n    `dfs(v, u)`\n    // After `dfs(v, u)` returns, `v` has processed all its children and non-tree edges.\n    // Now, decide direction of `(u, v)` based on `v`'s balance.\n    If `v == n`: // `v` is the sink\n      `ans[edge_idx] = 0` // Must direct `u -> n`\n      `current_balance[u] += c`\n      `current_balance[v] -= c`\n    Else: // `v` is an intermediate node (1 < `v` < `n`)\n      If `current_balance[v] < total_incident_flow[v] / 2`:\n        `ans[edge_idx] = 1` // `v -> u`\n        `current_balance[v] += c`\n        `current_balance[u] -= c`\n      Else:\n        `ans[edge_idx] = 0` // `u -> v`\n        `current_balance[u] += c`\n        `current_balance[v] -= c`\n\nTo handle the \"edge_idx is already decided\" part, we can simply mark edges as `processed` or `directed` to ensure each edge is directed exactly once. A boolean array `edge_directed[edge_idx]` initialized to false would work.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    edges_input = []\n    total_incident_flow = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    for i in range(m):\n        u, v, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append((v, c, i))\n        adj[v].append((u, c, i))\n        edges_input.append((u, v, c))\n        total_incident_flow[u] += c\n        total_incident_flow[v] += c\n\n    ans = [0] * m\n    current_balance = [0] * (n + 1)\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    edge_directed = [False] * m\n\n    #
