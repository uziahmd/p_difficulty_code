You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the \"Replacing Digits\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem, \"Replacing Digits.\" The goal is to maximize the value of an integer `a`, given as a string, by replacing some of its digits with digits from another string `s`, also provided.  Each digit in `s` can only be used once.\n\nFirst, I need to really understand the problem. The input is `a` and `s`, both up to 10^5 characters long.  My task is to output the largest possible number I can make by replacing digits in `a` with those from `s`. I don't have to use all the digits in `s`.\n\nTo maximize a number, the most significant digits need to be as large as possible. So, my strategy has to focus on this left-to-right replacement. I'll scan through `a`, and for each digit, try to replace it with the largest available digit from `s` that's *greater* than the current digit in `a`.\n\nHere's my detailed plan:\n\n1.  **Input:** Read `a` and `s` as strings.\n2.  **Conversion:** Convert `a` to a list of characters (or bytearray, although I'll probably just use a list for simplicity).\n3.  **Sorting `s`:** Convert `s` into a list of integers and sort it in descending order. Since I want the *largest* possible replacement, sorting in descending order means I can just iterate through `s` and pick the first eligible digit.\n4.  **Iteration:** Iterate through the digits of `a` from left to right.\n5.  **Replacement Logic:** For each digit `a[i]`:\n    *   I need to check if any digit in `s` is greater than `a[i]`.\n    *   Since `s` is sorted, I can just iterate through `s` (or maintain an index) and pick the first digit in `s` which is greater.\n    *   If I find a suitable digit from `s`, I replace `a[i]` and mark that digit in `s` as used (by, for example, removing it or incrementing the index).\n    *   If no digit in `s` can replace it, I move on.\n6.  **Output:** After processing all digits in `a`, I join the modified list back into a string and print it.\n\nLet's do a quick example. If `a = \"1024\"` and `s = \"010\"`, `a` starts as a list `['1', '0', '2', '4']` and `s` as `['1', '0', '0']`. I can see that in the second iteration, the `0` of the second position is going to be replaced by the first element of `s` (the `1`), increasing my number to `1124`. The other digits in `a` cannot be improved so remain the same.\n\nThis seems like a solid plan.  I should now be able to translate this into Python code and get the right answer efficiently. Let's get to coding.\n",
