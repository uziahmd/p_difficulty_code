After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break this down for a Python solution.**\n\nMy goal here is to craft a script that solves this competitive programming problem efficiently. The core of the issue is identifying which students are \"successful\" based on their marks in different subjects.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input and the constraints. We have `n` students and `m` subjects, and the marks are single digits (1-9).  I'll store these marks in a convenient structure, probably a list of strings, so I can access individual marks easily as characters. The constraints (1 <= n, m <= 100) are pretty lenient, so I don't need to worry *too* much about optimization, though it is always good to strive for it.\n\nThe real challenge is figuring out who's \"best\" in each subject, and from that, who's \"successful\".  A student is best if no one else has a higher mark for that *specific* subject.  This suggests an algorithm where I iterate through each subject and determine the maximum mark achieved.  Then, I'll go back and identify the students who attained that maximum mark for that subject. If a student is the best in at least one subject, they are deemed successful.\n\nMy plan involves these steps:\n\n1.  Read in `n` and `m` from the first line of input.\n2.  Read in the marks into a list of strings, each string representing a student's marks.  `gradebook[i][j]` will be the mark of student `i` in subject `j`.\n3.  I'll use a boolean array `successful_students` of size `n`. Initialize all values to `False`.  This will store a flag to mark which students are successful.\n4.  Now, the crucial part: I'll iterate through each subject (`j`).\n    *   For each subject, I will find the maximum mark `max_mark_j` across all students.\n    *   Then, I'll iterate again through the students (`i`). If a student's mark `gradebook[i][j]` is equal to `max_mark_j`, I'll set `successful_students[i]` to `True`.\n5.  Finally, after iterating through all subjects, I'll simply count how many `True` values are in `successful_students`. That count is the final output.\n\nI think this approach is clean and directly reflects the problem description. No complex data structures are needed, just a straightforward nested loop logic.  I should be able to whip up the Python code for this pretty quickly. This is a classic example of a problem that becomes easy once you've visualized the correct algorithm!\n",
