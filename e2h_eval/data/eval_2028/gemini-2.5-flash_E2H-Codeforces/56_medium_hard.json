Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Plan for Solving the \"Guard Duty (easy)\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We need a Python script to tackle this competitive programming challenge.  The core of the problem involves assigning spaceships to bases (and vice-versa) in a way that the paths between them don't cross. The input gives us coordinates, and the small size of the input (`R` and `B` are 1 to 10) screams \"brute force might work!\"\n\nFirst thing's first: if the number of rebels (`R`) doesn't match the number of bases (`B`), it's an immediate \"No\" because a perfect, non-overlapping matching is impossible. We can immediately output \"No\" and be done.\n\nNow, the \"no intersection\" part. We're dealing with straight-line paths, and the key is checking if two line segments cross.  Fortunately, we're guaranteed that no three points are on the same line. That's a huge simplification! It means we can use a standard intersection check based on orientations: checking if two segments cross. No need to deal with collinear cases (which can occur if all segments connect distinct pairs of points).  Collinear means if `orientation(p,q,r) = 0`.  But this is taken care of by the problem constraints.\n\nWe'll use the cross product to determine the orientation of points. If `(p, q, r)` is counter-clockwise, the cross product is positive. If clockwise, it's negative. If collinear, it's zero. Because of the constraint, we can simplify intersection checks.\n\nOur main strategy is going to be: Generate *all* possible assignments, and for each of them check if any pair of line segments (paths) intersects. Because `R` is at most 10, the maximum number of assignments to check is 10! (which is a manageable 3,628,800). The `permutations` from the `itertools` library will be our friend for this.\n\nFor each permutation of base, for all pair of assigned segments, we'll check if any two segments intersect. The intersection check uses an orientation test. If any intersections are found, we discard that assignment and move on. If we get through *all* assignments without finding intersections, we've found a \"Yes\" answer and exit. If none work, we output \"No\".\n\nIn terms of code, we'll need a helper function for the orientation calculation. And another for our \"strict intersection\" check, where we use cross products. The `do_intersect` logic ensures that segments that share an endpoint don't register as intersecting. This avoids redundant checks by taking advantage of the \"no three points on the same line\" guarantee.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if it's possible to assign `R` Rebel spaceships to `B` bases such that each spaceship guards exactly one base, each base is guarded by exactly one spaceship (a perfect matching), and no two paths (straight lines from a base to its assigned spaceship) intersect. The number of spaceships and bases `R, B` are small (up to 10).\n\n**1. Basic Requirement: Perfect Matching**\nFor a perfect matching to exist where every item from one set is paired with exactly one item from another set, the sizes of the sets must be equal. Therefore, if `R != B`, it's impossible to form such an assignment, and we should output \"No\". If `R = B = 0`, it's an empty, valid assignment, so \"Yes\".\n\n**2. Geometric Constraint: Non-intersecting Paths**\nThe core of the problem is the non-intersection constraint. We need to find an assignment `(R_i, B_j)` such that for any two distinct pairs `(R_a, B_b)` and `(R_c, B_d)`, the line segments `R_a B_b` and `R_c B_d` do not intersect. The problem specifies \"do not intersect in the galaxy plane\", which typically means they should not strictly cross each other. They are allowed to share an endpoint.\n\nThe problem guarantees:\n*   No two points coincide.\n*   No three points are on the same line.\n\nThese guarantees simplify the intersection check significantly.\n*   \"No two points coincide\" means all given `R+B` points are distinct.\n*   \"No three points are on the same line\" means that if we pick any three distinct points from the input, they will not be collinear. This implies that the `orientation` function (described below) will never return 0 for three distinct points.\n\n**Intersection Test using Orientation:**\nTo check if two line segments `(p1, q1)` and `(p2, q2)` strictly intersect, we can use the concept of orientation (cross product).\nThe `orientation(p, q, r)` function determines the relative orientation of point `r` with respect to the directed line segment `pq`.\n*   If `orientation(p, q, r) > 0`, `r` is to the \"left\" (counter-clockwise) of `pq`.\n*   If `orientation(p, q, r) < 0`, `r` is to the \"right\" (clockwise) of `pq`.\n*   If `orientation(p, q, r) = 0`, `p, q, r` are collinear. (This case is ruled out for distinct points by the problem guarantee).\n\nTwo line segments `(p1, q1)` and `(p2, q2)` strictly intersect if and only if:\n1.  `p2` and `q2` lie on opposite sides of the line `p1q1`.\n2.  `p1` and `q1` lie on opposite sides of the line `p2q2`.\n\nMathematically, this translates to:\n`(orientation(p1, q1, p2) * orientation(p1, q1, q2) < 0)` AND\n`(orientation(p2, q2, p1) * orientation(p2, q2, q1) < 0)`\n\n**Handling Shared Endpoints:**\nWhat if the two segments share an endpoint, e.g., `q1 = p2`? Then `p1, q1, p2` are not distinct points. `orientation(p1, q1, p2)` becomes `orientation(p1, q1, q1)`, which evaluates to 0. In this case, the product `(orientation(p1, q1, p2) * orientation(p1, q1, q2))` will be 0, making the `< 0` condition false. This correctly identifies that segments sharing an endpoint do not strictly cross. Thus, the general strict intersection test works for all cases given the problem constraints.\n\n**Algorithm:**\nSince `R` and `B` are very small (up to 10), we can try all possible assignments.\n1.  Read `R` and `B`.\n2.  Read `R` spaceship coordinates into a list `rebels`.\n3.  Read `B` base coordinates into a list `bases`.\n4.  If `R != B`, print \"No\" and exit.\n5.  If `R == 0` (and `B == 0`), print \"Yes\" and exit.\n6.  Generate all permutations of the `bases` list. Each permutation represents a potential assignment: `rebels[i]` is assigned to `perm_bases[i]`. There are `R!` such permutations. For `R=10`, `10! = 3,628,800`, which is computationally feasible.\n7.  For each permutation `perm_bases`:\n    a.  Construct the list of `R` line segments: `(rebels[i], perm_bases[i])` for `i` from `0` to `R-1`.\n    b.  Assume no intersections (`has_intersection = False`).\n    c.  Iterate through all unique pairs of these segments `(seg_i, seg_j)` where `i < j`.\n    d.  For each pair, use the `do_intersect` function to check if they strictly intersect.\n    e.  If an intersection is found, set `has_intersection = True` and break out of the inner loops (this permutation is invalid).\n    f.  If, after checking all pairs, `has_intersection` is still `False`, then this permutation is a valid non-intersecting assignment. Print \"Yes\" and exit.\n8.  If all permutations are checked and none result in a valid assignment, print \"No\".\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n*   Points can be represented as tuples `(x, y)`.\n*   The `itertools.permutations` function is useful for generating permutations.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Helper function to read a point (x, y) from stdin\ndef read_point():\n    x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    return (x, y)\n\n# Function to calculate orientation of ordered triplet (p, q, r)\n# Returns:\n# > 0 if p, q, r are in counter-clockwise order\n# < 0 if p, q, r are in clockwise order\n# = 0 if p, q, r are collinear (guaranteed not to happen for distinct points in this problem)\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # Calculate cross product (q-p) x (r-q)\n    # (q.x - p.x)(r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y)(r.x - p.x)\n    val = (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - \\\n          (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])\n    return val\n\n# Function to check if segment (p1, q1) and segment (p2, q2) strictly intersect\ndef do_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n    # Calculate the 4 orientations\n    o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2)\n    o2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2)\n    o3 = orientation(p2, q2, p1)\n    o4 = orientation(p2, q2, q1)\n\n    # General case: segments strictly intersect if p2, q2 are on opposite sides of p1q1\n    # AND p1, q1 are on opposite sides of p2q2.\n    # The problem guarantees \"no three points are on the same line\", so orientations will never be 0\n    # for distinct points.
