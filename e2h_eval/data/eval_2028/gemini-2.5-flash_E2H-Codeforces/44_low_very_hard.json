He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through \"Polycarp's Practice\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Polycarp's Practice\" problem, and I need to come up with a Python solution. The core of it seems pretty straightforward once you break it down. We're given problem difficulties, the number of days, and we need to maximize Polycarp's total profit – which is the sum of the maximum difficulty solved on each day.\n\nMy initial thought is to look for the optimal strategy to maximize the profit. And it becomes clear pretty quickly that to get the highest sum, I need to pick the largest problem difficulties possible as daily maximums. We are essentially selecting the largest possible values for each of the `k` days.\n\nSo, the strategy emerges: first, identify the `k` largest problem difficulties. These become my \"target\" maximums for each of the `k` days. The total profit is then the sum of these `k` difficulties.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how to divide the problems across the `k` days. I'm thinking I'll need to figure out the starting and ending indices of problems for each day. How do I make sure that each of my 'target' difficulties is included in its own day and is the maximum of that day?\n\nFinding the `k` largest difficulties and their sum seems simple enough. I can create a list of (difficulty, index) pairs, sort it in descending order by difficulty, and then take the first `k` elements. I then can sum the difficulties to get the maximum profit. I'll need to remember the original indices, because these indices tell me where those critical problems are in the original list.\n\nNow, how to divide it into `k` contiguous segments? I know where these \"critical\" problems are, because I remember their original index in the input array. That index provides me with a splitting point.\n\nI could loop through the sorted problems, starting from the end (biggest difficulty). For each of the `k` selected problems, I could add the difficulty to the total profit and define the segments in a loop, from highest to lowest difficulty. This seems like a reasonable approach.\n",
    "response": "To maximize the total profit, we should choose the `k` largest problem difficulties from the entire list `a`. The sum of these `k` largest difficulties will be the maximum possible total profit. This is because each of these `k` values can be assigned as the maximum for one of the `k` days. If we pick any other set of `k` maximums, their sum would be less than or equal to the sum of the `k` overall largest values.\n\nOnce we have identified the `k` largest difficulties, we need to determine the day breaks. We want each of these `k` largest difficulties to be the maximum in one of the `k` segments (days). To achieve this, we can make a day break immediately after each problem that corresponds to one of these `k` largest difficulties.\n\nHere's the detailed plan:\n1.  **Find the `k` largest difficulties:**\n    *   Create a list of tuples `(difficulty, original_index)` for all problems.\n    *   Sort this list in descending order based on difficulty.\n    *   Take the first `k` elements from this sorted list. These are the `k` largest difficulties.\n    *   Calculate their sum, which is our maximum total profit.\n    *   Collect their original indices. Let these be `critical_indices`.\n2.  **Determine day breaks:**\n    *   Sort `critical_indices` in ascending order. These indices mark the *end* of the segments that contain the `k` largest problems.\n    *   The first day will end at `critical_indices[0]`. The number of problems solved on day 1 is `critical_indices[0] + 1`.\n    *   The second day will end at `critical_indices[1]`. The number of problems solved on day 2 is `critical_indices[1] - critical_indices[0]`.\n    *   In general, for day `j` (1-indexed, `j > 1`), it ends at `critical_indices[j-1]`. The number of problems solved on day `j` is `critical_indices[j-1] - critical_indices[j-2]`.\n    *   The last day (`k`-th day) will end at `critical_indices[k-1]`. Since all `n` problems must be solved, and `critical_indices[k-1]` is the index of the `k`-th largest problem in the original array, the problems from `critical_indices[k-2] + 1` up to `n-1` must be solved on the last day. The number of problems solved on the last day will be `n - (critical_indices[k-2] + 1)`.\n\n    A simpler way to calculate segment lengths:\n    *   `t_1 = critical_indices[0] + 1`\n    *   For `j` from `1` to `k-2`: `t_{j+1} = critical_indices[j] - critical_indices[j-1]`\n    *   `t_k = n - critical_indices[k-2]` (This ensures all remaining problems are assigned to the last day).\n\nLet's walk through an example: `n = 8, k = 3, a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n\n1.  **Problems with indices:**\n    `[(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`\n2.  **Sort by difficulty (descending) and take top `k=3`:**\n    `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)]` (or `(5,4)` could be chosen instead of `(5,0)`, it doesn't matter for the sum)\n    *   Maximum total profit: `9 + 6 + 5 = 20`.\n    *   `critical_indices`: `[6, 3, 0]`\n3.  **Sort `critical_indices`:** `[0, 3, 6]`\n4.  **Calculate `t_j` values:**\n    *   `t_1 = critical_indices[0] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`\n    *   `t_2 = critical_indices[1] - critical_indices[0] = 3 - 0 = 3`\n    *   `t_3 = n - critical_indices[1] = 8 - 3 = 5`\n    *   This gives `[1, 3, 5]`. The segments would be `[5]`, `[4, 2, 6]`, `[5, 1, 9, 2]`. Profits: `5, 6, 9`. Total: `20`. This is a valid solution.\n\n    The example output `3 2 3` implies a different choice of `critical_indices` or a slightly different strategy.\n    Let's re-examine the example output: `[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]`.\n    The maximums are `5` (from `a[0]`), `6` (from `a[3]`), `9` (from `a[6]`).\n    The indices of these maximums are `0, 3, 6`. These are indeed the indices of the 3 largest values.\n    The day breaks are after index 2, and after index 4.\n    The segments end at index 2, index 4, and index 7.\n    The indices of the *critical problems* (the ones that are the maximum for their day) are `0, 3, 6`.\n    The day lengths are:\n    *   Day 1: `a[0], a[1], a[2]` (length 3). Max is `a[0]=5`.\n    *   Day 2: `a[3], a[4]` (length 2). Max is `a[3]=6`.\n    *   Day 3: `a[5], a[6], a[7]` (length 3). Max is `a[6]=9`.\n\n    The key is that the `k` largest values *must* be the maximums of their respective days.\n    If we choose the indices `0, 3, 6` as the *critical points* that define the day maximums, we need to ensure each falls within a segment and is its maximum.\n    The strategy of making a cut *after* each critical index (except the last one) is more robust.\n    Let `sorted_critical_indices` be `[idx_1, idx_2, ..., idx_k]`.\n    The cuts will be at `idx_1`, `idx_2`, ..., `idx_{k-1}`.\n    *   Day 1 problems: `a[0]` to `a[idx_1]`. Length `idx_1 + 1`.\n    *   Day 2 problems: `a[idx_1+1]` to `a[idx_2]`. Length `idx_2 - (idx_1+1) + 1 = idx_2 - idx_1`.\n    *   ...\n    *   Day `k` problems: `a[idx_{k-1}+1]` to `a[n-1]`. Length `(n-1) - (idx_{k-1}+1) + 1 = n - (idx_{k-1}+1)`.\n\n    Let's re-apply with `critical_indices = [0, 3, 6]` (sorted):\n    *   `t_1 = critical_indices[0] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`. (Problems `a[0]`)\n    *   `t_2 = critical_indices[1] - critical_indices[0] = 3 - 0 = 3`. (Problems `a[1]` to `a[3]`)\n    *   `t_3 = n - (critical_indices[1] + 1) = 8 - (3 + 1) = 4`. (Problems `a[4]` to `a[7]`)\n    This gives `[1, 3, 4]`. Segments: `[5]`, `[4, 2, 6]`, `[5, 1, 9, 2]`. Profits: `5, 6, 9`. Total: `20`. This is also a valid solution and matches the maximum profit.\n\n    The example output `3 2 3` is also valid. This means the problems are `[5, 4, 2]`, `[6, 5]`, `[1, 9, 2]`.\n    Here, the breaks are after index 2, and after index 4.\n    The critical problems are `a[0]=5`, `a[3]=6`, `a[6]=9`.\n    Notice that `a[0]` is in the first segment `[5, 4, 2]`, `a[3]` is in the second `[6, 5]`, and `a[6]` is in the third `[1, 9, 2]`.\n    The strategy of making cuts *after* `k-1` of the `k` critical indices works.\n    The example output `3 2 3` means the cuts are after `a[2]` and after `a[4]`.\n    The indices where cuts are made are `2` and `4`.\n    These are not necessarily the critical indices themselves.\n    The critical indices are `0, 3, 6`.\n    The indices where cuts are made (`2, 4`) must be chosen such that each of `0, 3, 6` falls into a different segment.\n    The simplest way to guarantee this is to make a cut *after* each of the first `k-1` sorted `critical_indices`.\n    This yields `[1, 3, 4]` as calculated above.\n\n    Let's re-evaluate the example output `3 2 3`.\n    It implies `t_1 = 3`, `t_2 = 2`, `t_3 = 3`.\n    The cuts are at `t_1-1 = 2` and `t_1+t_2-1 = 3+2-1=4`.\n    So, the cut points are indices `2` and `4`.\n    Our `critical_indices` are `0, 3, 6`.\n    *   Segment 1: `a[0]...a[2]`. Contains `a[0]`. Max is `a[0]=5`.\n    *   Segment 2: `a[3]...a[4]`. Contains `a[3]`. Max is `a[3]=6`.\n    *   Segment 3: `a[5]...a[7]`. Contains `a[6]`. Max is `a[6]=9`.\n    This also works. The problem says \"If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\"\n\n    My simplified strategy:\n    1. Find `k` largest difficulties and their original indices.\n    2. Sort these `k` original indices: `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{k-1}`.\n    3. The lengths of the segments will be:\n        *   `t_1 = p_0 + 1`\n        *   `t_2 = p_1 - p_0`\n        *   ...\n        *   `t_{k-1} = p_{k-2} - p_{k-3}`\n        *   `t_k = n - p_{k-1}` (This is the crucial part: the last segment takes all remaining problems from `p_{k-1}` up to `n-1`).\n\n    Let's apply this strategy to `n = 8, k = 3, a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`.\n    `k` largest difficulties: `9, 6, 5`.\n    Their original indices: `6, 3, 0`.\n    Sorted indices `p`: `[0, 3, 6]`.\n    `t_1 = p[0] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n    `t_2 = p[1] - p[0] = 3 - 0 = 3`.\n    `t_3 = n - p[2] = 8 - 6 = 2`.\n    This yields `[1, 3, 2]`.\n    Segments: `[5]`, `[4, 2, 6]`, `[5, 1, 9, 2]`.\n    Wait, `t_3 = n - p[2]` means the last segment starts at `p[2]` and goes to `n-1`.\n    This is incorrect. `t_k` should be `n - (p_{k-1})`.\n    Let's check `sum(t_i)`: `1 + 3 + 2 = 6`, not `n=8`.\n\n    The correct logic for segment lengths `t_j` with `k-1` cuts:\n    The cuts are made *after* the indices `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{k-2}`.\n    *   Day 1: problems `a[0]` to `a[p_0]`. Length `p_0 + 1`.\n    *   Day 2: problems `a[p_0+1]` to `a[p_1]`. Length `p_1 - (p_0+1) + 1 = p_1 - p_0`.\n    *   ...\n    *   Day `k-1`: problems `a[p_{k-3}+1]` to `a[p_{k-2}]`. Length `p_{k-2} - p_{k-3}`.\n    *   Day `k`: problems `a[p_{k-2}+1]` to `a[n-1]`. Length `(n-1) - (p_{k-2}+1) + 1 = n - (p_{k-2} + 1)`.\n\n    Applying this to `p = [0, 3, 6]` for `n=8, k=3`:\n    `p_0 = 0`, `p_1 = 3`, `p_2 = 6`.\n    *   `t_1 = p_0 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n    *   `t_2 = p_1 - p_0 = 3 - 0 = 3`.\n    *   `t_3 = n - (p_1 + 1) = 8 - (3 + 1) = 4`.\n    This gives `[1, 3, 4]`. Sum is `1+3+4=8=n`.\n    This is a valid distribution: `[5]`, `[4, 2, 6]`, `[5, 1, 9, 2]`. Maxes `5, 6, 9`. Total `20`.\n\n    This strategy is simple and correct. It ensures each of the `k` largest problems is the maximum of its day.\n    The first problem `a[p_0]` is the max of day 1.\n    The problem `a[p_1]` is the max of day 2.\n    ...\n    The problem `a[p_{k-1}]` is the max of day `k`.\n    Because `p_0 < p_1 < ... < p_{k-1}`, each `a[p_i]` will be in a distinct segment.\n    Since `a[p_i]` is one of the `k` largest values, and all other problems in its segment are either smaller or equal to one of the `k` largest (and thus smaller or equal to `a[p_i]` if `a[p_i]` is the largest in its segment), this ensures `a[p_i]` is the maximum.\n\nLet's test with `n=4, k=2, a=[1, 2000, 2000, 2]`.\n1.  Problems with indices: `[(1,0), (2000,1), (2000,2), (2,3)]`\n2.  Top `k=2` difficulties: `2000, 2000`. Sum = `4000`.\n    Their indices: `1, 2`.\n3.  Sorted `critical_indices` `p`: `[1, 2]`.\n    `p_0 = 1`, `p_1 = 2`.\n4.  Calculate `t_j`:\n    *   `t_1 = p_0 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    *   `t_2 = n - (p_0 + 1) = 4 - (1 + 1) = 2`. (Note: `p_0` is `p_{k-2}` when `k=2`)\n    This yields `[2, 2]`. Sum is `2+2=4=n`.\n    Segments: `[1, 2000]`, `[2000, 2]`. Maxes `2000, 2000`. Total `4000`. This matches the example output.\n\nThis strategy seems correct and robust.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Step 1: Find the k largest difficulties and their original indices\n    # Store as (difficulty, original_index) tuples\n    indexed_problems = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        indexed_problems.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Sort by difficulty in descending order\n    indexed_problems.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)\n\n    # Take the top k problems\n    top_k_problems = indexed_problems[:k]\n\n    # Calculate maximum total profit\n    max_total_profit = sum(p[0] for p in top_k_problems)\n\n    # Get the original indices of these k problems\n    critical_indices = sorted([p[1] for p in top_k_problems])\n\n    # Step 2: Determine day breaks (lengths of segments)\n    # The cuts will be made after the first k-1 critical problems.\n    # The last critical problem will be part of the last day's segment.\n    \n    t_values = []\n    current_start_index = 0\n\n    for i in range(k - 1):\n        # The current day ends at critical_indices[i]\n        # So, the number of problems for this day is (critical_indices[i] - current_start_index + 1)\n        day_length = critical_indices[i] - current_start_index + 1\n        t_values.append(day_length)\n        current_start_index = critical_indices[i] + 1\n    \n    # The last day takes all remaining problems\n    # It starts from current_start_index up to n-1\n    last_day_length = n - current_start_index\n    t_values.append(last_day_length)\n\n    sys.stdout.write(str(max_total_profit) + \"\\n\")\n    sys.stdout.write(\" \".join(map(str, t_values)) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
