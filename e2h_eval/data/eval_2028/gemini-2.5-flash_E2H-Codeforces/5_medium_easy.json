Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**The Plan to Conquer Colored Boots**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're facing the \"Colored Boots\" problem, aiming to maximize compatible pairs of boots. Sounds like a classic greedy approach is the way to go here. The core idea is to prioritize the *strongest* matches first: specific colors matching exactly. These are the most restrictive. If we don't grab those right away, we might lose our chance!\n\nSo, the game plan is:\n\n1.  **Data Structures:** Create dictionaries to store indices of boots for each color (including the wildcard '?'). We'll have `left_indices` and `right_indices`.\n2.  **Greedy Phase 1: Specific-to-Specific:** Iterate through each specific color and greedily match left and right boots of that exact color. Use `pop()` to ensure we're not re-using indices.\n3.  **Greedy Phase 2: Specific to '?':** This is the refined phase. If specific boots are still unmatched, let them use the '?' boots for max pairs. If some `L_C` boots remain and `R_?` boots exist, match them. Then, if `R_C` boots exist, match them with `L_?` boots. We need to be careful with the order; to maximize pairs, use the `?` boots where they can serve a specific boot.\n4.  **Greedy Phase 3: '?'-to-'?':** If any `?` boots are still unmatched, match them up.\n\nThat's the core. The critical part is that greedy matching, prioritizing the specific to specific, then to \"?\", then \"?\" to \"?\". The order of `c` doesn't matter since all boots of the same color are equivalent. This should give us the optimal solution because we're prioritizing the most restrictive matches first. I'll test it out to ensure it functions.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. A boot can be part of at most one pair. Compatibility rules are:\n1. Two specific colors (lowercase Latin letters) are compatible if they are exactly the same (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2. An indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any specific or indefinite color (e.g., '?' and 'z', 'a' and '?', '?' and '?').\n\nTo maximize the number of pairs, we should use a greedy strategy. The core idea is to prioritize matches that are more restrictive or have fewer alternatives. This leaves the more flexible boots (especially those with '?' colors) available to fill in gaps for boots that are harder to match.\n\nWe can categorize matches into three types based on restrictiveness:\n1. **Specific color - Specific color (same color):** These are the most restrictive. An 'a' boot can only strictly match another 'a' boot. If it doesn't find one, its only other option is to match a '?' boot.\n2. **Specific color - Indefinite color ('?'):** These are less restrictive. A specific color boot ('a') matches a '?' boot. The '?' boot could have matched any specific color or another '?' boot.\n3. **Indefinite color ('?') - Indefinite color ('?'):** These are the least restrictive. A '?' boot can match any other '?' boot.\n\nBased on this, the greedy strategy will be:\n\n**Step 1: Store boot indices by color.**\nWe'll create a dictionary (or list of lists) for left boots and another for right boots. Each key will be a color ('a' through 'z', plus '?'), and the value will be a list of 1-indexed indices of boots with that color.\n\nExample:\n`left_indices['a'] = [idx1, idx2, ...]`\n`right_indices['?'] = [idxA, idxB, ...]`\n\n**Step 2: Match specific colors with the exact same specific color.**\nIterate through each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z'. While there are available left boots of color `c` AND available right boots of color `c`, form a pair. This uses up the most restrictive matches first.\n`l_idx = left_indices[c].pop()`\n`r_idx = right_indices[c].pop()`\nAdd `(l_idx, r_idx)` to our `pairs` list.\n\n**Step 3: Match remaining specific colors with indefinite colors ('?').**\nAfter Step 2, any remaining specific color boots could not find an exact match. Their only remaining option is to match a '?' boot. We also have remaining '?' boots.\nWe need to be careful here because the pools of `left_indices['?']` and `right_indices['?']` are global and can be used by any specific color.\nIterate through each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z':\n  a. Match remaining `left_indices[c]` with available `right_indices['?']`.\n     While `left_indices[c]` is not empty AND `right_indices['?']` is not empty, form a pair.\n     `l_idx = left_indices[c].pop()`\n     `r_idx = right_indices['?'].pop()`\n     Add `(l_idx, r_idx)` to `pairs`.\n  b. Match remaining `right_indices[c]` with available `left_indices['?']`.\n     While `right_indices[c]` is not empty AND `left_indices['?']` is not empty, form a pair.\n     `l_idx = left_indices['?'].pop()`\n     `r_idx = right_indices[c].pop()`\n     Add `(l_idx, r_idx)` to `pairs`.\n\nThe order of `a` and `b` within Step 3 (i.e., whether we prioritize left-specific-right-question or left-question-right-specific) does not affect the total number of pairs, because '?' boots are fungible. The important thing is that these specific boots are matched with '?' boots before '?' boots are matched with other '?' boots.\n\n**Step 4: Match remaining indefinite colors ('?') with other indefinite colors ('?').**\nAfter Step 3, all specific color boots have been matched (either with an exact specific color or a '?') or are unmatched because no compatible boot was available. The only boots left are '?' boots.\nWhile `left_indices['?']` is not empty AND `right_indices['?']` is not empty, form a pair.\n`l_idx = left_indices['?'].pop()`\n`r_idx = right_indices['?'].pop()`\nAdd `(l_idx, r_idx)` to `pairs`.\n\nThis greedy strategy ensures that the most constrained matches are made first, preserving the flexibility of '?' boots for as long as possible. This leads to the maximum number of pairs.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- `n` can be up to 150,000, so an `O(N)` or `O(N log N)` solution is required. Using lists and `pop()` operations (which are `O(1)` for the end of the list) for each color category will be efficient enough, as there are only 27 categories ('a'-'z' and '?'). The total number of `pop()` operations will not exceed `2N`.\n- We'll use `collections.defaultdict(list)` for convenience to store indices.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Step 1: Store boot indices by color.\n    # Using defaultdict(list) makes it easy to append to lists that might not exist yet.\n    left_indices = defaultdict(list)\n    right_indices = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        left_indices[l_str[i]].append(i + 1) # 1-indexed\n        right_indices[r_str[i]].append(i + 1) # 1-indexed\n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Step 2: Match specific colors with the exact same specific color.\n    # Iterate through all lowercase Latin letters.\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        char = chr(char_code)\n        while left_indices[char] and right_indices[char]:\n            l_idx = left_indices[char].pop()\n            r_idx = right_indices[char].pop()\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Step 3: Match remaining specific colors with indefinite colors ('?').\n    # First, match left specific boots with right '?' boots.\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        char = chr(char_code)\n        while left_indices[char] and right_indices['?']:\n            l_idx = left_indices[char].pop()\n            r_idx = right_indices['?'].pop()\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n    \n    # Then, match left '?' boots with right specific boots.\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        char = chr(char_code)\n        while left_indices['?'] and right_indices[char]:\n            l_idx = left_indices['?'].pop()\n            r_idx = right_indices[char].pop()\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Step 4: Match remaining indefinite colors ('?') with other indefinite colors ('?').\n    while left_indices['?'] and right_indices['?']:\n        l_idx = left_indices['?'].pop()\n        r_idx = right_indices['?'].pop()\n        pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Output the result\n    sys.stdout.write(str(len(pairs)) + '\\n')\n    for l_idx, r_idx in pairs:\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"{l_idx} {r_idx}\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
