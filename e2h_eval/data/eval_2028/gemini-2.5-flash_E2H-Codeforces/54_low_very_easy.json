Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem staring me down. The goal is to find three distinct vertices (v1, v2, v3) on a regular n-gon where the angle v1-v2-v3 is as close as possible to a target angle 'a'.  I need to output the indices of these vertices.\n\nMy initial thought is to leverage the geometry of regular polygons and circumcircles. I know that all vertices of a regular n-gon lie on a circumcircle, and the angle formed by three vertices (an inscribed angle) is half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc.  I figure, if I can efficiently determine the arc length between two vertices given a fixed third vertex, I can calculate the corresponding angle.\n\nLet's simplify things by fixing v2 to be vertex 1 (without loss of generality, we can apply this logic to all vertices).  Then I'm left to find v1 and v3. Let's call them vertex i and vertex k. The key lies in understanding how the 'arc length' between i and k (excluding vertex 1) relates to the angle we want.\n\nI need to work with indices.  Let's assume vertices are numbered from 0 to n-1.  If v2 is vertex 0, v1 is vertex i, and v3 is vertex k, the angle i-0-k is determined by the arc length between i and k, not containing 0.\n\nSo, if n=4, and the vertices are 0,1,2,3...\n- v2 is 0.\n- if v1=1 and v3=2, the angle 1-0-2 has an arc length 1 segment. Angle = 1 * (360/n) / 2\n- if v1=1 and v3=3, the angle 1-0-3 has an arc length 2 segments. Angle = 2 * (360/n) / 2\n- if v1=2 and v3=3, the angle 2-0-3 has an arc length 1 segment. Angle = 1 * (360/n) / 2\n\nI think, the number of edges from the arc could be computed using some kind of modulus operation to handle indices correctly, which wraps around the vertices of the polygon.\n\nI'm starting to see a structure here. I need to iterate through possible combinations of vertices i and k, calculate the angle based on their separation, and keep track of the combination that yields the angle closest to 'a'.  This needs to be implemented efficiently in Python.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular convex n-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (with `v2` as the vertex) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. We need to print `v1, v2, v3`.\n\nAll vertices of a regular convex n-gon lie on a circumcircle. An angle formed by three vertices of the polygon, say `v1-v2-v3`, is an inscribed angle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.\n\nLet the vertices of the n-gon be numbered `1, 2, ..., n` in clockwise order.\nWithout loss of generality, let's fix the vertex `v2` to be vertex `2`.\nThen `v1` must be vertex `1` (or any other vertex, but choosing `1` simplifies the relative indexing).\nNow, `v3` must be a vertex distinct from `v1` and `v2`. So `v3` can be any vertex from `3` to `n`.\n\nLet `v2` be vertex `2`, `v1` be vertex `1`.\nIf `v3` is vertex `k` (where `k` ranges from `3` to `n`), the angle `1-2-k` is formed.\nThe arc `1-k` (the one not containing `2`) determines the angle.\nThe number of segments (edges of the polygon) in the arc `1-k` (not containing `2`) is `k - 1 - 1 = k - 2`.\nEach segment of the n-gon subtends a central angle of `360/n` degrees.\nSo, the central angle subtended by the arc `1-k` is `(k - 2) * (360/n)` degrees.\nThe inscribed angle `1-2-k` is half of this central angle:\n`Angle(1-2-k) = (k - 2) * (360/n) / 2 = (k - 2) * (180/n)` degrees.\n\nLet `m = k - 2`. As `k` ranges from `3` to `n`, `m` ranges from `1` to `n - 2`.\nSo, the possible angles are `m * (180/n)` for `m = 1, 2, ..., n - 2`.\nThe smallest possible angle is `1 * (180/n)` (when `v3` is `3`, `m=1`).\nThe largest possible angle is `(n - 2) * (180/n)` (when `v3` is `n`, `m=n-2`). This is the internal angle of the regular n-gon.\n\nWe need to find an `m` (from `1` to `n-2`) such that `|m * (180/n) - a|` is minimized.\nLet `unit_angle = 180/n`.\nWe are looking for `m` that minimizes `|m * unit_angle - a|`.\nThis is equivalent to minimizing `|m - a / unit_angle|`.\nLet `target_m_float = a / unit_angle`.\nWe need to find an integer `m` in the range `[1, n-2]` that is closest to `target_m_float`.\n\nThere are two candidate integer values for `m`: `floor(target_m_float)` and `ceil(target_m_float)`.\nLet `m1 = floor(target_m_float)` and `m2 = ceil(target_m_float)`.\nWe need to check which of these, when clamped to the range `[1, n-2]`, gives the minimum difference.\n\n1. **Calculate `unit_angle = 180 / n`.**\n2. **Calculate `target_m_float = a / unit_angle`.**\n3. **Consider candidate `m` values:**\n   - `m_cand1 = floor(target_m_float)`\n   - `m_cand2 = ceil(target_m_float)`\n4. **Initialize `min_diff` to infinity and `best_m` to -1.**\n5. **For each candidate `m_val` (i.e., `m_cand1` and `m_cand2`):**\n   - Ensure `m_val` is within the valid range `[1, n-2]`.\n     - If `m_val < 1`, skip or consider `m_val = 1`.\n     - If `m_val > n-2`, skip or consider `m_val = n-2`.\n     - A simpler approach is to check `m_val` against `1` and `n-2` and calculate the difference only if it's in range.\n     - For `m_val = 1`, `diff = abs(1 * unit_angle - a)`.\n     - For `m_val = n-2`, `diff = abs((n-2) * unit_angle - a)`.\n     - For `m_val = floor(target_m_float)`: if `1 <= m_val <= n-2`, calculate `diff = abs(m_val * unit_angle - a)`. If this `diff` is less than `min_diff`, update `min_diff = diff` and `best_m = m_val`.\n     - For `m_val = ceil(target_m_float)`: if `1 <= m_val <= n-2`, calculate `diff = abs(m_val * unit_angle - a)`. If this `diff` is less than `min_diff`, update `min_diff = diff` and `best_m = m_val`. If `diff` is equal to `min_diff`, any `best_m` is fine.\n\nA more robust way to handle the range `[1, n-2]` and `floor/ceil` candidates:\n- Consider `m = 1`. Calculate `diff1 = abs(1 * unit_angle - a)`.\n- Consider `m = n-2`. Calculate `diff2 = abs((n-2) * unit_angle - a)`.\n- Consider `m_floor = int(target_m_float)`. If `1 <= m_floor <= n-2`, calculate `diff_floor = abs(m_floor * unit_angle - a)`.\n- Consider `m_ceil = int(target_m_float + 0.99999999999)`. (This is a common way to implement `ceil` for positive floats, or `math.ceil` can be used). If `1 <= m_ceil <= n-2`, calculate `diff_ceil = abs(m_ceil * unit_angle - a)`.\n\nCompare `diff1`, `diff2`, `diff_floor`, `diff_ceil` (only for valid `m` values) and pick the `m` that gives the minimum absolute difference. If multiple `m` values give the same minimum difference, any of them is acceptable.\n\nLet's refine the selection of `best_m`:\nInitialize `best_m = 1`. `min_diff = abs(1 * unit_angle - a)`.\n\nCandidate `m` values to check:\n1. `m_floor = int(target_m_float)`\n2. `m_ceil = m_floor + 1` (if `target_m_float` is not an integer, otherwise `m_ceil = m_floor`)\n   It's safer to use `math.floor` and `math.ceil`.\n\n`m_floor_val = math.floor(target_m_float)`\n`m_ceil_val = math.ceil(target_m_float)`\n\nCheck `m_floor_val`:\nIf `m_floor_val >= 1` and `m_floor_val <= n-2`:\n  `current_diff = abs(m_floor_val * unit_angle - a)`\n  If `current_diff < min_diff`:\n    `min_diff = current_diff`\n    `best_m = m_floor_val`\n\nCheck `m_ceil_val`:\nIf `m_ceil_val >= 1` and `m_ceil_val <= n-2`:\n  `current_diff = abs(m_ceil_val * unit_angle - a)`\n  If `current_diff < min_diff`:\n    `min_diff = current_diff`\n    `best_m = m_ceil_val`\n  # If current_diff == min_diff, we can keep the existing best_m or update it.\n  # The problem states \"any of them\", so we don't need to worry about ties beyond picking one.\n\nAfter finding the `best_m`, the vertices are:\n`v1 = 1`\n`v2 = 2`\n`v3 = best_m + 2`\n\nExample: n=4, a=67\n`unit_angle = 180/4 = 45`\n`target_m_float = 67 / 45 = 1.488...`\n\n`m_floor_val = 1`\n`m_ceil_val = 2`\n\nValid range for `m`: `[1, n-2] = [1, 4-2] = [1, 2]`. Both `1` and `2` are in range.\n\nCheck `m = 1`:\n`angle = 1 * 45 = 45`\n`diff = abs(45 - 67) = 22`\n`best_m = 1`, `min_diff = 22`\n\nCheck `m = 2`:\n`angle = 2 * 45 = 90`\n`diff = abs(90 - 67) = 23`\n`23` is not less than `22`, so `best_m` remains `1`.\n\nResult: `best_m = 1`.\n`v1 = 1`, `v2 = 2`, `v3 = 1 + 2 = 3`. Output: `1 2 3`.\nThis matches the example output `2 1 3` (just a permutation, which is fine). My choice of `v1=1, v2=2` is arbitrary. The example output uses `v2=1`, `v1=2`, `v3=3`. The angle `2-1-3` corresponds to `m=1` (arc length 1 segment).\n\nExample: n=4, a=68\n`unit_angle = 45`\n`target_m_float = 68 / 45 = 1.511...`\n\n`m_floor_val = 1`\n`m_ceil_val = 2`\n\nValid range for `m`: `[1, 2]`.\n\nCheck `m = 1`:\n`angle = 1 * 45 = 45`\n`diff = abs(45 - 68) = 23`\n`best_m = 1`, `min_diff = 23`\n\nCheck `m = 2`:\n`angle = 2 * 45 = 90`\n`diff = abs(90 - 68) = 22`\n`22` is less than `23`, so `best_m` updates to `2`. `min_diff = 22`.\n\nResult: `best_m = 2`.\n`v1 = 1`, `v2 = 2`, `v3 = 2 + 2 = 4`. Output: `1 2 4`.\nThis matches the example output `4 1 2` (again, a permutation). My choice of `v1=1, v2=2` means the angle is `1-2-4`. The example output uses `v2=1`, `v1=4`, `v3=2`. The angle `4-1-2` corresponds to `m=2` (arc length 2 segments).\n\nThe logic seems sound.\nUse `float` for calculations involving `unit_angle` and `a` to maintain precision.\n`math.floor` and `math.ceil` are useful.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # The possible angles are m * (180/n) for m = 1, 2, ..., n-2.\n    # Let v2 be vertex 2.\n    # Let v1 be vertex 1.\n    # Let v3 be vertex k, where k ranges from 3 to n.\n    # The number of segments in the arc (1, k) not containing 2 is (k - 1) - 1 = k - 2.\n    # So, m = k - 2.
