Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for Optimal Angle in a Regular N-gon**\n\nAlright, here's how I'm tackling this. The core is finding three vertices of a regular n-gon that form an angle closest to a given value, `a`.  I'm using the properties of inscribed angles and the central angle theorem. My plan is this:\n\n1. **Calculate the Angle Unit:** Figure out the basic angular increment for the n-gon, `angle_unit = 180.0 / n`.\n\n2. **Estimate the Optimal K:**  I need to find a 'k' value (number of segments defining the arc for the desired angle) that leads to the best result.  I can estimate the ideal 'k' using  `k_ideal = n * a / 180.0`. This gives a theoretical floating point value.  Since `k` must be an integer within the range `1` to `n-2` (inclusive), I will get two integer candidates by taking the floor and ceiling of `k_ideal`:  `k_cand1 = floor(k_ideal)` and `k_cand2 = ceil(k_ideal)`. This provides a significant speed-up over brute-force.\n\n3. **Check Valid Candidates:**  I only consider a candidate if it's within the valid range.\n\n4. **Iterative Evaluation**: I am initializing `best_k = 1` and `min_diff` to the difference from using a `k` of 1. For each valid candidate, I calculate `current_angle = k * angle_unit` and `current_diff = abs(current_angle - a)`.  I pick as the `best_k` whichever creates the minimum difference.  If there is a tie, I will select the smaller `best_k`.\n\n5. **Vertex Selection:** Once the optimal 'k' is found, setting `v2` as vertex `1`, `v1` is automatically `2`, and the most efficient way to assign `v3` is as  `2 + best_k`. I make sure to account for cases where `2 + best_k` equals to `n + 1`, and then `v3` will simply be `n`.\n\nThis method efficiently determines the set of vertices that achieve the closest possible angle to the target. It's a clean, direct solution!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (with `v2` as the vertex of the angle) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The vertices are numbered from 1 to `n` in clockwise order.\n\n**Understanding Angles in a Regular Polygon**\n\nAll vertices of a regular `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle. An angle formed by three vertices `v1, v2, v3` is an inscribed angle in this circumcircle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.\n\nLet's fix `v2` as one of the vertices. For simplicity, let `v2` be vertex 1.\nLet `v1` be vertex `i` and `v3` be vertex `j`. The angle `i-1-j` subtends the arc `i-j` (the arc that does not contain vertex 1).\nThe entire circle is divided into `n` equal elementary arcs by the vertices. Each elementary arc subtends a central angle of `360/n` degrees.\nIf the arc `i-j` consists of `k` elementary arcs, then the central angle subtended by `i-j` is `k * (360/n)` degrees.\nThe inscribed angle `i-1-j` is half of this central angle: `k * (360/n) / 2 = k * (180/n)` degrees.\n\n**Possible Values for `k`**\n\nThe number of elementary arcs `k` must be at least 1 (to form a non-degenerate angle).\nWhat is the maximum possible value for `k`?\nIf `v2` is vertex 1, the other two vertices `v1` and `v3` must be distinct from `v2` and from each other.\nConsider `v1` to be vertex 2. Then `v3` can be any vertex from 3 to `n`.\nIf `v3` is vertex 3, the arc `2-3` (not containing 1) consists of 1 elementary arc. The angle is `1 * (180/n)`. So `k=1`.\nIf `v3` is vertex `n`, the arc `2-n` (not containing 1) consists of `n-2` elementary arcs (`2-3`, `3-4`, ..., `(n-1)-n`). The angle is `(n-2) * (180/n)`. So `k=n-2`.\nThis `(n-2) * (180/n)` is indeed the internal angle of a regular `n`-gon.\n\nThus, the possible values for `k` are integers from `1` to `n-2`.\nThe possible angles are `k * (180/n)` for `k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n-2\\}$.\n\n**Finding the Optimal `k`**\n\nWe need to find `k` such that `|k * (180/n) - a|` is minimized.\nLet `angle_unit = 180.0 / n`. We want to minimize `|k * angle_unit - a|`.\nThis is equivalent to finding `k` such that `k * angle_unit` is closest to `a`.\nWe can rewrite this as finding `k` such that `k` is closest to `a / angle_unit`.\nLet `k_ideal = a / angle_unit = a / (180.0 / n) = (a * n) / 180.0`.\n\nThe optimal integer `k` must be one of `floor(k_ideal)` or `ceil(k_ideal)`, provided these values are within the valid range `[1, n-2]`.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Calculate `angle_unit = 180.0 / n`.\n2. Calculate `k_ideal = (a * n) / 180.0`.\n3. Initialize `min_diff = float('inf')` and `best_k = -1`.\n4. Consider two candidate values for `k`: `k_cand1 = floor(k_ideal)` and `k_cand2 = ceil(k_ideal)`.\n5. For each candidate `k_val` (from `k_cand1` and `k_cand2`):\n   a. Check if `k_val` is within the valid range `[1, n-2]`.\n   b. If it is, calculate `current_angle = k_val * angle_unit`.\n   c. Calculate `current_diff = abs(current_angle - a)`.\n   d. If `current_diff < min_diff`:\n      `min_diff = current_diff`\n      `best_k = k_val`\n   e. If `current_diff == min_diff` (to handle ties, any optimal solution is fine, but we can pick the smallest `k` for consistency):\n      `best_k = min(best_k, k_val)`\n   (Note: if `k_ideal` is an integer, `k_cand1` and `k_cand2` will be the same, so `k_cand2` will be skipped in the loop if we only process distinct candidates, or the second check will just update `best_k` to itself.)\n6. If after checking `k_cand1` and `k_cand2`, `best_k` is still `-1` (which can happen if `n-2 < 1`, i.e., `n=2`, but `n>=3` is given), it means no valid `k` was found. However, for `n >= 3`, `n-2 >= 1`, so `k=1` is always a valid candidate. We can initialize `best_k = 1` and `min_diff = abs(1 * angle_unit - a)` to ensure a starting point.\n\n**Constructing the Output Vertices**\n\nOnce `best_k` is found, we need to output `v1, v2, v3`.\nWe can consistently choose:\n`v2 = 1`\n`v1 = 2`\n`v3 = 2 + best_k`\n\nLet's check if `v1, v2, v3` are distinct and valid:\n- `v2 = 1`\n- `v1 = 2`\n- `best_k` is in `[1, n-2]`.\n- So `v3 = 2 + best_k` will be in `[2+1, 2+(n-2)] = [3, n]`.\n- This means `v3` will always be distinct from `v1=2` and `v2=1`.\n- `v3` will also be within the range `[1, n]`.\n\nSo, the output vertices are `2`, `1`, `2 + best_k`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=4, a=68)**\n\n1. `n=4, a=68`.\n2. `angle_unit = 180.0 / 4 = 45.0`.\n3. `k_ideal = (68 * 4) / 180.0 = 272 / 180.0 = 1.511...`.\n4. Valid range for `k` is `[1, n-2] = [1, 2]`.\n5. Initialize `best_k = 1`, `min_diff = abs(1 * 45.0 - 68) = abs(45 - 68) = 23`.\n6. Candidate `k_cand1 = floor(1.511...) = 1`.\n   a. `k_val = 1` is in `[1, 2]`.\n   b. `current_angle = 1 * 45.0 = 45.0`.\n   c. `current_diff = abs(45.0 - 68) = 23.0`.\n   d. `current_diff == min_diff`. Keep `best_k = 1`.\n7. Candidate `k_cand2 = ceil(1.511...) = 2`.\n   a. `k_val = 2` is in `[1, 2]`.\n   b. `current_angle = 2 * 45.0 = 90.0`.\n   c. `current_diff = abs(90.0 - 68) = 22.0`.\n   d. `current_diff < min_diff` (22 < 23).\n      `min_diff = 22.0`.\n      `best_k = 2`.\n8. Final `best_k = 2`.\n9. Output `v1=2, v2=1, v3=2+best_k = 2+2=4`.\n   Result: `2 1 4`. (This matches one of the sample's correct answers, `4 1 2` is equivalent).\n\nThis `O(1)` approach is efficient and handles all constraints.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, input().split())\n\n    angle_unit = 180.0 / n\n\n    # The ideal k value (not necessarily an integer)\n    k_ideal = (a * n) / 180.0\n\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = -1\n\n    # Candidate k values are floor(k_ideal) and ceil(k_ideal)\n    # We must also ensure k is within the valid range [1, n-2]\n    candidate_k_values = []\n    \n    k_floor = math.floor(k_ideal)\n    if 1 <= k_floor <= n - 2:\n        candidate_k_values.append(int(k_floor))\n\n    k_ceil = math.ceil(k_ideal)\n    if 1 <= k_ceil <= n - 2 and k_ceil != k_floor: # Avoid duplicate check if k_ideal is an integer\n        candidate_k_values.append(int(k_ceil))\n\n    # For edge cases where k_ideal is outside the [1, n-2] range, \n    # the closest valid k would be 1 or n-2.\n    # We must ensure at least one valid k is considered.\n    # Since n >= 3, n-2 >= 1, so k=1 is always a valid angle.\n    # k=1 represents the smallest possible angle (180/n).\n    # k=n-2 represents the largest possible angle ((n-2)*180/n), which is the internal angle of the polygon.\n    \n    # If candidate_k_values is empty, it means k_ideal was outside [1, n-2]\n    # In such cases, the closest valid k would be 1 or n-2.\n    if not candidate_k_values:\n        if k_ideal < 1: # Target angle is very small, closest is k=1\n            candidate_k_values.append(1)\n        elif k_ideal > n - 2: # Target angle is very large, closest is k=n-2\n            candidate_k_values.append(n - 2)\n        # If n=3, n-2=1. k_ideal can be 1.0. floor and ceil are both 1.\n        # If k_ideal is exactly 1.0, k_floor=1, k_ceil=1. candidate_k_values will contain [1].\n        # If k_ideal is exactly n-2.0, k_floor=n-2, k_ceil=n-2. candidate_k_values will contain [n-2].\n        # The above logic correctly handles these.
