The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Rock-Paper-Scissors Loss Calculation**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to figure out how many times Nikephoros and Polycarpus lose in a Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The core of the problem is determining the losses, which are denoted as red spots.\n\nMy initial thought is to break this down. We have the game rules (rock beats scissors, etc.), the cyclic strategies of the players (Nikephoros and Polycarpus repeating sequences), and the number of rounds. The output will be the number of losses for each player.\n\nIf the number of rounds, *n*, were small, I could just simulate the game round by round. I'd have a loop that goes through each round, determines the moves, and figures out the winner/loser, incrementing the respective loss counter. But, *n* can be as big as 2 * 10^9, so that's obviously not going to work, and it would be very slow! We need a much more efficient approach.\n\nSince the strategies are cyclic, I'm thinking modular arithmetic will be key. Nikephoros's moves repeat every *m* rounds, and Polycarpus's every *k* rounds. The combined pattern of moves will repeat every least common multiple of *m* and *k*, or `lcm(m, k)`.  Given the constraints that *m* and *k* are at most 1000, the least common multiple won't be too large, at most a million. This is great, because I can work with that cycle length!\n\nHere's my refined plan:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Losses within a Cycle:** First, I'll figure out the cycle length, *L*, as the least common multiple of *m* and *k*. Then, I'll simulate *L* rounds, tracking the number of losses for both Nikephoros and Polycarpus within that cycle. I'll store these as `nike_losses_cycle` and `poly_losses_cycle`.\n2.  **Calculate Losses from Full Cycles:** Next, I'll divide the total number of rounds, *n*, by the cycle length, *L*, to figure out how many full cycles are present: `num_full_cycles`. Then, I'll multiply that number by the losses per cycle for each player to get the losses from these complete cycles.\n3.  **Calculate Losses from Remaining Rounds:** Finally, I'll determine the remainder from the division ( `remaining_rounds = n % L`). I will then simulate the game for these remaining rounds and add those losses to the totals.\n\nI need a helper function to decide the winner/loser of a single round. I will call it, something like `get_result(move1, move2)`. It takes the moves of each player and returns the result (winner, or draw, or the losing player). I'll need to encode the game rules inside this function.\n\nThis way, I avoid the computationally expensive loop for very large *n* values and instead focus on repeated patterns and the cycles within the game! This should be efficient and accurate.\n",
