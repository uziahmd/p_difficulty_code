Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Boot Pairing Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem, and my immediate goal is to write a Python script to find the maximum number of compatible boot pairs. The core of this hinges on matching left and right boots based on their colors, and there are some specific rules around compatibility, particularly with the wildcard character '?'.\n\nHere's the problem as I see it: I've got `n` left boots and `n` right boots, represented by strings `l` and `r`, with each character denoting a color. Colors are lowercase Latin letters or '?'.  A pair is compatible if their colors match (same letter) or if one or both are '?'. I need to find the largest set of pairs, ensuring each boot is used only once. And the output should be the number of pairs, plus the pairs themselves.\n\nMy intuition screams \"greedy matching.\" The compatibility rules suggest a clear order of precedence for matching: exact matches are most restrictive, followed by matches with '?', and finally, '?' with '?'. It's usually a good bet to go for the most restrictive matches first, to avoid missing out on more optimal pairings down the line. I should prioritize picking the concrete matches.\n\nThe structure needed feels pretty obvious: I should create lists or, more likely, dictionaries, to store the indices of boots for each color. Something like `left_boots` and `right_boots` where the keys are colors and the values are lists of boot indices. Initialize with all lowercase letters 'a' to 'z' and the '?' character as keys.\n\nI'm thinking I'll start by collecting all the boot indices into these dictionaries:\n\n```python\nleft_boots = {char: [] for char in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz?'}\nright_boots = {char: [] for char in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz?'}\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    left_boots[l[i]].append(i + 1)\n    right_boots[r[i]].append(i + 1)\n```\n\nNow, the greedy part. I'll go through the exact matches first, the most restrictive, focusing on matching up boots with the same specific color.  This will be my Step 1.\n\n```python\npairs = []\nfor char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n    char = chr(char_code)\n    while left_boots[char] and right_boots[char]:\n        pairs.append((left_boots[char].pop(), right_boots[char].pop()))\n```\n\nAfter doing the exact matches, there might be boots left with a specific color on one side but not on the other. That makes Step 2.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs and print them. Compatibility rules are:\n1.  Two specific colors `c1`, `c2` are compatible if `c1 == c2`.\n2.  A question mark `'?'` is compatible with any color (specific or another `'?'`).\n\nWe need to maximize the number of pairs, with each boot used at most once. This is a classic greedy matching problem. To maximize pairs, we should prioritize matches that are most restrictive, as they have fewer alternatives.\n\nThe hierarchy of restrictiveness is:\n1.  **Exact specific color matches (`c`, `c`):** These are the most restrictive. A left boot of color `c` can only match a right boot of color `c` if we want an exact specific match.\n2.  **Specific color with question mark matches (`c`, `?`) or (`?`, `c`):** Less restrictive than exact matches. A `c` boot can match a `?` boot. A `?` boot can match a `c` boot.\n3.  **Question mark with question mark matches (`?`, `?`):** Least restrictive. A `?` boot can match another `?` boot.\n\nBased on this hierarchy, the optimal greedy strategy is to process matches in this order:\n\n1.  **Match specific colors with the same specific color:** Iterate through all specific colors ('a' through 'z'). For each color `c`, match as many left boots of color `c` with right boots of color `c` as possible.\n    *   Example: `l_c` left boots of color `c`, `r_c` right boots of color `c`. We make `min(l_c, r_c)` pairs.\n\n2.  **Match remaining specific colors with question marks:** After step 1, some specific color boots might remain (e.g., more left 'a' boots than right 'a' boots). Also, all question mark boots are still available.\n    *   For each specific color `c`, if there are remaining left boots of color `c`, match them with available right '?' boots.\n    *   Similarly, if there are remaining right boots of color `c`, match them with available left '?' boots.\n\n3.  **Match remaining question marks with question marks:** After step 2, any remaining left '?' boots can be matched with any remaining right '?' boots.\n\nTo implement this efficiently, we can store the indices of boots for each color in separate lists. A dictionary mapping colors to lists of indices is suitable.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   Create `left_boots` and `right_boots` dictionaries. Keys will be specific colors ('a'-'z') and '?', and values will be lists of 1-indexed original indices.\n    *   Populate these dictionaries by iterating through the input strings `l` and `r`.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Exact Specific Color Matches (`c`, `c`)**\n    *   Initialize an empty list `pairs` to store the results.\n    *   Iterate through each character `c` from 'a' to 'z'.\n    *   While there are available left boots of color `c` AND available right boots of color `c`:\n        *   Pop an index from `left_boots[c]` and an index from `right_boots[c]`.\n        *   Add this pair `(left_idx, right_idx)` to `pairs`.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Specific Color with Question Mark Matches (`c`, `?`) and (`?`, `c`)**\n    *   Iterate through each character `c` from 'a' to 'z'.\n    *   **Match remaining left `c` with right `?`:**\n        *   While there are available left boots of color `c` AND available right '?' boots:\n            *   Pop an index from `left_boots[c]` and an index from `right_boots['?']`.\n            *   Add this pair `(left_idx, right_idx)` to `pairs`.\n    *   **Match remaining right `c` with left `?`:**\n        *   While there are available left '?' boots AND available right boots of color `c`:\n            *   Pop an index from `left_boots['?']` and an index from `right_boots[c]`.\n            *   Add this pair `(left_idx, right_idx)` to `pairs`.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Question Mark with Question Mark Matches (`?`, `?`)**\n    *   While there are available left '?' boots AND available right '?' boots:\n        *   Pop an index from `left_boots['?']` and an index from `right_boots['?']`.\n        *   Add this pair `(left_idx, right_idx)` to `pairs`.\n\n5.  **Output:**\n    *   Print the total number of pairs (`len(pairs)`).\n    *   Print each pair `(a_j, b_j)` on a new line.\n\nThis greedy strategy works because:\n*   Exact specific matches (`c`, `c`) are the most constrained. Using a `c` boot for an exact match prevents it from being used with a `?` boot, but this is fine because a `?` boot could potentially match any other `c` boot, or another `?` boot. Prioritizing exact matches ensures we don't waste `?` boots on specific colors that could have been matched exactly.\n*   Matching specific colors with `?` boots next is also optimal. A specific color `c` boot can only be matched with another `c` boot or a `?` boot. Since we've exhausted `c`-`c` matches, the only option for a remaining `c` boot is a `?` boot. Using a `?` boot for a `c` boot is better than leaving the `c` boot unmatched.\n*   Finally, matching `?` with `?` uses up the remaining most flexible boots.\n\nThe use of `list.pop()` is efficient for removing elements and ensures that each boot is used at most once.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store indices of boots for each color\n    # Using dictionaries where keys are colors and values are lists of 1-indexed indices\n    left_boots = {char: [] for char in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz?'}\n    right_boots = {char: [] for char in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz?'}\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        left_boots[l_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n        right_boots[r_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Step 1: Match specific colors with the same specific color ('c', 'c')\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        char = chr(char_code)\n        while left_boots[char] and right_boots[char]:\n            pairs.append((left_boots[char].pop(), right_boots[char].pop()))\n\n    # Step 2: Match remaining specific colors with question marks ('c', '?') or ('?', 'c')\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        char = chr(char_code)\n        # Match left 'c' with right '?'\n        while left_boots[char] and right_boots['?']:\n            pairs.append((left_boots[char].pop(), right_boots['?'].pop()))\n        # Match left '?' with right 'c'\n        while left_boots['?'] and right_boots[char]:\n            pairs.append((left_boots['?'].pop(), right_boots[char].pop()))\n\n    # Step 3: Match remaining question marks with question marks ('?', '?')\n    while left_boots['?'] and right_boots['?']:\n        pairs.append((left_boots['?'].pop(), right_boots['?'].pop()))\n\n    # Output results\n    sys.stdout.write(str(len(pairs)) + '\\n')\n    for l_idx, r_idx in pairs:\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"{l_idx} {r_idx}\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
