The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem...**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to figure out the total number of \"gilded\" cells on a rectangular plate. The input parameters are the plate's width (`w`), height (`h`), and the number of rings (`k`).  Each ring essentially represents a border around an inner rectangle, and I have a clear definition of how those inner rectangle's dimensions shrink with each ring.\n\nI understand the core idea: calculate the perimeter of each ring's inner rectangle and sum those perimeters for all `k` rings. Each ring is just a single cell wide, so the number of cells in the ring will be the perimeter of its corresponding inner rectangle.\n\nI've broken down the problem:\n\n1.  **Ring Definition:** The *i*-th ring has an inner rectangle with width and height calculated as `w_i = w - 4(i - 1)` and `h_i = h - 4(i - 1)`.\n\n2.  **Perimeter Calculation:**  The number of cells in the *i*-th ring is `2 * (w_i + h_i - 2)`. This formula comes from the fact that we can count the top and bottom borders which are `w_i` cells each, the left and right borders which are `h_i - 2` cells each and sum.\n\n3.  **Summation:**  I need to iterate from `i = 1` to `k` and sum up the perimeter calculation for each ring.\n\nThe problem also gives me this constraint on `k`: `1 <= k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)`. This is important, it helps me make sure my rings are valid. I need to make sure the inner rectangle still has at least a width of 3 and height of 3 because of the ring definition, so I need to limit the number of rings.\n\nThinking about it geometrically: the rings are *distinct* – they don't overlap. Each ring is one cell wide, so I am counting all the border cells on each ring's inner rectangle.\n\nMy approach will be: I can write a loop from 1 to *k* and within each loop, I compute `w_i` and `h_i`, calculate the ring's perimeter using my formula, and add it to a running total. Finally, I'll return the total number of cells.\n",
