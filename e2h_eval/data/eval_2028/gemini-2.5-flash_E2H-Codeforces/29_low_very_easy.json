            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Substitutes in Number\n\nAndrew and Eugene are playing a game. Initially, Andrew has string s, consisting of digits. Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Substitutes in Number Problem - My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Substitutes in Number\" problem, and here's my line of thinking: I need a Python script to handle this efficiently. The challenge is clear: we can't just build the giant final string after all the substitutions because the length can explode exponentially. Direct string manipulation will be a performance nightmare.\n\nThe core idea I'm latching onto is to avoid that explicit string construction.  Instead, I need to work directly with the numerical value, keeping track of things modulo 1000000007 (that's MOD).\n\nHere's my initial plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the problem:** We start with a string `s` of digits, and we get `n` queries, each a replacement rule \"di -> ti\".  We need to apply all these rules sequentially and then calculate the resulting number modulo MOD.\n\n2.  **The key insight:**  Instead of building the string step by step, I'll need to calculate the contribution of each original digit in `s` to the final sum. Think about it: if we have a number like \"123\", it's really `1 * 10^2 + 2 * 10^1 + 3 * 10^0`.  When a substitution happens, it *changes* the \"value\" of that digit (e.g., if \"2\" becomes \"00\", then the contribution of the '2' changes).\n\n3.  **Substitution propagation:**  Each substitution rule will change not just the digit directly substituted but also the digits that come after it (because the overall number length changes). So, I'll need a way to track the \"length effect\" that each substitution has. If I replace a digit with a longer string, it shifts the position of all following digits.\n\n4.  **Keeping track of \"10^P\":** I'll need to know the power of 10 that each digit contributes to the final number. This will change with each substitution!  Since we're dealing with modulo, I'll have to use modular exponentiation to keep those values manageable.\n\n5.  **Avoid intermediate strings:** I'll *have* to avoid building huge strings. I'll probably store the substitution rules in some kind of dictionary or mapping, maybe something like `replacements = {digit: string}`.\n\nSo, the high-level algorithm is forming in my mind: iterate through the original string, calculate the contribution of each digit to the final answer (taking substitutions into account), and keep everything modulo MOD. It looks like a dynamic programming approach might be helpful, but I'll see how it goes.  I'm ready to start sketching out the code!\n",
