Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the \"Valera and X\" Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this \"Valera and X\" problem. It's a classic competitive programming challenge. I need a Python script to determine if a given grid forms an \"X\" shape based on specific rules. Let's break down my thought process.\n\nFirst, I need to fully understand the problem's core requirements.  I'm given an `n x n` grid filled with lowercase letters, and `n` is an odd number. The grid needs to follow three key rules:\n\n1.  All letters along both diagonals must be identical.\n2.  All letters *not* on the diagonals must be identical.\n3.  The letter on the diagonals must be different from the letter outside the diagonals.\n\nThe input will consist of the grid's size `n`, followed by `n` lines, each representing a row in the grid. My output should be \"YES\" if the grid conforms to these \"X\" rules and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nI looked at the example and it helped me to fully understand the logic. For `n = 5`, the diagonals include the cells where the row index equals the column index (main diagonal) and where the row index plus the column index equals `n - 1` (anti-diagonal).  I can see that cells like (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) and (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0) are the diagonal cells.\n\nNow, my strategy is clear. I'll read the input grid. I'll need to define what makes a cell a diagonal cell.  I will then compare the characters, as per my observations. I have to determine the character on the diagonals.  Then, I need to check all non-diagonal cells to make sure they are the same and different from the diagonal character.  If any rule is broken, the answer is \"NO\"; otherwise, it's \"YES.\"  I'm ready to translate this into a Python script.\n",
