String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**The Problem of Beautiful Strings**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. I'm tasked with writing a Python script to count \"beautiful strings.\" A beautiful string has to meet a few conditions: it consists of only '0's and '1's, has a specific number of each ('n' zeros and 'm' ones), and, after some modifications, reduces to a single character 'g'. The modification is the interesting bit - you take the last two characters of the string and replace them with a single character based on their values.\n\nThis modification operation... it's like a binary operation. I've worked it out, and it's equivalent to `NOT (x OR y)`, which is also the same as `(1-x) AND (1-y)`. I'll call this operation `op(x, y)`. The order of application is important - it goes from right to left, replacing the last two characters in each step. I've also figured out this: If there's any '1' in the string, the final result will most likely be '0'.\n\nLet's say the final string value is `val(s)`. To get `val(s)`, I'm going to have to apply the operation repeatedly from right to left: `val(s_1 s_2 ... s_k) = val(s_1 ... s_{k-2} op(s_{k-1}, s_k))`. This becomes `op(c_1, op(c_2, ..., op(c_{L-1}, c_L)...))`.\n\nNow, if the goal, `g`, is 1. That's `val(s)=1`. Then, the very last operation must result to 1: `op(x, y) = 1` which is when we have `x=0, y=0`. So string needs to end with 00. And we have to check how the proceeding elements of the string results to 0.\n\nI need to analyze the specific cases where either n or m are 0. So, I will define `m=0`, all strings are composed of only zeros. If `n=1`, `val(s)=0`; if `n>1`, and is even, `val(s)=1` otherwise 0. If `n=0`, all strings are composed of ones, so if `m=1`, then `val(s)=1` otherwise `val(s)=0`. This should allow me to formulate any possible edge-case.\n\nIf n and m are both greater than 0, then if there's any '1', I'm betting the answer will be '0'. I need to consider that the result depends on where the '1' is. So, let's say the rightmost '1' has index k, then all of the characters after k are zeros.  I need to check for this and analyze `val(s)`. If the '1' is rightmost, `X_L =1`, and `val(s)` will depend on all the preceding characters.\n\nThe core of the problem seems to be efficiently calculating this repeated `op` operation, especially for the general case with both zeros and ones. I'll probably end up using dynamic programming of some sort to avoid redundant calculations. And I'll need to remember all the edge cases and how the position of '1' determines the value of the string.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of binary strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones such that after a sequence of modifications, the string reduces to a single character `g`. The modification operation is: replace the two last characters `xy` with `z`, where `z=1` if `xy=\"00\"`, and `z=0` otherwise. This operation is equivalent to `z = NOT(x OR y)`. The operation is applied repeatedly until the string has length 1.\n\nLet's denote the final character of a string `s = c_1 c_2 ... c_L` as `val(s)`.\nThe modification rule \"replace two last characters\" means `val(c_1 ... c_L) = val(c_1 ... c_{L-2} op(c_{L-1}, c_L))`.\nThis implies that `val(c_1 ... c_L) = op(c_1, op(c_2, ..., op(c_{L-1}, c_L)...))`.\nLet `X_i` be the value of the suffix `c_i ... c_L` after reduction.\n`X_L = c_L` (base case for length 1 string).\nFor `i < L`, `X_i = op(c_i, X_{i+1})`.\nThe final character is `X_1`.\n\nLet's analyze the `op(x, y)` function:\n`op(0, 0) = 1`\n`op(0, 1) = 0`\n`op(1, 0) = 0`\n`op(1, 1) = 0`\n\nThis implies:\n- `op(x, 1) = 0` for any `x`.\n- `op(x, 0) = NOT x = (1-x)`.\n\nNow let's determine `X_1` based on the string `c_1 ... c_L`:\n\n**Case 1: `m = 0` (string consists only of zeros)**\nThe string is `s = \"00...0\"` (`n` zeros).\n- If `n=1`: `s=\"0\"`. `val(\"0\") = 0`.\n- If `n > 1`:\n  `X_n = c_n = 0`.\n  `X_{n-1} = op(c_{n-1}, X_n) = op(0, 0) = 1`.\n  `X_{n-2} = op(c_{n-2}, X_{n-1}) = op(0, 1) = 0`.\n  `X_{n-3} = op(c_{n-3}, X_{n-2}) = op(0, 0) = 1`.\n  In general, `X_i = 1` if `n-i` is odd, and `X_i = 0` if `n-i` is even.\n  The final value is `X_1`. `X_1 = 1` if `n-1` is odd (i.e., `n` is even). `X_1 = 0` if `n-1` is even (i.e., `n` is odd).\n  So, for `n > 1`, `val(s) = 1` if `n` is even, `val(s) = 0` if `n` is odd.\nCombining with `n=1`: `val(s) = 0` if `n` is odd, `val(s) = 1` if `n` is even and `n > 0`.\n\n**Case 2: `n = 0` (string consists only of ones)**\nThe string is `s = \"11...1\"` (`m` ones).\n- If `m=1`: `s=\"1\"`. `val(\"1\") = 1`.\n- If `m > 1`:\n  `X_m = c_m = 1`.\n  `X_{m-1} = op(c_{m-1}, X_m) = op(1, 1) = 0`.\n  `X_{m-2} = op(c_{m-2}, X_{m-1}) = op(1, 0) = 0`.\n  All subsequent `X_i` will also be `0`. So `X_1 = 0`.\n  Thus, for `m > 1`, `val(s) = 0`.\nCombining with `m=1`: `val(s) = 1` if `m=1`, `val(s) = 0` if `m > 1`.\n\n**Case 3: `n > 0` and `m > 0` (string contains both zeros and ones)**\nLet `k` be the index of the first '1' in the string. So `c_1 = ... = c_{k-1} = 0` and `c_k = 1`.\nThe final value `X_1 = op(c_1, X_2)`.\nSince `c_1 = 0`, `X_1 = op(0, X_2) = 1 - X_2`.\nSimilarly, `X_2 = 1 - X_3`, ..., `X_{k-1} = 1 - X_k`.\nSubstituting these:\n`X_1 = 1 - X_2 = 1 - (1 - X_3) = X_3 = 1 - X_4 = ...`\nIf `k-1` is even, `X_1 = X_k`.\nIf `k-1` is odd, `X_1 = 1 - X_k`.\nIn general, `X_1 = X_k` if `k` is odd, and `X_1 = 1 - X_k` if `k` is even. (This is `X_1 = X_k` if `(k-1)` is even, `1-X_k` if `(k-1)` is odd).\n\nNow we need to find `X_k = op(c_k, X_{k+1}) = op(1, X_{k+1})`.\nSince `c_k = 1`, `X_k = op(1, X_{k+1}) = 0`.\nSo, `X_k` is always `0` if `c_k=1`.\nTherefore:\n- If `k` is odd (i.e., `c_1=0, c_2=0, ..., c_{k-1}=0, c_k=1`, and `k-1` is even, so `X_1 = X_k`): `X_1 = 0`.\n- If `k` is even (i.e., `c_1=0, c_2=0, ..., c_{k-1}=0, c_k=1`, and `k-1` is odd, so `X_1 = 1 - X_k`): `X_1 = 1 - 0 = 1`.\n\nThe value `k` is the number of leading zeros plus one.\n`k = (\\text{number of leading zeros}) + 1`.\nSo, `val(s) = 0` if the count of leading zeros is even.\n`val(s) = 1` if the count of leading zeros is odd.\n\nLet `N_0` be the count of leading zeros.\nIf `N_0` is even, `val(s) = 0`.\nIf `N_0` is odd, `val(s) = 1`.\n\nNow we need to count strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones that satisfy this condition for a target `g`.\nThe total number of strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones is `C(n+m, n) = (n+m)! / (n! m!)`.\n\n**If `g = 0`:**\nWe need `val(s) = 0`.\nThis means either:\n  1. `m=0` and `n` is odd. (Count = 1, string is \"0...0\")\n  2. `n=0` and `m > 1`. (Count = 1, string is \"1...1\")\n  3. `n > 0, m > 0` and the number of leading zeros (`N_0`) is even.\n\nLet's count strings for case 3. `N_0` can be `0, 2, 4, ...` up to `n` (if `n` is even) or `n-1` (if `n` is odd).\nA string with `N_0` leading zeros looks like `0...0` (`N_0` times) `1` (remaining `n-N_0` zeros and `m-1` ones).\nThe first character after the leading zeros must be '1'.\nThe remaining `n-N_0` zeros and `m-1` ones can be arranged in `C(n-N_0 + m-1, n-N_0)` ways.\nSo, for `g=0`, total count is:\n`Count(g=0) = (1 if m=0 and n%2==1 else 0) + (1 if n=0 and m>1 else 0) + sum_{N_0=0,2,4,...} C(n-N_0+m-1, n-N_0)`\n\n**If `g = 1`:**\nWe need `val(s) = 1`.\nThis means either:\n  1. `m=0` and `n` is even and `n > 0`. (Count = 1, string is \"0...0\")\n  2. `n=0` and `m=1`. (Count = 1, string is \"1\")\n  3. `n > 0, m > 0` and the number of leading zeros (`N_0`) is odd.\n\nLet's count strings for case 3. `N_0` can be `1, 3, 5, ...` up to `n` (if `n` is odd) or `n-1` (if `n` is even).\nA string with `N_0` leading zeros looks like `0...0` (`N_0` times) `1` (remaining `n-N_0` zeros and `m-1` ones).\nThe remaining `n-N_0` zeros and `m-1` ones can be arranged in `C(n-N_0 + m-1, n-N_0)` ways.\nSo, for `g=1`, total count is:\n`Count(g=1) = (1 if m=0 and n%2==0 and n>0 else 0) + (1 if n=0 and m==1 else 0) + sum_{N_0=1,3,5,...} C(n-N_0+m-1, n-N_0)`\n\nThe sum `sum_{i=k, k+2, ...} C(N-i, K)` is tricky to calculate directly.\nLet `S_0 = sum_{N_0=0,2,4,...} C(n-N_0+m-1, n-N_0)` (for `n>0, m>0`)\nLet `S_1 = sum_{N_0=1,3,5,...} C(n-N_0+m-1, n-N_0)` (for `n>0, m>0`)\n\nLet `T = n+m`. Total length.\nThe sum `sum C(n-N_0 + m-1, n-N_0)` is over `N_0` up to `n`.\nLet `k = n-N_0`. This is the number of zeros after the first '1'.\nWhen `N_0` is even, `k` has the same parity as `n`.\nWhen `N_0` is odd, `k` has the opposite parity of `n`.\n\nSo:\nIf `g=0`: need `N_0` even.\nThis means `k = n-N_0` has the same parity as `n`.\nWe sum `C(k+m-1, k)` for `k` from `0` to `n`, with `k` having the same parity as `n`.\n\nIf `g=1`: need `N_0` odd.\nThis means `k = n-N_0` has the opposite parity of `n`.\nWe sum `C(k+m-1, k)` for `k` from `0` to `n-1`, with `k` having the opposite parity as `n`. Note that `N_0` can't be `n` if `m-1<0`. If `m-1=0`, then `N_0` can be `n`. If `m=1`, then `k` goes from `0` to `n`.\n\nLet `N = n+m-1`, `K = m-1`.\nThe terms are `C(n-N_0+m-1, m-1)`.\nLet `j = N_0`.\n`S_0 = sum_{j=0,2,... \\le n} C(n-j+m-1, m-1)`\n`S_1 = sum_{j=1,3,... \\le n} C(n-j+m-1, m-1)`\n\nWe know `sum_{i=0 to X} C(A+i, i) = C(A+X+1, X)`. This is not directly applicable.\nWe need `sum C(N-j, K)` where `j` steps by 2.\nConsider `sum_{i=0 to X} C(Y, i)`. This is `2^Y`.\nThis is a standard combinatorial identity: `sum_{i=0 to k, i \\equiv p \\pmod 2} C(N, i)`.\nNo, this is `C(N-j+m-1, m-1)`.\nLet `A = m-1`.

This is `C(N+K+1, K+1)`. (Hockey-stick identity)\nWe need to sum `C(x+A, A)` for `x` of a specific parity.\nLet `F(P, A) = sum_{i=0 to P, i \\text{ has same parity as } P} C(i+A, A)`.\nLet `G(P, A) = sum_{i=0 to P, i \\text{ has opposite parity to } P} C(i+A, A)`.\nThen `F(P, A) + G(P, A) = C(P+A+1, A+1)`.\nIt is known that `sum_{i=0 to N, i \\text{ even}} C(M, i) = 2^{M-1}` and `sum_{i=0 to N, i \\text{ odd}} C(M, i) = 2^{M-1}` for `M>0`.\nThis is not for `C(i+A, A)`.\n\nA known identity is `sum_{k=0 to n} C(r+k, k) = C(r+n+1, n)`.\nLet's use a trick for sums with alternating parity.\nLet `S = sum_{j=0 to n} C(n-j+m-1, m-1) = C(n+m, m-1)`.\nThis sum is `C(n+m-1, m-1) + C(n+m-2, m-1) + ... + C(m-1, m-1)`.\nThis is `C( (m-1) + n + 1, (m-1)+1 ) = C(n+m, m)`.\nSo `S = C(n+m, m)`.\n\nLet `S_even = sum_{j=0,2,... \\le n} C(n-j+m-1, m-1)`\nLet `S_odd = sum_{j=1,3,... \\le n} C(n-j+m-1, m-1)`\nWe know `S_even + S_odd = C(n+m, m)`.\n\nThere's an identity `sum_{k=0 to N} C(M+k, k) = C(M+N+1, N)`.\nLet `M=m-1`.\n`sum_{j=0 to n} C(m-1 + n-j, n-j) = C(m-1 + n+1, n) = C(n+m, n)`.\nThis sum is `C(m-1+n, n) + C(m-1+n-1, n-1) + ... + C(m-1, 0)`.\nThis is `C(n+m, n)`.\n`S_0` is the sum of terms where `n-j` has same parity as `n`.\n`S_1` is the sum of terms where `n-j` has opposite parity as `n`.\n\nConsider `C(N, K) = C(N, N-K)`.\n`C(n-j+m-1, m-1) = C(n-j+m-1, n-j)`.\nLet `r = n-j`.\nWe need to sum `C(r+m-1, r)` for `r` from `0` to `n` with specific parity.\n`sum_{r=0 to n, r \\text{ has same parity as } n} C(r+m-1, r)`.\n`sum_{r=0 to n, r \\text{ has opposite parity as } n} C(r+m-1, r)`.\n\nThis is a known identity for `sum C(A+i, i)` with alternating parity.\n`sum_{i=0 to K} C(N+i, i)`\n`sum_{i=0 to K, i \\text{ even}} C(N+i, i) = C(N+K+1, K) - C(N+K, K-1) + C(N+K-1, K-2) - ...` (This is not useful)\n\nA simpler approach for `n>0, m>0`:\nThe total number of strings is `C(n+m, n)`.\nThe condition `val(s)=0` vs `val(s)=1` depends on the parity of leading zeros `N_0`.\nIf `s` starts with '1' (`N_0=0`, even), `val(s)=0`.\nIf `s` starts with '01' (`N_0=1`, odd), `val(s)=1`.\nIf `s` starts with '001' (`N_0=2`, even), `val(s)=0`.\nAnd so on.\n\nThe number of strings starting with exactly `N_0` zeros (and then a '1') is `C(n-N_0 + m-1, m-1)`.\nThis is for `N_0 < n`. If `N_0 = n`, then it must be `m=0`. But we are in `m>0` case.\nSo `N_0` ranges from `0` to `n`.\nIf `N_0=n`, then `s = \"0...01...\"`. This means `m-1` ones and `0` zeros remaining. This is `C(m-1, m-1) = 1`. This case is `s = \"0...0\" \"1\" \"1...1\"`.\nThe condition `m>0` is important for `C(n-N_0+m-1, m-1)`. It implies `m-1 >= 0`.\n\nLet `A = n+m`.\nIf `g=0`: Sum `C(A-1-N_0, m-1)` for `N_0 = 0, 2, ..., \\le n`.\nIf `g=1`: Sum `C(A-1-N_0, m-1)` for `N_0 = 1, 3, ..., \\le n`.\n\nThese sums are difficult. Is there a simpler property?\nThe question states it is a \"very easy question\". This implies the solution should not involve complex combinatorial identities.\n\nWhat if `m=1`?\nIf `m=1, n>0`:\n`val(s)=0` if `N_0` is even.\n`val(s)=1` if `N_0` is odd.\n`N_0` can be `0, 1, ..., n`.\nNumber of strings with `N_0` leading zeros: `C(n-N_0 + 1-1, 1-1) = C(n-N_0, 0) = 1`.\nSo there is exactly one string for each `N_0`.\nFor example, `n=1, m=1`. Strings: \"01\", \"10\".\n\"01\": `N_0=1` (odd). `val(\"01\") = 1`.\n\"10\": `N_0=0` (even). `val(\"10\") = 0`.\nIf `g=0`, count is 1 (\"10\").\nIf `g=1`, count is 1 (\"01\").\nMatches example `n=1, m=1, g=0` output 2. My calculation gives 1. What is wrong?\n\nLet's re-evaluate `val(\"10\")` for `n=1, m=1`.\n`c_1=\"1\", c_2=\"0\"`.\n`X_2 = c_2 = 0`.\n`X_1 = op(c_1, X_2) = op(1, 0) = 0`.\nSo `val(\"10\") = 0`. Correct.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `val(\"01\")` for `n=1, m=1`.\n`c_1=\"0\", c_2=\"1\"`.\n`X_2 = c_2 = 1`.\n`X_1 = op(c_1, X_2) = op(0, 1) = 0`.\nSo `val(\"01\") = 0`. Correct.\n\nMy calculation:\n`n=1, m=1`.\n`N_0` can be `0` (string \"10\") or `1` (string \"01\").\nIf `N_0=0` (even), `val(s)=0`. String \"10\".\nIf `N_0=1` (odd), `val(s)=1`. String \"01\".\nThis implies `val(\"01\")=1` and `val(\"10\")=0`.\nBut my trace shows `val(\"01\")=0` and `val(\"10\")=0`.\nThis means my derivation for `n>0, m>0` is wrong.\n\nLet's re-trace `X_1` for `n>0, m>0`.\n`X_1 = op(c_1, X_2)`\n`X_2 = op(c_2, X_3)`\n...\n`X_{L-1} = op(c_{L-1}, X_L)`\n`X_L = c_L`\n\nIf there is ANY '1' in `c_2 ... c_L`:\nLet `j` be the smallest index such that `j > 1` and `c_j = 1`.\nThen `X_j = op(c_j, X_{j+1}) = op(1, X_{j+1}) = 0`.\nThen `X_{j-1} = op(c_{j-1}, X_j) = op(c_{j-1}, 0) = 1 - c_{j-1}`.\n`X_{j-2} = op(c_{j-2}, X_{j-1}) = op(c_{j-2}, 1 - c_{j-1})`.\n`X_i = op(c_i, X_{i+1})`.\nIf `X_{i+1}=0`, then `X_i = 1-c_i`.\nIf `X_{i+1}=1`, then `X_i = 0`.\n\nLet's look at the structure of `X_i`.\n`X_i` depends on `c_i, c_{i+1}, ..., c_L`.\nIf `c_i = 1`, then `X_i = 0`.\nIf `c_i = 0`, then `X_i = 1 - X_{i+1}`.\n\nSo, `X_1 = 0` if `c_1=1`.\nIf `c_1=0`, then `X_1 = 1 - X_2`.\n  If `c_2=1`, then `X_2 = 0`. So `X_1 = 1 - 0 = 1`.\n  If `c_2=0`, then `X_2 = 1 - X_3`. So `X_1 = 1 - (1 - X_3) = X_3`.\n    If `c_3=1`, then `X_3 = 0`. So `X_1 = 0`.\n    If `c_3=0`, then `X_3 = 1 - X_4`. So `X_1 = X_4`.\n\nThis pattern continues. `X_1` is `X_k` if `k-1` is even, and `1-X_k` if `k-1` is odd.\n`X_1` is `X_k` if `k` is odd, `1-X_k` if `k` is even.\nThe first `c_k=1` determines `X_k=0`.\nSo, if the first '1' is at an odd position `k`, then `X_1 = X_k = 0`.\nIf the first '1' is at an even position `k`, then `X_1 = 1 - X_k = 1 - 0 = 1`.\n\nLet `k` be the position of the first '1'.\n`k = 1 + (\\text{number of leading zeros})`.\nIf `k` is odd (0 leading zeros, 2 leading zeros, etc.), then `val(s) = 0`.\nIf `k` is even (1 leading zero, 3 leading zeros, etc.), then `val(s) = 1`.\n\nThis is the same conclusion I had before.

(Wait, my trace for \"001\" gives 1, but rule `k>=2` and `k` even is not met).\n  Let's recheck `val(\"001\")`: `X_3=1, X_2=op(0,1)=0, X_1=op(0,0)=1`. Correct.\n  So `val(\"001\")=1`. `k=3` (odd).\n\nRevised rule for `m=1`:\n`val(s) = 1` if `k` (position of '1') is `2` or `3` or `4`... (This is not useful)\n\nLet's summarize my traces for `m=1` where `k` is the position of the single '1'.\n`k=1`: \"1...\" -> `val=0`. (e.g. \"10\", \"100\")\n`k=2`: \"01...\" -> `val=0`. (e.g. \"01\", \"010\")\n`k=3`: \"001...\" -> `val=1`. (e.g. \"001\")\n`k=4`: \"0001...\" -> `val=0`. (e.g. \"0001\")\n\nThis is `val(s) = 1` if `k=3`. Else `val(s)=0`. For `m=1`.\nThis means `n` must be `2` for `k=3`. (`001`).\nSo, if `m=1`:\n  `val(s)=1` if `n=2` and '1' is at position 3 (i.e. `s=\"001\"`).\n  `val(s)=0` otherwise.\n\nLet's test this rule for `m=1`.\n`n=1, m=1`: `k=1` (\"10\") or `k=2` (\"01\"). Neither is `k=3`. So `val=0` for both. This matches example `1 1 0` -> `2`, `1 1 1` -> `0`.\n`n=2, m=1`: \"001\", \"010\", \"100\".\n  \"001\": `k=3`. Rule says `val=1`. (Matches trace).\n  \"010\": `k=2`. Rule says `val=0`. (Trace says `val=1`).\n  \"100\": `k=1`. Rule says `val=0`. (Matches trace).\nThis rule is also wrong.\n\nThe property must be something simple.\nConsider the parity of `m`.\nIf `m` is even: `val(s) = 0`.\nIf `m` is odd: `val(s)` depends on `n`.\n\nLet's check the examples:\n`n=1, m=1, g=0`: output 2. `m` is odd.\n`n=2, m=2, g=0`: output 4. `m` is even.\n`n=1, m=1, g=1`: output 0. `m` is odd.\n\nIf `m` is even, `val(s)` is always `0`.\nThis explains `n=2, m=2, g=0` output 4. All 6 strings have `m=2` (even). So `val=0` for all 6.\nBut example output is 4, not 6.\nThis means my hypothesis \"If `m` is even, `val(s)` is always `0`\" is wrong.\nWhat strings are `0011`, `1001`, `1010`, `1100`?\n`val(\"0011\")`: `X_4=1, X_3=op(1,1)=0, X_2=op(0,0)=1, X_1=op(0,1)=0`. `val=0`.\n`val(\"1001\")`: `X_4=1, X_3=op(0,1)=0, X_2=op(0,0)=1, X_1=op(1,1)=0`. `val=0`.\n`val(\"1010\")`: `X_4=0, X_3=op(1,0)=0, X_2=op(0,0)=1, X_1=op(1,1)=0`. `val=0`.\n`val(\"1100\")`: `X_4=0, X_3=op(0,0)=1, X_2=op(1,1)=0, X_1=op(1,0)=0`. `val=0`.\nAll these 4 strings reduce to `0`.\nWhat about the other 2 strings for `n=2, m=2`: \"0101\", \"0110\"?\n`val(\"0101\")`: `X_4=1, X_3=op(0,1)=0, X_2=op(1,0)=0, X_1=op(0,0)=1`. `val=1`.\n`val(\"0110\")`: `X_4=0, X_3=op(1,0)=0, X_2=op(1,0)=0, X_1=op(0,0)=1`. `val=1`.\nSo for `n=2, m=2`: 4 strings give `0`, 2 strings give `1`.\nIf `g=0`, count is 4. (Matches example).\nIf `g=1`, count is 2.\n\nThis means the `val(s)` is `1` for `s` starting with `01` and `m>=2`.\n`val(s)=1` if `s` is `01...` AND `m>=2`.\n`val(\"0101\")`: starts `01`. `m=2`. `val=1`.\n`val(\"0110\")`: starts `01`. `m=2`. `val=1`.\n\nLet's test this rule.\nIf `s` starts with `01`: `c_1=0, c_2=1`.\n`X_1 = op(c_1, X_2) = op(0, X_2) = 1 - X_2`.\n`X_2 = op(c_2, X_3) = op(1, X_3) = 0`.\nSo `X_1 = 1 - 0 = 1`.\nThis rule is correct! If a string starts with \"01\", its final value is `1`.\nThis holds for any `n, m` as long as `n>=1, m>=1`.\n\nSo the rule for `n>0, m>0` is:\n`val(s)=1` if `s` starts with `01`.\n`val(s)=0` otherwise.\n\nLet's verify this against all examples and my other traces.\n`n=1, m=1`:\n  \"01\": starts \"01\". `val=1`. (My trace `val(\"01\")=0`. This is the problem!)\n  \"10\": does not start \"01\". `val=0`. (My trace `val(\"10\")=0`. Matches).\n\nMy traces `val(\"01\")=0` and `val(\"0101\")=1` are contradictory.\n`val(\"01\")`: `X_2=1, X_1=op(0,1)=0`.\n`val(\"0101\")`: `X_4=1, X_3=op(0,1)=0, X_2=op(1,0)=0, X_1=op(0,0)=1`.\nThe difference is the length of the string.\nThe rule `X_2 = op(1, X_3) = 0` only holds if `m-1 >= 1` (i.e., `m>=2`).\nIf `m=1`, then `s` is `010...0`. The `1` is at `c_2`. `X_2 = op(c_2, X_3) = op(1, X_3)`.\nIf `m=1`, then `c_3, ..., c_L` must all be `0`.\nSo `X_3` is the result of `0...0` for `L-2` zeros.\n`X_3 = 0` if `L-2` is odd. `X_3 = 1` if `L-2` is even and `L-2 > 0`. `X_3=0` if `L-2=1`.\nIf `L-2=0` (i.e., `L=2`), `s=\"01\"`. `X_3` is not defined. `X_2=c_2=1`.\nSo for `s=\"01\"`, `X_1=op(0,1)=0`.\n\nRevised rule for `s` starting with `01`:\n`val(s)=1` if `m>=2`. (Because `X_2=op(1,X_3)=0` due to `c_2=1` and `X_3` contains a '1' or is `0` from the remaining `m-1` ones and `n` zeros).\n  If `m>=2`, then `X_3` will contain at least one more '1' or `X_3` is `0` (if `c_3=1` or `c_3=0` and `X_4=1`).\n  The critical point is that `X_k=0` if `c_k=1`.\n  If `s` starts `01...`: `c_1=0, c_2=1`.\n  `X_2 = op(1, X_3) = 0`.\n  Then `X_1 = op(0, X_2) = op(0, 0) = 1`.\n  This is correct! `val(s)=1` if `s` starts with `01`.\n  This applies if `L>=2`.\n  This applies if `n>=1` and `m>=1`.\n\nLet's recheck `val(\"01\")` (where `n=1, m=1`):\n`c_1=0, c_2=1`. Here `L=2`.\n`X_2 = c_2 = 1`.\n`X_1 = op(c_1, X_2) = op(0, 1) = 0`.\nSo `val(\"01\")=0`.\n\nMy rule `val(s)=1` if `s` starts with `01` is only for `L > 2`.\nThis means if `s` is `01...` and `L > 2`, then `val(s)=1`.\nIf `s` is `01` (i.e. `L=2`), then `val(s)=0`.\n\nThis is the final set of rules for `val(s)`:\n1. If `m=0` (string is `n` zeros):\n   - If `n=1`: `val=0`.\n   - If `n>1`: `val=1` if `n` is even, `val=0` if `n` is odd.\n2. If `n=0` (string is `m` ones):\n   - If `m=1`: `val=1`.\n   - If `m>1`: `val=0`.\n3. If `n>0` and `m>0`:\n   - If `s` starts with `01`:\n     - If `n=1` and `m=1` (i.e. `s=\"01\"`): `val=0`.\n     - If `n>1` or `m>1` (i.e. `s` starts `01` and `L>2`): `val=1`.\n   - If `s` does not start with `01`: `val=0`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate all examples:\n`n=1, m=1, g=0`:\n  `s=\"01\"`: `n=1, m=1`. Case 3.1. `val=0`.\n  `s=\"10\"`: Case 3.2. `val=0`.\n  Both are 0. So count = 2. Matches example.\n`n=1, m=1, g=1`:\n  `s=\"01\"`: `val=0`.\n  `s=\"10\"`: `val=0`.\n  None are 1. So count = 0. Matches example.\n\n`n=2, m=2, g=0`:\n  Total `C(4,2)=6` strings.\n  Strings starting `01`: \"0101\", \"0110\". `n=2, m=2`. Case 3.1. `L>2`. `val=1`.\n  Strings not starting `01`: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\". Case 3.2. `val=0`.\n  So `val=0` for 4 strings. Count = 4. Matches example.\n\nThis set of rules is consistent with all examples and traces.\n\nNow for the counting:\nLet `ans = 0`.\nModulo `1000000007`.\n\n**If `g=0`:**\n  - If `m=0`:\n    - If `n` is odd: `ans = (ans + 1) % MOD`.\n  - If `n=0`:\n    - If `m > 1`: `ans = (ans + 1) % MOD`.\n  - If `n>0` and `m>0`:\n    - Strings `s=\"01\"` (if `n=1, m=1`): `ans = (ans + 1) % MOD`.\n    - Strings not starting `01`:\n      Total strings with `n` zeros, `m` ones: `C(n+m, n)`.\n      Strings starting `01`: `C(n-1+m-1, n-1) = C(n+m-2, n-1)`. (if `n>=1, m>=1`).\n      Strings starting `01` and `L>2`: `C(n+m-2, n-1)` if `n+m-2 >= 1`.\n      Number of strings starting `01` is `C(n+m-2, n-1)`.\n      If `n=1, m=1`, `C(0,0)=1` (string \"01\"). This gives `val=0`.\n      If `n>1` or `m>1`, `C(n+m-2, n-1)` strings give `val=1`.\n      So, `ans = (ans + C(n+m, n) - C(n+m-2, n-1) + MOD) % MOD`.\n      This `C(n+m-2, n-1)` term should be `0` if `n=0` or `m=0`. It's `0` if `n-1<0` or `m-1<0`.\n      If `n=1, m=1`, `C(0,0)=1`. `ans = (ans + C(2,1) - C(0,0) + MOD) % MOD = (2-1+MOD)%MOD = 1`.\n      This is the count of strings that don't start `01`.\n      So, if `n=1, m=1`, `ans = (ans + 1) % MOD` (for \"01\") and `ans = (ans + 1) % MOD` (for \"10\"). Total 2.\n      My calculation: `ans` is 0 initially.\n      If `n=1, m=1`, `g=0`:\n        `s=\"01\"`: `val=0`. `ans = (ans + 1) % MOD`.\n        `s=\"10\"`: `val=0`. `ans = (ans + 1) % MOD`.\n        Final `ans = 2`.\n      If `n>0, m>0` and not `n=1, m=1`:\n        `ans = (ans + C(n+m, n) - C(n+m-2, n-1) + MOD) % MOD`.\n        This is for strings that do not start `01`, plus the string `01` if `n=1, m=1`.\n        This is total strings minus strings that start `01` and `L>2`.\n        So `ans = (C(n+m, n) - (C(n+m-2, n-1) if (n+m-2 >= 1) else 0) + MOD) % MOD`.\n\n**If `g=1`:**\n  - If `m=0`:\n    - If `n` is even and `n > 0`: `ans = (ans + 1) % MOD`.\n  - If `n=0`:\n    - If `m=1`: `ans = (ans + 1) % MOD`.\n  - If `n>0` and `m>0`:\n    - Strings starting `01` and `L>2`: `C(n+m-2, n-1)`.\n    - `ans = (ans + (C(n+m-2, n-1) if (n+m-2 >= 1) else 0)) % MOD`.\n\nThis looks like a solid plan. Need to handle `n+m-2 < 0` for combinations (e.g., `n=0, m=1`).\n`C(N, K)` is 0 if `K < 0` or `K > N`.\n`n+m-2 >= 1` is equivalent to `n+m >= 3`.\nSo `C(n+m-2, n-1)` is 0 if `n+m < 3`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 1000000007\nMAX_N_M = 2 * 10**5 + 5 # Max n+m is 2*10^5\n\nfact = [1] * MAX_N_M\ninv_fact = [1] * MAX_N_M\n\ndef precompute_factorials():\n    for i in range(1, MAX_N_M):\n        fact[i] = (fact[i-1] * i) % MOD\n\ndef power(a, b):\n    res = 1\n    a %= MOD\n    while b > 0:\n        if b % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * a) % MOD\n        a = (a * a) % MOD\n        b //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef mod_inverse(n):\n    return power(n, MOD - 2)\n\ndef precompute_inverse_factorials():\n    inv_fact[MAX_N_M - 1] = mod_inverse(fact[MAX_N_M - 1])\n    for i in range(MAX_N_M - 2, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = (inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n\ndef nCr_mod_p(n, r):\n    if r < 0 or r > n:\n        return 0\n    num = fact[n]\n    den = (inv_fact[r] * inv_fact[n-r]) % MOD\n    return (num * den) % MOD\n\nprecompute_factorials()\nprecompute_inverse_factorials()\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m, g = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    ans = 0\n\n    # Case 1: m = 0 (string is n zeros)\n    if m == 0:\n        if n == 1:\n            if g == 0:\n                ans = 1\n            else: # g == 1\n                ans = 0\n        else: # n > 1\n            if n % 2 == 0: # val = 1\n                if g == 1:\n                    ans = 1\n                else: # g == 0\n                    ans = 0\n            else: # n % 2 == 1 (val = 0)\n                if g == 0:\n                    ans = 1\n                else: # g == 1\n                    ans = 0\n        print(ans)\n        return\n\n    # Case 2: n = 0 (string is m ones)\n    if n == 0:\n        if m == 1: # val = 1\n            if g == 1:\n                ans = 1\n            else: # g == 0\n                ans = 0\n        else: # m > 1 (val = 0)\n            if g == 0:\n                ans = 1\n            else: # g == 1\n                ans = 0\n        print(ans)\n        return\n\n    # Case 3: n > 0 and m > 0 (string contains both zeros and ones)\n    # Rule: val(s)=1 if s starts with \"01\" AND (n+m > 2).
