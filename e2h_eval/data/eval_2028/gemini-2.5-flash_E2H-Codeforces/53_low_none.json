Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Substring Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice within a given string.  The occurrences are allowed to overlap, and the input string is just lowercase Latin letters with a maximum length of 100.  Given the size constraint, I think a brute-force approach will be perfectly acceptable.\n\nLet's dissect this. First, I need to iterate through all possible substring lengths, starting from the longest possible (which is `n-1`, where `n` is the string length) down to 1.  For each length, I'll need to generate all possible substrings of that length.  Then, for each substring, I'll have to count how many times it appears in the original string.\n\nThe logic seems pretty straightforward:\n\n1.  **Iterate Substring Lengths:** `N-1` to `1` (inclusive), descending.\n2.  **Generate Substrings:** For each length, I'll need to iterate through the string, extracting substrings of that length.\n3.  **Count Occurrences:** For each extracted substring, I'll search the entire string to count how many times it appears. If the count is 2 or more, I know I've found a valid substring.  Because I'm iterating downwards by length, the first one I find can be immediately returned since it will be the longest.\n\nIf I get through the entire process and don't find a substring that meets the criteria, I should return `0`, which would be the correct answer for strings like \"abcd\".\n\nI'm thinking the algorithm will look something like this in a high-level pseudo-code.\n\n*   `max_len = 0`\n*   `N = len(s)`\n\n*   `for length` from `N-1` down to `1`:\n    *   `for i` from `0` to `N - length`:\n        *   `current_substring = s[i : i + length]`\n        *   `count = 0`\n        *   `for j` from `0` to `N - length`:\n            *   `if s[j : j + length] == current_substring`:\n                *   `count += 1`\n        *   `if count >= 2`:\n            *   `max_len = length`\n            *   `return max_len`\n\nLet's run through a quick example to be certain that I'm on the right track. Consider `s = \"ababa\"`:\n\n*   `N = 5`\n*   `max_len = 0`\n\n*   `length = 4`:\n    *   `i = 0`: `current_substring = \"abab\"`;\n        `count` will be `0` after comparing with \"ababa\".\n    *   `i = 1`: `current_substring = \"baba\"`;\n        `count` will be `0` after comparing with \"ababa\".\n*   `length = 3`:\n    *   `i = 0`: `current_substring = \"aba\"`; `count = 2`. `max_len = 3`; return `3`.\n\nIt checks out!\n\nOkay, time for a quick complexity analysis:\n\n*   Outer loop for `length`:  `O(N)`\n*   Second loop for `i`: `O(N)`\n*   Third loop for `j`: `O(N)`\n*   Substring comparison within the innermost loop: `O(length)`\n\nThis results in, roughly,  `O(N * N * N * length)`. Because `length` can, at most, be equal to `N-1`, that means this will be `O(N^4)`. Given `N` is small (at most 100), this is certainly acceptable, I can write the code now.\n",
