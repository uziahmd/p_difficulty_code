After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about determining the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. Hmm.\n\nSo, each student has marks for m subjects. A student is considered the best at a subject if no one else has a higher mark for that subject. And a student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. My task is to find out how many such students there are.\n\nLet me think about the input. The first line gives n and m. Then there are n lines, each representing a student's grades. Each grade is a string of m characters, each being a digit from 1 to 9. Oh right, because each character represents a mark for a subject.\n\nWait, so for each subject, I need to check all students' marks and find the maximum. Then, for each student, check if they have any subject where they are the maximum. If yes, count them.\n\nHmm, okay. So the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input correctly. The first line is n and m. Then each of the next n lines is a string of length m, each character is a mark.\n\n2. For each subject (from 0 to m-1), determine which student(s) have the maximum mark in that subject.\n\n3. For each student, check across all m subjects whether they are the maximum in any. If so, increment the count.\n\nBut wait, how do I process each subject? For each subject j, iterate through all students and find their mark, then track the maximum. Then, for each student, see if their mark in subject j equals the maximum. But no, wait: a student is the best at a subject if they have the maximum mark for that subject, regardless of others. So for each subject, we can collect the maximum mark, and for each student, for each subject, compare their mark to the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, for each subject j:\n- Find the maximum mark among all students.\n- For each student, if their j-th mark equals the maximum, they are the best in that subject.\n\nThen, for each student, if they are the best in at least one subject, count them as successful.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently?\n\nLet's plan the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read the input. So, read n and m. Then read n lines. Each line is a string of length m. So, for example, the first sample input is:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nEach line is a string. So, for each student, we can store their marks as a list of integers or keep them as strings. Hmm, maybe easier to process as integers.\n\nSo, let's process each student into a list of integers. For example, for the first sample, the first student's marks would be [2,2,3], second [2,3,2], third [1,1,2].\n\nOnce I have all the students' marks stored, for each subject j (from 0 to m-1), I can collect all the j-th marks from each student, find the maximum, then for each student, see if their j-th mark is equal to that maximum.\n\nWait, but for each subject, the maximum is the same for all students. So for subject j, the max_mark_j is determined once, then for each student, check if their j-th mark is equal to max_mark_j. If so, add that subject to their 'best' set.\n\nSo, perhaps for each student, we can track which subjects they are the best in. Then, after processing all subjects, check if that set is non-empty.\n\nAlternatively, for each student, if for any subject j, their mark is equal to the max_mark_j, then the student is successful.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read each student's marks, store as a list of lists of integers.\n- For each subject j in 0 to m-1:\n   - Find the maximum mark among all students for j.\n   - Record this max for j.\n- Then, for each student:\n   - Check if, for any j, their mark equals the max for j.\n   - If yes, count them as successful.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nLet me think about how to represent the data.\n\nSuppose we have a list called students, where each element is a list of m integers. For example, students[i] is a list of m integers representing the i-th student's marks.\n\nThen, for each j from 0 to m-1, compute the maximum in the j-th column.\n\nWe can create a list of max_marks, where max_marks[j] is the maximum mark for subject j.\n\nOnce we have max_marks, for each student, we check if any of their marks equals the corresponding max_marks[j]. If yes,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark for that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: The first input line contains two integers `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). The subsequent `n` lines each contain `m` characters representing the marks for each subject.\n2. **Store Marks**: Convert each student's marks into a list of integers for easier processing.\n3. **Determine Maximum Marks**: For each subject, find the maximum mark among all students.\n4. **Identify Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the maximum mark in any subject. If they do, count them as successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read the input\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    row = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in row]\n    students.append(marks)\n\n# For each subject, find the maximum mark\nmax_marks = [0] * m\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_mark = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > max_mark:\n            max_mark = students[i][j]\n    max_marks[j] = max_mark\n\n# Count successful students\nsuccessful = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n            successful += 1\n            break  # No need to check other subjects\n\nprint(successful)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of students `n` and subjects `m`. Each student's marks are stored as a list of integers.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject, iterate through all students' marks to find the highest score. This gives us an array where each element represents the highest mark for the corresponding subject.\n3. **Checking Success**: For each student, check if their mark in any subject matches the maximum mark for that subject. If a match is found, the student is marked as successful and counted.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each student's marks and checks against the maximum marks for each subject, ensuring we correctly identify all successful students.",
