There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about maximizing profit by building houses on a street with certain restrictions. \n\nAlright, let me read the problem statement carefully again. So, there are n spots on the street where each house can be built with a height between 0 and h. Each spot contributes a squared value equal to the height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in the range from l_i to r_i (inclusive), the tallest house must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit.\n\nHmm. So, the constraints are that for each of the m ranges, the maximum height in that range doesn't exceed x_i. And I want to assign heights to each spot such that all these constraints are satisfied, and the sum of squares is as large as possible.\n\nThe input gives n, h, m, followed by m lines each with l_i, r_i, x_i. The output should be the maximum possible sum of squares.\n\nSo, how do I model this? It feels like a dynamic programming problem or maybe using some kind of constraints satisfaction approach. Since n and m are up to 50, which is manageable, perhaps a DP approach is feasible.\n\nLet me think about the possible approaches.\n\nOne way is to model the problem by considering each spot and the constraints that affect it. But the constraints can overlap, making it tricky. For example, a spot may be covered by multiple restrictions, so the maximum of all applicable restrictions' x_i values is the effective upper bound for that spot.\n\nWait, no. Because each restriction specifies a range, and the maximum in that range must be <= x_i. So for a particular spot, if it's included in multiple restrictions, each of those restrictions might impose an upper limit on its height. But the overall maximum height allowed for the spot is the minimum of all x_i's for all restrictions that include it. Because, for example, if one restriction allows up to 5, another allows up to 3, then the spot's height must be at most 3 to satisfy both.\n\nSo first, perhaps we can pre-process the restrictions to find for each spot the maximum allowed height based on all overlapping restrictions.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because each restriction imposes that within its own range, the maximum can't exceed x_i. So, for a spot, the maximum allowed is the minimum of all x_i's from the restrictions that include that spot.\n\nFor example, suppose a spot is in two restrictions: one with x=5 and another with x=3. Then the spot's height must be at most 3 because otherwise, the second restriction would be violated.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each spot i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of x_i across all restrictions that include i in their [l_i, r_i] range.\n\nBut wait, what about the global maximum h? Oh right, each spot's height cannot exceed h. So the maximum allowed for spot i is the minimum between h and the minimum x_i of all applicable restrictions.\n\nSo, for each spot, I can compute the maximum allowed height as min(h, min over all x_i for restrictions covering i).\n\nThis seems like a crucial step. Once I know the maximum allowed height for each spot, the problem reduces to choosing for each spot a height between 0 and that maximum, such that the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nBut wait, is that sufficient? Because the problem's constraints are that for each restriction, the maximum in its range is <= x_i. So if I set each spot's height to the maximum allowed, that would ensure that all restrictions are satisfied. Because for any restriction, the maximum in its range will be <= the minimum of all x_i's for that spot, which is <= x_i.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the process is:\n\n1. For each spot i, find all the restrictions that cover it (i.e., l_j <= i <= r_j).\n2. For each such spot, the maximum allowed height is the minimum x_j among those restrictions and h.\n3. Then, choose the heights for each spot as high as possible (up to their max allowed) to maximize the sum of squares.\n\nWait, but that's only correct if the maximum allowed for each spot is determined correctly. Because the problem isn't just about individual spots; it's about the maximum within each restriction's range. So setting each spot to the maximum allowed might cause some restriction's max to exceed x_i.\n\nWait no. Because when we take the minimum of all x_j for each spot, then the maximum in any restriction's range will be <= x_i for that restriction. Because for any spot in the range, the maximum allowed is the minimum of all x_j's, including the current restriction's x_i. So the maximum in that range would be at most x_i.\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose a restriction has",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to given zoning restrictions. Each house contributes to the profit based on its height squared, and each restriction limits the maximum height within a specific range.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: Each restriction specifies a range and a maximum height. The tallest house in each specified range must not exceed this maximum height.\n2. **Determine Maximum Allowed Heights**: For each spot, compute the effective maximum height considering all applicable restrictions. This is the minimum of all restriction heights that include the spot and the global maximum height `h`.\n3. **Maximize Profit**: Assign the highest possible height to each spot without violating any constraints. This ensures the sum of squares (and thus the profit) is maximized.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append((l-1, r-1, x))  # Convert to 0-based indices\n\n# For each spot, find the minimum x among all restrictions covering it\nmax_heights = [h] * n\nfor i in range(n):\n    min_x = h\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        if l <= i <= r:\n            if x < min_x:\n                min_x = x\n    max_heights[i] = min(min_x, h)\n\n# Now assign the maximum possible height to each spot\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    total += max_heights[i] ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into variables for the number of spots, maximum height, and restrictions.\n2. **Processing Restrictions**: Each restriction is converted to 0-based indices for easier processing.\n3. **Compute Effective Heights**: For each spot, determine the minimum allowed height considering all applicable restrictions and the global maximum height `h`.\n4. **Calculate Profit**: Sum the squares of the computed heights to get the maximum profit.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are respected while maximizing the profit by assigning the highest possible heights to each spot.",
