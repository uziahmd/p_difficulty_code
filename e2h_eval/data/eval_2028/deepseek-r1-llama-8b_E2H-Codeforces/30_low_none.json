Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"TV Game,\" and from the description, I need to find a sequence of moves for Homer and Marge that maximizes their total prize. \n\nHmm, the game works like this: they have a number A which is 2n digits long. Each turn, a player takes the leftmost digit of A, appends it to their number, then erases that digit. They do this for exactly n moves each. At the end, S1 (Homer's number) and S2 (Marge's number) are compared, and the sum of their prizes is maximized. So the goal is to decide for each digit whether it's taken by H or M such that both take exactly n digits, and the total sum of their numbers is as large as possible.\n\nWait, but the prize isn't just the sum of the digits. Because when you form a number, the digits' positions matter in terms of their place value. For example, a '9' in the first position is worth 9000, whereas a '9' in the second is 900, etc. So the order in which the digits are added affects the total value.\n\nSo the challenge is to assign each digit to either H or M in such a way that:\n\n1. Exactly n digits go to H and n to M.\n2. The resulting numbers S1 and S2 are as large as possible when added together.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the output is the sequence of H and M, and the prize is S1 + S2. But wait, the problem statement says that the first player gets S1 dollars, the second S2. So the sum is S1 + S2. We need to maximize this sum.\n\nBut how? Because S1 is formed by appending digits, each digit is placed at the end of their current number. So the first digit taken is the most significant digit in their number.\n\nWait, let me think about the process. Let's say A is \"1234\" and n=2.\n\n- Turn 1: Player takes '1' and adds to their S. So if H takes it, S1 becomes '1', else '0'.\n- Turn 2: Next digit is '2'—again, H or M can take it.\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, but since the digits are being taken from the left, the order in which the digits are assigned to H and M affects the place value.\n\nSo the problem reduces to assigning each digit to either H or M, with exactly n digits each, such that the sum of the values of S1 and S2 is maximized.\n\nHmm, okay. So the key is to model this as a dynamic programming problem, where for each step, we track the number of digits taken by H and M so far, and also the current state of the remaining digits. But wait, considering that the digits are processed in order, the state would need to include the current position in the string.\n\nLet me think about the structure. Let's denote dp[i][h] as the maximum sum achievable when processing the first i digits, and h digits have been assigned to H so far. Similarly, m = i - h, since each step assigns one digit.\n\nWait, but the sum depends on the assignment of each digit to H or M. Since each digit's contribution depends on its position in S1 or S2, it's not straightforward. How can we model the sum?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the problem as choosing, for each position, whether to assign the digit to H or M, ensuring that exactly n are assigned to each. Then, for each digit, its contribution depends on where it's placed in S1 or S2.\n\nWait, but S1 is formed by the digits assigned to H, in the order they are taken. So the first digit assigned to H is the most significant, the next is less, etc. Similarly for S2.\n\nSo each digit's contribution to the sum depends on two factors: whether it's in H's number or M's, and the position in their respective numbers.\n\nThis seems complicated because the earlier digits have higher place values.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the DP state as follows:\n\nWe have a list of digits. For each step, we decide whether to assign the current digit to H or M, keeping track of how many digits each has taken so far.\n\nThe DP state could be something like dp[i][h][m], representing the maximum sum achievable after processing i digits, having assigned h digits to H and m digits to M. But since h + m = i, m = i - h, so we can simplify it to dp[i][h].\n\nThe transition would be: for each possible state, we can choose to assign the next digit to H or M, provided that we don't exceed n assignments for either.\n\nEach time we assign a digit to H",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for two players, Homer and Marge, in a game where they take turns picking digits from a given string to maximize their total prize. Each player must make exactly `n` moves, and the goal is to maximize the sum of their respective numbers formed by the digits they collect.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached using dynamic programming (DP). The key idea is to model the state of the game as we process each digit in the string. The DP state will track how many digits each player has collected so far and the maximum sum achievable at that point.\n\n1. **State Representation**: We use a 2D DP array `dp[i][h]` where `i` represents the number of digits processed, and `h` represents the number of digits collected by Homer. The value `dp[i][h]` will store the maximum sum achievable after processing `i` digits with Homer having collected `h` digits.\n\n2. **Transition**: For each digit, we have two choices: assign it to Homer or Marge. If we assign it to Homer, we update the state `dp[i+1][h+1]`, and if we assign it to Marge, we update the state `dp[i+1][h]`.\n\n3. **Initialization**: Start with an empty state where no digits have been processed and both players have collected zero digits.\n\n4. **Result Extraction**: After processing all digits, the result will be found in `dp[2n][n]`, which gives the maximum sum when both players have made exactly `n` moves.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\n\ndigits = [int(c) for c in A]\n\nINF = float('inf')\n\n# dp[i][h]: max sum after i digits processed, h assigned to H, m=i-h assigned to M\nmax_digits = len(digits)\ndp = [[-1 for _ in range(n + 1)] for __ in range(max_digits + 1)]\n\nfor i in range(max_digits + 1):\n    for h in range(n + 1):\n        if dp[i][h] == -1:\n            continue\n        if i < max_digits:\n            # Assign current digit to H\n            if h < n:\n                new_h = h + 1\n                place = 10 ** (max_digits - i - 1)\n                dp[i+1][new_h] = max(dp[i+1][new_h], dp[i][h] + digits[i] * place)\n            # Assign current digit to M\n            new_m = h  # since m = i - h, but since h can be up to i+1, not sure\n            place = 10 ** (max_digits - i - 1)\n            dp[i+1][new_m] = max(dp[i+1][new_m], dp[i][h] + digits[i] * place)\n\n# Now find the path\nresult = []\ncurrent_h = 0\ncurrent_sum = dp[2*n][n]\ni = 2*n\n\nwhile i > 0:\n    if dp[i-1][current_h] != current_sum:\n        # The current digit was assigned to H\n        result.append('H')\n        current_h += 1\n    else:\n        result.append('M')\n    i -= 1\n\nprint(''.join(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The DP table is initialized with `-1` to indicate unprocessed states. The initial state `dp[0][0]` is set to 0, representing that no digits have been processed and no moves have been made.\n\n2. **DP Transition**: For each digit, we consider assigning it to either Homer or Marge. The contribution of the digit to the sum depends on its position (place value) and whether it is assigned to Homer or Marge.\n\n3. **Backtracking to Find the Path**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from `dp[2n][n]` to determine the sequence of moves that led to this state. This involves checking whether the last move was made by Homer or Marge and constructing the result string accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible sequences of moves efficiently, leveraging dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum possible sum at each step.",
