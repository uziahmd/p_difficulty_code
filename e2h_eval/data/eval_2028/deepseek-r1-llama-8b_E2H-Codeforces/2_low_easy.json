Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X'. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe grid is n x n, where n is odd. The conditions for it being an 'X' are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same character.\n2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same character, which is different from the diagonal ones.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to check the two main diagonals. Both should consist of the same character. Then, all non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Read the input correctly. The first line is n, followed by n lines each containing n characters. But wait, in the example given, the input is presented as a list of strings, but each string ends with '\\n'. Oh right, because in Python, when you split the input, each line includes the newline. So I'll need to process each line to extract just the letters.\n\nWait, the input is given as a list of strings, but each string represents a row. So for example, the first sample input is 5x5, so the first element is \"xooox\\n\", then \"oxoxo\\n\", etc. So I need to split each line into individual characters, ignoring the newline.\n\nSo step 0: Read the input. For each of the next n lines, strip the newline and process each character.\n\n2. Once I have the grid, I need to check the two diagonals. For a grid, the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal is top-right to bottom-left.\n\nFor each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j, and on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n-1 (since indices start at 0).\n\n3. Check that all the main diagonal cells are the same. Similarly, all anti-diagonal cells are the same. Also, the two diagonals must have the same character.\n\nWait, no. Wait the condition says that both diagonals are the same. So the main diagonal's character must equal the anti-diagonal's character.\n\nYes. So first, collect the characters along both diagonals and see if they are all the same across both, and also between the two diagonals.\n\nThen, all other cells (non-diagonal) must be the same and different from the diagonal.\n\nSo let's break it down:\n\n- Collect the main diagonal's characters. They must all be the same. Let's call this char_dia.\n- Collect the anti-diagonal's characters. They must all be the same. And char_dia must equal this char.\n- Then, for all other cells not on either diagonal, check that they are all the same, and this same character is different from char_dia.\n\nWait, but what about cells that are on both diagonals? For n>1, the only cell that is on both diagonals is the center cell when n is odd. So for n=3, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So when checking, the center's character is part of both diagonals. So during the checks, the main diagonal includes the center, and the anti-diagonal also includes it. So the condition is that all main and anti-diagonal cells are the same.\n\nWait, no. The main diagonal includes the center, and the anti-diagonal does too. So their intersection is one cell. So when we collect the main and anti-diagonal, the center is counted in both.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the first condition is that both diagonals are the same. So all cells in both diagonals must be the same character.\n\nSo, for example, in the third test case of the sample:\n\n3\nx p x\np x p\nx p x\n\nWait, the main diagonal is x, x, x. The anti-diagonal is x, x, x. So both are same. Then, all non-diagonal cells are p's. So this would be a YES.\n\nAnother example: when n=3 and the grid is:\n\nw s w\ns w s\nw s w\n\nMain diagonal is w, w, w; anti is w, w, w. So both are same. The other cells are s, which is different. So YES.\n\nIn the sample input, the second case is 3x3 and outputs YES.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Read the grid correctly.\n\n2. Check that all main diagonal elements are the same. Let's say they are all c1.\n\n3. Check that all anti-diagonal elements are the same. Let's say they are all c2.\n\n4. Check that c1 equals c2.\n\n5. Now, check that all the other cells (non-diagonal) are the same, and that this value is",
