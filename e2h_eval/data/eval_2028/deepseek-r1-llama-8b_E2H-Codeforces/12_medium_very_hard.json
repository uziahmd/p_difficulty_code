The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, Xenia is in a city with houses arranged in a ring, right? She needs to do some tasks, and each task requires her to be at a certain house. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks.\n\nWait, the problem says that each task i must be done after all tasks j where j < i. So, for example, if her tasks are in the order a1, a2, ..., am, she has to handle them in that exact sequence. Or wait, no—does that mean that she can process them in any order as long as each task i is completed before task j if j comes later in the list? Or does the order have to be exactly a1 first, then a2, etc.? I think it's the latter because the note says that consecutive tasks can be done in the same house.\n\nWait, the second paragraph says: \"In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" Oh, okay, so the tasks must be processed in the order given. So the first task is a1, then a2, then a3, and so on until am. For each task ai, she must be present there, and all previous tasks (a1 to a_{i-1}) must have been done.\n\nSo the problem is about finding the minimal time to traverse the ring of houses such that she starts at 1, then goes through each task in order, possibly revisiting houses multiple times.\n\nNow, the ring is one-way clockwise. So moving from house x to x+1 is possible, but not back to x. Wait no, the ring is a loop, so the houses are arranged in a circle. So from any house, the next is the next in the clockwise direction. But movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction; you can't go counterclockwise. So from house n, the next is 1, then 2, etc.\n\nSo the movement is such that from house x, the next house is x mod n + 1, but wait, no, since the houses are numbered 1 to n in a circle. So for x = n, the next is 1.\n\nSo the movement is always in a clockwise direction. So the distance between two houses depends on whether you go the short way or the long way around the ring. But since movement is only allowed in one direction, the optimal path will always choose the shortest possible route.\n\nBut how does that affect the problem? Because Xenia has to move from her current position to the next required task, possibly making loops if that's more efficient.\n\nWait, but the key here is that the tasks are processed in order, so each step is moving from the current position to the next task's house, but perhaps taking the most efficient path along the ring.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal time is determined by the sum of the distances from the starting point (house 1) to each subsequent task, considering that each time she may have to make a loop around the ring to reach the target.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be modeled by looking at the positions of the tasks in the ring and determining the minimal steps needed to cover all of them in order.\n\nLet me think of an example. Take the sample input:\n\nFirst example:\nn=4, m=3\nTasks: 3,2,3\n\nShe starts at 1. The first task is 3. So she moves clockwise from 1 to 2, then to 3. That takes 2 steps. Then, the next task is 2. But since we're moving clockwise, from 3 to 4 is another step, then 4 to 1 (step 4), then 1 to 2 (step5). So now she's at 2 for the second task. Then, the third task is 3 again. From 2 to 3 is one step. Total steps: 2 (to 3) + 3 (to 2) + 1 (to 3) = 6 steps. Wait, wait. Or maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let's retrace the sample:\n\nShe starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. She moves from 1→2→3: 2 steps.\n\nSecond task is 2. She's currently at 3. To get to 2, she can either go the other way around the ring, but since movement is only clockwise, she must go 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps.\n\nThird task is 3 again. From 2, moving clockwise to 3 is 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 2+3+1=6. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is to model each step as the minimal steps required to go from the current position to the next task, considering that the movement is constrained to the clockwise direction.\n\nSo the key is, for each task after the first, compute the minimal number of steps needed to reach that task from the previous task's position, moving only in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, but what's the minimal steps? Because moving clockwise, the distance between two points x and y is (y -x) mod n, but if y >=x, it's y-x steps. If y <x, it's (n -x + y) steps.\n\nWait, for example, in a ring of 4 houses:\n\nFrom 3 to 2: the clockwise path is 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps.\n\nWhich is indeed (2 -3 +4) mod 4 = (3) steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the minimal steps to go from a to b is (b - a) mod n, but since movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction, that's the only way.\n\nWait, but wait. Suppose a is behind b. Like a is 3, b is 2. Then the clockwise path is longer, but it's the only option.\n\nSo the distance is (b - a) if b > a, else (n - a + b).\n\nSo for each pair of consecutive tasks, we need to calculate the distance from the previous position to the next task's position, and sum all those distances.\n\nAdditionally, the initial position is 1, so the first task is a1, so the distance from 1 to a1 is (a1 -1) if a1>1, else (n -1 + a1) steps.\n\nWait, no. Because 1 is the starting point. So for the first task, the distance is (a1 -1) if a1 >=1, else (n -1 + a1). But since a1 is at least 1, the first part is correct.\n\nSo, the total time is the sum of all the individual distances between consecutive tasks.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Sort the task list in the order they are given.\n\nWait, no. Because the order is fixed. The tasks must be processed in the given order. So the list a1, a2, ..., am is the order in which she must perform them. So for each i from 1 to m, she must go from the current position to a_i, and then do the task.\n\nSo, for each i from 2 to m, compute the distance from the previous position to a_i, add it to the total time.\n\nThe initial position is 1, so for the first task, the distance is from 1 to a1.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Initialize current_pos = 1\n\n- total_time = 0\n\n- for each task in the list:\n\n   - compute the distance from current_pos to this task\n\n   - add this distance to total_time\n\n   - update current_pos to this task\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's test this logic against the sample.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=4, m=3\n\ntasks: 3,2,3\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 3: distance is 3-1=2. So total_time becomes 2. current_pos is now 3.\n\nSecond task is 2: distance from 3 to 2 is (2-3) mod 4 = (2-3) +4=3. So add 3 → total_time=5. current_pos is 2.\n\nThird task is 3: distance from 2 to 3 is 1. Add 1 → total_time=6.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: input '4 3\\n2 3 3'\n\nSo the list is 2,3,3.\n\ncurrent_pos is 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: distance is 2-1=1. total_time=1.\n\ncurrent_pos is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: distance from 2 to3 is 1. total_time=2.\n\ncurrent_pos is3.\n\nThird task is3: distance 0. total_time remains 2.\n\nSo output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if all tasks are in order.\n\nLike n=5, m=3, tasks 1,2,3.\n\nStarts at 1.\n\nTask1: 1. distance 0. Time 0.\n\nTask2:2. distance 1.\n\nTime 1.\n\nTask3:3. distance 1. Time 2.\n\nTotal 2.\n\nAnother case: n=3, m=2, tasks 3,3.\n\nStarts at1.\n\nFirst task:3. distance is (3-1)=2. Time +=2 → 2.\n\nCurrent pos 3.\n\nSecond task:3. distance 0. Time remains 2.\n\nSo output is 2.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=3, tasks 5,4,5.\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst task:5. distance 5-1=4. Time 4.\n\nCurrent pos 5.\n\nSecond task:4. distance from5 to4: (4-5+5) =4. Time 8.\n\nCurrent pos4.\n\nThird task:5. distance 4 to5 is 1. Time 9.\n\nSo total 9.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nYes.\n\nSo the algorithm is to iterate over the tasks in the given order, compute the distance from the current position to the next task, sum these distances.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\nInitialize current_pos as 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nfor each a in the list:\n\n   distance = (a - current_pos) % n\n\n   # because for a <= current_pos, the distance is (n - current_pos + a)\n\n   # but wait, (a - current_pos) could be negative, so mod n gives the positive difference.\n\n   # So yes, the distance is (a - current_pos) % n.\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current_pos = a\n\nPrint total_time.\n\nWait, but wait: the mod operation in Python returns a non-negative result when the divisor is positive. So for a=2, current_pos=3, n=4: (2-3)=-1 mod4 is 3, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntime = 0\n\nfor a in tasks:\n    diff = (a - current) % n\n    time += diff\n    current = a\n\nprint(time)\n\nWait, but wait: in the first sample, the first a is 3, current is 1. 3-1=2 mod4 is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nIn the second sample, the first a is 2, current is1: 2-1=1 mod4=1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, a=4, current=5. 4-5= -1 mod5=4. Which is correct, as 5→1→2→3→4 is 4 steps.\n\nSo yes, the code should work.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the second a is 2, current is3: 2-3= -1 mod4=3, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the solution. The code is straightforward.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks if she starts at house number 1 and moves clockwise around a ring of houses. Each task must be completed in the given order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to complete tasks in a specific order. The movement is restricted to a one-way clockwise direction on the ring. The goal is to compute the minimal time required to move from the starting point to each subsequent task location.\n2. **Intuition**: For each task, the minimal time to reach it from the current position is determined by the shortest clockwise path on the ring. This can be calculated using modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ring.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Start from house 1.\n   - For each task, compute the clockwise distance from the current house to the task's house using modulo operation.\n   - Sum these distances to get the total time.\n4. **Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(m) time, where m is the number of tasks, making it efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntime = 0\n\nfor a in tasks:\n    diff = (a - current) % n\n    time += diff\n    current = a\n\nprint(time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`, followed by the list of tasks.\n2. **Initialization**: Xenia starts at house 1 (`current = 1`), and the total time is initialized to 0.\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task in the list, the code calculates the clockwise distance from the current house to the task's house using `(a - current) % n`. This distance is added to the total time.\n4. **Updating Position**: After processing each task, the current position is updated to the task's house.\n5. **Output**: Finally, the total time is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time required by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic to handle the circular movement constraint.",
