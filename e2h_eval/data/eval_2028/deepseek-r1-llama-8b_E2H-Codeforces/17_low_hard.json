He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Prefixes and Suffixes.\" Hmm, Ivan has a string s of length n, and I don't know it. He tells me all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so from lengths 1 to n-1). But he doesn't say which are which—whether they're prefixes or suffixes. My task is to determine for each of the 2n-2 given strings whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the actual string s. And output a string of 'P' and 'S' accordingly.\n\nWait, but how? Because the input gives me all these strings in arbitrary order. So I need to figure out which ones are prefixes and which are suffixes.\n\nHmm, let's think about the structure of the possible correct string. Each proper prefix must be a prefix of the string, and each proper suffix must be a suffix. Also, the correct string must have a certain relationship between its prefixes and suffixes.\n\nAn approach comes to mind: find the longest possible prefix that is also a suffix. Because for a string s, the longest prefix that's also a suffix is called the period, right? Or wait, maybe the point where the prefix and suffix meet is important here.\n\nWait, another idea: the correct string will have a certain structure where some of the given strings are prefixes and others are suffixes. The key is to find for each possible string whether it can be formed by combining the prefixes and suffixes correctly.\n\nBut since the input is a mix of all prefixes and suffixes, perhaps I can model this by trying to reconstruct the string step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps the first step is to group the given strings by their length. Because all strings of length k are either prefixes or suffixes of s. So for each k from 1 to n-1, there are two strings: one is a prefix, one is a suffix.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each possible candidate string, check if it satisfies the condition that all the given strings are either a prefix or a suffix of it.\n   But wait, the problem says that the given strings are exactly all the prefixes and suffixes of some existing string. So there exists at least one string that fits. We need to find such a string, then assign P and S based on whether each input string is a prefix or a suffix of it.\n\nBut how do I find such a string?\n\nAnother thought: the candidate string must have a certain property regarding the given strings. For example, the first character of the string must be a prefix, and the last character must be a suffix. Wait, no. Because the prefixes include all the strings of varying lengths starting from the beginning, and the suffixes include all the strings starting from the end.\n\nSo perhaps the candidate string is built by considering that for each position, the next character must match the corresponding positions in the given prefixes and suffixes.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the candidate string that can be formed by choosing the order of the prefixes and suffixes such that when you concatenate a prefix and a suffix, they form the string, possibly overlapping.\n\nLet me think: for the candidate string s of length n, let's denote that the maximum possible prefix that is also a suffix is the point where the prefixes and suffixes meet. So for example, if s is \"ababa\", then the maximum prefix which is also a suffix is \"ab\". So the candidate string can be split into a prefix part and a suffix part that overlaps with the prefix.\n\nWait, this might not directly help. Maybe I should consider the following approach:\n\nThe candidate string must be such that for every proper prefix, it is indeed a prefix, and for every proper suffix, it is indeed a suffix.\n\nSo, how to construct the candidate string.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the candidate string as follows:\n\nWe can iterate through possible split points where the prefix ends and the suffix begins. For each possible split, we can try to build the candidate string and see if it satisfies all the given constraints.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the candidate string can be constructed by combining a prefix and a suffix, ensuring that the suffix starts at some position after the prefix.\n\nFor instance, suppose the candidate string is made up of a prefix p of length k and a suffix t of length m, such that k + m = n. But wait, no, because the suffix could start before the end of the prefix. So for example, in \"ababa\", the prefix \"aba\" and the suffix \"aba\" would overlap.\n\nSo the general case is that the string can be seen as a combination of a prefix and a suffix that may overlap.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit tricky. So perhaps the way to approach this is to find a way to combine the given prefixes and suffixes to form the candidate string s, and then check if all the given strings are either prefixes or",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of a hidden string `s` of length `n`. The input provides all the proper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, and our task is to classify each string as either 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Candidate String**: The candidate string must be such that it includes all given prefixes and suffixes. We can construct this candidate string by considering all possible ways to combine the given prefixes and suffixes.\n2. **Check Validity of Each String**: For each possible candidate string, verify if all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of this candidate string.\n3. **Determine Classification**: Once the correct candidate string is identified, classify each input string as 'P' if it is a prefix of the candidate string, otherwise classify it as 'S'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nstrings = []\nfor _ in range(2 * n - 2):\n    s = input().strip()\n    strings.append(s)\n\n# Group the strings by their lengths\nlength_groups = {}\nfor s in strings:\n    l = len(s)\n    if l not in length_groups:\n        length_groups[l] = []\n    length_groups[l].append(s)\n\n# Try to find the correct string by combining the groups\ncandidate = None\n\n# Check all possible ways to combine the first part and the second part\nfor k in range(1, n):\n    for pre in length_groups.get(k, []):\n        for suf in length_groups.get(n - k, []):\n            # Combine prefix and suffix, check if they form a valid string\n            candidate = pre + suf\n            # Ensure the total length is n\n            if len(candidate) != n:\n                continue\n            # Now, check if all given strings are either prefixes or suffixes\n            valid = True\n            for s in strings:\n                if s in length_groups[k]:\n                    # This should be a prefix\n                    if not candidate.startswith(s):\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                elif s in length_groups[n - len(pre) if len(pre) < n else 0]:\n                    # Wait, this part is tricky.

This ensures we consider all possible ways the string could be formed.\n3. **Validation**: For each candidate string, we check if all given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of the candidate.\n4. **Classification**: Once the correct candidate string is identified, we classify each input string as 'P' or 'S' based on whether it is a prefix or suffix of the candidate.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible candidate strings and validates them against the given constraints, ensuring we find a consistent solution.",
