    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Minimum Ternary String. Hmm. So, the task is to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing certain swap operations. \n\nWait, the allowed swaps are only between '0' and '1' if they are adjacent, and between '1' and '2' if they are adjacent. So, for example, you can't swap a '0' and a '2' directly because they aren't adjacent in the swap rules. Oh right, that's an important point.\n\nSo the string consists of 0s, 1s, and 2s. And we can only swap adjacent 0 and 1, or 1 and 2. The goal is to rearrange the string as much as possible using these swaps to get the lex smallest possible string.\n\nHmm. So how do I approach this? Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's consider the order of the characters. Since we can swap 0 and 1, their relative positions can be adjusted. Similarly, 1 and 2 can be swapped, but 0 and 2 can't be swapped directly. So, what does that mean for the ordering?\n\nLet's think about the possible orderings. For 0 and 1, since they can be swapped, their order can be rearranged. But for 0 and 2, since you can't swap them directly, their relative positions depend on other swaps.\n\nWait, but perhaps 0 can be moved past 1s, but not directly past 2s. So maybe the 0s can be reordered among themselves and with 1s, but 2s have to stay in their relative order with respect to each other and to 0s unless there's a 1 in between.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should model the problem differently.\n\nAnother approach: for each position in the string, determine what is the earliest possible character that can appear there given the allowed swaps.\n\nBut considering the allowed swaps, maybe the characters can be grouped into two categories: those that can be swapped among themselves and others. Wait, 0s and 1s can be swapped, so any 0 and 1 can be reordered relative to each other. Similarly, 1s and 2s can be reordered relative to each other. But 0s and 2s can't be directly swapped, so their order is fixed unless there's a 1 between them.\n\nWait, wait. Because 0 and 1 can be swapped, any 0 can be moved past 1s, but to move a 0 past a 2, you'd need to have a 1 in between. Because 1 and 2 can be swapped. So for example, if I have a 0 followed by a 2, without a 1 in between, I can't swap them. But if there's a 1 somewhere after the 0, then maybe I can move the 1 next to the 0, swap the 0 and 1, and then proceed.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think about the relative order of 0s, 1s, and 2s. Since 0 and 1 can be swapped, all 0s and 1s can be arranged in any order relative to each other. Similarly, all 1s and 2s can be arranged in any order relative to each other. But 0s cannot pass through 2s unless there's a 1 involved.\n\nWait no, that's not exactly correct. Let's say the string is \"021\". Can I rearrange it to \"012\"? Or \"102\"?\n\nWait, let's see. The original string is 0,2,1. Can I perform any swaps? Well, 0 and 2 can't be swapped. But 2 and 1 can be swapped because they are adjacent. So swapping them would make it 0,1,2. Then, can I swap 0 and 1? Yes, because they are adjacent. So the final string could be 1,0,2. Or 0,1,2 is also possible. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that 0s can be placed anywhere relative to 1s, but their relative order with respect to 2s depends on whether there are 1s in between.\n\nHmm. Maybe the approach is to process the string and arrange the 0s first, then the 1s, then the 2s, but that's probably not correct because sometimes a 2 can come before a 0 if it's not possible to move the 0 past it.\n\nWait, but how? Because 0 and 2 can't be directly swapped. So, the relative order between 0 and 2 can't be changed unless a 1 is present between them.\n\nWait, but maybe through a series of swaps, 0 can move past 2 if there's a 1 in between. Let's see: suppose the string is \"02\". Since we can't swap them, that's the minimum possible. But if it's \"021\", can I make it \"012\"?\n\nWait, let's see: 0,2,1. Swap 2 and 1 to get 0,1,2. Now, can I swap 0 and 1? Yes, so the string becomes 1,0,2. That's worse. Alternatively, is there a way to bring 1 closer to 0, then swap 0 and 1?\n\nWait, no. Because 0 and 1 are adjacent, so swapping is allowed. So in the initial string \"021\", the 2 is before 1. So I can swap 2 and 1 to get \"012\". Then, 0 is before 1, which is allowed. So the string becomes \"012\". Which is lex smaller than \"021\". So yes, that's better.\n\nSo, in that case, the 2 was able to move after 1, allowing the 0 to come before 1.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the relative order of 0s and 2s can be changed if there's a 1 in between. So, for the purpose of finding the lex smallest string, 0s can be arranged as early as possible, followed by 1s, followed by 2s, but with some flexibility based on where the 1s are.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal lex string can be achieved by grouping 0s first, then 1s, then 2s, but with the 0s and 1s being able to be reordered among themselves, and 1s and 2s as well.\n\nWait, but in the example given:\n\nInput: '100210'\n\nThe output is '001120'.\n\nSo the input is '1','0','0','2','1','0'. The output is '0','0','1','1','2','0'.\n\nSo the 0s are moved to the front, followed by 1s, and then 2, then 0. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the output is '001120'. So after the initial 0s, the 1s come, then the 2, then another 0. How is that possible?\n\nWait, maybe the 2 can be moved forward by swapping with 1s. Let's see.\n\nIn the input '100210', the 2 is at position 3 (0-based index 3). To get it earlier, perhaps we need to swap it with the 1s before it. So let's see:\n\nThe input is 1,0,0,2,1,0.\n\nWe can swap the 2 with the 1 before it. So step by step:\n\n- After the 2, there's a 1. So swap them: 2 and 1 become 1 and 2. So now, the string becomes 1,0,0,1,2,0.\n\nThen, the 2 is at position 4. Now, can we swap it with the 1 at position 3? Yes, because 1 and 2 can be swapped. So swap 1 and 2: the string becomes 1,0,0,2,1,0.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. Hmm, maybe I'm not thinking correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about the problem as follows: 0s can be reordered among themselves and with 1s, but 2s can only be reordered with 1s. So the 0s can be moved past 1s, but can't directly move past 2s unless via 1s.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Arrange all the 0s as far left as possible, subject to the constraints that they can be moved past 1s but not 2s.\n\n2. Then arrange the 1s, moving them past 2s as needed.\n\nBut wait, how to handle the 2s? Because 1s can be swapped with 2s, so 2s can be moved to the right past 1s, but not left past 1s unless via 0s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal string is built by first placing all 0s as far left as possible, then arranging the 1s and 2s in such a way that 1s come before 2s wherever possible.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because 0 is the smallest, so all 0s should come before 1s and 2s. Then, within the 1s and 2s, 1 comes before 2.\n\nSo the approach is to split the string into three parts: 0s, then 1s, then 2s, but considering that 1s and 2s can be reordered.\n\nWait, but how can 2s be reordered? Because 1s and 2s can be swapped. So, if a 2 is to the left of a 1, it can be swapped, resulting in 1 being before 2. So, in the 1s and 2s part, the 1s can be moved to the left past 2s, but 2s can't be moved left past 1s unless via 0s.\n\nWait, perhaps the 1s and 2s can be arranged in any order, but with 1s as far left as possible.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n1. Collect all 0s and place them as far left as possible.\n\n2. Then, collect all 1s and 2s, and arrange them such that 1s come before 2s as much as possible.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n- Iterate through the string, and collect the 0s first, but when a 0 is encountered, move it as far left as possible, considering that 0s can be swapped with 1s.\n\nWait, but 0s can be swapped with 1s, so any 0 can be moved past any number of 1s to the left. So, in the first pass, all 0s can be moved to the front, but the order of the 0s among themselves can't be changed because they can only be swapped with 1s, not with each other. Wait, no, 0s can be swapped among themselves? No, because 0s are only allowed to be swapped with 1s, not with each other. Wait, the problem statement says you can swap any two adjacent 0 and 1, or 1 and 2. So, 0s can't be swapped with other 0s. So, the order of 0s is fixed; you can't reorder 0s among themselves. Only 0s can be moved past 1s.\n\nOh! That's a crucial point I missed earlier. So 0s cannot be reordered among themselves. Because you can't swap two 0s. Similarly, 2s can't be reordered among themselves. Because you can't swap two 2s. So the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed unless there's a 1 between them.\n\nWait, so that changes everything. So, the initial string has a certain number of 0s, 1s, and 2s, and their relative order is fixed except for the 0s and 1s, and 1s and 2s.\n\nSo, the 0s can't be reordered among themselves. So the first occurrence of 0 in the string will always be the first 0 in the output, and so on.\n\nSimilarly for 2s: their relative order can't be changed unless 1s are involved.\n\nSo, this complicates things.\n\nHmm, okay, so let's reevaluate.\n\nEach 0 must appear in the same order as they appear in the input. Similarly for 2s. Only 1s can be reordered relative to 0s and 2s, but 1s can't be reordered among themselves because you can't swap two 1s directly.\n\nWait, wait. Because 1s can be swapped with 0s and 2s, but not among themselves. So the relative order of 1s depends on the presence of 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, for example, if the string is \"1102\", can the 1s be reordered? No, because you can't swap two 1s directly. So their relative order remains as 1,1,0,2.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the 0 is after the first 1. So can the first 1 be moved past the 0? Because 1 and 0 can be swapped.\n\nYes, because 1 and 0 are adjacent. So the 1 can be swapped with 0, resulting in 0,1,1,2.\n\nSo, in this case, the 0 moves to the front, pushing the 1 back.\n\nSo, the relative order of the 0s is fixed, but the 1s can be moved around as needed.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- The 0s must appear in the same order as in the input.\n\n- The 2s must appear in the same order as in the input.\n\n- The 1s can be moved around, but their relative order is determined by how they interact with 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, but 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s, but their own order among themselves can't be changed because you can't swap two 1s.\n\nSo, the 1s can only be reordered relative to 0s and 2s, but not among themselves.\n\nWait, no. Because 1s can be swapped with 0s and 2s, but the relative order of 1s can change based on their interaction with 0s and 2s.\n\nFor example, if you have two 1s separated by a 0, you can swap the first 1 with the 0, making the 0 come before the 1, and then swap the 0 with the next 1, leading to the two 1s being in reverse order.\n\nWait, but that's only possible if the 0 is between them. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the string is \"101\". So the two 1s are separated by a 0. Can the first 1 be moved to the right past the 0, and the second 1 be moved left past the 0?\n\nWell, the first 1 can be swapped with the 0 to get \"011\". Then, the second 1 can be swapped with the 0 to get \"110\". So the relative order of the two 1s is reversed.\n\nSo, in this case, the 1s can be reordered among themselves by passing through a 0.\n\nSo, this suggests that the relative order of 1s can be changed, but only by having 0s in between. So, 1s can be reordered as long as they can be moved through 0s.\n\nSimilarly, 1s can be reordered with 2s, because they can be swapped.\n\nSo, this complicates things further.\n\nHmm. So the problem is more complex than initially thought.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the optimal way to approach the problem is to collect the 0s first, then arrange the 1s and 2s in such a way that 1s come before 2s as much as possible, considering their relative positions.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal string is constructed by greedily placing the smallest possible character at each position, considering the allowed swaps.\n\nSo, for each position, we want the smallest possible character that can be moved to that position using the allowed swaps.\n\nBut the question is, how to determine what characters can be moved to a given position.\n\nWait, for each character in the string, we can track its movement possibilities.\n\nBut with a string length up to 1e5, we need an O(n) solution.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think about the allowed swaps again.\n\n0 and 1 can be swapped, but 0 and 2 cannot. 1 and 2 can be swapped, but 1 and 0 can be swapped.\n\nWait, perhaps the relative order of 0s and 2s can be modified as follows:\n\nIf a 0 appears before a 2, it can't be moved past the 2 unless there's a 1 in between. Because without a 1, 0 and 2 can't be swapped, so their order is fixed.\n\nBut if a 0 appears after a 2, can it be moved to the front?\n\nYes, because 0 can be swapped with 1s, and if there are 1s after the 0, then those 1s can be moved past the 0, allowing the 0 to be moved towards the beginning.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as follows:\n\n- All 0s can be moved to the left as much as possible, but their relative order is fixed.\n\n- All 2s can be moved to the right as much as possible, but their relative order is fixed.\n\nWait, but 2s can be moved to the right by swapping with 1s.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because 2s can't be moved past 1s unless there's a 1 before them.\n\nWait, perhaps the 2s can be moved to the right by swapping with 1s, but 1s can be moved to the left past 2s.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal lex string is obtained by processing the string from left to right, and at each step choosing the smallest possible character available, given the allowed swaps.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: group the 0s, 1s, and 2s, and for each group, process them in a way that allows the smallest possible arrangement.\n\nWait, but considering that 0s and 2s can't be directly swapped, but can be moved via 1s.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach can work:\n\n- First, collect all the 0s in their original order. They form a prefix.\n\n- Then, for the remaining part of the string, which consists of 1s and 2s, arrange them in such a way that all 1s come before 2s, but respecting their original order.\n\nWait, but how can that be done?\n\nBecause 1s and 2s can be swapped, so their relative order can be adjusted.\n\nWait, for example, if in the remaining part, a 2 comes before a 1, we can swap them to get 1 before 2. So, the minimal arrangement would have all 1s before 2s, regardless of their original order.\n\nSo, the idea is:\n\n1. All 0s are placed first, in their original order.\n\n2. Then, all the 1s and 2s are arranged such that all 1s come before 2s, and their relative order among themselves is adjusted as per the allowed swaps.\n\nWait, but in the case where a 2 is before a 1 in the original string, but can't be moved past the 1 because of other constraints.\n\nWait, no. Because 1 and 2 can be swapped, so any 2 that comes after a 1 in the original string can be moved to the left past that 1, and vice versa.\n\nWait, let's take an example.\n\nOriginal string: 2,1.\n\nCan they be swapped? Yes. So the string becomes 1,2.\n\nSo, in the remaining part, any 2 can be moved past 1s to the right, but that's not helpful for the minimal lex string. Wait, no. Because for the minimal lex string, we want 1s to come before 2s.\n\nSo, for the remaining part, the minimal arrangement is all 1s first, followed by all 2s, but their relative order can be adjusted as needed.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Place all 0s in their original order.\n\n- Then, arrange the 1s and 2s in the order that is lex smallest, which is all 1s first, followed by all 2s, but with the ability to swap 1 and 2.\n\nWait, but how? Because the 1s and 2s can be reordered, but their relative order may have been different in the original string.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal arrangement for the 1s and 2s is to have all 1s come before 2s, regardless of their original order. Because you can swap any 2 and 1 pair.\n\nSo, for the 1s and 2s part, the lex smallest arrangement is all 1s followed by all 2s.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWait, let's see. Suppose the remaining part is \"21\", which is a 2 followed by a 1. We can swap them to get \"12\".\n\nSo, the minimal arrangement is indeed 1 followed by 2.\n\nAnother example: \"1212\". After processing, the minimal arrangement is \"1122\".\n\nSo, yes, the 1s can be moved to the left past 2s, and the 2s can be moved to the right past 1s as needed.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Extract all 0s in their original order and place them first.\n\n2. Then, extract all 1s and 2s, and arrange them in such a way that all 1s come before 2s, in their original order.\n\nWait, no, because the 1s can be reordered among themselves as well. Because two 1s can be swapped if there's a 0 or 2 between them, but that's not allowed. Because you can't swap two 1s directly.\n\nWait, no, you can't swap two 1s directly. So their relative order is fixed unless a 0 or 2 is in between.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThe 1s can be reordered relative to 0s and 2s, but their own relative order can change only if they are separated by 0s or 2s.\n\nFor example, in the string \"1102\", the two 1s can be reordered by moving the 0 between them, allowing the 1s to swap places.\n\nSo, the relative order of 1s can be changed by passing through 0s or 2s.\n\nBut in the case where two 1s are adjacent, their order is fixed.\n\nSo, the relative order of 1s in the string can be modified by their proximity to 0s and 2s.\n\nThis suggests that the 1s can be rearranged in a way that allows them to be ordered as left as possible, considering the 0s and 2s as possible pathways.\n\nBut for the problem, perhaps the minimal arrangement is achieved by:\n\n- All 0s first, in their original order.\n\n- Then, all 1s, in their original order, but possibly reordered by moving them past 0s and 2s.\n\n- Then, all 2s, in their original order, but possibly reordered by moving them past 1s.\n\nWait, but how to model that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s can be arranged in a way that allows them to be as left as possible, considering that they can be swapped with 0s and 2s.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal string is formed by:\n\n- All 0s, in their original order.\n\n- Then, all 1s, arranged as left as possible, considering that each 1 can be moved past 0s and 2s.\n\n- Then, all 2s, arranged as right as possible, considering that each 2 can be moved past 1s.\n\nWait, but how to compute this.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way to proceed is as follows:\n\n- The 0s are fixed in their order.\n\n- For the 1s and 2s, create a new string where all 1s come before 2s, regardless of their original order, but preserving the relative order among 1s and 2s as much as possible.\n\nWait, but that's not accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal arrangement is to have all 0s, followed by all 1s, followed by all 2s, but with the 1s and 2s arranged in such a way that any 1 comes before any 2, even if originally the 2 was before the 1.\n\nBecause 1s and 2s can be swapped.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Collect all 0s in their original order. These form the first part of the result.\n\n2. Collect all 1s and 2s, and arrange them in such a way that all 1s come before 2s, and the relative order of 1s and 2s is such that 1s are as left as possible, and 2s as right as possible.\n\nWait, but how to do that.\n\nAnother approach: for the 1s and 2s part, the minimal arrangement is to have all 1s first, followed by all 2s, but maintaining their original order relative to each other. Because 1s can be moved past 2s, so any 2 that comes before a 1 can be swapped to put the 1 before the 2.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, for the 1s and 2s part:\n\n- We need to create a string where all 1s are first, followed by all 2s.\n\nBut wait, that's not quite right. Because, for example, if the original string is \"211\", the 1s and 2s part is \"2\",\"1\",\"1\". We can swap the 2 and the first 1 to get \"121\", then swap again to get \"112\". So the minimal arrangement is \"112\".\n\nWhich is all 1s followed by all 2s.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: \"1212\" â†’ after processing, becomes \"1122\".\n\nSo, yes, the 1s are moved to the front, followed by 2s.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Extract all 0s in their original order, and place them at the beginning.\n\n2. For the remaining part, process the 1s and 2s, and arrange them such that all 1s come before 2s, while preserving the relative order of the 1s and 2s as much as possible.\n\nWait, but wait: the relative order of 1s among themselves can be changed if they are separated by 0s or 2s.\n\nSo, in the 1s and 2s part, the 1s can be reordered among themselves to achieve the lex smallest arrangement.\n\nSo, for the 1s, their order can be rearranged as necessary, but only by moving them past 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAn alternative idea: for the 1s and 2s part, the minimal lex string is obtained by taking all 1s first, in their original order, but moving them as far left as possible, and then taking all 2s, moving them as far right as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal arrangement for the 1s and 2s part is to have all 1s come before all 2s, but the 1s are arranged in the same order as they appeared in the original string, but possibly reordered by moving past 2s, and the 2s are arranged in the same order as they appeared, but possibly reordered by moving past 1s.\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s and 2s can be arranged in any order, as long as all 1s are before 2s, and their own relative orders can be adjusted as needed.\n\nSo, the way to construct the minimal string is:\n\n- Collect all 0s in their original order.\n\n- Then, collect all 1s and 2s, and arrange them in such a way that all 1s come before 2s, and within the 1s and 2s, the order is such that 1s are as left as possible, and 2s are as right as possible.\n\nWait, but how to do that.\n\nPerhaps, for the 1s and 2s part, we can count the number of 1s and 2s, and then arrange them in such a way that all 1s are first, followed by all 2s.\n\nBut that's not considering their original order.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the 1s can be swapped with 2s, so the relative order between 1 and 2 can be altered.\n\nSo, the 1s can be moved to the left past any 2s, and 2s can be moved to the right past any 1s.\n\nThus, in the 1s and 2s part, the lex smallest arrangement is all 1s followed by all 2s, regardless of their original order.\n\nBut wait, that's not exactly correct.\n\nBecause, for example, if the original string is \"201\", the 2 is before the 0, which is before the 1.\n\nBut 0 can't be moved past 2, so the 0 remains after the 2.\n\nWait, no. Because 0 and 2 can't be swapped, so their order is fixed. So, the 0 can't be moved past the 2.\n\nWait, but in that case, the 1 is after the 0. Can the 1 be moved past the 0?\n\nYes, because 0 and 1 can be swapped. So, the 1 can be moved to the left past the 0, resulting in \"210\".\n\nWait, no. Because the string is \"201\", which is '2','0','1'. Swapping 0 and 1 gives '2','1','0'. Then, can the 2 and 1 be swapped? Yes, so the string becomes '1','2','0'.\n\nSo, the minimal arrangement is '102'? Or wait, after swapping 0 and 1, it's '2','1','0'. Then, swap 2 and 1 to get '1','2','0'.\n\nBut the 2 is still before the 0, which can't be swapped. So the 0 remains after the 2.\n\nWait, but the 0 is after the 2 in the minimal arrangement, which is worse than having the 0 before the 2.\n\nHmm, but in the original string, the 0 is between the 2 and the 1. So, can the 0 be moved to the front?\n\nWait, the 0 can be moved past the 1, but not past the 2.\n\nWait, in \"201\", the 0 is between 2 and 1.\n\nSo, the 0 can be swapped with the 1 to become '210', then the 2 can be swapped with 1 to become '120'. So the 0 is after the 2.\n\nBut that's not better. So, the minimal string is '120'.\n\nBut according to our previous approach, the 0s are placed first, then 1s, then 2s. But in this case, the 0 is after the 2, which can't be moved past the 2.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimal string is '120'.\n\nWait, but according to our previous idea of placing 0s first, then 1s, then 2s, the 0 can't be moved past the 2, so it remains after the 2.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- 0s first, in their original order.\n\n- Then, 1s and 2s arranged so that 1s come before 2s.\n\nBut in the case where a 0 is after a 2, it can't be moved past the 2, so the 0 remains after the 2.\n\nSo, the overall minimal arrangement is:\n\nAll 0s, in their original order, followed by all 1s and 2s arranged such that 1s come before 2s, with their own relative orders preserved as much as possible.\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient because 1s can be reordered among themselves.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- Collect all 0s in their original order.\n\n- Then, collect all 1s and 2s, and within that, arrange them in a way that all 1s come before 2s, and the 1s are arranged as left as possible, considering their ability to be swapped with 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the 1s can be reordered as much as possible to the left, but their relative order among themselves is fixed unless they are separated by 0s or 2s.\n\nThis is getting a bit too abstract.\n\nPerhaps, instead of trying to model the entire process, I can think of an algorithm that processes the string and builds the minimal string by greedily choosing the smallest possible character at each step, considering the allowed swaps.\n\nHere's an idea:\n\n- Iterate through the string, and for each position, decide what's the smallest possible character that can be placed there.\n\n- Once a character is placed, remove it from the pool of available characters.\n\nBut how to track which characters can be placed next.\n\nWait, perhaps using a greedy approach, at each step, find the earliest possible occurrence of the smallest possible character that can be moved to the current position.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think about the allowed swaps.\n\n0 can be swapped with 1, but not with 2.\n\n1 can be swapped with 0 and 2.\n\nSo, 0 can be moved past 1s, but not past 2s unless there's a 1 in between.\n\nSimilarly, 2 can be moved past 1s, but not past 0s unless there's a 1 in between.\n\nThis seems complex.\n\nAnother approach is to model the problem as a graph, where each node represents a character, and edges represent allowed swaps. But that might not be helpful for a programming competition problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into two separate passes: one for 0s and 1s, and another for 1s and 2s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key insight is that 0s can be moved past 1s, but 2s can be moved past 1s. So, 0s can be moved past 1s, which can in turn be moved past 2s.\n\nSo, 0s can effectively be moved past 2s via 1s.\n\nWait, for example, if a 0 is after a 2, and there's a 1 between them, the 0 can be moved past the 1, and then the 1 can be moved past the 2, allowing the 0 to be before the 2.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the 0 can be moved past the 2 by using the 1 as an intermediary.\n\nSo, 0s can be moved past 2s, provided that there's at least one 1 between them.\n\nSimilarly, 2s can be moved past 0s, provided that there's at least one 1 between them.\n\nSo, this suggests that 0s and 2s can be reordered relative to each other if there's a 1 in between.\n\nIn that case, perhaps all 0s can be moved to the front, regardless of their original order, as long as there's a path through 1s.\n\nWait, but what if a 0 is in between a 2 and a 1? Like 2-0-1. Then, the 0 can be moved to the front by swapping with the 1, resulting in 0-1-2, then the 1 can be swapped with 2 to get 0-2-1. But that's worse.\n\nWait, but the goal is to get the lex smallest string.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to think that 0s can be moved to the front as much as possible, and 2s can be moved to the end as much as possible, considering that 1s can act as intermediaries.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\n- Move all 0s to the front, in their original order, but interleaving with 1s.\n\n- Then, move all 1s to the front, interleaving with 2s.\n\nWait, but how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal string is achieved by:\n\n- All 0s in their original order, then all 1s in their original order, then all 2s in their original order.\n\nBut that's not correct because the 1s can be reordered relative to 2s.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- 0s first, in their original order.\n\n- Then, arrange the 1s and 2s such that all 1s come before 2s, and their relative order is adjusted as needed.\n\nWait, but the 1s and 2s can be reordered arbitrarily.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal string is:\n\n0s + all 1s and 2s arranged as 111...222.\n\nBut that ignores their original order.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, let's look at the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: '100210' â†’ Output: '001120'\n\nOriginal string: 1,0,0,2,1,0.\n\nSo, the 0s are at positions 1, 2, 5.\n\nThey are in the order 0,0,0",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing allowed swaps on a given ternary string.

Similarly, '1's can be reordered with both '0's and '2's. The goal is to place '0's as far left as possible, followed by '1's, and then '2's.\n\n1. **Collect '0's**: Extract all '0's from the string and place them at the beginning of the result.\n2. **Process '1's and '2's**: For the remaining part of the string, process '1's and '2's such that all '1's come before '2's, ensuring the smallest lexicographical order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    # Collect all 0s first\n    zeros = []\n    ones_and_twos = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '0':\n            zeros.append(c)\n        else:\n            ones_and_twos.append(c)\n    \n    # Now process ones and twos: move all 1s to the front, then 2s\n    processed = []\n    # Collect all 1s and 2s, keeping their relative order but moving 1s as left as possible\n    # So, for each character in ones_and_twos, if it's a 1, add to processed immediately\n    # Else, collect 2s until a 1 is found\n    # Wait, no.

We count the number of '1's and '2's and construct a new string where all '1's come before '2's, ensuring the smallest lexicographical order.
