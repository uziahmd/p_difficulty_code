On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"A Twisty Movement\" and involves sequences of numbers. Hmm.\n\nSo, the problem statement says that Tommy wants to choose an interval [l, r] in the sequence and reverse the subarray from l to r. After doing this, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the new sequence.\n\nWait, right. The original sequence consists of 1s and 2s because each ai is either 1 or 2. So the initial array is made up of just these two numbers.\n\nThe task is to find the best reversal such that when you reverse a certain subarray, the LNDS is as long as possible.\n\nHmm. Okay, let's think about how to approach this. Since n is up to 2000, which isn't too big, but trying all possible intervals [l, r] would be O(n^2) possibilities. For each interval, we'd have to compute the LNDS of the modified array. But computing LNDS for each modified array might be expensive if done naively.\n\nWhat's the standard way to compute the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence? Oh right, it's O(n log n) using a patience sorting-like algorithm. But if we have to do this for every possible reversed subarray, that's going to be O(n^3 log n), which for n=2000 would be 2000^3 * something, which is way too big—like 8e10 operations. That's definitely not feasible.\n\nSo, we need a smarter approach. Let's think about the structure of the problem.\n\nGiven that the array consists only of 1s and 2s, perhaps there's some pattern or property we can exploit.\n\nWait, after reversing a subarray, the LNDS will depend on how the 1s and 2s are arranged. The LNDS is maximized when we have as many consecutive 1s followed by 2s as possible. Because in a non-decreasing sequence, all 1s come first, then 2s.\n\nSo, maybe the optimal reversal is one that groups all 1s together and 2s together. Or perhaps not necessarily all, but as much as possible.\n\nLet me think: the LNDS without any reversal is just the count of 1s plus the count of 2s after them. Wait no, because the order matters. Wait, the LNDS in the original array can be found quickly.\n\nBut after reversing a subarray, the arrangement of 1s and 2s changes. So, the LNDS depends on the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before 2s.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find a reversal that allows for as many 1s as possible to precede the 2s, thereby increasing the LNDS.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LNDS is simply the maximum between the number of 1s and the number of 2s. But that can't be right because sometimes they can be interleaved in a way that gives a longer subsequence.\n\nWait, for example, in the sample input:\n\nFirst sample:\nOriginal array: 1 2 1 2\nReversed [2,3], which swaps the 2 and 1, making it 1 1 2 2. So the LNDS is 4.\n\nThe total number of 1s is 2 and 2s is 2. So in this case, the maximum is achieved by grouping all 1s together and 2s together, giving a LNDS equal to the sum, which is 4.\n\nIn the second sample:\nOriginal array: 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1\nAfter reversing [3,7], which is positions 3-7 inclusive. Let's see:\nOriginal positions 3-7: 2,2,1,1,2. Reversed becomes 2,1,1,2,2.\nSo the new array is [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]. Now, the LNDS is 9: eight 1s and one 2, but wait, actually, the 2 comes after the 1s, so the 1s are 4 in a row, and then 5 2s, totaling 9.\n\nWait, but the array after reversal has 5 2s? Let me recount. The initial part is four 1s, then five 2s, then another 1. So the LNDS is 4 +5 =9, yes.\n\nSo in both cases, the optimal reversal leads to all 1s being first, then all 2s. So the LNDS is the total number of ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing a subarray in the given sequence of 1s and 2s.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the LNDS can be maximized by grouping all 1s together followed by all 2s. This is because a non-decreasing sequence can have all 1s first and then 2s without any interleaving. \n\nGiven this, the approach involves:\n1. Considering all possible subarrays to reverse.\n2. For each reversed subarray, compute the LNDS.\n3. Track the maximum LNDS found.\n\nHowever, directly computing the LNDS for each possible reversed subarray would be computationally expensive. Instead, we use a more efficient method by leveraging the fact that the optimal reversal will group as many 1s as possible before the 2s.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    max_length = 0\n    \n    # Precompute prefix sums of 1s and suffix sums of 2s for all possible l and r\n    prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_ones[i+1] = prefix_ones[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n    \n    suffix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n    \n    for l in range(1, n+1):\n        for r in range(l, n+1):\n            # Reverse from l to r (1-based indices)\n            # The new array will have:\n            # [a[0..l-2]] + reversed(a[l-1..r-1]) + [a[r..n-1]]\n            # But since we don't actually modify the array, we need to calculate the best possible\n            # The optimal scenario is when as many 1s as possible are before 2s\n            # So the number of 1s in the prefix up to l-1, plus the number of 2s in the suffix from r onwards,\n            # plus the count of 1s in the reversed part that are <= 2s in the suffix or 1s before them\n            # Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the total 1s in the prefix and the suffix\n            # Wait, let's think differently.\n            # After reversal, the 1s in the reversed part (from l to r) can be placed before the 2s outside the reversed part.\n            \n            # The optimal case is when all 1s are as left as possible and 2s as right as possible.\n            # So the maximum possible 1s is prefix_ones[l] + (number of 1s in the reversed subarray)\n            # The maximum possible 2s is suffix_twos[r] + (number of 2s in the reversed subarray)\n            # But how?\n            # Alternatively, the best we can do is to take all 1s before l, all 1s in the reversed part, and all 2s after r.\n            # Or maybe the best is to take all 1s up to l-1, plus all 1s in the reversed subarray that are <= the 2s in the suffix.\n            \n            # Maybe a smarter way is to consider that after reversal, the maximum possible LNDS is:\n            # (number of 1s in the prefix up to l-1) + (number of 2s in the suffix from r onwards) \n            # Plus any 1s in the reversed subarray that are <= the 2s in the suffix, but I'm not sure.\n            \n            # Let's try to model this.\n            # The total 1s available is prefix_ones[r] (since we reversed l to r, which includes a[l-1..r-1]).\n            # The total 2s available is suffix_twos[l] (since after reversal, the 2s from r onwards remain).\n            # The overlapping is tricky.\n            \n            # Another approach: for the reversed subarray, the 1s can be arranged to come before the 2s as much as possible.\n            # So the maximum possible is the sum of:\n            # 1s in the prefix (up to l-1), plus 1s in the reversed subarray that are <= 2s in the suffix from r onwards.\n            # Hmm, this might not be accurate.\n            \n            # Perhaps the best we can do is to calculate the total number of 1s in the entire array, but that's not correct because sometimes interleaving gives a longer LNDS.\n            \n            # Since the problem is difficult, perhaps we can precompute for each possible reversal the maximum possible 1s before and 2s after.\n            \n            # Alternatively, considering that the optimal reversal is such that all 1s are on one side and 2s on the other, the maximum possible LNDS would be the maximum between:\n            # (prefix_ones[l] + suffix_twos[r]) and (total_ones + total_twos -
