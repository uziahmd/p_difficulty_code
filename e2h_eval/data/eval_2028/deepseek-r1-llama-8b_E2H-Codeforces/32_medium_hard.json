    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Array Stabilization. Hmm.\n\nThe task is, given an array of integers, to remove exactly one element such that the instability of the remaining array is minimized. Instability is defined as the maximum element minus the minimum element in the array.\n\nSo, I need to find which single element to remove so that the resulting array has the smallest possible max - min. And then output that minimal instability.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this efficiently? Because n can be up to 1e5, so any O(n^2) approach is definitely out of the question. We need something linear or O(n log n), probably.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. The initial idea is that removing a certain element could potentially reduce the max and/or increase the min, thus decreasing the instability.\n\nWait, but for each element, if I remove it, I have to compute the new max and min of the array excluding it. But computing that directly for each element would be O(n) per element, leading to O(n^2) time, which is not feasible for n=1e5.\n\nSo I need a smarter way to compute for each possible removal whether it gives a better result.\n\nWhat's the minimal way to track the max and min when each element is removed?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can precompute some prefix and suffix max and min arrays. Like for each position i, know the max from 0 to i-1 and from i+1 to end. Then, for each i, the max when removing a[i] would be the max of the left and right maxes. Similarly for the min.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So here's the plan:\n\n1. Precompute for each index i:\n   - The maximum of the array excluding i.\n   - The minimum of the array excluding i.\n\nBut how do we compute these efficiently?\n\nWe can create two arrays: prefix_max and suffix_max. Similarly for min.\n\nFor example, prefix_max[i] will store the maximum from a[0] to a[i], and suffix_max[i] will store the maximum from a[i] to a[-1].\n\nWait, no. Maybe another approach. For each position i, the max when we exclude it would be the maximum between the prefix max up to i-1 and the suffix max starting from i+1. Similarly for the min.\n\nSo let's create:\n\n- left_max: an array where left_max[i] is the maximum from a[0] to a[i].\n- right_max: an array where right_max[i] is the maximum from a[i] to a[-1].\nSimilarly for min.\n\nThen, for each i, the new max when removing a[i] is the maximum of (left_max[i-1], right_max[i+1]). Wait, but for i=0, left_max[i-1] doesn't exist. So for i=0, the max after removal is right_max[1]. Similarly, for i = n-1, it's left_max[n-2].\n\nSame logic applies for the min.\n\nOnce we have these, for each i, the potential instability when removing a[i] is (new_max - new_min).\n\nWe can compute all these instabilities and choose the minimum among them.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, let's think about how to compute left_max and right_max.\n\nFor left_max, we can iterate from left to right:\n\nleft_max[0] = a[0]\nfor i from 1 to n-1:\n    left_max[i] = max(left_max[i-1], a[i])\n\nSimilarly, for right_max, iterate from right to left:\n\nright_max[n-1] = a[n-1]\nfor i from n-2 down to 0:\n    right_max[i] = max(right_max[i+1], a[i])\n\nWait, no. Because right_max[i] is the maximum from a[i] to a[-1]. So for i, right_max[i] = max(a[i], right_max[i+1]).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSame for left_max: left_max[i] = max(left_max[i-1], a[i]).\n\nSimilarly, for left_min and right_min:\n\nleft_min[0] = a[0]\nfor i in 1..n-1:\n    left_min[i] = min(left_min[i-1], a[i])\n\nright_min[n-1] = a[n-1]\nfor i in n-2 downto 0:\n    right_min[i] = min(right_min[i+1], a[i])\n\nOnce these four arrays are computed, for each i, the new_max is max(left_max[i-1], right_max[i+1]) if i is not at the ends. For i=0, it's right_max[1], and for i=n-1, it's left_max[n-2]. Similarly for new_min.\n\nWait, no. For i=0, the array without a[0] is a[1..n-1], so the max is right_max[1]. For i=n-1, the array without a[n-1] is a[0..n-2], whose max is left_max[n-2].\n\nWait, but right_max[i] is the maximum from a[i] to a[-1]. So if we remove a[i], then the max of the remaining array is the maximum of the elements before i and after i.\n\nSo for any i, the max after removal is the maximum of the left part (up to i-1) and the right part (from i+1 onwards). So:\n\nmax_without_i = max( (left_max[i-1] if i>0 else -infinity), (right_max[i+1] if i <n-1 else -infinity) )\n\nWait, but wait: left_max[i-1] is the maximum of a[0..i-1], and right_max[i+1] is the maximum of a[i+1..n-1]. So the max of the entire array without a[i] is the maximum of those two.\n\nSimilarly for min.\n\nSo for each i:\n\nif i == 0:\n    new_max = right_max[1]\nelif i == n-1:\n    new_max = left_max[n-2]\nelse:\n    new_max = max(left_max[i-1], right_max[i+1])\n\nSame for new_min.\n\nSo, with all that, for each i, we can compute new_max and new_min, and then calculate the instability as new_max - new_min.\n\nThen, find the minimum instability across all i.\n\nThat's the plan.\n\nNow, what about the edge cases?\n\nWell, for n=2, there are only two elements. Removing either one leaves one element, so the instability is zero. Which is the case in the sample input.\n\nAnother edge case: when all elements are the same. Then, regardless of which one you remove, the instability is zero.\n\nAnother case: when the array has varying elements, but removing a certain element significantly reduces the max or increases the min.\n\nSo, the steps for the code would be:\n\n1. Read n and the array a.\n\n2. Compute left_max, left_min, right_max, right_min.\n\n3. For each i, compute new_max and new_min as explained.\n\n4. Compute the instability for each i.\n\n5. Find the minimal instability.\n\n6. Output that minimal value.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nIn Python, since n can be up to 1e5, we need to process this efficiently.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nRead n as an integer, then read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nThen, compute the left_max and right_max.\n\nInitialize left_max as a list of size n, same for the others.\n\nCompute left_max:\n\nleft_max[0] = a[0]\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    left_max[i] = max(left_max[i-1], a[i])\n\nSimilarly for right_max:\n\nright_max[-1] = a[-1]\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n    right_max[i] = max(right_max[i+1], a[i])\n\nSame for left_min and right_min:\n\nleft_min[0] = a[0]\nfor i in 1..n-1:\n    left_min[i] = min(left_min[i-1], a[i])\n\nright_min[-1] = a[-1]\nfor i in n-2 down to 0:\n    right_min[i] = min(right_min[i+1], a[i])\n\nOnce these are computed, loop through each i from 0 to n-1:\n\nFor each i, compute new_max and new_min.\n\nBut how to handle the cases when i is at the ends?\n\nLike, if i is 0, then new_max is right_max[1], but wait: right_max[1] is the max from a[1] to a[-1], which is exactly the max of the array without a[0].\n\nSimilarly, if i is n-1, new_max is left_max[n-2], which is the max of a[0..n-2].\n\nFor i in the middle, new_max is the max of left_max[i-1] and right_max[i+1].\n\nSame for new_min.\n\nOnce we have new_max and new_min, compute the instability as new_max - new_min, and keep track of the minimum.\n\nWait, but in the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 4, [1,3,3,7]\n\nAfter computing left_max and right_max:\n\nleft_max = [1,3,3,7]\n\nright_max = [7,7,7,7]\n\nBecause for i=0, right_max[0] = max(1,3,3,7)=7.\n\ni=1: right_max[1] = max(3,3,7) =7.\n\nSo, for each i:\n\ni=0:\n\nnew_max is right_max[1] =7\n\nnew_min is right_min[1]. What's right_min?\n\nCompute right_min:\n\nright_min[3] =7\n\ni=2: right_min[2] = min(3,7) =3.\n\ni=1: right_min[1] = min(3,3,7) =3.\n\ni=0: right_min[0] = min(1,3,3,7)=1.\n\nSo for i=0:\n\nnew_max is 7, new_min is 3 (since right_min[1] is 3? Wait, no.\n\nWait, for i=0, the array after removing it is [3,3,7]. The min of this is 3.\n\nSo right_min[1] is min(a[1], a[2], a[3]) =3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo new_max is 7, new_min is 3. Instability is 4.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the optimal is to remove 7, which gives instability 2.\n\nHmm. So perhaps my approach is correct, but let's proceed.\n\nSo for each i, we compute new_max and new_min correctly.\n\nWait, let's see for i=3 (the last element):\n\nnew_max is left_max[2] =3.\n\nnew_min is left_min[2] =3.\n\nSo instability is 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when i=3, the array is [1,3,3], min is 1, max is 3, so instability is 2. So why according to our calculation, new_max is 3 and new_min is 3, giving 0?\n\nAh, wait, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, for i=3, the array after removal is a[0..2], which is [1,3,3].\n\nSo the max is 3, min is 1. So the instability is 2.\n\nBut according to the code, new_max is left_max[2] =3, which is correct. new_min is left_min[2] = min(left_min[1], a[2]) = min(3,3) =3.\n\nWait, that's wrong. Because left_min[i] is the min from a[0] to a[i], but when i=3 is removed, the min comes from a[0..2], which is 1.\n\nSo, wait, no. My approach is incorrect because for i=3, the new_min is not left_min[i-1], but rather the min of a[0..i-1], which is left_min[i-1].\n\nBut wait, for i=3, left_max[i-1] is left_max[2] =3, and left_min[i-1] is left_min[2] =3. But the actual min after removing i=3 is 1.\n\nSo, this approach is flawed. Because when you remove an element, the min may come from somewhere else, not necessarily the min of the left or right parts.\n\nWait, that's a big problem.\n\nSo, my initial approach is incorrect. Because the min of the array after removing a[i] could be the min of the left part, the right part, or perhaps even a combination, but not just the min of left or the min of right.\n\nWait, no. Because the min of the entire array after removal is the min of the left part (a[0..i-1]) and the right part (a[i+1..n-1]).\n\nSo, for i=3, the left part is a[0..2], min is 1, right part is empty. So new_min is 1.\n\nBut according to my approach, new_min is the min of left_min[i-1] and right_min[i+1], but for i=3, i+1 is beyond the array.\n\nSo, for i=3, new_min = left_min[i-1] = left_min[2] =3. But the actual min is 1.\n\nSo, my approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So what can I do?\n\nWait, perhaps for each i, the new_min is the minimum between left_min[i-1] and right_min[i+1], but also considering the entire array.\n\nWait, no. Because the new array is a[0..i-1] + a[i+1..n-1], so the min is the minimum of the left part and the right part.\n\nSo, the new_min is min(left_min[i-1], right_min[i+1]).\n\nWait, yes! Because the left part's min is left_min[i-1], and the right part's min is right_min[i+1]. So the overall min is the smaller of the two.\n\nWait, but for i=3, i+1 is 4, which is beyond the array. So right_min[i+1] is undefined. So for i=3, new_min is left_min[i-1], which is left_min[2]=3. But the actual min is 1.\n\nSo, that's the issue. So, the approach of taking min of left and right parts isn't sufficient when one of the parts is empty.\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct way is:\n\nFor new_max, if i is the first element, then the max is right_max[i+1]. If i is the last, it's left_max[i-1]. Else, it's the max of left_max[i-1] and right_max[i+1].\n\nSimilarly for new_min: if i is the first, new_min is right_min[i+1]. If i is the last, it's left_min[i-1]. Else, the min is min(left_min[i-1], right_min[i+1]).\n\nWait, but for i=3, the right part is empty, so the new_min is left_min[i-1], which is 3, but the correct min is 1.\n\nSo this suggests that my approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, what's wrong here?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in defining the right_min array. Because right_min[i] is the min from a[i] to a[n-1]. So, when i=3, right_min[3] is a[3], which is 7. But when we remove i=3, the right part is empty, so the min is the min of the left part.\n\nSo, for i=3, the new_min is left_min[2], which is 3, but the actual min of the array after removal is 1.\n\nSo, my method is incorrect.\n\nThis means that the approach of using left and right min arrays isn't sufficient because when one of the parts is empty, the min comes from the other part.\n\nWait, but in the case where i=3, the left part is a[0..2], which has min 1, and the right part is empty. So the new_min is 1.\n\nBut according to the current approach, new_min is min(left_min[2], right_min[4]), but right_min[4] is undefined.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should adjust the way I compute the min when one part is empty.\n\nWait, perhaps for each i, the new_min is the minimum of the left part (if i>0) and the right part (if i <n-1).\n\nSo, if i is 0, new_min is right_min[i+1], but wait, right_min[i+1] is the min from a[i+1..n-1], which is correct.\n\nWait, no. Because if i is 0, the array after removal is a[1..n-1], so the min is right_min[1], which is the min from a[1] to a[-1].\n\nSimilarly, for i=n-1, the array after removal is a[0..n-2], whose min is left_min[n-2].\n\nBut for i in between, the min is the min of the left part and the right part.\n\nSo for i=3 in the sample:\n\nleft part is a[0..2], min 1.\n\nright part is a[4..n-1], which is empty.\n\nSo new_min is 1.\n\nBut according to the code, for i=3:\n\nnew_min = min(left_min[2], right_min[4]).\n\nBut right_min[4] is undefined. So perhaps, in code, we can handle it by checking if i+1 is beyond the array.\n\nSo, perhaps in code:\n\nfor each i in 0..n-1:\n\nif i == 0:\n    new_max = right_max[1] if n >1 else None\n    new_min = right_min[1] if n>1 else None\nelif i == n-1:\n    new_max = left_max[n-2]\n    new_min = left_min[n-2]\nelse:\n    new_max = max(left_max[i-1], right_max[i+1])\n    new_min = min(left_min[i-1], right_min[i+1])\n\nWait, but for i=0 and n>1, the array after removal is a[1..n-1], which has its own max and min, which are right_max[1] and right_min[1].\n\nSimilarly for i=n-1, the array is a[0..n-2], so max is left_max[n-2], min is left_min[n-2].\n\nSo for i=0:\n\nif n>1:\n\n    new_max = right_max[1]\n    new_min = right_min[1]\n\nelse:\n\n    # but n >=2 according to problem statement, so no else needed.\n\nSimilarly for i=n-1.\n\nSo, in the sample, for i=3:\n\ni=3, n=4.\n\nSo, new_max = left_max[2] =3.\n\nnew_min = left_min[2] =3.\n\nBut the actual min is 1.\n\nSo, clearly, the approach is wrong.\n\nWhat's the problem here?\n\nWait, because when you remove a[3], the left part is a[0..2], whose min is 1. So the new_min should be 1, not 3.\n\nAh, so the approach of taking min of left_min[i-1] and right_min[i+1] is wrong.\n\nBecause, when i is 3, right_min[i+1] is right_min[4], which is beyond the array.\n\nSo, in code, perhaps I should consider that when i is n-1, the right part is empty, so the new_min is left_min[i-1], but that's only the left part. But the new array is just the left part.\n\nWait, but in that case, new_min is the min of the left part.\n\nSo, perhaps the code needs to be:\n\nif i == 0:\n\n    new_max = right_max[1]\n    new_min = right_min[1]\n\nelif i == n-1:\n\n    new_max = left_max[n-2]\n    new_min = left_min[n-2]\n\nelse:\n\n    new_max = max(left_max[i-1], right_max[i+1])\n    new_min = min(left_min[i-1], right_min[i+1])\n\nWait, but for i=3, new_min is left_min[2] =3, but the actual min is 1.\n\nSo, that approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, but what is left_min[2]?\n\nIn the sample, a = [1,3,3,7]\n\nleft_min[0] =1\n\nleft_min[1] =1\n\nleft_min[2] =1\n\nleft_min[3] =1.\n\nWait, wait no.\n\nWait, in the sample, a is [1,3,3,7].\n\nleft_min[0] =1.\n\nleft_min[1] = min(1,3) =1.\n\nleft_min[2] = min(1,3,3) =1.\n\nleft_min[3] = min(1,3,3,7) =1.\n\nWait, right, so for i=3, new_min is left_min[2] =1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that for i=3, left_min[2] is 3, but that's not correct.\n\nSo perhaps I made a mistake in calculating left_min.\n\nAh, right, because left_min[i] is the min from a[0] to a[i], including a[i].\n\nSo, for i=2, a[0..2] is [1,3,3], min is 1.\n\nSo, left_min[2] is 1.\n\nSo, for i=3, new_min is left_min[2] =1, which is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial approach was correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that for i=3, the new_min is 3, but that's incorrect because left_min[2] is 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is correct.\n\nSo, in that sample, when i=3 is removed, new_max is left_max[2] =3, new_min is left_min[2] =1. So instability is 2, which is correct.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nBut why did I get confused earlier?\n\nBecause I thought left_min[2] was 3, but it's actually 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, in code, for each i, compute new_max and new_min as follows:\n\nif i ==0:\n\n    new_max = right_max[1]\n    new_min = right_min[1]\n\nelif i ==n-1:\n\n    new_max = left_max[n-2]\n    new_min = left_min[n-2]\n\nelse:\n\n    new_max = max(left_max[i-1], right_max[i+1])\n    new_min = min(left_min[i-1], right_min[i+1])\n\nSo, for the sample, when i=3:\n\nnew_max = left_max[2] =3\n\nnew_min = left_min[2] =1\n\nso 3-1=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for i=0:\n\nnew_max = right_max[1] =7\n\nnew_min = right_min[1] =3.\n\nSo instability is 4.\n\nWhich is worse than 2.\n\nSo the minimal instability is 2.\n\nSo, the approach seems correct.\n\nSo, in code, the steps are:\n\n- Read n and a.\n\n- Compute left_max, left_min, right_max, right_min.\n\n- For each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   if i ==0:\n\n      if n==1: impossible, since n>=2.\n\n      else:\n\n          new_max = right_max[1]\n\n          new_min = right_min[1]\n\n   elif i ==n-1:\n\n      new_max = left_max[n-2]\n\n      new_min = left_min[n-2]\n\n   else:\n\n      new_max = max(left_max[i-1], right_max[i+1])\n\n      new_min = min(left_min[i-1], right_min[i+1])\n\n   compute instability as new_max - new_min.\n\n- Keep track of the minimal instability.\n\nSo, now, let's test this approach on the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=4, a=[1,3,3,7]\n\nCompute left_max:\n\n[1,3,3,7]\n\nCompute right_max:\n\nFor i=3:7.\n\ni=2: max(3,7)=7.\n\ni=1: max(3,7)=7.\n\ni=0: max(1,7)=7.\n\nSo right_max is [7,7,7,7].\n\nleft_min:\n\ni=0:1.\n\ni=1: min(1,3)=1.\n\ni=2: min(1,3,3)=1.\n\ni=3: min(1,3,3,7)=1.\n\nright_min:\n\ni=3:7.\n\ni=2: min(3,7)=3.\n\ni=1: min(3,3,7)=3.\n\ni=0: min(1,3,3,7)=1.\n\nSo, for i=0:\n\nnew_max = right_max[1] =7.\n\nnew_min = right_min[1] =3.\n\ninstability 4.\n\ni=1:\n\nnew_max = max(left_max[0]=1, right_max[2]=7) →7.\n\nnew_min = min(left_min[0]=1, right_min[2]=3) →1.\n\nso instability 6.\n\ni=2:\n\nnew_max = max(left_max[1]=3, right_max[3]=7) →7.\n\nnew_min = min(left_min[1]=1, right_min[3]=7) →1.\n\nso instability 6.\n\ni=3:\n\nnew_max = left_max[2] =3.\n\nnew_min = left_min[2] =1.\n\nso instability 2.\n\nThus, the minimal is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput: 2, [1,100000]\n\nn=2.\n\nFor i=0:\n\nnew_max = right_max[1] =100000.\n\nnew_min = right_min[1] =100000.\n\nso instability 0.\n\nFor i=1:\n\nnew_max = left_max[0] =1.\n\nnew_min = left_min[0] =1.\n\nso instability 0.\n\nThus, the minimal is 0.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nAnother test case: all elements same.\n\nn=5, a=[5,5,5,5,5]\n\nleft_max and right_max are all 5.\n\nleft_min and right_min are all 5.\n\nFor any i:\n\nif i is 0: new_max=5, new_min=5 →0.\n\nSimilarly for any i, the instability is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a=[1,2,3]\n\nCompute left_max: [1,2,3]\n\nright_max: [3,3,3]\n\nleft_min: [1,1,1]\n\nright_min: [1,2,3]\n\nFor each i:\n\ni=0:\n\nnew_max = right_max[1] =3.\n\nnew_min = right_min[1] =2.\n\nso instability 1.\n\ni=1:\n\nnew_max = max(left_max[0]=1, right_max[2]=3) →3.\n\nnew_min = min(left_min[0]=1, right_min[2]=3) →1.\n\nso instability 2.\n\ni=2:\n\nnew_max = left_max[1] =2.\n\nnew_min = left_min[1] =1.\n\nso instability 1.\n\nThus, the minimal is 1.\n\nWhich is achieved by removing either 0 or 2.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nWe'll read n, then the array a.\n\nCompute left_max, right_max, left_min, right_min.\n\nThen loop through each i, compute new_max and new_min, compute instability, and track the minimum.\n\nImplementing this.\n\nPotential corner cases:\n\n- n=2: as in the sample.\n\n- All elements same.\n\n- All elements in increasing order.\n\n- All elements in decreasing order.\n\nAnother thing to note: in Python, for large n, building lists for left and right arrays is acceptable.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\nCompute left_max, left_min.\n\nCompute right_max, right_min.\n\nInitialize min_instability to a very large number.\n\nLoop over i in range(n):\n\n   if i ==0:\n\n       if n ==1:\n\n           pass # but n >=2.\n\n       else:\n\n           current_max = right_max[1]\n\n           current_min = right_min[1]\n\n   elif i ==n-1:\n\n           current_max = left_max[n-2]\n\n           current_min = left_min[n-2]\n\n   else:\n\n           current_max = max(left_max[i-1], right_max[i+1])\n\n           current_min = min(left_min[i-1], right_min[i+1])\n\n   instability = current_max - current_min\n\n   if instability < min_instability:\n\n       min_instability = instability\n\nAt the end, print min_instability.\n\nSo, the code should look like this.\n\nTesting for the sample inputs.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nWait, but for i=0, right_max[1] is the max of a[1..n-1], which is correct.\n\nSimilarly for i=n-1.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nWait, but what if n is 1?

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to find the element whose removal results in the smallest possible instability. This can be efficiently achieved by precomputing certain values using prefix and suffix arrays.\n2. **Precomputation**: We compute four arrays:\n   - `left_max` and `left_min`: These arrays store the maximum and minimum values from the start up to each index.\n   - `right_max` and `right_min`: These arrays store the maximum and minimum values from each index to the end.\n3. **Compute Instability for Each Removal**: For each element, calculate the potential instability if that element is removed. This involves:\n   - Taking the maximum value from either the left part or the right part of the array (excluding the current element).\n   - Taking the minimum value similarly.\n4. **Efficiency**: Using prefix and suffix arrays allows us to compute the required values in linear time, making the solution efficient even for large arrays.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nif n == 0:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\nleft_max = [0] * n\nleft_min = [0] * n\nleft_max[0] = a[0]\nleft_min[0] = a[0]\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    left_max[i] = max(left_max[i-1], a[i])\n    left_min[i] = min(left_min[i-1], a[i])\n\nright_max = [0] * n\nright_min = [0] * n\nright_max[-1] = a[-1]\nright_min[-1] = a[-1]\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n    right_max[i] = max(right_max[i+1], a[i])\n    right_min[i] = min(right_min[i+1], a[i])\n\nmin_instability = float('inf')\nfor i in range(n):\n    if i == 0:\n        current_max = right_max[1] if n > 1 else a[0]\n        current_min = right_min[1] if n > 1 else a[0]\n    elif i == n-1:\n        current_max = left_max[n-2]\n        current_min = left_min[n-2]\n    else:\n        current_max = max(left_max[i-1], right_max[i+1])\n        current_min = min(left_min[i-1], right_min[i+1])\n    instability = current_max - current_min\n    if instability < min_instability:\n        min_instability = instability\n\nprint(min_instability)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Prefix Arrays**: `left_max` and `left_min` are computed by iterating from the start to the end of the array.\n3. **Suffix Arrays**: `right_max` and `right_min` are computed by iterating from the end to the start of the array.\n4. **Calculate Instability**: For each element, compute the potential instability by considering the maximum and minimum values of the remaining elements using the precomputed prefix and suffix arrays.\n5. **Determine Minimum Instability**: Track the minimum instability across all possible element removals and print the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the desired result in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes.",
