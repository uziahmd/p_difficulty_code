Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Crazy Town,\" and from the description, it seems like it involves lines dividing a plane into regions, and moving between these regions with certain rules.\n\nHmm, the task is to find the minimum number of steps to get from the home block to the university block. Each step is moving from one block to another if they share a common border of non-zero length. So, the key here is understanding how the lines partition the plane and how the points are located in relation to these lines.\n\nLet me think about what defines a region in this context. Each line is a road, and the roads divide the plane into regions. So, each road can be thought of as a boundary that splits the plane into two parts. For a given point, whether it's on one side or the other of a line depends on the sign of the expression when you plug the point into the line's equation.\n\nWait, right! For a line ax + by + c = 0, substituting a point (x0, y0) gives a value d = a*x0 + b*y0 + c. The sign of d tells which side of the line the point is on. If d is positive, it's on one side; if negative, the other.\n\nSo, for each road, the home and university points have definite signs. Now, the problem is about the arrangement of these signs across all roads. Because each road contributes to the partitioning, the regions are determined by the combination of signs across all roads.\n\nBut how does this relate to moving between blocks? Well, each time you cross a road, you switch the sign for that particular line. But since the movement is allowed only through shared borders, perhaps the minimal path involves crossing the least number of lines necessary to separate the home and university regions.\n\nWait, but the minimal steps required would correspond to the number of lines that separate the two points. Because each such line can be crossed once, thereby changing their relative positions across those lines. So, the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nBecause, for each such line, you have to cross it exactly once to get from one region to the other. But wait, maybe not exactly once—because some lines might not directly affect the path. Hmm.\n\nLet me think again. Suppose there are k roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. Then, to move from the home's region to the university's region, you must cross each of these k roads exactly once. Because each crossing changes the position relative to that road, and after crossing all of them, the points will be in the same region. Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, no. Because the regions are determined by all the roads together. So, if two points are on the same side for all roads except for m, then to reach each other, you need to cross m roads. Because each crossing flips their position for that road, and the order doesn't matter because you can choose any path that goes through the necessary roads.\n\nWait, but the problem allows moving through adjacent regions that share a border. So, the minimal steps would be the number of lines that separate the two points. Because each such line must be crossed at least once to get from the home region to the university region.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each of the n roads, check whether the home and university are on opposite sides. The count of such roads is the minimal number of steps required.\n\nThat makes sense. Because each such road forms a boundary that the two points are on opposite sides of, thus requiring at least one crossing to get from one to the other.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each road, compute the value of a*x1 + b*y1 + c and a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n2. If the signs of these two values are different, increment the count.\n3. The count is the minimal number of steps needed.\n\nYes! That simplifies the problem significantly. Because instead of dealing with the complex geometry of the regions, we can model it using the signs of the linear expressions.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read the home coordinates (x1, y1).\n- Read the university coordinates (x2, y2).\n- Read the number of roads, n.\n- For each of the n roads, read a, b, c.\n- Compute d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n- Compute d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n- If d1 and d2 have opposite signs, count it.\n- After processing all roads, output the count.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where d1 and d2 are zero? Oh, but the problem states that neither home nor university lie on any road. So, d1 and d2 are always non-zero. So, we don't have to worry about division by zero or anything.\n\nSo, the code can proceed safely.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\nHome: 1 1\nUniversity: -1 -1\nn=2\n\nRoads:\n0 1 0 → line is y=0.\n1 0 0 → line is x=0.\n\nFor each road, calculate d1 and d2.\n\nFirst road: y=0.\nd1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 >0.\nd2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0.\nSo, opposite signs. Count +=1.\n\nSecond road: x=0.\nd1 = 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1>0.\nd2 = 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0 =-1<0. Opposite signs. Count +=1.\n\nTotal count is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample in the problem statement. Let me check that as well.\n\nIn the second sample, home is (1,1), university is (-1,-1), n=3.\n\nRoads:\n1 0 0 → x=1.\n0 1 0 → y=0.\n1 1 -3 → x + y -3 =0.\n\nCheck each road.\n\nFirst road: x=1.\nd1 =1*1 +0*1 -0=1>0.\nd2=1*(-1)+0*(-1)-0 =-1<0. Opposite. Count=1.\n\nSecond road: y=0.\nSame as before. d1=1>0, d2=-1<0. Count=2.\n\nThird road: 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3= -1 <0.\nd2=1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 =-1-1-3 =-5 <0.\nSame sign. So no count.\n\nTotal count is 2, which is the sample output.\n\nSo the logic holds.\n\nNow, the next step is to write the code accordingly.\n\nThe code needs to read the home and university points, then process each of the n roads.\n\nImplementing this in Python is straightforward.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input.\nRead x2, y2 from input.\nRead n.\nInitialize count to 0.\nFor each of n lines:\n   read a, b, c.\n   compute d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 +c\n   compute d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 +c\n   if d1 * d2 < 0:  # opposite signs\n       count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nBut wait, since the numbers can be very large (up to 1e6 in absolute value), but in Python, integers can handle that.\n\nAlso, the multiplication d1*d2 could cause integer overflow in some languages, but in Python, it's fine.\n\nSo, the code is simple.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nWhat if a road has a=0 and b=0? No, according to the problem statement, ai and bi are not both zero. So, each road is a valid line.\n\nAnother test case: home and university are on the same side of all roads. Then, the count is zero, meaning they are in the same block, so zero steps needed.\n\nAnother test case: home and university are on opposite sides of all roads. So the count is n, meaning you have to cross all roads once.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases correctly.\n\nThus, the Python code is as described.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. The town is divided by multiple roads defined by linear equations, and each step allows moving from one block to another if they share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each road is a line that divides the plane into two regions. A point (x, y) can be on either side of the line based on the sign of the expression when substituted into the line equation. For example, for a line `ax + by + c = 0`, substituting a point (x1, y1) gives a value `d1`, and substituting (x2, y2) gives `d2`. If `d1` and `d2` have opposite signs, the points are on opposite sides of the line.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block corresponds to the number of lines (roads) where the home and university points are on opposite sides. Each such line must be crossed exactly once to move between the blocks.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the coordinates of the home and university.\n   - For each road, compute the values of the line equation at both home and university.\n   - Count the number of roads where these values have opposite signs.\n   - This count is the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    d1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    d2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if d1 * d2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n- **Line Evaluation**: For each road, it evaluates the line equation at the home and university coordinates to determine which side of the line each point lies on.\n- **Counting Crossings**: It counts how many times the home and university are on opposite sides of the same road, as each such crossing represents a necessary step to move between blocks.\n- **Output**: The total count of such crossings is printed, representing the minimum steps needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution by leveraging the geometric properties of lines and their impact on dividing the plane into regions.",
