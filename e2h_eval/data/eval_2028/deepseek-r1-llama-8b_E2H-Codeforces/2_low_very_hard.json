Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Valera and X\". Hmm. Valera has a square piece of paper with n x n squares, each containing a letter. We need to determine if the letters form an \"X\" according to certain conditions.\n\nWait, what's the condition for forming an \"X\"? Oh right, the teacher said that the letters on the square form an \"X\" if:\n\n1. Both diagonals have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) contain the same letter, which is different from the ones on the diagonals.\n\nSo my task is to read the grid and check these conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input. The first line is n, an odd integer. Then there are n lines, each with n characters, representing the grid.\n\nHmm, so for each grid, I need to check two main things:\n\nA. Check if both diagonals consist of the same character.\nB. Check if all non-diagonal cells have the same character, which is different from the diagonal's character.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Read the input correctly. Since the input is given as strings with newlines, I'll need to split them properly. Each row is a string, but perhaps I should process each row into a list of characters.\n\nWait, in Python, reading the input can be a bit tricky because sometimes the input is given as a single string with '\\n' separators. So I should read all lines at once, then split them accordingly.\n\nFor example, if the input is like:\n\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nThen the second line is 'xooox', and so on.\n\nSo in code, I can read using something like:\n\nimport sys\ngrid = [list(sys.stdin.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nOnce I have the grid, I can proceed.\n\nStep 2: Identify the diagonal elements.\n\nThe main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right. For an n x n grid, the indices are 0-based. So the elements are grid[i][i] for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nThe anti-diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left. So the elements are grid[i][n-1 -i] for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nI need to check if all elements in both diagonals are the same.\n\nSo first, get the main diagonal's character. Let's say d1 is grid[0][0], then check all grid[i][i] == d1.\n\nSimilarly for the anti-diagonal, d2 is grid[0][n-1], and check all grid[i][n-1 -i] == d2.\n\nIf either diagonal doesn't satisfy this, then it's not an X. So both diagonals must have the same character.\n\nWait, but do they have to be the same? Because the problem says both diagonals should have the same letters. So yes, d1 must equal d2.\n\nSo if the diagonals are not the same, then output is NO.\n\nSo first, check that all main diagonal elements are the same, and all anti-diagonal elements are the same, and that d1 equals d2.\n\nIf that's not the case, return NO.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nNext, check the non-diagonal elements. They must all be the same, and different from d1 (since d1 is the diagonal).\n\nSo how do we collect all non-diagonal elements?\n\nLoop through each cell (i,j). If (i == j) or (i + j == n-1), then it's a diagonal element. Else, it's part of the other regions.\n\nWe need to collect all such cells and check if they are all the same character, which is not equal to d1.\n\nSo let's think about the steps:\n\n1. Check if both diagonals have the same character.\n\n   a. For the main diagonal, check every cell. If any cell differs, return NO.\n\n   b. Similarly for the anti-diagonal.\n\n   c. Also, check if the main and anti-diagonal characters are the same. If not, return NO.\n\n2. Once the diagonals are valid, collect all non-diagonal cells.\n\n3. Check if all these non-diagonal cells have the same character, and that this character is different from the diagonal's character.\n\n4. If all conditions are met, output YES. Else, NO.\n\nSo now, how to implement this.\n\nLet's outline the code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the grid.\n\nCheck the main diagonal:\n\nd1 = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n   if grid[i][i] != d1:\n\n       print(\"NO\")\n\n       exit()\n\nSimilarly for anti-diagonal:\n\nd2 = grid",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given n x n grid of letters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The letter \"X\" is defined such that both diagonals of the grid must contain the same character, and all other cells must contain the same different character.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the integer `n` and the subsequent `n` lines of the grid.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: \n   - Check if all elements on the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) are the same.\n   - Check if all elements on the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) are the same.\n   - Ensure the characters on both diagonals are the same.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements**: Collect all non-diagonal elements and check if they are all the same character, which must be different from the diagonal character.\n4. **Output Result**: If all conditions are met, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [list(input().strip()) for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Function to check if all elements in the diagonal are the same\ndef check_diagonal(grid, start_i, start_j, step_i, step_j):\n    d = grid[start_i][start_j]\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_i = start_i + i * step_i\n        current_j = start_j + i * step_j\n        if grid[current_i][current_j] != d:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Check main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)\nif not check_diagonal(grid, 0, 0, 1, 1):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left)\nif not check_diagonal(grid, 0, n-1, 1, -1):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check if both diagonals have the same character\nd_main = grid[0][0]\nd_anti = grid[0][n-1]\nif d_main != d_anti:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Now check all non-diagonal elements\nother_char = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            continue  # Skip diagonal elements\n        if other_char is None:\n            other_char = grid[i][j]\n        else:\n            if grid[i][j] != other_char:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit()\n\n# Check if the other_char is different from the diagonal\nif other_char == d_main:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The grid is read into a list of lists where each sublist represents a row of the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: The function `check_diagonal` is used to verify that all elements in a specified diagonal are the same. This function is called twice, once for each diagonal.\n3. **Anti-Diagonal Check**: After ensuring both diagonals have the same character, we verify that all non-diagonal elements are the same and different from the diagonal character.\n4. **Result Output**: Based on the checks, the program prints \"YES\" if the grid forms an \"X\", otherwise it prints \"NO\".",
