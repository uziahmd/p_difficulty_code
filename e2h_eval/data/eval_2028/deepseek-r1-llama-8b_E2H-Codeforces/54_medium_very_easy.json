Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Mister B and Angle in Polygon.\" Hmm, the task is to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 of a regular convex n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. And if there are multiple options with the same minimal difference, any of them is acceptable.\n\nAlright, first, I need to understand how the angle is formed in a regular polygon. So, let's think about a regular polygon. All sides are equal, all angles are equal. The internal angle of a regular n-gon is known; the formula for that is ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But wait, the angle we're considering here isn't necessarily the internal angle of the polygon. Because the angle is formed by two points on the sides of a vertex, not necessarily the adjacent vertices.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the polygon is regular, so each side has the same length, and each central angle is 360/n degrees. So, when you pick a vertex as the angle point, the lines from that vertex to the other two points will form certain angles based on how many steps apart those points are around the polygon.\n\nLet me think: for a regular polygon, any three distinct points form an angle at the middle one. But in our case, the three points must be such that v1 and v3 lie on the sides of the angle at v2. Wait, no, the problem says that v1 and v3 lie on the sides of the angle at v2. Or wait, perhaps more accurately, v1 and v3 are on the sides of the polygon, but the angle is formed by the two lines from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3, which are sides of the polygon? Or maybe they are just any two points on the polygon, not necessarily adjacent.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle (with v2 as the vertex) is as close as possible to a. So the angle is the angle between the two lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the possible angles that can be formed at a vertex depend on the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nSo, for example, in a triangle (3-gon), the only possible angle is the internal angle, which is 60 degrees. So, any triplet where v2 is one vertex, and the other two are the other two, gives the same angle.\n\nFor a square (4-gon), the possible angles at a vertex could be:\n\n- Adjacent vertices: then the angle is 90 degrees (the internal angle).\n- Next-nearest: like v2 has v1 as the next but one, and v3 as the previous but one. Then the angle would be 45 degrees, because the lines from v2 to v1 and v3 create a right angle across the diagonal.\n\nWait, perhaps the possible angles are determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 around the polygon, measured in either direction from v2.\n\nEach step corresponds to a central angle of 360/n degrees. So, the angle between v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 would be k*(360/n), where k is the number of edges between them along one arc. But wait, since it's a regular polygon, the angle could also be considered as the smaller arc between the two points, so the maximum possible k is floor(n/2). Because beyond that, it's shorter to go the other way.\n\nWait, no. For example, in a square, the angle between v2 and the two opposite points (like 1 and 3) would be 180 degrees, but that's a straight line. Wait, no, in a square, the internal angle is 90 degrees, but the angle formed by connecting two non-adjacent points would be larger. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle is formed by two chords from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. The measure of that angle depends on the arc between v1 and v3 as viewed from the center. Because in a circle, the angle subtended by two points at a third point is half the measure of the arc between them. Wait, no, that's for the inscribed angle theorem. So, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3, but only if the points are on the circumference.\n\nWait, yes. Because in a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, for a regular polygon, which is inscribed in a circle, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3.\n\nSo, for each possible pair of points v1 and v3 (distinct from v2), the angle at v2 is half of the arc between them.\n\nTherefore, the possible angles are determined by the possible arc lengths between v1 and v3, which are multiples of the central angle (360/n) degrees.\n\nSo, for each possible k (number of steps between v1 and v3 along one arc), the angle is k*(360/n)/2 = (k * 180)/n degrees.\n\nWait, but since the polygon is regular, the arc can be measured in either direction. So for a given pair v1 and v3, the minimal arc between them is min(k, n-k) steps, where k is the number of steps in one direction. So the minimal arc is k, but k can vary up to floor(n/2).\n\nThus, for each possible k (from 1 to m, where m is floor((n-1)/2)), we can compute the angle as (k * 180)/n degrees.\n\nBut wait, the angle can be either (k * 180)/n or ( (n - k) * 180 ) /n, but that's the same as (180 - (k*180)/n). So, for each k, the angle is (k*180)/n, but since we're looking for the closest to 'a', it's the minimal absolute difference between any of these angles and 'a'.\n\nSo, the approach is to find all possible angles that can be formed at a vertex of the polygon, and then find which one is closest to 'a'.\n\nOnce we have that, we can choose the corresponding triplet of vertices.\n\nBut how do we model the possible triplets?\n\nWell, for each vertex v2, the possible angles are determined by the possible k steps away from v2 in either direction. So for each v2, the angles are (k*180)/n degrees for k=1,2,...,m, where m is the maximum possible steps without overlapping, i.e., m = floor( (n-1)/2 )\n\nWait, for example, in a square (n=4):\n\nThe steps can be 1, 2, or 3.\n\nBut for k=2, the angle is (2*180)/4 = 90 degrees. For k=3, the angle is (3*180)/4 = 135 degrees. But wait, no—because in a square, the angle between v2 and the two points across the square would be 180 degrees, but that's only if you take the opposite points, but according to the inscribed angle theorem, the angle is half the arc. So for k=2, the arc is 2 steps, which is 2*(360/4)=180 degrees. So the angle is 90 degrees, which is correct.\n\nBut for k=3, the arc is 3 steps, which is 270 degrees. But the inscribed angle is half that, 135 degrees. However, since the polygon is convex, the angle inside the polygon is 90 degrees, but the angle formed by two points that are 3 steps away in one direction would actually be 135 degrees. Wait, but in the square, the possible angles for a vertex would be 90 degrees (adjacent), 135 degrees (two steps), and 90 degrees again (three steps the other way, which is equivalent to one step the other way). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps for a polygon, the possible angles at a vertex v2 are determined by the minimal arc between v1 and v3. So for each possible step count k, the minimal arc is min(k, n -k) steps. Because for a polygon, the minimal path between two points is the smaller of the two possible arcs.\n\nWait, for example, in a square, the points 1 and 3 are opposite, but the minimal arc is 2 steps (since 4-3+1=2 steps the other way). So for any k, the minimal arc is min(k, n -k) steps.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the angle as (min(k, n -k) * 180 ) /n degrees.\n\nBecause that would give the actual angle within the polygon.\n\nWait, no. Because the inscribed angle depends on the arc that's opposite to the angle. So, for a pair of points, the angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc that's intercepted by the angle. So, if the arc between v1 and v3 is s steps (each step being 360/n degrees), then the angle is s*(360/(n*2)) degrees.\n\nBut wait, s is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the minor arc. So, s can be 1, 2, ..., m, where m is floor( (n-1)/2 ), because beyond that, the minor arc would be n-s steps.\n\nSo, for each possible s (from 1 to m), the angle is s*(360/(n*2)) degrees.\n\nSo, for example, in a square (n=4), m is (4-1)/2 = 1.5, so m=1. So s can be 1. The angle is 1*(360/(4*2)) = 45 degrees. But wait, that's not matching the earlier example. Hmm, perhaps my reasoning is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle at v2 is determined by the number of edges between v1 and v3 when moving clockwise from v1 to v3. So for a square, if v2 is at position 2, v1 is at 1 (clockwise, one step) and v3 is at 3 (also one step clockwise). The angle at v2 is 90 degrees, which is the internal angle. But if v1 is at 1 and v3 is at 3, then moving from v1 to v3 is two steps, but the minor arc is two steps, which is 2*(360/4) = 180 degrees. So the inscribed angle is 90 degrees.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So for a square, the possible angles are 90 degrees, 135 degrees, etc.? No, wait, no. Wait, for s=1: the angle is (1 * 360/(4*2)) = 45 degrees. That's when the two points are adjacent. But wait, that's the angle outside the polygon. Because in a square, the internal angle is 90 degrees, but perhaps the angle formed by two adjacent points is 45 degrees. Or maybe I'm mixing internal and external angles.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let's try to clarify.\n\nIn a regular polygon, each internal angle is ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. For a square, that's 90 degrees. Now, when you choose two points that are adjacent to v2, the angle at v2 is the internal angle, which is 90 degrees. But if you choose two points that are further apart, the angle may be different.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle between two chords from v2 can be calculated using the formula for the inscribed angle. So the angle is equal to half the measure of the arc between the two points, but that's when the angle is formed by two chords intersecting at a point on the circumference.\n\nSo, for example, in a regular polygon, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc that is intercepted by the two points. So, for two points that are s steps apart (along the minor arc), the angle is (s * 360/(n*2)) degrees.\n\nSo, in the square, when s=2 steps (so the two points are opposite each other), the angle is (2 * 360/(4*2)) = 90 degrees. But wait, that's the internal angle. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but when s=1 step, the angle would be 45 degrees, which is less than the internal angle. How does that make sense?\n\nAh, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the configuration. Maybe the angle at v2 is formed by two chords that connect to v1 and v3, which are s steps apart along the minor arc. So, for s=1 step, the angle is 45 degrees, which is the angle between the two edges of the polygon. But in reality, the internal angle is 90 degrees. So perhaps the angle at v2 is the angle between the two edges, which is 90 degrees. So why is this conflicting with the inscribed angle calculation?\n\nWait, perhaps the inscribed angle is the angle inside the polygon, but when s=2 steps, the angle is 90 degrees. When s=1 step, the angle is 45 degrees. So that suggests that the angle can vary based on the positions of v1 and v3.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to model this correctly.\n\nLet me take an example.\n\nTake a square: 4 vertices arranged in a circle.\n\nSuppose v2 is at position 1.\n\nIf v1 is at 2 and v3 is at 4, then the angle at v2 is the internal angle of the square, which is 90 degrees.\n\nIf v1 is at 2 and v3 is at 3, then the angle is 90 degrees.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because in a square, the internal angle is 90 degrees, but the angle formed by two adjacent points is indeed 90 degrees.\n\nBut if v1 is at 2 and v3 is at 4, that's across the square. Wait, no, in a square, 1,2,3,4 are in order. So from 1, the adjacent points are 2 and 4. So, if v1 is 2 and v3 is 4, then the angle is 90 degrees.\n\nIf v1 is 3 and v3 is 1, then the angle is also 90 degrees.\n\nWait, but what if v1 is 2 and v3 is 3? Then, the angle at v2 is the angle between the two edges 2-1 and 2-3. Which is 90 degrees.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Because in a square, the edge from 2 to 1 is along one side, and the edge from 2 to 3 is another side, forming a 90-degree internal angle.\n\nSo, perhaps all possible angles in the square are either 90 degrees or 135 degrees? Or am I missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm thinking in terms of the internal angles of the polygon, but the problem allows for any three points, regardless of whether they are adjacent.\n\nSo, for a square, let's consider all possible pairs of points:\n\nCase 1: v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2. Then the angle is 90 degrees.\n\nCase 2: v1 is one step away in one direction, v3 is two steps away in the other direction. Wait, but in a square, that's not possible. Or maybe I'm complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle at v2 can be determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the minor arc. So for a square, the minor arc between v1 and v3 can be 1 step (for adjacent points) or 2 steps (for opposite points). So the angle is (s * 360/(n*2)) degrees, where s is the minor arc steps.\n\nSo, for s=1: angle is 360/(4*2) *1 = 45 degrees.\n\nFor s=2: angle is 360/(4*2)*2 = 90 degrees.\n\nSo, the angle can be 45 or 90 degrees in a square.\n\nBut wait, in the square, the internal angle is 90 degrees. So the angle of 45 degrees is formed by points that are not adjacent. For example, v2 is at 2, v1 is at 1, and v3 is at 3. The angle at v2 is 45 degrees. Because the minor arc between v1 and v3 is 2 steps (from 1 to 3 via 2), which is 180 degrees. Wait, no, the minor arc is the smaller of the two possible paths between 1 and 3. In a square, the distance from 1 to 3 can be 2 steps clockwise or 2 steps counter-clockwise. So the minor arc is 2 steps, which is 2*(360/4)=180 degrees. So the inscribed angle is 90 degrees.\n\nWait, that's confusing. So if s is the number of steps in the minor arc, then for s=2 in a square, the angle is 90 degrees. But for s=1, the angle is 45 degrees.\n\nBut how can that be? Because in the square, the internal angle is 90 degrees. So when s=1, the angle is 45 degrees, which is smaller than the internal angle. So how is that possible?\n\nWait, perhaps the angle at v2 is the angle between the two edges, which is 90 degrees, but the angle between two other points could be 45 degrees. For example, in a square, if v2 is 2, v1 is 1, and v3 is 3. Then the angle at v2 is 45 degrees. Because the chord from v2 to v1 is along one edge, and the chord from v2 to v3 is along the diagonal, forming a 45-degree angle with the edge.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because in a square, the diagonal splits the 90-degree angle into two 45-degree angles. So when v1 is adjacent (say, 1), and v3 is the opposite point (3), the angle at v2 is 45 degrees. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the angle can vary based on how far apart v1 and v3 are.\n\nSo, for a square, the possible angles at a vertex are 45 degrees and 90 degrees.\n\nSo, for each vertex v2, the possible angles are (s * 180)/n, where s is the number of steps in the minor arc between v1 and v3, and s can be 1 or 2 in a square.\n\nWait, wait, 180 is (n * 180) / 2, but for the angle, it's (s * 180)/n.\n\nSo for a square, s=1: 180/4=45 degrees.\n\ns=2: 360/4=90 degrees.\n\nSo that makes sense.\n\nSo, for each possible s (from 1 to m, where m is floor( (n-1)/2 )), the angle is (s * 180)/n degrees.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- For each possible s (step counts), calculate the angle.\n- Find the s that gives the angle closest to a.\n- Then, construct the triplet of vertices accordingly.\n\nNow, the problem requires finding three vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each possible s (from 1 to m), calculate the angle.\n\n2. Find the s that minimizes |angle - a|. If there's a tie, any of the s's is acceptable.\n\n3. Once the optimal s is found, construct the triplet v1, v2, v3.\n\nBut how do we construct the triplet once we have s?\n\nHmm, for a given s, the triplet is v2, and v1 is s steps before v2, and v3 is s steps after v2 (or vice versa, depending on direction). Or perhaps it's the other way around.\n\nWait, no. Because for a given s, the minor arc between v1 and v3 is s steps. So, for example, in a pentagon (n=5), if s=2, then v1 is two steps before v2, and v3 is two steps after v2, making the minor arc between them 4 steps, but wait, that's not correct.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the minor arc is the minimal steps between v1 and v3. So for s=2, the minor arc is 2 steps. So, in a pentagon, if v2 is at position x, then v1 is x-2 mod n, and v3 is x+2 mod n. So the minor arc between v1 and v3 is 4 steps, but that's the major arc. Wait, no, because the minor arc is the minimal of the two possible paths. So, for s=2 in a pentagon, the minor arc is 2 steps. So, the triplet is v2, and v1 is s steps back, and v3 is s steps forward.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of moving s steps clockwise from v2 to get v1, and s steps counter-clockwise to get v3.\n\nNo, because that would result in a minor arc of 2s steps, which may not be minimal.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model it is: for a given s, the minor arc between v1 and v3 is s steps, so the angle is (s * 180)/n degrees.\n\nSo, to construct the triplet, for each s, the triplet is (v2 - s, v2, v2 + s) mod n, assuming that the minor arc is s steps. But wait, the step counts can be in either direction.\n\nWait, no. Because the minor arc is the minimal steps between v1 and v3, which is s steps. So, the triplet can be constructed by taking v1 as (v2 - s) mod n and v3 as (v2 + s) mod n. Or perhaps v1 is (v2 + s) mod n and v3 is (v2 - s) mod n.\n\nBut since the polygon is regular and convex, it's symmetric, so the choice of direction doesn't matter. So, for each s, the triplet is v2, and v1 is s steps before, v3 is s steps after, or vice versa.\n\nWait, no. Because for some s, adding s steps might give a larger arc than subtracting. So perhaps the triplet should be built as v2, v_prev, v_next, where v_prev is s steps before v2, and v_next is s steps after v2.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model it is: for a given s, the triplet is (v2 - s) mod n, v2, (v2 + s) mod n.\n\nBut wait, that would mean the minor arc between v1 and v3 is 2s steps, which may not be the minimal.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think differently.\n\nWe can represent the polygon as a list of vertices arranged in a circle. For a given v2, the points can be arranged as v2, v_prev_1, v_prev_2, ..., v_prev_s, v2, v_next_1, v_next_2, ..., v_next_s, where v_prev_1 is the next vertex before v2, and v_next_1 is the next after.\n\nSo, for each s from 1 to m, the angle at v2 is (s * 180)/n degrees.\n\nSo, to construct the triplet, for each s, the triplet is (v2 - s, v2, v2 + s), but modulo n.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the way to do it. Because then, the minor arc between v1 and v3 is 2s steps. But that's not correct because for s=2 in a square, 2s is 4 steps, but the minor arc is 2 steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the s wrong. Let me think again.\n\nIn a square, s can be 1 or 2.\n\nWait, no, earlier analysis showed that in a square, the possible s values are 1 and 2, leading to angles of 45 and 90 degrees.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the s wrong. Because for a square, the minor arc between v1 and v3 can be 2 steps, which would correspond to s=2, giving an angle of 90 degrees.\n\nSo, for each s, the angle is (s * 180)/n.\n\nSo, for s=1, angle is 45 degrees, for s=2, angle is 90 degrees.\n\nSo, for each s from 1 to m, where m is floor( (n-1)/2 ), the angle is (s * 180)/n degrees.\n\nSo, the triplet is built by selecting v1 as v2 - s steps, and v3 as v2 + s steps, modulo n.\n\nWait, but in a square, for s=2, v2 -2 is the same as v2 +2, because n=4.\n\nSo, in that case, v1 and v3 would be the same point, but that's not allowed because they must be distinct.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to take s from 1 to m, and then for each s, the triplet is (v2 - s) mod n, v2, (v2 + s) mod n, but ensuring that v1 != v3.\n\nBut when s is exactly n/2, in even n, then v1 and v3 would be the same point, which is invalid.\n\nSo, for even n, s can only go up to (n/2)-1.\n\nWait, perhaps m is floor( (n-1)/2 ). Because for even n, (n-1)/2 is (even n-1 is odd, so it's integer). For example, n=4: m=1.5, but floor is 1. So s can be 1.\n\nWait, but in the square, s can be 1 or 2. Wait, but for s=2, the minor arc is 2 steps, which is 2*(360/4)=180 degrees. The angle is 90 degrees.\n\nBut according to the earlier approach, s is 2, but m was 1. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAh, perhaps I should allow s up to m, where m is floor( (n)/2 ) -1, because when s is n/2, the minor arc is n/2 steps, which is 180 degrees, but for the angle, it's 90 degrees.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of m as the maximum s where 2s < n.\n\nBecause, for s steps, the minor arc is s steps, but when 2s >=n, then the minor arc is n-2s steps, which is smaller.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to model s as the number of steps in the minor arc. So for any two points, their minor arc is the minimal of the clockwise and counter-clockwise steps.\n\nSo, for any two points, the minor arc is s steps, where s ranges from 1 to floor(n/2).\n\nSo, the maximum s is floor(n/2).\n\nSo, for n=4, s can be 1 or 2.\n\nWait, but 2 is equal to n/2.\n\nSo, for each s from 1 to m, where m is floor(n/2), the angle is (s * 180)/n degrees.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, now, the plan is:\n\nFor each possible s in 1..m (where m = floor(n/2)), compute the angle (s * 180)/n. Then, among all these angles, find the one(s) that are closest to a.\n\nOnce the optimal s is found, construct the triplet v1, v2, v3.\n\nSo, the triplet is v2, and v1 is (v2 - s) mod n, v3 is (v2 + s) mod n.\n\nBut wait, for n=4, s=2: v1 is v2-2 mod4, which is same as v2+2 mod4. So, v1 and v3 would be the same point. That's not allowed.\n\nSo, perhaps for even n, when s is n/2, we cannot use that s because v1 and v3 would be the same point.\n\nThus, for even n, s can be up to (n/2)-1.\n\nWait, but in the square example, when s=2, the triplet is 2,1,3, which is 2,1,3. So, v1 is 1, v2 is 2, v3 is 3. The angle is 90 degrees.\n\nWait, but 2-2 is 0 mod4 is 4, and 2+2 is 4 mod4 is 0. So, the triplet would be 4,2,0, but since the vertices are numbered from 1 to n, perhaps we need to adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps I should represent the vertices as 1-based, so mod n is adjusted accordingly.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should model the vertices as 1-based. So, for v2=2, s=1: v1=1, v3=3.\n\nFor s=2: v1=0 (but 0 mod4 is 4?), so v1=4, v3=4, which is same as v2=2. So, that's invalid.\n\nSo, for even n, s can't be n/2, because that would cause v1 and v3 to coincide with v2.\n\nThus, for even n, m is (n/2)-1.\n\nWait, but in the sample input for n=4, the output includes triplets like 4 1 2, which implies s=1.\n\nSo, for n=4, s can be 1 or 2, but for s=2, the triplet would have v1=2-2=0 mod4=4, v3=2+2=4 mod4=0 mod4=4, which is same as v2=2. So that's invalid.\n\nSo, in that case, for even n, s can be up to (n/2)-1.\n\nWait, but earlier in the square example, the sample input shows that the angle can be 45 degrees (s=1) or 90 degrees (s=2). So, for s=2, the angle is 90 degrees, but the triplet is 2,1,3, which is 1 step before and after.\n\nWait, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect. Maybe for even n, s can be up to n/2, but in that case, v1 and v3 are the same as v2's immediate neighbors.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on this.\n\nAn alternative approach is: for each possible s in 1 to m, where m is (n-1)//2, generate the triplet (v2 - s, v2, v2 + s), mod n, ensuring that the triplet consists of distinct vertices.\n\nBut wait, for n=4, s=2: v2=2, v2-2=0 mod4=4, v2+2=4 mod4=0 mod4=0. So, v1=4, v2=2, v3=0 mod4=4. So, v3=4 is same as v1, which is invalid.\n\nThus, for even n, when s = n/2, the triplet is invalid, so s can only be up to (n/2)-1.\n\nThus, for even n, m = (n/2) -1.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCompute m as the maximum s for which 2s < n.\n\nSo, for n=4: m=1.\n\nFor n=5: m=2.\n\nFor n=6: m=2.\n\nThus, the steps:\n\nFor each s from 1 to m:\n\n   angle = (s * 180) / n\n\n   compute the difference between angle and a.\n\nFind the s with the minimal difference. If multiple s's have the same minimal difference, any can be chosen.\n\nOnce s is selected, construct the triplet as:\n\nv_prev = (v2 - s -1) mod n +1 \n\nWait, perhaps not. Wait, perhaps the triplet is v_prev, v2, v_next, where v_prev is the s-th previous vertex, and v_next is the s-th next vertex.\n\nWait, in 1-based indexing.\n\nSo, for v2, the previous s-th vertex is v2 - s.\n\nBut since we're dealing with 1-based, and mod n, we need to adjust.\n\nSo, for example, for v2=2, n=4, s=1:\n\nv_prev = 2 -1 =1.\n\nv_next = 2 +1 =3.\n\nThus, triplet is 1,2,3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nFor s=2, n=4:\n\nv_prev =2-2=0 → mod4 is 0, but since it's 1-based, 0 is treated as n=4.\n\nv_next=2+2=4.\n\nSo, triplet is 4,2,4 → which is invalid because v1 and v3 are same.\n\nThus, for even n, s= n/2 is invalid, so s can't be used.\n\nSo, for even n, m = (n/2)-1.\n\nThus, the code needs to handle this.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and a.\n\n2. Compute m = min( (n // 2 ) -1, ...). Wait, no, for n even, m is (n/2)-1.\n\nWait, n=4: m=1.\n\nn=5: m=2.\n\nn=6: m=2.\n\nSo, m = (n-1) // 2.\n\nWait, for n=4: (4-1)//2 = 1.\n\nYes.\n\nn=5: (5-1)/2=2.\n\nYes.\n\nn=6: (6-1)/2=2 (since 5//2=2).\n\nYes.\n\nThus, m = (n-1)//2.\n\nSo, for each s in 1..m:\n\n   angle = (s * 180) / n.\n\n   compute |angle - a|.\n\nChoose the s with the smallest difference. If multiple s's, pick the smallest s, or any.\n\nOnce s is chosen, construct the triplet.\n\nHow to construct the triplet:\n\nv_prev = v2 - s.\n\nBut since the vertices are 1-based, if v_prev is 0, it's n.\n\nSo, v_prev = v2 - s.\n\nIf v_prev ==0: set to n.\n\nElse, v_prev is v_prev.\n\nSimilarly for v_next = v2 + s.\n\nBut v_next may exceed n, so mod n.\n\nWait, but in 1-based, adding s to v2 may result in a value larger than n, which wraps around to 1.\n\nWait, for example, v2=4, s=1, n=4: v_next=5 → mod4 is 1.\n\nThus, v_prev=3, v2=4, v_next=1.\n\nSo, triplet is 3,4,1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nv_prev = v2 - s\n\nif v_prev <=0: add n to make it positive.\n\nSimilarly, v_next = v2 + s.\n\nif v_next >n: subtract n.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is:\n\nv_prev = (v2 - s -1) %n +1\n\nv_next = (v2 + s -1) %n +1\n\nBecause in Python, mod can return 0, which we want to convert to n.\n\nWait, let's test.\n\nFor v2=2, s=1, n=4.\n\nv_prev = (2-1-1) mod4 +1 → 0 mod4 is 0 → 0+1=1.\n\nv_next = (2+1-1) mod4 +1 → 2 mod4 +1=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test: v2=4, s=1, n=4.\n\nv_prev = (4-1-1) mod4 +1 → (2) mod4 +1=3.\n\nv_next = (4+1-1) mod4 +1 →4 mod4=0 →0+1=1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test: v2=3, s=2, n=5.\n\nv_prev = (3-2-1)=0 → mod5=0 → +1=1.\n\nv_next = (3+2-1)=4 → mod5=4 →+1=5.\n\nSo, triplet is 1,3,5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the formula for v_prev and v_next is:\n\nv_prev = (v2 - s -1) %n +1\n\nv_next = (v2 + s -1) %n +1\n\nThus, the triplet is [v_prev, v2, v_next].\n\nBut wait, in the first sample input:\n\nInput: 3 15\n\nOutput: 1 2 3.\n\nn=3, a=15.\n\nPossible s's: m=(3-1)//2=1.\n\ns=1.\n\nangle is 180/3=60.\n\n|60-15|=45.\n\nSo, the triplet is 1,2,3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nn=4, a=67.\n\nThe output is '2 1 3' → s=1.\n\nangle is 45 degrees.\n\n67 is closer to 45 (difference 22) than to 90",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices of a regular convex polygon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given angle. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently computing the closest possible angle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Polygon's Geometry**: A regular polygon with `n` sides can be inscribed in a circle. The internal angle at each vertex can be calculated, but we also need to consider angles formed by non-adjacent vertices.\n2. **Angles in the Polygon**: For any vertex `v2`, the angle formed by two other vertices `v1` and `v3` can be determined using the central angles. The angle at `v2` is half the measure of the arc between `v1` and `v3`.\n3. **Possible Angles**: For each possible step count `s` (from 1 to `m`, where `m` is `(n-1)//2`), compute the angle formed. This angle is given by `(s * 180) / n` degrees.\n4. **Finding the Closest Angle**: Compute the absolute difference between each possible angle and the target angle `a`. Select the `s` that minimizes this difference.\n5. **Constructing the Triplet**: Once the optimal `s` is found, construct the triplet of vertices `v1`, `v2`, `v3` using modular arithmetic to ensure the vertices are distinct and correctly positioned.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\nif n == 3:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, [1, 2, 3])))\n    exit()\n\nm = (n - 1) // 2\nmin_diff = float('inf')\nbest_s = 0\n\nfor s in range(1, m + 1):\n    angle = (s * 180) / n\n    diff = abs(angle - a)\n    if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and s < best_s):\n        min_diff = diff\n        best_s = s\n\nv2 = 1  # Choosing v2 as 1 for simplicity; any vertex works due to symmetry\nv_prev = (v2 - best_s - 1) % n + 1\nv_next = (v2 + best_s - 1) % n + 1\nprint(f\"{v_prev} {v2} {v_next}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle).\n2. **Special Case Handling**: For a triangle (`n=3`), the only possible angle is 60 degrees, so any triplet is correct.\n3. **Compute Possible Angles**: For each possible step count `s` from 1 to `m`, compute the angle and its difference from `a`.\n4. **Select Optimal Step Count**: Track the step count `s` that gives the smallest difference from `a`.\n5. **Construct Triplet**: Using modular arithmetic, compute the previous and next vertices relative to `v2` to form the triplet.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the closest possible angle and construct the required triplet of vertices.",
