For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. Let's think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem defines a major triad as having two intervals: 4 semitones and 3 semitones when the notes are ordered in a specific way. The minor triad is similar but with the intervals reversed—3 semitones first, then 4. Also, the order of the notes matters because we can arrange them in any order to find if either condition holds.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input, which consists of three notes separated by spaces.\n2. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes since the order can vary.\n3. For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes, considering the cyclic nature of the scale (after H comes C again).\n4. Check if any permutation satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n5. Based on the checks, classify the triad accordingly.\n\nLet me break down each step.\n\nStep 1: Reading the input. The input is a single line with three space-separated notes. So, I'll read the line, split it into a list, and process each note.\n\nWait, no, wait—the input is three space-separated strings, like ['C E G', 'C# B F', ...], right? Or maybe the actual input is a single string, but in the sample, it's written as a list. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the input is a single line with three space-separated notes. So for example, the first sample input is 'C E G', which is one line, not a list. So when I read from stdin, I should split the input into three separate note strings.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, for the code, I'll do something like:\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nWhich will give me a list of three strings, each representing a note.\n\nStep 2: Generate all permutations of the three notes. Since the order matters for calculating the intervals, I need to consider every possible ordering. The number of permutations for three elements is 6, which is manageable.\n\nIn Python, I can use itertools.permutations to generate all possible orderings. So I'll import itertools and create a generator for all permutations of the notes.\n\nStep 3: For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes. But how do I represent the notes numerically to compute the distances?\n\nI think the best approach is to assign each note an index in the scale, then compute the differences modulo 12 (since there are 12 notes). Let's create a list that represents the order of the notes. The order given is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait—wait, the problem says the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Oh, but wait, H is a typo? Because in music, after B comes C. Oh, the problem says that the scale is cyclic, so the list goes C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then after H comes C again.\n\nWait, but in standard Western music theory, the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, and then C again. Oh, but the problem lists the notes as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Hmm. So H is considered equivalent to B? Or perhaps H is a typo, and it should be B. Wait, the problem statement says \"H\" but in the sample inputs, like the third example is \"A B H\", which is considered as a strange chord. Wait, perhaps H is a typo, and it's supposed to be B. Or maybe H is intended here.\n\nWait, the problem's note list includes H, but in reality, in the standard chromatic scale, after B comes C. So perhaps the problem uses a different notation where H is another note. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and it's meant to be B. But according to the problem statement, the list is as given: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So H is the 11th note, and then it wraps around to C.\n\nSo, I'll create a list that represents the order of the notes. Let me write this list as:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nBut wait, that's 12 elements. So each note can be mapped to its index in this list. For example, 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, ..., 'H' is 11.\n\nOnce I have the numerical indices for each note, I can compute the distance between two notes as (y - x) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the higher note. So for X to Y, the distance is (Y - X) mod 12. But since each semitone is 0.5 tone, the distance is (Y - X) * 0.5.\n\nWait, but when computing whether it's 4 or 3 semitones, we can compare the integer values multiplied by 2. Because 4 semitones would correspond to 8 half-tones, but perhaps it's easier to represent everything in terms of semitone counts as integers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the distance as (y - x) % 12, and then see if that difference is equal to 3 or 4, but multiplied by 0.5. Wait, no, because 3 semitones would be 6 half-tones. Wait, no, wait: 1 semitone is 0.5 tone. So 3 semitones equal 1.5 tones, 4 semitones equal 2 tones.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the distance is in semitones. So between two consecutive notes, it's exactly 1 semitone. So the distance between C and C# is 1 semitone, etc.\n\nSo, for two notes X and Y, the distance is calculated as (y_index - x_index) mod 12, and that gives the number of semitones from X to Y, moving upward.\n\nFor example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc. So the distance from C to E is (4 - 0) mod 12 =4 semitones. That matches the problem statement.\n\nSo, for each permutation of the notes, I can get their numerical indices, compute the distances between the first and second, and between the second and third.\n\nBut wait, the permutation has three elements. So for a permutation [X, Y, Z], the first interval is Y - X mod 12, the second is Z - Y mod 12. Then, the sum of these two is (Z - X) mod 12.\n\nBut the problem requires that in a major triad, the first interval is 4 semitones, the second 3, and the total is 7. Similarly, for a minor triad, the first is 3, the second 4, total 7.\n\nSo, for each permutation, compute d1 = (Y - X) mod 12, d2 = (Z - Y) mod 12.\n\nThen check:\n\n- If d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major.\n- If d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies either of these, then the triad is classified accordingly. Otherwise, it's strange.\n\nWait, but what about the order of the notes? The problem says that the triad is unordered. So the notes can be arranged in any order to find if they fit the major or minor pattern.\n\nSo, the approach is correct: for each possible order (permutation), check the two intervals. If any permutation meets the major or minor condition, then the triad is classified.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Create a note_order list with the 12 notes in order.\n2. For each note, map it to its index in this list.\n3. Generate all 6 permutations of the three notes.\n4. For each permutation (x, y, z):\n   a. Compute d1 = (y - x) mod 12\n   b. Compute d2 = (z - y) mod 12\n   c. If d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major, return 'major'\n   d. Else if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor, return 'minor'\n5. If none of the permutations satisfy either condition, return 'strange'\n\nNow, edge cases to consider:\n\n- What if the same note appears more than once? For example, all three notes are C. Then, any permutation would have x=y=z. So d1=0, d2=0. Not 3 or 4. So it's 'strange'.\n\nAnother case: notes form a major triad in one permutation, but also in another. But the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so no such cases exist.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the answer is always unique, so we don't have to worry about overlapping conditions.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nFirst, create the note_order list.\n\nThen, for each permutation, calculate the two distances. If any permutation meets the major condition, output 'major'. If any permutation meets the minor condition, output 'minor'. If none, output 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, we need to process the permutations in a certain order. For example, for a given set, perhaps in one permutation it's major, in another minor. But according to the problem statement, this cannot happen. So, the code can stop at the first occurrence of either condition.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So, for any input, either it's major, minor, or neither, but not both.\n\nSo, in code, for each permutation, check for major condition first. If found, return 'major'. Then, check for minor condition. If found, return 'minor'. Otherwise, continue.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead the three notes.\n\nMap each note to its index.\n\nGenerate all permutations.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   x, y, z = the three notes in the permutation.\n\n   d1 = (y - x) mod 12\n\n   d2 = (z - y) mod 12\n\n   if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n       print 'major' and exit.\n\n   elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n       print 'minor' and exit.\n\nAfter checking all permutations:\n\nprint 'strange'.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'C E G'\n\nNotes are C, E, G.\n\nIndices: C is 0, E is 4, G is 7.\n\nPermutations include C E G:\n\nd1 = 4-0=4, d2=7-4=3 → 4 and 3 → major. So output is 'major'.\n\nSample Input 2: 'C# B F'\n\nNotes: C# is 1, B is 10, F is 5.\n\nCheck all permutations.\n\nOne permutation is B, C#, F.\n\nd1 = (1-10) mod 12 → 1-10 is -9 mod 12 is 3.\n\nd2 = (5-1) mod 12 →4.\n\nSo d1 is 3, d2 is4 → minor. So output 'minor'.\n\nThird sample: 'A B H'\n\nNotes: A is 9, B is 10, H is 11.\n\nPossible permutation: A, B, H.\n\nd1 = 10-9=1, d2=11-10=1 → 1 and 1 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: B, H, A.\n\nd1 = (11-10) mod 12 →1.\n\nd2 = (9 -11) mod 12 → ( -2 ) mod 12 →10 → not 3 or4.\n\nAnother permutation: H, A, B.\n\nd1 = (9-11) mod12= ( -2 ) mod12=10 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: A, H, B.\n\nd1 = (11-9)=2 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H.\n\nd1=(9-10)= -1 mod12=11 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: H, B, A.\n\nd1=(10-11)=-1 mod12=11 → no.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: Let's say the input is ['E G C'].\n\nE is 4, G is7, C is0.\n\nIn permutation E, G, C: d1=7-4=3, d2=0-7=5 (mod12 is 5). So 3 and5 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: G, C, E.\n\nd1=0-7=5 mod12=5 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: E, C, G.\n\nWait, no, wait, the permutation is E, C, G.\n\nWait, wait, no, the permutation is (E, C, G) ?\n\nNo, because the permutation is all possible orderings of the three notes.\n\nWait, the input is ['E', 'G', 'C'].\n\nSo, possible permutations include E, G, C; E, C, G; G, E, C; etc.\n\nTake the permutation E, C, G.\n\nd1 = C - E → (0 -4) mod12=8.\n\nd2 = G - C → (7-0) mod12=7.\n\nSo 8 and7 → doesn't fit.\n\nAnother permutation: C, E, G.\n\nd1=4, d2=3 → major.\n\nSo the output would be 'major'.\n\nSo the code correctly identifies that.\n\nAnother test case: ['F A C'].\n\nF is 5, A is9, C is0.\n\nPermutation F, A, C.\n\nd1=9-5=4, d2=0-9=3 mod12=3. So 4 and3 → major.\n\nSo output is 'major'.\n\nAnother test case: ['G B D'].\n\nG is7, B is10, D is2.\n\nIn permutation G, B, D.\n\nd1=10-7=3, d2=2-10= (2-10)= -8 mod12=4 → 3 and4 → minor.\n\nSo output is 'minor'.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, considering the code.\n\nFirst, I'll create the note_order list.\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says the notes are repeated cyclically. So the list is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the notes are written as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's 12 notes, with H being the last. So, the list is correct.\n\nSo, for each note, we can find its index by looking it up in this list.\n\nBut wait, the note may be passed in as a string with a space, like 'C E G'. So, in the code, each note is a separate string. So, for each note in the input, we need to find its index in the note_order list.\n\nSo, for example, for the input note 'C', it's index is 0.\n\nBut wait, what if the note is 'H'? It's index is 11.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_indices = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nThen, for each note in the input, we can get its index as note_indices[note].\n\nWait, but the input is three notes, like 'C E G' → split into ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nSo, for each note in the input, look up its index.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_indices = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\nindices = [note_indices[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 ==3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but in the code above, 'perm' is a tuple of three indices. So for each permutation, we compute d1 and d2.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the loop is over all possible permutations of the original three notes' indices. So for each permutation, it's considering the notes in a new order.\n\nThis should work.\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: ['C E G'] → notes = ['C', 'E', 'G']\n\nindices: C is 0, E is4, G is7.\n\npermutation (0,4,7):\n\nd1=4, d2=3 → major → output 'major'.\n\nSample Input 2: ['C# B F'] → notes are ['C#', 'B', 'F'].\n\nindices: C# is1, B is10, F is5.\n\nLooking for a permutation where d1=3, d2=4.\n\nLooking for a permutation where y -x mod12 =3, z -y mod12=4.\n\nFor example, permutation (10,1,5):\n\nd1= (1-10) mod12 → 1-10 is -9 → mod12 is 3.\n\nd2= (5-1) mod12 →4.\n\nSo, yes. So in the code, for this permutation, it will print 'minor'.\n\nSample Input 3: ['A B H'] → indices 9,10,11.\n\nNone of the permutations will give d1=4 and d2=3 or d1=3 and d2=4.\n\nSo the code will output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nAnother test case: ['E G C'].\n\nIndices: E is4, G is7, C is0.\n\nLooking for permutation (4,7,0):\n\nd1=3, d2= (0-7) mod12=5 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: (0,4,7) →d1=4, d2=3 → major.\n\nSo code outputs 'major'.\n\nAnother test case: ['F A C'] → indices 5,9,0.\n\nPermutation (5,9,0): d1=4, d2= (0-9) mod12=3 → major.\n\nSo code outputs 'major'.\n\nAnother test case: ['G B D'] → indices 7,10,2.\n\nLooking for a permutation where d1=3, d2=4.\n\nFor example, permutation (7,10,2):\n\nd1=3, d2=(2-10) mod12= ( -8 ) mod12=4 → yes. So code outputs 'minor'.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nWhat about a case where the notes are all the same? Like ['C C C'].\n\nIndices are [0,0,0].\n\nAll permutations will have x=y=z=0.\n\nd1=0, d2=0 → no. So code outputs 'strange'.\n\nAnother case: ['E C G'].\n\nWait, E is4, C is0, G is7.\n\nLooking for permutation (0,4,7): d1=4, d2=3 → major.\n\nSo code outputs 'major'.\n\nAnother case: ['A C E'].\n\nA is9, C is0, E is4.\n\nIn permutation (0,9,4):\n\nd1=9, d2= (4-9) mod12= ( -5 ) mod12=7 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: (9,0,4).\n\nd1= (0-9) mod12=3, d2=(4-0)=4 → 3 and4 → minor.\n\nSo code outputs 'minor'.\n\nSo, the code seems to correctly handle all cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Typos in the note_order list. Need to ensure that the order is correct as per the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nSo, the note_order list is correct.\n\nAnother thing: handling the modulo correctly. For example, when x > y, (y-x) mod12 would give a negative number? No, because in Python, the modulo operator returns non-negative results when the divisor is positive.\n\nFor example, (10-12) mod12 is ( -2 ) mod12 → 10.\n\nWait, 10-12 is -2. -2 mod12 is 10, because 12 * (-1) = -12 → -2 - (-12) = 10.\n\nYes, so the code correctly computes the distance as the positive number of semitones.\n\nAnother point: what about the same note appearing twice but different from the third. For example, ['C C E'].\n\nIndices: 0,0,4.\n\nLooking for permutations:\n\n(0,0,4): d1=0, d2=4 → 0 and4 → no.\n\n(0,4,0): d1=4, d2= (0-4) mod12=8 → no.\n\n(4,0,0): d1= (0-4) mod12=8, d2= (0-0)=0 → no.\n\nOther permutations involve two Cs and one E. None will satisfy the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo code will output 'strange'.\n\nThus, the code seems solid.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither.
