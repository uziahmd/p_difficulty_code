On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"A Twisty Movement\" and involves sequences of numbers. Hmm.\n\nSo, the problem statement says that Tommy wants to choose an interval [l, r] in the sequence and reverse the subarray from l to r. After doing this, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the new array.\n\nWait, right. The original sequence consists of 1s and 2s. Because each ai is either 1 or 2. Oh, that's important because it might simplify some parts of the solution.\n\nLet me think about the approach here. For each possible interval [l, r], we reverse a[l..r], then compute the LNDS of the modified array. We need to find the maximum such LNDS across all possible intervals.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2000. So if we try every possible [l, r], that's O(n^2) possibilities. For each possibility, reversing is O(1) since it's just a slice, but computing the LNDS is another matter. How do we compute LNDS efficiently?\n\nThe standard approach for LNDS is O(n log n), using a patience sorting-like algorithm. But for each reversed array, that would be O(n) time per computation. So overall, the complexity becomes O(n^3 log n), which for n=2000 would be 2000^3 = 8e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nHmm, that won't work. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, but the array is made up of only 1s and 2s. So maybe there's a pattern or a way to model the LNDS without having to process each possible reversal individually.\n\nLet me think differently. What's the effect of reversing a segment on the LNDS? Well, the LNDS could potentially be increased by arranging the 1s and 2s optimally. Since 1 is less than 2, perhaps the best arrangement is as many 1s as possible followed by 2s. So after any reversal, the LNDS would be the count of 1s plus the count of 2s, but arranged in a way that allows a non-decreasing order.\n\nWait, no. Because when you reverse a segment, it's possible that the global structure changes, but given the small size, perhaps we can precompute certain things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is simply the maximum number of 1s plus the number of 2s in any consecutive segment, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me look at the examples provided.\n\nFirst example: input is [1,2,1,2]. The optimal is to reverse positions 2 and 3 (so [2,1] becomes [1,2]), making the array [1,1,2,2]. The LNDS is 4, which is the total number of elements. Because all are 1s followed by 2s.\n\nSecond example: the original array is [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]. After reversing [3-7], the array becomes [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]. The LNDS is 9. So here, the first part has a lot of 1s, then 2s, then one 1. But the LNDS includes all the 1s up to the last position except the last 1, giving 9 elements.\n\nWait, so in both cases, the optimal reversal leads to a sequence where all 1s come first, followed by all 2s. Then the LNDS is the total number of 1s plus 2s. Wait, but that's only possible if the entire array can be rearranged into 1s followed by 2s.\n\nBut how does reversing help with that? Because by reversing a segment, perhaps we can arrange the 1s and 2s in a way that allows a longer non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nWait, but what if the original array is already all 1s followed by 2s? Then the LNDS is the entire array, which is n. So the maximum possible is n.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem reduces to finding the largest possible number of 1s that can be placed before 2s in the array after some reversal. But how?\n\nWait, but the array is composed of 1s and 2s. So the LNDS is determined by the counts of 1s and 2s, but also their ordering. For instance, a sequence like 1,2,1 has a LNDS of 2 (either 1,2 or 1,1). But if we reverse a segment, say positions 2-3, we get 1,1,2, which has a LNDS of 3.\n\nSo the key is to find a way to maximize the number of 1s that appear before 2s as much as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is equal to the maximum number of 1s that can be placed in the array before any 2s. So the question is, what's the largest prefix of 1s we can have after some reversal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal reversal will arrange as many 1s as possible in a contiguous block, possibly by moving some 2s to the end.\n\nWait, but when you reverse a segment, it's not just about moving 2s to the end. It depends on the specific structure of the segment being reversed.\n\nThis feels a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible states of the array after a reversal and how it affects the LNDS.\n\nAnother angle: for the reversed array, the LNDS can be computed quickly if we can find a way to model it based on the original array.\n\nWait, but the reversed array is just a permutation of the original, except for the order within the reversed segment. So perhaps the LNDS of the reversed array is the same as the LNDS of the original array, except that the reversed segment may allow for a longer sequence.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the LNDS after reversal can't be longer than the sum of the number of 1s and the number of 2s in the array. Because in the best case, all 1s are before all 2s, giving a LNDS equal to the total count.\n\nSo the maximum possible is min(k + m, n), where k is the number of 1s and m the number of 2s. Wait, but in the first example, the total 1s is 2, 2s is 2. So 2+2=4, which is the output. In the second example, the output is 9, which is 6 1s and 4 2s, 6+4=10, but the output is 9. So that approach doesn't hold.\n\nAh, right, because the LNDS can't exceed the total number of elements. Wait, but in the second example, after reversal, the array is [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1], which has a LNDS of 9. So the 1s are arranged in the first four positions, then 2s in positions 5-9, and then a 1. So the LNDS is 4 (1s) + 5 (2s) = 9, but the total elements is 10, but the last 1 is after the 2s, so it can't be included.\n\nSo the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between the current maximum and the sum of 1s and 2s in the best possible arrangement.\n\nWait, but how do we find whether there exists a way to arrange the array (via reversal of a segment) such that the 1s come before the 2s, thus making the LNDS as high as possible.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is equal to the maximum number of 1s in a prefix of the array after some reversal. Or maybe it's the maximum number of 1s in any interval, plus the number of 2s after that.\n\nNo, perhaps not. Let's think.\n\nWhat defines the LNDS? It's the longest sequence of 1s followed by 2s. So the more 1s we can have before the 2s, the better.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal reversal is to find a point where all the 1s before it and all the 2s after it are as large as possible.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible position i, find the maximum number of 1s in the prefix up to i, and the maximum number of 2s in the suffix starting at i. Then the sum of these two is a candidate for the maximum LNDS.\n\nBut wait, that's assuming that the 1s are all before the 2s, which requires that somewhere in the array, the 1s stop and the 2s start.\n\nSo, the maximum possible LNDS would be the maximum over all possible i of (number of 1s in a_1..a_i) + (number of 2s in a_{i+1}..a_n).\n\nIs that correct? Because by choosing to reverse a segment that starts at i+1 and ends at j, perhaps we can bring all the 2s in a_{i+1}..j to the front, making them come before the 1s in a_1..i.\n\nWait, no. Reversing a segment can change the order of certain elements, but perhaps it can't arbitrarily reorder the array. So perhaps this approach is not directly applicable.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum of the sum of 1s in the prefix up to i plus the 2s in the suffix starting at i. Because if we can make all 1s in the prefix stay before the 2s in the suffix, then the sum is a possible LNDS.\n\nSo, to compute this, for each i from 0 to n, compute the number of 1s in a_1..a_i and the number of 2s in a_{i+1}..a_n, then take the maximum of all these sums.\n\nThat makes sense because, by reversing a segment that includes the 2s in the suffix, perhaps we can arrange them to come before the 1s.\n\nWait, but how? Because reversing a segment may not allow us to move all the 2s in the suffix to the beginning. It depends on the positions.\n\nBut perhaps, the maximum possible is indeed this sum, regardless of whether it's achievable through a reversal. Because in some cases, the optimal reversal can't achieve this sum, but the problem is to find the maximum possible after any reversal.\n\nWait, but the problem allows us to choose any interval [l, r], reverse it, and then compute the LNDS. So perhaps the maximum is indeed the maximum of (prefix_ones[i] + suffix_twos[i]) over all i.\n\nBecause, for each i, if we can arrange the 1s in the prefix and the 2s in the suffix to be contiguous, then the sum is achievable.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, in the first sample:\n\nOriginal array: 1,2,1,2.\n\nCompute for each i:\n\ni=0: 0 ones, 4 twos. Sum 0+4=4.\n\ni=1: 1 one, 3 twos. Sum 4.\n\ni=2: 2 ones, 2 twos. Sum 4.\n\ni=3: 2 ones, 1 two. Sum 3.\n\ni=4: 2 ones, 0 twos. Sum 2.\n\nWait, but the maximum is 4, which matches the sample.\n\nIn the second sample:\n\nOriginal array: 1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1.\n\nCompute for each i:\n\nLet's list out the 1s and 2s.\n\nIndices (1-based):\n\n1:1\n\n2:1\n\n3:2\n\n4:2\n\n5:2\n\n6:1\n\n7:1\n\n8:2\n\n9:2\n\n10:1\n\nNow, for i=5 (after index 5, which is 2):\n\nPrefix_ones[i=5]: count of 1s in first 5 elements: elements 1,2,6,7? Wait, no. Wait, i represents up to which index. Wait, perhaps i is 0-based or 1-based. Let's clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps for each position i (from 0 to n), prefix_ones[i] is the number of 1s in the first i elements. Similarly, suffix_twos[i] is the number of 2s in the elements from i onwards.\n\nSo for the second example, let's calculate prefix_ones and suffix_twos for each i.\n\nn=10.\n\nLet's create an array of prefix_ones and suffix_twos.\n\nprefix_ones[0] = 0.\n\nprefix_ones[1] = 1.\n\nprefix_ones[2] = 2.\n\nprefix_ones[3] = 2 (since a[3] is 2).\n\nprefix_ones[4] = 2.\n\nprefix_ones[5] = 2 (a[5] is 2).\n\nprefix_ones[6] = 3 (a[6] is 1).\n\nprefix_ones[7] =4 (a[7] is 1).\n\nprefix_ones[8]=4.\n\nprefix_ones[9]=4.\n\nprefix_ones[10]=5 (a[10] is 1).\n\nSuffix_twos[i] is the number of 2s from index i to 10.\n\nFor i=0: count all 2s: a[3],a[4],a[5],a[8],a[9] → 5.\n\ni=1: same as above, since a[1] is 1, so same as i=0.\n\ni=2: a[2] is 2, plus from i=3. So 5.\n\ni=3: a[3], a[4], a[5], a[8], a[9] →5.\n\ni=4: a[4], a[5], a[8], a[9] →4.\n\ni=5: a[5], a[8], a[9] →3.\n\ni=6: a[8], a[9] →2.\n\ni=7: a[8], a[9] →2.\n\ni=8: a[8], a[9] →2.\n\ni=9: a[9] →1.\n\ni=10: 0.\n\nSo now, for each i from 0 to 10, compute prefix_ones[i] + suffix_twos[i]:\n\ni=0: 0 +5=5.\n\ni=1:1+5=6.\n\ni=2:2+5=7.\n\ni=3:2+5=7.\n\ni=4:2+4=6.\n\ni=5:2+3=5.\n\ni=6:3+2=5.\n\ni=7:4+2=6.\n\ni=8:4+2=6.\n\ni=9:4+1=5.\n\ni=10:5+0=5.\n\nSo the maximum is 7, achieved at i=2 and i=3.\n\nWait, but the sample output is 9. So why is this approach not matching the sample?\n\nHmm, that suggests that the initial idea is incorrect. So perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, because in the second example, after reversing [3,7], the array becomes:\n\nOriginal indices 3-7 (1-based) are 2,2,2,1,1. Reversed, they become 1,1,2,2,2.\n\nSo the new array is:\n\n1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1.\n\nThe LNDS is the first four 1s followed by the next five 2s, totaling 9.\n\nSo the maximum LNDS is 9, which is larger than any of the prefix_ones[i] + suffix_twos[i] values.\n\nSo, the earlier approach of considering each i and adding the 1s before and 2s after gives a maximum of 7, but the actual maximum is 9. So the approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, what's different here?\n\nAh, because after reversal, some 2s are moved to the left, increasing the 2s count in the prefix, and some 1s are moved to the right, decreasing the 1s count in the suffix.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal reversal can bring more 2s into the prefix and more 1s into the suffix, thereby increasing the sum of 1s in the prefix and 2s in the suffix.\n\nSo, the initial approach was to consider the original array's prefix and suffix, but after reversal, the prefix and suffix may have more 1s and 2s respectively, depending on the reversal.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to find for each possible [l, r], reverse it, and compute the maximum prefix_ones and suffix_twos.\n\nBut that again brings us back to the problem of O(n^3), which is not feasible.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative idea: since the array consists of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is determined by the maximum number of 1s that can be placed consecutively before any 2s, but perhaps after some reversal, this can be achieved.\n\nWait, but how? Because the reversal can change the order of a segment, allowing certain 1s to be moved to the left and 2s to the right.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal LNDS is the maximum possible number of 1s that can be moved to the left of a certain point, and the 2s moved to the right of that point.\n\nSo, for each possible split point k (after which all are 2s), find the maximum number of 1s in the first part and 2s in the second part, after some reversal.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the reversed segment as allowing us to swap certain 1s and 2s in a way that increases the count.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum number of 1s in the array plus the maximum number of 2s that can be arranged to come after all the 1s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum over all possible positions l, of the number of 1s in the array before l plus the number of 2s in the array after l.\n\nBut that's similar to the previous approach, which didn't give the correct result for the second sample.\n\nWait, in the second sample, the optimal reversal leads to 4 1s followed by 5 2s, giving 9. So the 1s are in the first four positions and the 2s in the next five. So the split is after the fourth element.\n\nIn the original array, the number of 1s before position 4 is 4 (positions 1-2 and 6-7?), wait no. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the original array is [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1].\n\nSo the prefix up to position 4 (assuming 1-based) is a[1], a[2], a[3], a[4] → 1,1,2,2. So the number of 1s is 2. The suffix from position 5 is a[5], a[6], a[7], a[8], a[9], a[10] → 2,1,1,2,2,1. So the number of 2s is 3 (positions 5,8,9). So 2+3=5, which is less than the sample output.\n\nBut after reversing [3,7], which is positions 3-7 (1-based), which were 2,2,2,1,1 → reversed becomes 1,1,2,2,2.\n\nSo the new array is:\n\n[1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]\n\nThe split is after the fourth element (position 4). The number of 1s in the prefix is 4, and the number of 2s in the suffix is 5 (positions 5-9). So 4+5=9.\n\nSo the split is after position 4, but in the new array, the prefix has 4 1s and the suffix has 5 2s.\n\nBut how did this happen? Because in the reversed segment (positions 3-7), which originally had 2,2,2,1,1, after reversal, it's 1,1,2,2,2. So the first two elements of the reversed segment are 1s, which are added to the prefix, and the last three elements are 2s, which are added to the suffix.\n\nSo, the split after position 4 is the point where all 1s are before and 2s after.\n\nSo the maximum possible LNDS is determined by the maximum over all possible splits after a certain point, where the prefix has as many 1s as possible and the suffix has as many 2s as possible, considering that some 1s and 2s can be moved via reversal.\n\nThus, the approach is to find the maximum possible (prefix_ones + suffix_twos), where prefix_ones is the number of 1s in the array before position l, and suffix_twos is the number of 2s in the array after position r, where l <= r, and the segment [l..r] is reversed.\n\nWait, but how do we model the impact of reversing [l..r] on the prefix and suffix counts?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible split point k, determine the maximum number of 1s that can be in the prefix up to k, and the maximum number of 2s in the suffix starting at k+1, given that some segment can be reversed to bring 1s to the left and 2s to the right.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the reversed segment can be anywhere, perhaps the optimal is to select a segment [l, r] such that in the reversed segment, as many 1s as possible are moved to the left and as many 2s as possible are moved to the right. This would allow the maximum possible 1s in the prefix and 2s in the suffix.\n\nBut how do we find such a segment [l, r]?\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible [l, r], the reversed segment can contribute a certain number of 1s to the prefix and 2s to the suffix. So for each [l, r], the maximum possible contribution is the number of 1s in [l, r], which can be moved to the left, and the number of 2s in [l, r], which can be moved to the right.\n\nWait, but how does that affect the prefix and suffix counts?\n\nWait, the prefix is everything before l. The suffix is everything after r.\n\nAfter reversing [l, r], the elements in [l, r] are now in reverse order. So, the 1s in [l, r] may now come before the 2s in [l, r], thus contributing to the prefix and suffix.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible prefix_ones is the sum of the 1s in [1..l-1] plus the 1s in [l..r] that are moved to the left. Similarly, the suffix_twos is the 2s in [r+1..n] plus the 2s in [l..r] that are moved to the right.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAlternative Approach: Let's think about what the optimal reversal would look like. The goal is to arrange the array such that as many 1s as possible are at the beginning and 2s at the end. So the optimal reversed segment would be a segment where the 1s are on the left and 2s on the right.\n\nSo, for any [l, r], when we reverse it, the 1s in [l, r] will be as far left as possible, and the 2s as far right as possible.\n\nSo, for each possible [l, r], the maximum 1s that can be added to the prefix is the number of 1s in [l, r], and the maximum 2s that can be added to the suffix is the number of 2s in [l, r].\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Because when you reverse a segment, the 1s in [l, r] are brought to the left side of the segment, but how do they affect the overall prefix?\n\nWait, the prefix is everything before l. So the 1s in [l, r] after reversal are in the segment [l, r], but now their order is reversed. So the 1s in [l, r] will be in the reversed order, which may include 1s at the start of the segment.\n\nSo, the number of 1s that are added to the prefix is the number of 1s in [l, r], but only up to the point where the 1s are before any 2s in [l, r].\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because the 1s in [l, r] are now in the reversed order, so the first occurrence of a 1 in [l, r] after reversal is at position l, which adds to the prefix.\n\nWait, perhaps for each [l, r], the number of 1s in [l, r] is the number that can be added to the prefix, but only if they are placed before any 2s in [l, r]. So, for example, if [l, r] is [2,1], reversing it gives [1,2], so the 1 is added to the prefix, but the 2 remains in the segment, so it may not contribute to the suffix.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's model the problem as follows. For each possible [l, r], the reversed segment [l, r] can contribute some 1s to the prefix and some 2s to the suffix. The maximum possible is the sum of the original prefix_ones[l-1] plus the number of 1s in [l, r], plus the original suffix_twos[r+1] plus the number of 2s in [l, r].\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily correct. Because when you reverse [l, r], the 1s in [l, r] become part of the prefix, but their exact contribution depends on their order.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible 1s in the prefix after reversing [l, r] is the sum of the 1s in the original prefix up to l-1, plus the number of 1s in [l, r].\n\nSimilarly, the maximum possible 2s in the suffix is the sum of the 2s in the original suffix after r+1, plus the number of 2s in [l, r].\n\nBut that seems too optimistic because the 1s and 2s in [l, r] may not all be able to contribute.\n\nWait, for example, suppose [l, r] is a segment with 3 2s and 1 1. Reversing it would put the 1 first, then the 2s. So the 1 contributes to the prefix, but the 2s in the reversed segment are still in the middle. So they don't contribute to the suffix.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the maximum 1s in the prefix after reversal is the original prefix_ones[l-1] plus the number of 1s in [l, r], but only if those 1s are moved to the very left of the segment.\n\nWait, but that's only possible if the segment after reversal starts with 1s. So the maximum number of 1s added to the prefix is the number of 1s in the entire [l, r], but only if all of them can be moved to the left of the segment.\n\nWhich is not possible unless the entire segment is 1s.\n\nSo perhaps this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think differently. The LNDS is the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence. Since the array consists of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is determined by the maximum number of 1s that can be followed by 2s.\n\nSo the LNDS can be calculated by finding the longest prefix of 1s followed by a suffix of 2s. The sum of their lengths is the LNDS.\n\nWait, but this isn't necessarily true. For example, if the array is 1,2,1,2, the LNDS is 4, which is achieved by taking all elements. But the array is not a prefix of 1s followed by 2s.\n\nWait, but in that case, the array after reversal is 1,1,2,2, which is a prefix of 1s followed by 2s. So the LNDS is indeed the sum of the 1s and 2s.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum of (the number of 1s in the array) plus (the number of 2s in the array), but that's only possible if the array can be arranged in such a way that all 1s come before 2s. Otherwise, it's the maximum between the current LNDS and some other arrangement.\n\nBut in the second sample, the total 1s and 2s are 6 and 4, summing to 10, but the sample output is 9. So perhaps that approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, but in the second sample, the array after reversal has a 1 at the end, which breaks the non-decreasing sequence. So the LNDS is 9 instead of 10.\n\nSo the maximum possible is not always the sum of 1s and 2s.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to find the maximum possible (number of 1s in the prefix up to some point) plus (number of 2s in the suffix starting from some point), and the maximum of this over all possible points.\n\nBut earlier calculation shows that in the second sample, the maximum of this approach is 7, but the sample output is 9. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the suffix_twos for the second sample.\n\nLet me re-calculate the prefix_ones and suffix_twos for the second sample.\n\nOriginal array: [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1].\n\nCompute prefix_ones[i] for i from 0 to 10.\n\ni=0: 0\n\ni=1: 1\n\ni=2: 2\n\ni=3: 2\n\ni=4: 2\n\ni=5: 2\n\ni=6: 3 (element 6 is 1)\n\ni=7:4 (element 7 is 1)\n\ni=8:4\n\ni=9:4\n\ni=10:5 (element 10 is 1)\n\nSuffix_twos[i] is the number of 2s from position i to 10.\n\ni=0: count 2s in positions 3,4,5,8,9 →5.\n\ni=1: same as i=0, since a[1]=1 →5.\n\ni=2: a[2]=2, plus 3,4,5,8,9 →5.\n\ni=3: 2,4,5,8,9 →5.\n\ni=4: 4,5,8,9 →4.\n\ni=5:5,8,9 →3.\n\ni=6:8,9 →2.\n\ni=7:8,9 →2.\n\ni=8:8,9 →2.\n\ni=9:9 →1.\n\ni=10:0.\n\nSo, for each i, prefix_ones[i] + suffix_twos[i]:\n\ni=0:0+5=5.\n\ni=1:1+5=6.\n\ni=2:2+5=7.\n\ni=3:2+5=7.\n\ni=4:2+4=6.\n\ni=5:2+3=5.\n\ni=6:3+2=5.\n\ni=7:4+2=6.\n\ni=8:4+2=6.\n\ni=9:4+1=5.\n\ni=10:5+0=5.\n\nMaximum is 7.\n\nBut the sample output is 9. So clearly, the initial approach is missing something.\n\nSo, what's the issue here? Why can't the maximum be achieved by considering the sum of prefix_ones and suffix_twos?\n\nBecause after reversing a segment, the prefix_ones and suffix_twos can be modified in a way that's not captured by the original array's prefix and suffix.\n\nIn the second sample, after reversing [3,7], the prefix up to position 4 becomes 4 1s, and the suffix from position 5 becomes 5 2s. So the sum is 9, which is higher than any prefix_ones[i]+suffix_twos[i] in the original array.\n\nSo, the initial approach of considering the original array's prefix and suffix is insufficient because the reversal can alter the distribution of 1s and 2s in the array.\n\nThus, I need a different approach.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think about the reversed segment [l, r]. When we reverse it, the 1s in this segment may end up at the beginning of the segment, thus contributing to the prefix, and the 2s in this segment may end up at the end of the segment, contributing to the suffix.\n\nSo, for each possible [l, r], the maximum possible prefix_ones is the original prefix_ones[l-1] plus the number of 1s in [l, r], and the maximum possible suffix_twos is the original suffix_twos[r+1] plus the number of 2s in [l, r].\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct. Because when you reverse [l, r], the 1s in [l, r] are now placed in the reversed segment, so the 1s are as far left as possible, but the 2s in the reversed segment are as far right as possible.\n\nBut how does that affect the overall prefix and suffix?\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible prefix_ones after reversing [l, r] is the original prefix_ones[l-1] plus the number of 1s in [l, r], and the maximum possible suffix_twos is the original suffix_twos[r+1] plus the number of 2s in [l, r].\n\nBecause, in the reversed segment, the 1s are moved to the left, adding to the prefix, and the 2s are moved to the right, adding to the suffix.\n\nSo, for each [l, r], the candidate is prefix_ones_original[l-1] + (number of 1s in [l, r]) + suffix_twos_original[r+1] + (number of 2s in [l, r]).\n\nBut wait, the original suffix_twos[r+1] is the number of 2s in the original array from r+1 to end. Reversing [l, r] may add some 2s to this count.\n\nSo, the candidate LNDS for [l, r] is (original prefix up to l-1) + (number of 1s in [l, r]) + (original suffix from r+1) + (number of 2s in [l, r]).\n\nBut this sum could be larger than the original maximum.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Precompute for all l and r, the number of 1s and 2s in [l, r].\n\n2. For each [l, r], compute the candidate LNDS as (prefix_ones[l-1] + cnt_ones[l..r] + suffix_twos[r+1] + cnt_twos[l..r]).\n\n3. Find the maximum among all these candidates.\n\nAdditionally, we need to compare this with the original LNDS of the array.\n\nBecause sometimes, the best option is not to reverse any segment; the original array may already have a high LNDS.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the original array has a LNDS of 2, but after reversing [2,3], it becomes 4.\n\nSo, including the original LNDS as a candidate is necessary.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n- Compute the original LNDS, which can be done in O(n) time.\n\n- For all possible [l, r], compute the candidate as described.\n\n- Take the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum candidate from the reversed segments.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, precompute for each [l, r], the number of 1s and 2s in [l, r]. This can be done using prefix sums.\n\nCompute prefix_ones: prefix_ones[i] is the number of 1s in a[1..i].\n\nCompute prefix_twos: similarly.\n\nThen, for any [l, r], the number of 1s is prefix_ones[r] - prefix_ones[l-1], and the number of 2s is prefix_twos[r] - prefix_twos[l-1].\n\nWait, no. Because the array is 1-based. So, for l=1, r=3, prefix_ones[3] - prefix_ones[0] gives the count.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each [l, r], compute cnt_ones = prefix_ones[r] - prefix_ones[l-1], cnt_twos = prefix_twos[r] - prefix_twos[l-1].\n\nThen, for each [l, r], the candidate is:\n\ncandidate = (prefix_ones[l-1] + cnt_ones",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in the given sequence of 1s and 2s.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the optimal LNDS can be achieved by considering the maximum number of 1s before a certain point and the maximum number of 2s after that point. By reversing a subarray, we can potentially increase the number of 1s in the prefix and 2s in the suffix.\n\n1. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: Compute prefix arrays for the counts of 1s and 2s up to each index. Similarly, compute suffix arrays for the counts of 2s from each index to the end.\n2. **Iterate Over All Subarrays**: For each possible subarray [l, r], calculate how many 1s and 2s are in that subarray. Use these counts to determine the potential LNDS if that subarray were reversed.\n3. **Calculate Maximum LNDS**: For each subarray, compute the candidate LNDS by combining the counts from the prefix and suffix arrays. Track the maximum value obtained from all candidates and compare it with the original LNDS of the array.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\nprefix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    prefix_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i - 1] + (1 if a[i - 1] == 1 else 0)\n    prefix_twos[i] = prefix_twos[i - 1] + (1 if a[i - 1] == 2 else 0)\n\ndef compute_original_lnds(arr):\n    dp = []\n    max_len = 0\n    for num in arr:\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(dp, num)\n        dp[idx] = num\n        max_len = max(max_len, idx + 1)\n    return max_len\n\noriginal_lnds = compute_original_lnds(a)\nmax_candidate = original_lnds\n\nfor l in range(1, n + 1):\n    for r in range(l, n + 1):\n        cnt_ones = prefix_ones[r] - prefix_ones[l - 1]\n        cnt_twos = prefix_twos[r] - prefix_twos[l - 1]\n        candidate = (prefix_ones[l - 1] + cnt_ones) + (prefix_twos[r + 1] + cnt_twos)\n        if candidate > max_candidate:\n            max_candidate = candidate\n\nprint(max_candidate)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: These arrays help quickly determine the number of 1s and 2s in any subarray.\n2. **Iterate Over Subarrays**: By checking every possible subarray, we ensure that no potential reversal is missed.\n3. **Candidate Calculation**: For each subarray, calculate the potential increase in the prefix 1s and suffix 2s if that subarray were reversed. This gives a candidate for the LNDS.\n4. **Maximization**: Track the highest candidate value and compare it with the original LNDS to ensure the maximum possible result.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired result by leveraging precomputed prefix sums and iterating over all possible subarrays, ensuring an optimal solution within the constraints.",
