The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They each have their own sequences of moves, and after each round, the loser gets a red spot. My task is to determine how many red spots each has after n rounds.\n\nHmm, let me break down the problem. Both players are cycling through their sequences. So for each round, Nikephoros shows A[i], Polycarpus shows B[j]. Then based on the outcome, either one gets a point.\n\nWait, right. For each round i (from 0 to n-1), we need to find out who loses. Because that's who gets the red spot.\n\nSo first, I think I should model each move and determine the winner for each round.\n\nLet me think about the rules again. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock. If same, it's a draw.\n\nSo for each round, compare A's move and B's move:\n\nCase 1: A beats B → B gets a spot.\nCase 2: B beats A → A gets a spot.\nCase 3: Draw → no spots.\n\nSo for each round, I need to calculate whether there's a winner and who it is.\n\nBut since the sequences are cyclic, I need to track which move each player is showing in each round.\n\nSo for each round t (from 0 to n-1):\n\nNikephoros's move is A[t % m], where m is the length of A.\nPolycarpus's move is B[t % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nThen, compare these two moves to see who wins.\n\nWait, but wait—each round uses the t-th move from each sequence. So for round 0, both use their first element. Round 1, second, etc. And when they run out, it wraps around.\n\nSo yes, the mod operation is correct.\n\nSo for each t in 0..n-1:\n\na = A[(t) % len(A)]\nb = B[(t) % len(B)]\n\nThen determine if a beats b or vice versa.\n\nIf a beats b → Polycarpus gets a spot (since he lost).\nIf b beats a → Nikephoros gets a spot.\nElse, no one.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize two counters, countA and countB, both starting at 0.\n\nLoop over each round from 0 to n-1:\n\n   get a = A[t % m]\n   get b = B[t % k]\n\n   check if a beats b:\n      if yes → increment countB\n   else if b beats a:\n      increment countA\n   else:\n      do nothing\n\nWait, but how do I check if a beats b?\n\nI can represent each choice as a function that returns True if a beats b, False otherwise.\n\nFor example:\n\ndef beats(a, b):\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return True\n    elif (b == 'R' and a == 'S') or (b == 'S' and a == 'P') or (b == 'P' and a == 'R'):\n        return False  # because b beats a\n    else:\n        return False  # same, no one wins\n\nWait, maybe a better way. Alternatively, create a dictionary that maps each move to what it beats.\n\nbeats_map = {\n    'R': 'S',\n    'S': 'P',\n    'P': 'R'\n}\n\nSo if a beats b, then beats_map[a] == b.\n\nSo for a given a and b:\n\nif beats_map[a] == b → a wins, so B gets a spot.\n\nelif beats_map[b] == a → B's move beats A's, so A gets a spot.\n\nelse → it's a draw.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo for each round, we can compute whether a wins or b wins.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\ncountA = 0\ncountB = 0\n\nfor t in range(n):\n    a = A[ t % m ]\n    b = B[ t % k ]\n    if beats_map[a] == b:\n        countB +=1\n    elif beats_map[b] == a:\n        countA +=1\n    else:\n        pass\n\nThen output countA and countB.\n\nWait, but in the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n7\nRPS\nRSPP\n\nSo A is 'RPS' (length 3), B is 'RSPP' (length 4).\n\nLet's simulate the rounds:\n\nRound 0:\nA[",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots each player gets after playing n rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each round, the winner pinches the loser, resulting in a red spot. The players follow cyclic sequences of moves, and the winner is determined based on the game rules.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves simulating a Rock-Paper-Scissors game where two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, each have their own sequences of moves. The goal is to count the number of times each player loses a round, which results in a red spot.\n\n2. **Intuition**: Each player cycles through their respective sequences of moves. For each round, we need to compare the moves of both players to determine the winner. If a player wins, they get a red spot on the loser.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We will use a loop to simulate each round, cycling through the moves of both players using modulo operations to handle the cyclic nature of their sequences. We will use a dictionary to map each move to the move it beats, allowing us to quickly determine the winner of each round.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves iterating through each of the n rounds once, making the time complexity O(n), which is efficient given the constraints (n up to 2*10^9). The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a fixed amount of additional memory.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nbeats_map = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\ncountA = 0\ncountB = 0\n\nfor t in range(n):\n    a = A[t % len(A)]\n    b = B[t % len(B)]\n    if beats_map[a] == b:\n        countB += 1\n    elif beats_map[b] == a:\n        countA += 1\n\nprint(countA, countB)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: We read the number of rounds `n` and the sequences `A` and `B` from the input.\n2. **Dictionary for Moves**: The `beats_map` dictionary maps each move to the move it can beat.\n3. **Loop Through Rounds**: For each round, we determine the current move of both players using modulo operations to cycle through their sequences.\n4. **Determine Winner**: Using the `beats_map`, we check if either player's move beats the other. If so, we increment the corresponding counter for the winner.\n5. **Output Results**: Finally, we print the counts of red spots for both players.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the game and correctly counts the red spots based on the cyclic nature of the players' strategies.",
