    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"TV Game,\" and from the description, I need to find a sequence of moves for Homer and Marge that maximizes their total prize. \n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step. The game involves two players taking turns picking digits from a string A. Each player makes exactly n moves. On each turn, the current player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their number. Then that digit is removed from A. Initially, both S1 and S2 are empty. At the end, the first player gets S1 dollars and the second gets S2 dollars. We need to maximize the sum of these two numbers.\n\nWait, but how do we determine the maximum sum? Oh right, because the order in which the digits are picked affects the numerical values of S1 and S2. So our goal is to assign digits to S1 and S2 in such a way that when converted into numbers, their sum is as large as possible.\n\nHmm, but wait, the output isn't just the maximum sum; it's the sequence of moves—each move being either 'H' or 'M'. So the problem reduces to figuring out for each digit whether it should be assigned to H or M in such a way that the overall sum of the two resulting numbers is maximized. But since H and M alternate turns, the assignment depends on the position in the sequence of moves.\n\nSo the key here is to model the problem as choosing, for each digit, whether it goes to H or M, but with the constraint that exactly n digits go to each. And we need to choose the assignments that maximize the sum of S1 and S2.\n\nWait, but how does the order of digits affect S1 and S2? Because each digit is taken from the left, the earlier digits have higher significance in their respective numbers.\n\nFor example, suppose the digits are 1,2,3,4. If H picks 1, then M picks 2, then H picks 3, then M picks 4. Then S1 is 13 and S2 is 24. Sum is 37. Alternatively, if H picks 1, M picks 3, H picks 2, M picks 4: S1 is 12, S2 is 34, sum is 46, which is better.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the first scenario, the digits are taken in order 1,2,3,4. But wait, the initial arrangement is 1234. So the order in which they are taken is the same as the order of the string.\n\nSo the problem is similar to assigning each digit to either H or M, but with the condition that exactly n digits are assigned to each. However, the assignment must follow the order of the digits in A, because each digit is taken from the left one by one.\n\nSo each digit is processed in the given order, and for each digit, we decide whether it goes to H or M, but subject to the fact that H and M each make exactly n moves. So the problem is to partition the 2n digits into two groups of size n each, where the order within each group determines the numerical value.\n\nBut wait, the order matters because the first digit taken is the most significant digit. So the first digit in A will be the first digit of either S1 or S2, depending on whether H or M picks it. The next digit will be added to the next available number, and so on.\n\nWait, no. Because the selection is done in the order of the string. For each step i (from 0 to 2n-1), the current player takes the first digit. So the first digit is taken by the first player, the second digit by the second player, etc., but not exactly because the players alternate based on who made the previous move.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of the entire process as a sequence of decisions: for each position in the string A, decide whether it's H's turn or M's turn. But H and M must each have exactly n moves.\n\nWait, but the initial state is that both S1 and S2 are empty. So the first move is made by whoever is the first player (but the problem says that before each turn, they determine who will make the next move). Wait, no—the initial state has no player chosen. So the problem says that each player makes exactly n moves. So the sequence must consist of exactly n H's and n M's, arranged in some order. But the assignment of which move corresponds to which digit must be such that the first digit is assigned to either H or M, then the second digit to the other player, and so on, but with the possibility of switching who starts.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that each player makes exactly n moves. So the sequence of H and M must consist of exactly n H's and n M's. The order in which they appear determines which player takes which digit.\n\nBut how do the digits get assigned to H and M? Let me think of it as follows: the first move is made by either H or M. Let's say the first move is H, then the second must be M, then H, etc. But wait, no. Because after each move, the next player is determined again. Or maybe the choice is made before each move. So the sequence is determined by a series of choices, each time selecting whether it's H or M's turn, but ensuring that in the end, each has made exactly n moves.\n\nWait, no. The problem says, \"Each player should make exactly n moves.\" So the sequence of moves must consist of exactly n H's and n M's, but the order can vary. So for each position in the 2n-length string, we have to decide whether it's H or M, such that the count of each is exactly n.\n\nBut the assignment of the digits depends on the order of the players. For example, the first digit is taken by the first player (H or M?), the second by the next player, etc. Wait, no—because the sequence of players is determined by the choices made before each turn. So the first move could be H, the second M, the third H, and so on. Or it could start with M, then H, etc.\n\nSo the sequence of moves is a binary string of length 2n, with exactly n H's and n M's. Each move in the sequence indicates which player took the corresponding digit in A.\n\nOur goal is to choose the sequence of H's and M's such that when each digit is added to the respective player's number in the order of the sequence, the sum of S1 and S2 is maximized.\n\nNow, the question is: How can we model this problem to find the optimal sequence?\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem. Because for each step, we have a state that represents how many digits have been processed so far, and how many moves each player has made, along with some information about the current state of S1 and S2.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 18, leading to 2n = 36 digits, the state space could be quite large. So we need an efficient way to model this.\n\nWait, but let's think about the properties of the optimal solution. The sum S1 + S2 is to be maximized. Each digit contributes to the sum based on its position in S1 and S2.\n\nFor example, if a digit d is placed in the i-th position of S1 and another digit e is placed in the j-th position of S2, their contribution to the sum is (d * 10^i) + (e * 10^j).\n\nThus, for each digit, its contribution depends on the power of 10 it is multiplied by in S1 or S2.\n\nTherefore, to maximize the sum, we want higher digits to be placed in positions with higher powers of 10 in S1 or S2.\n\nBut how do we assign each digit to S1 or S2 in a way that the sum is maximized, considering that each player must take exactly n digits, and the order in which the digits are taken affects the placement in their numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to arrange the digits in such a way that for each pair of digits, the larger one is assigned to the more significant position between S1 and S2.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose that for each digit, we have to decide whether it's assigned to S1 or S2. But the assignment isn't independent because the order in which they are taken affects how many digits each has left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as building S1 and S2 step by step, deciding for each digit whether to add it to S1 or S2, while keeping track of the remaining moves.\n\nSo the state in the DP could be:\n\n- The current index in the string A.\n- The number of digits left for S1 (initially n).\n- The number of digits left for S2 (initially n).\n- The current positions (lengths) of S1 and S2.\n\nWait, but for S1, each new digit is added to the front or the back? No, wait, each digit is appended to the end of S1 or S2. Because each move takes the leftmost digit and appends it to the player's number. So, for example, if S1 is empty and the first digit is 2, then S1 becomes \"2\". The next digit is taken from the left, which is the second digit of A.\n\nSo the digits are taken from left to right, and each time a player appends the digit to the end of their number.\n\nSo for S1 and S2, the digits are added in the order they are picked, each appended to the end. So the first digit in S1 is the first digit taken by H, the next is the third digit (if H takes again), etc.\n\nWait, no. Let's see. For example, if the sequence is H, M, H, M, the digits are taken in the order d1, d2, d3, d4. So H takes d1, appending to S1 → S1 is d1. Then M takes d2, appending to S2 → S2 is d2. Then H takes d3, appending → S1 is d1d3. Then M takes d4 → S2 is d2d4.\n\nSo the digits in S1 are in the order of the positions where H chose, in the sequence of the original string. Same for S2.\n\nThus, the digits in S1 and S2 are ordered according to their positions in A. So for S1, the digits are the ones taken by H in the order they were picked. Similarly for S2.\n\nThis complicates things because the order in which digits are assigned to S1 and S2 affects their significance.\n\nBut how can we model this in a way that allows us to compute the maximum sum?\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the contribution of a digit depends on its position in S1 or S2. For instance, the first digit taken by H is the most significant digit in S1, contributing 10^(n-1) times itself (since there are n digits in S1). The second digit taken by H contributes 10^(n-2), and so on.\n\nSimilarly for S2.\n\nThus, each digit's contribution is determined by when it is assigned to H or M, and its position in their respective sequences.\n\nWait, that might be the key. So the earlier a digit is assigned to a player, the higher its contribution. So to maximize the sum, we need to assign higher digits to positions with higher exponents.\n\nBut the problem is that the assignment of digits to players depends on the order of selection. So for each digit, the decision to assign it to H or M affects the exponent it will have in their respective sums.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the problem can be transformed into selecting for each digit whether to assign it to H or M, under the constraint that each gets exactly n digits, and the sum of their contributions is maximized.\n\nBut the problem is that the assignment isn't independent because the order in which digits are taken affects their exponents.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model the problem as a bipartition of the digits into two groups of size n each, and for each group, arrange the digits in such a way that the most significant digits are assigned to the highest possible exponents.\n\nWait, but how? Because the order of the digits in each group determines their exponents.\n\nSo for example, if H's digits are d1, d3, d5..., then d1 is the most significant (10^{n-1}), d3 is 10^{n-2}, etc.\n\nSimilarly for M's digits: d2, d4, d6... would have d2 at 10^{n-1}, d4 at 10^{n-2}, etc.\n\nWait, but this is only if H and M take the first, third, fifth digits, etc. But in reality, the selection depends on the order of the players' turns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is to split the digits into two groups of size n, such that when the digits in each group are sorted in descending order, the first digit of H's group is as large as possible, the second digit as large as possible, etc., and similarly for M's group. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about this: each digit's contribution is determined by the position in S1 or S2. For example, the first digit in S1 contributes 10^{n-1}, the second 10^{n-2}, down to 10^0.\n\nSimilarly for S2.\n\nSo, for all the digits assigned to S1, the earlier they appear in the string A, the higher their contribution. Same for S2.\n\nBut the problem is that the assignment of which player takes which digit depends on the order of play, which is determined by the sequence of H and M.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal strategy is to arrange the digits into two groups of size n, and for each group, the digits are arranged in the order they appear in the string, so that the most significant digits are assigned to the earliest possible positions.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to arranging the digits into two groups, each of size n, such that the sum of the two numbers formed by each group is maximized.\n\nIn this case, the problem is similar to partitioning the digits into two sets, each of size n, and for each set, the digits are arranged in the order they were in the original string, and then the sum is computed.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the order in which the digits are taken affects their positions in the numbers. For example, if a digit is taken early by H, it's the first digit of S1, contributing a high exponent. But if it's taken later, it's the second digit, contributing a lower exponent.\n\nSo the earlier a digit is taken by a player, the higher its contribution.\n\nThus, the problem is to select for each digit whether to assign it to H or M, such that the total sum of (digit * 10^position_in_S1) + (digit * 10^position_in_S2) is maximized.\n\nWait, no. Because each digit is only assigned to either S1 or S2. So for each digit, it's either part of S1 or S2. So the sum is the sum of S1 and S2, where S1 is the number formed by the digits assigned to H, and S2 is the number formed by the digits assigned to M.\n\nSo the problem is to partition the digits into two subsets S1 and S2, each of size n, such that the sum of the two numbers they form is maximized.\n\nBut the key is that the order of the digits in S1 and S2 is determined by their positions in the original string A. Because the digits are taken in the order they appear, each subsequent digit is added to the end.\n\nSo, for example, if the first digit is assigned to S1, it will be the most significant digit of S1. The second digit, if assigned to S1, will be the next most significant, and so on.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to choosing which n digits go to S1 and which n to S2, in such a way that the sum of the two numbers formed by these digits is maximized, with the understanding that the order in S1 and S2 is the same as their order in A.\n\nAh! So the problem is equivalent to selecting a subset of n digits from A, in their original order, such that the sum of the number formed by the subset and the number formed by the complement subset is maximized.\n\nWait, that's a crucial insight. Because once the subset is chosen, the order is fixed as per their positions in A, so the number is simply the concatenation of those digits in the order they appear.\n\nSo the problem simplifies to selecting a subset of n digits, maintaining their order, and the sum of the two numbers formed by this subset and the complementary subset is maximized.\n\nSo now the problem is to find a subset of n digits (in their original order) such that the sum of the two numbers formed is as large as possible.\n\nThis is a much simpler problem. Now, the question is, how do we find such a subset?\n\nThe key is to maximize the sum S = S1 + S2, where S1 is the number formed by the selected n digits, and S2 is formed by the remaining n digits, both in their original order.\n\nTo maximize S, we need to arrange the digits such that the most significant digits are as large as possible, but also considering that the sum of the two numbers is maximized.\n\nWait, but how? For example, suppose we have two digits, 9 and 9. Assigning both to S1 gives S1=99, S2=0 → sum is 99. Assigning one to S1 and one to S2 gives S1=9, S2=9 → sum is 18. Assigning none to S1 (but that's impossible since each must have exactly n digits). So in this case, it's better to have S1 as large as possible.\n\nAnother example: digits are 9 and 8. Assigning 9 to S1 and 8 to S2: S1=9, S2=8 → sum 17. Alternatively, 8 to S1 and 9 to S2: sum 17. So same result.\n\nAnother example: digits are 3, 4. Assigning 4 to S1: 4 and 3. Sum is 43. Assigning 3 to S1: 34, sum 34. So better to assign 4 to S1.\n\nSo the optimal approach is to assign the largest possible digits to the most significant positions.\n\nBut how do we distribute them between S1 and S2 to maximize the sum.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the sum S = S1 + S2.\n\nEach digit contributes to the sum as follows: if it's in S1, it's multiplied by 10^k, where k is its position in S1 (from 0 to n-1, starting from the left). Similarly for S2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in S1, the first digit taken is the most significant, contributing 10^{n-1}. The next digit contributes 10^{n-2}, and so on until 10^0.\n\nSo, the contribution of a digit d_i in position j in S1 is d_i * 10^{(n - 1 - j)}.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model each digit's contribution as follows: for each digit at position p in the original string, if it is assigned to S1, it contributes d_p * 10^{m}, where m is the number of digits in S1 that come after it. Similarly, if it's assigned to S2, it contributes d_p * 10^{l}, where l is the number of digits in S2 that come after it.\n\nWait, but how do we calculate m and l for each digit?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a dynamic programming problem where for each position in the string, and for each possible number of digits assigned to S1 and S2 so far, we keep track of the maximum possible sum.\n\nYes, that sounds promising.\n\nLet's formalize this.\n\nWe can model the problem using dynamic programming with the following state:\n\ndp[i][a][b] = the maximum sum achievable by processing the first i digits, having assigned a digits to S1 and b digits to S2.\n\nInitially, dp[0][0][0] = 0.\n\nFor each position i, from 0 to 2n-1, and for each possible a and b, we can consider whether to assign the i-th digit to S1 or S2.\n\nBut wait, a and b must satisfy a + b = i, since each digit can be assigned to either S1 or S2.\n\nWait, no. Because for each digit, we can choose to assign it to S1 or S2, but the total number of digits in S1 must be exactly n, and similarly for S2.\n\nSo for each digit i, we can decide to assign it to S1 or S2, provided that after assignment, the counts a and b do not exceed n.\n\nSo for each state (i, a, b), where i is the current digit being considered, a is the number of digits assigned to S1 so far, and b is the number assigned to S2, we can transition to (i+1, a+1, b) if we assign the current digit to S1, or to (i+1, a, b+1) if assigned to S2.\n\nThe value of the state is the maximum sum achievable up to that point.\n\nThe base case is dp[0][0][0] = 0.\n\nAt the end, the state (2n, n, n) will have the maximum sum.\n\nBut wait, this doesn't capture the order of digits in S1 and S2. Because the order in which digits are assigned affects their exponents.\n\nNo, wait, in this model, the order is implicitly captured because the digits are processed in the order of the string. So for each digit, the decision to assign it to S1 adds it to the end of S1, which means it contributes 10^{(n - 1 - a)}, since a is the number of digits already in S1 before this one. Similarly for S2.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because when you assign a digit to S1 at position i, the number of digits already in S1 is a, so this digit is the (a+1)-th digit in S1. So its contribution is d_i * 10^{(n - 1 - (a))}.\n\nSimilarly, if it's assigned to S2, it's the (b+1)-th digit, contributing d_i * 10^{(n - 1 - (b))}.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because for S1, the first digit is the most significant, contributing 10^{n-1}, the second 10^{n-2}, etc. So for the a-th digit in S1, the exponent is (n-1 - (a-1)) = n - a.\n\nWait, perhaps for a digit assigned as the a-th digit in S1, it contributes d * 10^{(n - a)}.\n\nSimilarly for S2, if it's the b-th digit, contributes d * 10^{(n - b)}.\n\nSo the total contribution of the current digit depends on whether we assign it to S1 or S2.\n\nThus, the recurrence relation for dp[i][a][b] would be:\n\nIf we assign the i-th digit to S1:\nsum += d_i * 10^{(n - a)}\nand transition to (i+1, a+1, b).\n\nIf we assign it to S2:\nsum += d_i * 10^{(n - b)}\nand transition to (i+1, a, b+1).\n\nWe choose the option that gives the maximum sum.\n\nSo, the DP state is (i, a, b), representing that we've processed the first i digits, assigned a to S1, and b to S2.\n\nThe transitions are as described.\n\nThe challenge is that for each state, we need to compute the maximum possible sum. Since n can be up to 18, 2n is 36, so i can be up to 36. a can be up to 18, same for b. So the total number of states is 36 * 19 * 19 ≈ 136, which is manageable.\n\nBut computing 10^{(n - a)} for each a and digit is feasible.\n\nSo, the steps to solve the problem are:\n\n1. Read the input n and the string A.\n\n2. Convert A into a list of integers, digits = [int(c) for c in A].\n\n3. Initialize a DP table, perhaps using a dictionary or a 3D array.\n\n4. Use memoization to store the maximum sum for each state (i, a, b).\n\n5. For each digit, try both assignments (to S1 or S2), and update the DP accordingly.\n\n6. Once the DP is filled, backtrack from the state (2n, n, n) to determine the sequence of assignments (whether each digit was assigned to S1 or S2).\n\n7. Construct the output string based on this assignment.\n\nNow, the main issue is implementing this efficiently, especially considering that for each state, we need to consider two possibilities, and the exponents can be very large (up to 10^18, since n is up to 18).\n\nBut since Python handles big integers well, this shouldn't be a problem.\n\nImplementing the DP:\n\nWe'll represent the DP as a 3-dimensional array, but perhaps a dictionary is more efficient, but given the small size, a 3D array is manageable.\n\nWe can represent the DP as a 2D array for each i, where each cell (a, b) holds the maximum sum up to that state.\n\nWe can initialize the DP with -infinity, except for the starting state.\n\nBut in Python, perhaps using a dictionary of dictionaries would be more efficient, but for small sizes, a 3D list is acceptable.\n\nWait, but for 36 * 19 * 19 = 13696 states, each requiring computation of two options, it's manageable.\n\nSo, steps in code:\n\nRead n, read A.\n\nConvert A to a list of integers.\n\nInitialize the DP as a 3D array of size (2n+1) x (n+1) x (n+1), filled with -infinity.\n\nSet dp[0][0][0] = 0.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to 2n-1:\n\n   for each a from 0 to n:\n\n      for each b from 0 to n:\n\n          if dp[i][a][b] is not -infinity:\n\n              // Option 1: assign digit i to S1\n\n              if a < n:\n\n                  exponent_S1 = n - a\n\n                  // The contribution is digit[i] * 10^exponent_S1\n\n                  new_sum = dp[i][a][b] + digit[i] * (10 ** exponent_S1)\n\n                  if new_sum > dp[i+1][a+1][b]:\n\n                      dp[i+1][a+1][b] = new_sum\n\n              // Option 2: assign digit i to S2\n\n              if b < n:\n\n                  exponent_S2 = n - b\n\n                  new_sum = dp[i][a][b] + digit[i] * (10 ** exponent_S2)\n\n                  if new_sum > dp[i+1][a][b+1]:\n\n                      dp[i+1][a][b+1] = new_sum\n\nOnce the DP is filled, we look at dp[2n][n][n], which contains the maximum sum.\n\nBut we also need to reconstruct the path to get the sequence of H and M.\n\nReconstructing the path:\n\nWe need to backtrack from (2n, n, n) to (0,0,0), keeping track of the choices made at each step.\n\nAt each step i, a, b, we can check whether the current digit was assigned to S1 or S2.\n\nHow?\n\nFor each state (i, a, b), we can determine whether the previous state came from assigning to S1 or S2.\n\nFor example, in state (i+1, a+1, b), the digit at i was assigned to S1.\n\nIn state (i+1, a, b+1), it was assigned to S2.\n\nSo, during backtracking, we can start from (2n, n, n), and for each step, see whether a is less than n, and whether the previous state was (i, a-1, b) (if assigned to S1), or (i, a, b-1) (assigned to S2).\n\nWe can build the sequence in reverse, appending 'H' or 'M' accordingly.\n\nWait, but how to know which choice was made.\n\nFor each state (i+1, a, b), we can check if a = a_prev +1. If so, then the previous state was (i, a_prev, b), and the digit was assigned to S1. So in the sequence, it's an 'H'.\n\nOtherwise, it was assigned to S2, so 'M'.\n\nBut wait, because in the state transition, the a and b are updated after the digit is assigned.\n\nSo, for each state (i, a, b), the next state is (i+1, a', b'), where either a'=a+1 or b'=b+1.\n\nThus, during backtracking, for each state (i, a, b), we can look at the next state and determine whether the digit was assigned to S1 or S2.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the path as a tree, and during the forward pass, we record for each state how it was reached.\n\nSo during the DP phase, for each state (i, a, b), we can store the direction taken (S1 or S2) to reach it.\n\nBut storing that information is necessary for reconstruction.\n\nAlternatively, during the DP phase, we can fill in a parent pointer table, indicating for each state (i, a, b), how it was reached.\n\nBut this may require more memory, but for 36*19*19 states, it's manageable.\n\nSo, perhaps during the DP, for each state, we can store whether the previous assignment was to S1 or S2.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the DP is built as described.\n\nOnce the DP is filled, we can create a parent table, where parent[i][a][b] is a tuple (prev_i, prev_a, prev_b, choice), indicating that the state (i,a,b) was reached from (prev_i, prev_a, prev_b) by choosing 'H' or 'M'.\n\nThen, during backtracking, starting from (2n, n, n), we can trace back to (0,0,0), collecting the choices.\n\nBut how to determine the choice.\n\nFor each state (i, a, b), we can look at the next state (i+1, a, b) — but wait, that's not necessarily correct. Because the next state could be either (i+1, a+1, b) or (i+1, a, b+1).\n\nWait, no. The next state is either (i+1, a+1, b) if the digit was assigned to S1, or (i+1, a, b+1) if assigned to S2.\n\nSo for a state (i+1, a, b), it could have been reached from (i, a-1, b) via S1 assignment, or from (i, a, b-1) via S2.\n\nWait, no. Because for the state (i+1, a, b), a is the number of digits assigned to S1. So if a is greater than the previous a, then the digit was assigned to S1.\n\nSo, during backtracking:\n\nGiven state (current_i, current_a, current_b), the previous state is either (current_i-1, current_a-1, current_b) if the digit was assigned to S1, or (current_i-1, current_a, current_b-1) if assigned to S2.\n\nBut wait, in the DP, for each state (i, a, b), the next state is (i+1, a+1, b) or (i+1, a, b+1). So, for the current state (i, a, b), the previous state is (i-1, a-1, b) if the last assignment was to S1, or (i-1, a, b-1) if it was to S2.\n\nSo, for backtracking:\n\nStart from (2n, n, n). For each step, look at the previous state.\n\nIf the previous state is (i-1, a-1, b), then the digit was assigned to S1 → add 'H' to the sequence.\n\nElse, if the previous state is (i-1, a, b-1), then the digit was assigned to S2 → add 'M' to the sequence.\n\nProceed until we reach (0,0,0).\n\nWait, but the initial state is (0,0,0), which is before any digits are processed.\n\nSo, the backtracking steps would be:\n\nInitialize the sequence as empty.\n\nWhile (current_i, current_a, current_b) is not (0,0,0):\n\n   if current_i == 0: break\n\n   if current_a == 0:\n\n       // digit was assigned to S2\n\n       append 'M'\n\n       current_b -= 1\n\n   else:\n\n       // digit was assigned to S1\n\n       append 'H'\n\n       current_a -= 1\n\n   current_i -= 1\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because for each step, the current state is (i, a, b). The previous state is (i-1, a_prev, b_prev), which is either (i-1, a-1, b) or (i-1, a, b-1).\n\nSo, during backtracking, starting from (2n, n, n):\n\nsequence = []\n\nwhile True:\n\n   if i == 0:\n\n       break\n\n   if a == 0:\n\n       // the digit was assigned to S2 → 'M'\n\n       sequence.append('M')\n\n       b -= 1\n\n   else:\n\n       // assigned to S1 → 'H'\n\n       sequence.append('H')\n\n       a -=1\n\n   i -=1\n\nWait, but the order is reversed. Because the last digit processed is the 2n-th, and the first in the sequence is the first digit processed.\n\nWait, no. The sequence is built from the last digit to the first. So, for example, the last digit processed is at i=2n-1, which is the 2n-th digit. So, during backtracking, the first digit to be added to the sequence is the 2n-th digit's assignment.\n\nWhich is the first character in the output string.\n\nBut wait, the sequence is built in reverse order. So, when we reconstruct, the first digit processed is added to the end of the sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think with an example.\n\nSuppose the digits are processed as follows:\n\ni=0 (first digit): assign to H → 'H'\n\ni=1: assign to M → 'M'\n\ni=2: assign to H → 'H'\n\ni=3: assign to M → 'M'\n\nThe sequence is 'HMHM'.\n\nWhen backtracking from (4,2,2), which is the end state:\n\ni=4, a=2, b=2.\n\nWe check the previous state.\n\nIf a>0, then the previous state is (3,1,2), and the digit was assigned to S1 → 'H'.\n\nSo the next character is 'H'.\n\nThen i=3, a=1, b=2.\n\nCheck if a>0 → yes, previous state is (2,0,2), assigned to S1 → 'H'.\n\nNext character is 'H'.\n\ni=2, a=0, b=2.\n\nCheck a==0 → previous state is (1,0,1), assigned to S2 → 'M'.\n\nAppend 'M'.\n\ni=1, a=0, b=1.\n\nCheck a==0 → previous state is (0,0,0), assigned to S2 → 'M'.\n\nAppend 'M'.\n\nNow the sequence is ['M','M','H','H'], but since we're building it in reverse, the actual sequence is 'MMHH', which is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Because during backtracking, the first step is to process the last digit, which is the 4th digit (i=3 in 0-based indexing, but in the code above, i starts at 2n, which is 4 for n=2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the indices.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nThe digits are indexed from 0 to 2n-1.\n\nThe DP processes i from 0 to 2n-1, and for each i, decides to assign the digit to S1 or S2.\n\nThe state (i, a, b) represents that we have processed the first i digits (digits 0..i-1), assigned a to S1 and b to S2.\n\nSo, the initial state is (0,0,0), and after processing all 2n digits, the state is (2n, n, n).\n\nThus, during backtracking, starting from (2n, n, n), we need to find the sequence of decisions that led to this state.\n\nAt each step, the current state is (i, a, b). The previous state could be (i-1, a-1, b) if the digit was assigned to S1, or (i-1, a, b-1) if assigned to S2.\n\nThus, during backtracking, we can collect the sequence in reverse order.\n\nFor example, the last digit processed is i=2n-1. Its assignment is the last step in the DP. So, the first character in the output is the last digit's assignment.\n\nSo, the back",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for two players, Homer and Marge, to maximize their total prize in a TV game. The game involves taking turns to pick digits from a given string, with each player making exactly `n` moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of the numbers formed by the digits each player accumulates.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - The problem can be modeled as a dynamic programming (DP) problem where we need to partition the digits into two groups such that each group has exactly `n` digits.\n   - Each digit's contribution to the total sum depends on its position in the number it forms. The earlier a digit is picked, the higher its significance.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming State**:\n   - We define a 3D DP array `dp[i][a][b]` where `i` is the current digit being processed, `a` is the number of digits assigned to Homer (S1), and `b` is the number of digits assigned to Marge (S2).\n   - The value of `dp[i][a][b]` represents the maximum sum achievable by processing the first `i` digits with `a` digits assigned to S1 and `b` digits assigned to S2.\n\n3. **State Transition**:\n   - For each digit, we have two choices: assign it to S1 or S2.\n   - If assigned to S1, it contributes `digit * 10^(n - a - 1)` to the sum and transition to state `(i + 1, a + 1, b)`.\n   - If assigned to S2, it contributes `digit * 10^(n - b - 1)` to the sum and transition to state `(i + 1, a, b + 1)`.\n\n4. **Reconstructing the Path**:\n   - After filling the DP table, we backtrack from the final state `(2n, n, n)` to determine the sequence of moves that led to this state, starting from the last digit and moving backwards to the first.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\ndigits = [int(c) for c in A]\n\nsize_i = len(digits)\nmax_a = n\nmax_b = n\n\n# Initialize DP table\ndp = [[[-1 for _ in range(max_b + 1)] for __ in range(max_a + 1)] for ___ in range(size_i + 1)]\ndp[0][0][0] = 0\n\nfor i in range(size_i):\n    for a in range(max_a + 1):\n        for b in range(max_b + 1):\n            if dp[i][a][b] == -1:\n                continue\n            # Assign to S1\n            if a < max_a:\n                exponent = (max_a - a - 1)\n                new_sum = dp[i][a][b] + digits[i] * (10 ** exponent)\n                if dp[i+1][a+1][b] < new_sum:\n                    dp[i+1][a+1][b] = new_sum\n            # Assign to S2\n            if b < max_b:\n                exponent = (max_a - b - 1)\n                new_sum = dp[i][a][b] + digits[i] * (10 ** exponent)\n                if dp[i+1][a][b+1] < new_sum:\n                    dp[i+1][a][b+1] = new_sum\n\n# Now reconstruct the path\nsequence = []\ni, a, b = size_i, n, n\nwhile i > 0:\n    if a == 0:\n        # Last move was to S2\n        sequence.append('M')\n        b -= 1\n    else:\n        # Last move was to S1\n        sequence.append('H')\n        a -= 1\n    i -= 1\n\n# The sequence is built in reverse order, so reverse it\nsequence.reverse()\n\nprint(''.join(sequence))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Dynamic Programming Table**: The DP table is initialized to store the maximum sum achievable up to each state `(i, a, b)`.\n- **State Transition**: For each digit, we consider both possible assignments (to S1 or S2) and update the DP table accordingly.\n- **Path Reconstruction**: Starting from the final state, we trace back through the DP table to determine the sequence of moves that maximizes the sum, ensuring each player makes exactly `n` moves.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal sequence of moves using dynamic programming, ensuring that the solution is both correct and efficient.",
