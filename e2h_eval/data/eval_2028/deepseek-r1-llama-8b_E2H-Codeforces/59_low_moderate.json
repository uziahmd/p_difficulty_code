    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Happy Sets,\" and from the description, I need to find the number of different arrays of sets that satisfy certain conditions. \n\nHmm, let me try to parse the problem statement step by step.\n\nFirst, the definition: A set A is a child of set B if for every x in A, there's an x+1 in B. So, for example, if A has {1}, then B must have at least 2. If A is empty, then any B is a parent since the condition is vacuously true. Also, if A has elements up to x, then B must have all those elements plus x+1.\n\nThe task is, given N and K, to count the number of arrays of N sets [S_1, S_2, ..., S_N] such that:\n\n1. Each set can contain zero or more distinct integers from 1 to K.\n2. There exists a rearrangement of the array into [S'_1, S'_2, ..., S'_N] where each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}.\n\nAnd we have to output the count modulo 998244353.\n\nTwo arrays are considered different if any index has a different set. And two sets are different if they differ in at least one element.\n\nSo, the key here is to model the problem in terms of the structure of these sets after rearrangement. Since each S'_i must be a child of S'_{i+1}, this implies a certain ordering on the elements present in the sets.\n\nLet me think about the constraints on the sets. For each i, S'_i is a subset of S'_{i+1}'s elements in some way. Wait, no, not exactly a subset because the elements could be higher but not necessarily include all lower ones. Wait, no—because for every x in S'_i, x+1 must be in S'_{i+1}. So, the presence of x in S'_i implies that S'_{i+1} contains x+1.\n\nBut S'_i can have elements that are not in S'_{i+1}? No, wait. Because if S'_i has x, then S'_{i+1} must have x+1. But that doesn't mean that S'_{i+1} can't have x as well. It just needs to have x+1 for every x in S'_i.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to look at it: the maximum element in S'_i must be less than or equal to the maximum element in S'_i+1 minus 1. Because if the maximum in S'_i is m, then S'_i+1 must have m+1, which implies its maximum is at least m+1. Or perhaps the maximum can be higher, but it's allowed as long as all the required elements are present.\n\nSo, when you arrange the sets in order S'_1, S'_2, ..., S'_n, each S'_i must be a subset (in the sense of the child relation) of S'_i+1. That is, the elements of S'_i are a subset of {1, 2, ..., max(S'_i)}, and S'_i+1 must have all the x+1 elements for each x in S'_i, but S'_i+1 can have more elements beyond that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each S'_i can be thought of as a chain leading up to S'_n, where each step adds some new elements.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this yet. Maybe we can model the problem by considering the possible \"states\" each set can have, and how they transition from one to the next.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the entire array as a sequence of sets that form a chain. So, S_1 is a child of S_2, S_2 is a child of S_3, and so on. Then, when we rearrange the array, the order must form such a chain.\n\nBut the problem allows any rearrangement of the array into a valid chain. So, the array can be any collection of sets that can be ordered into a chain where each step satisfies the child condition.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all possible multisets of N sets that can be arranged into a chain S_1', S_2', ..., S_N' where each S_i' is a child of S_{i+1}'.\n\nNow, the question is how to count the number of such arrays.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Maybe for each position i in the array, we can track the state of the set, and ensure that each subsequent set in the arrangement is a child of the next.\n\nBut wait, since the array can be rearranged, perhaps the order of the sets in the original array doesn",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid arrays of sets that can be rearranged into a chain where each set is a child of the next. The solution involves dynamic programming and combinatorial mathematics to efficiently compute the result modulo 998244353.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Child Relationship**: A set \\( A \\) is a child of set \\( B \\) if for every element \\( x \\) in \\( A \\), \\( x+1 \\) is in \\( B \\). This implies that each subsequent set in the chain must include all elements of the previous set incremented by 1.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: We use dynamic programming to track the possible states of the sets as we build up the array. The state will represent the maximum element present in the current set, allowing us to ensure the child relationship condition is met.\n\n3. **Combinatorial Counting**: For each state, we count the number of ways to form valid sets considering the constraints. This involves precomputing factorials and inverse factorials to efficiently compute combinations.\n\n4. **Transition Between States**: We transition between states by considering how new elements can be added to the sets, ensuring the child relationship holds across the chain.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    N, K = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    max_k = K\n    # Precompute factorial and inverse factorial modulo MOD\n    fact = [1] * (max_k + 2)\n    for i in range(1, max_k + 1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n    inv_fact = [1] * (max_k + 2)\n    inv_fact[max_k] = pow(fact[max_k], MOD-2, MOD)\n    for i in range(max_k - 1, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n    \n    dp = [[0] * (max_k + 2) for _ in range(N + 1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 1  # base case: empty set\n    \n    for i in range(1, N+1):\n        for last in range(0, K + 1):\n            if dp[i-1][last] == 0:\n                continue\n            # Current maximum is 'last', so the next set can have any subset of {last+1, ..., K}\n            # But also, any new elements added must not violate the child condition.\n            # So, the next set's last element can be from (last, K]\n            for new_last in range(last + 1, K + 1):\n                if new_last > last:\n                    # The new set can have any combination of the existing elements and new_last\n                    # But wait, when adding new_last, all elements up to new_last can be present or not.\n                    # Wait, no: the sets can contain any subset, but when arranged, they must satisfy the chain.\n                    # So, the next set can include any elements up to new_last, including those beyond last.\n                    # So, the number of subsets is the number of subsets of {last+1, ..., new_last} plus the empty set.\n                    # Or perhaps it's better to think that the next set can have any subset of {last+1, ..., K}, but when you include new_last, you can add any subset of {last+1, ..., new_last} to the existing subsets.\n                    # Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the transitions based on the maximum element.\n                    # When moving from state m to state t, t must be >= m+1.\n                    # For each such t, the number of ways is the sum over s from m+1 to t of C(s - m - 1 + t - s, t - s).\n                    # Wait, that might not be efficient.\n                    # Perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's consider that for each step, the next set can have any subset of {last + 1, ..., K}.\n                    # But since the next set is being built after the previous one, which had a maximum of 'last', the next set's maximum can be any value >= last + 1.\n                    # However, the next set can have any subset of the elements from 1 to its maximum.

Because the next set's elements are determined by the chain. If the next set has a higher maximum, then it can include any elements up to that maximum.

Because when transitioning from last to new_last, the next set can include any subset of {last + 1, ..., new_last}. The number of subsets is 2^{(new_last - last)}.

So, the next set can have any subset of {1, 2, ..., new_last}, but the important thing is that it includes all elements up to new_last if needed. Wait, no—the child condition only requires that for any x in the previous set, x+1 is in the next. It doesn't restrict the next set from having elements less than x+1. So, the next set can have any elements up to new_last, including any subset of them.\n                    # So, for the next set, the number of subsets is 2^{new_last}, because each element from 1 to new_last can be either present or not.\n                    # Wait, but that's not correct. Because the next set can have any subset of elements, but when building the chain, the maximum can only increase or stay the same. So, for the DP, the maximum is tracked as the state, and each transition increases or keeps the maximum.\n\n                    # So, when moving from last to new_last, the next set's maximum is new_last, and it can have any subset of {1, 2, ..., new_last}. However, the number of subsets is 2^{new_last} if we allow any elements up to new_last. But wait, no: the next set's elements are determined by the chain. Since the next set must be a child of the next-next set, it must include all elements of the next set minus one. So, perhaps the number of subsets for the next set is 2^{new_last - (last + 1) + 1} }, but I'm getting confused.\n\n                    # Let me re-express this: for each step, the next set can have any subset of elements up to new_last, but the elements must be such that if the current set has a maximum of last, the next set must have a maximum of at least last + 1.

Each set in the array can be any subset, but when arranging them into a chain, each set must be a child of the next.

Because each step can choose any new_last >= last, and for each new_last, the number of subsets is 2^{new_last}.\n\n                    # But with K up to 2e5, this approach would be O(N*K^2), which is not feasible for N=2e5.\n\n                    # So, this approach is not efficient enough. We need a smarter way.\n\n                    # Let me think differently. The problem allows any arrangement of the array into a valid chain. So, the order in which the sets appear in the array doesn't matter as long as they can be rearranged into a valid chain.\n\n                    # So, the problem reduces to counting the number of multisets of N sets such that their elements can be ordered into a chain where each set is a child of the next.\n\n                    # Now, each set can be represented by its maximum element.

Because for each i, S'_i must be a child of S'_{i+1}, which means that the maximum element of S'_i must be less than or equal to the maximum element of S'_{i+1} minus 1. Because if S'_i has a maximum of m, then S'_{i+1} must have m+1.\n\n                    # So, m_{i+1} must be >= m_i + 1.\n\n                    # Therefore, the sequence m_1, m_2, ..., m_N must satisfy m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N, or m_1 = m_2 - 1, etc.\n\n                    # So, the maximums form a strictly increasing sequence.\n\n                    # Wait, no. Suppose S'_i has maximum m, then S'_{i+1} must have m+1. So, the maximum of S'_{i+1} is at least m+1. It could be larger, but not smaller.

For each such new_last, the number of subsets for the next set is 2^{new_last} (since it can include any subset of elements up to new_last).\n\n                    # So, the recurrence is:\n                    # for each i from 1 to N:\n                    #   for each possible last in 0..K:\n                    #       for each new_last in last..K:\n                    #           if new_last >= last:\n                    #               dp[i][new_last] += dp[i-1][last] * 2^{new_last}\n                    # But wait, this can't be right because 2^{new_last} would make the numbers grow too quickly. For K=2e5, this would be impossible.\n\n                    # Wait, no. Because each step can choose any new_last >= last, and for each new_last, the number of subsets is 2^{new_last}.\n\n                    # But with K up to 2e5, this approach would be O(N*K^2), which is not feasible for N=2e5.\n\n                    # So, this approach is not efficient enough. We need a smarter way.\n\n                    # Let me think differently. The problem allows any arrangement of the array into a valid chain. So, the order in which the sets appear in the array doesn't matter as long as they can be rearranged into a valid chain.\n\n                    # So, the problem reduces to counting the number of multisets of N sets such that their elements can be ordered into a chain where each set is a child of the next.\n\n                    # Now, each set can be represented by its maximum element. Let's denote the maximum element of the i-th set as m_i. Then, for the chain to be valid, m_1 <= m_2 <= ... <= m_N.\n\n                    # Wait, no. Because for each i, S'_i must be a child of S'_{i+1}, which means that the maximum element of S'_i must be less than or equal to the maximum element of S'_{i+1} minus 1. Because if S'_i has a maximum of m, then S'_{i+1} must have m+1.\n\n                    # So, m_{i+1} must be >= m_i + 1.\n\n                    # Therefore, the sequence m_1, m_2, ..., m_N must satisfy m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N, or m_1 = m_2 - 1, etc.\n\n                    # So, the maximums form a strictly increasing sequence.\n\n                    # Wait, no. Suppose S'_i has maximum m, then S'_{i+1} must have m+1. So, the maximum of S'_{i+1} is at least m+1. It could be larger, but not smaller. So, the sequence of maximums must be non-decreasing, and each step increases by at least 1.\n\n                    # Therefore, the maximums must form a non-decreasing sequence where each term is at least the previous plus 1.\n\n                    # This insight simplifies the problem. Now, the problem can be reduced to counting the number of sequences of N elements where each element is a maximum of a set, and the sequence is such that each element is >= the previous + 1.\n\n                    # So, the maximums are m_1, m_2, ..., m_N, where m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N, and each m_i is between 0 and K.\n\n                    # Wait, but m_1 can be 0 (empty set), and m_2 can be 1, etc.\n\n                    # So, the first set can have a maximum of 0, the next 1, then 2, etc., up to K.\n\n                    # Now, the problem becomes counting the number of such sequences of maximums, and for each maximum, count the number of sets with that maximum.\n\n                    # Once we have the maximums, each set in the sequence can have any subset of elements up to its maximum.\n\n                    # So, the total number of arrays is the sum over all possible valid sequences of maximums, multiplied by the product of the number of subsets for each set in the sequence.\n\n                    # So, let's define dp[i][m] as the number of ways to form the first i sets with the i-th set having a maximum of m, and the sequence of maximums is valid up to i.\n\n                    # Then, the recurrence is:\n\n                    # For each i, m, dp[i][m] = sum_{k = prev_m + 1 to m} dp[i-1][k] * 2^m\n\n                    # Wait, no. Because for the i-th set, the maximum is m, which must be >= k+1, where k is the maximum of the (i-1)-th set.\n\n                    # Wait, perhaps I should model the DP as follows:\n\n                    # dp[i][m] represents the number of ways to have i sets, with the i-th set having a maximum of m, and the sequence of maximums satisfies m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_i.\n\n                    # Then, for each i and m, dp[i][m] can be computed as the sum over all possible k < m of dp[i-1][k] multiplied by the number of subsets for the i-th set with maximum m.\n\n                    # The number of subsets for the i-th set with maximum m is 2^m (since each element up to m can be included or not).\n\n                    # So, the recurrence is:\n\n                    # dp[i][m] = sum_{k=0}^{m-1} dp[i-1][k] * 2^m\n\n                    # But this is still O(N*K^2), which is not feasible for K=2e5.\n\n                    # To optimize, we can precompute prefix sums.\n\n                    # Let's define prefix_sum[i] = sum_{m=0}^{i} dp[i][m]\n\n                    # Then, for each i and m, dp[i][m] can be expressed as (prefix_sum[i-1][m-1]) * 2^m.\n\n                    # Because prefix_sum[i-1][m-1] is the sum of dp[i-1][k] for k from 0 to m-1.\n\n                    # So, the recurrence becomes:\n\n                    # dp[i][m] = (prefix_sum[i-1][m-1]) * 2^m\n\n                    # And the prefix_sum[i][m] = prefix_sum[i][m-1] + dp[i][m]\n\n                    # Now, with this optimization, each step can be computed in O(K) time, leading to O(N*K) overall time.\n\n                    # The initial condition is dp[1][m] = 2^m for m >= 0, since the first set can have any subset with maximum m, but since it's the first, it's just any subset.\n\n                    # Wait, no. For the first set, m can be any value from 0 to K. The number of subsets for a set with maximum m is 2^m, because each element from 1 to m can be present or not.\n\n                    # So, dp[1][m] = 2^m for m in 0..K.\n\n                    # Then, for i>1, dp[i][m] = prefix_sum[i-1][m-1] * 2^m.\n\n                    # So, with this, the solution becomes manageable.\n\n                    # Now, the final answer is the sum of dp[N][m] for m from 0 to K.\n\n                    # But wait, the problem allows the sets to be in any order, but the chain must exist. So, the order in the array doesn't matter as long as the sets can be arranged into a valid chain. However, in our DP approach, we're counting sequences where the sets are arranged in a valid chain. But the problem allows any arrangement, so the count is the same as the number of valid sequences.\n\n                    # Therefore, the total number of arrays is the sum of dp[N][m] for all m from 0 to K.\n\n                    # So, the steps are:\n\n                    # 1.
