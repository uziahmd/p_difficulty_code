He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Check the string,\" and from the description, it seems a bit tricky but manageable.\n\nHmm, let me read the problem again. So, the string is built in three steps: first by A adding 'a's, then B adding 'b's, and finally C adding 'c's. The conditions are that after each step, certain things must be true.\n\nWait, the process is:\n1. A creates a string with some 'a's. So the initial string has only 'a's.\n2. B appends some 'b's. So now the string has at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'.\n3. C appends some 'c's. The number of 'c's must equal the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before C adds them. And it's possible that C's 'c's equal both counts.\n\nSo the final string must satisfy these conditions for the process to be valid.\n\nThe task is to check whether a given string could have been formed this way. If yes, output YES; else, NO.\n\nAlright, let's think about the properties the string must have.\n\nFirst, the order of the characters must be correct. The string should consist of a bunch of 'a's followed by a bunch of 'b's followed by a bunch of 'c's. Because each step appends new characters to the end.\n\nSo the string can't have any 'a's after a 'b' or 'c', nor any 'b's after a 'c'.\n\nThat's the first condition. So we need to check if the string is a sequence of a's, then b's, then c's, without mixing. For example, 'aabbc' is okay, 'ababc' is not because there's a 'b' after an 'a' but then a 'c' comes in the middle.\n\nSo step one is to split the string into runs of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. Then check the order is a's, then b's, then c's. If any other order exists, return NO.\n\nSecond, after the a's and b's are added, when C appends the c's, the count of c's must equal the count of a's or the count of b's in the string before C's addition.\n\nWait, wait. Let's clarify:\n\nAfter B appends their 'b's, the string has some a's and some b's. Then C appends c's. The number of c's added must be equal to the number of a's or the number of b's in the string before C's step.\n\nSo the total count of a's and b's is fixed before C adds c's. Let's denote:\n\ncount_a = total a's in the string (after A and B)\ncount_b = total b's in the string (after B)\ncount_c = number of c's added by C.\n\nC's count_c must be equal to either count_a or count_b.\n\nBut also, count_c can't be zero because the problem states that after C's step, the string must have at least one 'a' and 'b'â€”wait, no, the initial step ensures that. Wait, the note says that after B appends, the string has at least one a and one b. So when C appends, the count of c's is based on the current a and b counts.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says that in the initial step, A makes sure that after giving to B, the string has at least one a and one b. So when C appends, the string before C's step already has a's and b's.\n\nSo, for the string S given as input, we need to:\n\n1. Check that the order is all a's, then all b's, then all c's.\n2. Compute the counts of a's, b's, and c's in S.\n3. The count of c's (let's say c_count) must be equal to either the a_count or the b_count in the string after B's step.\n   Wait, but wait: after B's step, the string has a_count + b_count letters. But when C appends c's, the count of c's is equal to the a_count or b_count in the string before C's step.\n\nWait, no. The string before C appends is the string after B's step. So the a_count is the number of a's in that string, which is the same as the a_count in S (since C only appends c's). Similarly, the b_count in the string before C is the same as the b_count in S.\n\nBecause C's step adds c's, which don't affect the a and b counts.\n\nSo, the number of c's added by C is equal to a_count OR b_count.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the number of letters C appends is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's in the string before he appends. So the count_c in S is equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nSo, for the string S:\n\n- After checking the order (a's followed by b's followed by c's), compute a_count, b_count, c_count.\n\nThen, check if c_count equals a_count or b_count.\n\nIf yes, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but wait: C appends the c's after B. So the a_count in the string after B is the same as in S, since no a's are added by B or C. Similarly for b_count.\n\nSo for the string S, after verifying the order, the count of c's must be equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nConditions:\n\n1. The string is a non-decreasing sequence of a's, then b's, then c's. No a's after b's or c's, etc.\n\n2. The count of c's in S must be equal to the count of a's or the count of b's in S.\n\nIf both conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but wait: what about the counts after B's step?\n\nLet me think again. When B appends 'b's, the string before C is s_after_B. In s_after_B, the a_count is the same as in S (since B only appends b's), and the b_count is the number of b's in S.\n\nSo when C appends, the c_count is equal to a_count (from s_after_B) or b_count (from s_after_B).\n\nIn the final string S, the c_count is exactly equal to a_count or b_count (because s_after_B is the string before C appends, which is the same as the initial part of S up to the c's).\n\nSo yes, in S, the c_count must be equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nSo, that's the key.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Split the string into groups of consecutive same characters, keeping track of the order.\n\nFor example, 'aaabccc' is split into a:3, b:1, c:3.\n\nIf the order is a's, then b's, then c's, else it's invalid.\n\nOnce the order is correct, check whether the count of c's is equal to a's or b's.\n\nAdditionally, there's another condition: the string must have at least one a, one b, and one c. Because after A gives to B, there's at least one a and one b, then C appends some c's (could be zero? Wait no, because the problem says that C appends some number of c's, so the count of c's is at least 1.\n\nWait, looking back: the note says that in the problem statement, after each step, the string has at least one a and b.\n\nWait, the initial step (A) ensures that after B appends, the string has at least one a and one b. Then, when C appends, the number of c's can be zero? Or is it that the problem says that C appends some number of c's.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" So 'some number' implies at least one, right? Because 'some' implies a positive quantity.\n\nSo in the final string, the c_count must be >=1.\n\nSo in our code, we need to make sure that c_count >=1, and also that a_count >=1, b_count >=1.\n\nWait, because the string after B's step has at least one a and one b.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe need to:\n\n1. Check that the string is in the form of a's followed by b's followed by c's.\n\n   How to do this? Well, we can iterate through the string and ensure that once a character is higher than 'a', it's either 'b' or 'c', and once we hit 'c', no more changes are allowed.\n\n   Alternatively, group the string into runs, then check that the runs are in the order a, b, c.\n\n2. Once the order is confirmed, compute a_count, b_count, c_count.\n\n3. Check that a_count >=1, b_count >=1, c_count >=1.\n\n4. Check that c_count is equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nIf all conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nLet's test this logic against the examples.\n\nExample 1: 'aaabccc'\n\nGrouping: a:3, b:1, c:3.\n\nOrder is a->b->c: valid.\n\nc_count=3.\n\na_count=3, b_count=1.\n\nSo c_count equals a_count (3=3). So condition satisfied. Output YES.\n\nExample 2: 'bbacc'\n\nGrouping: b:2, a:1, c:2, but wait no, the string is 'b','b','a','c','c'? So the grouping is b:2, a:1, c:2. But the order is b, then a, which is invalid. So condition 1 fails. So output is NO, as per example.\n\nThird example: 'aabc'\n\nWait, let me see: 'a','a','b','c' â†’ grouping a:2, b:1, c:1.\n\nOrder is aâ†’bâ†’c: valid.\n\na_count=2, b_count=1, c_count=1.\n\nIs c_count equal to a_count (2)? No. Equal to b_count (1)? Yes. So condition satisfied. So output YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' â†’ a:1, b:1, c:1.\n\nc_count=1, which equals a_count (1) or b_count (1). So output YES.\n\nWhat about 'aabbbc'? a_count=2, b_count=3, c_count=1. Is c_count equal to a_count (no) or b_count (no). So output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'abba' â†’ no, because the order is a, b, b, a. So condition 1 fails.\n\nAnother case: 'acbbc' â†’ after a comes c, which is invalid. So condition 1 fails.\n\nSo, the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input string.\n\nThen, group the string into runs of same characters, and check the order.\n\nHow to group the string?\n\nOne way is to iterate through the string, tracking the current character and the count.\n\nAlternatively, using itertools.groupby.\n\nYes, perhaps using itertools.groupby is efficient.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nimport itertools\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nif len(s) ==0:\n    print(\"NO\") # but according to problem, the string has at least length 1.\n\ngroups = []\n\nfor k, g in itertools.groupby(s):\n    groups.append( (k, len(list(g))) )\n\nNow, groups is a list of tuples (char, count) in order.\n\nThen, check if the order is a, then b, then c.\n\nSo, the first character must be 'a', then 'b', then 'c'. Any other order, like a, c, is invalid.\n\nSo:\n\nif len(groups) <3:\n\n   if len(groups) ==1: only 'a's. So no, because after B appends, we have at least one a and one b.\n\n   elif len(groups) ==2: possible 'a's followed by 'b's, or 'a's followed by 'c's, or 'b's followed by 'c's.\n\nWait, but in the case where len(groups) is 1: only 'a's. But the problem says after B appends, the string has at least one 'a' and 'b', so len(groups) can't be 1.\n\nSimilarly, len(groups) can't be less than 3. Because after C appends, the string must have a's, b's, and c's.\n\nWait, len(groups) can't be 2 because that would imply that after B appends, the string has only a's and b's, but then C appends c's. So the final string must have a's, b's, and c's, meaning groups must be at least 3.\n\nWait no: suppose the string is 'abc' â†’ groups are a, b, c â†’ len(groups)=3.\n\nIf the string is 'aabbbbbc' â†’ groups are a, b, c â†’ len=3.\n\nSo the len(groups) must be exactly 3, with the order a, b, c.\n\nWait, but what about a string like 'aabbbcccaaaa' â†’ that's a, b, c, a. So the groups are a, b, c, a. So the order is invalid.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nif len(groups)!=3: output NO.\n\nElse, the order of the groups must be 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\nSo:\n\nif groups[0][0] != 'a' or groups[1][0] != 'b' or groups[2][0] != 'c':\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nAlso, check that each group is a separate run: no overlapping.\n\nSo, if groups[0][0] is 'a', groups[1][0] is 'b', groups[2][0] is 'c' â†’ correct.\n\nOnce the groups are correct, check the counts.\n\nCompute a_count = groups[0][1], b_count = groups[1][1], c_count = groups[2][1].\n\nCheck a_count >=1, b_count >=1, c_count >=1.\n\nAnd check c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count.\n\nIf all these are true, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but wait: what about a string that has groups in a, b, c, but the counts don't satisfy the condition?\n\nLike 'aaabbbccc': a=3, b=3, c=3 â†’ c_count=3, which equals a and b. So output YES.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbbc' â†’ a=2, b=3, c=1. c_count=1. Does 1 equal a_count (2) or b_count (3)? No. So output NO.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nSo, steps in code:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nGroup the string into runs.\n\nIf the number of groups is not exactly 3 â†’ output NO.\n\nElse, check that the groups are 'a', 'b', 'c' in order.\n\nIf not â†’ output NO.\n\nElse, compute a_count, b_count, c_count.\n\nCheck a_count >=1, b_count >=1, c_count >=1.\n\nCheck if c_count is equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nIf all conditions met â†’ output YES else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'abc' â†’ a=1, b=1, c=1. So c_count is 1, which equals a and b. So output YES.\n\nAnother edge case: 'ab' â†’ groups are a, b â†’ len=2 â†’ output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'acb' â†’ groups are a, c, b â†’ order incorrect â†’ output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' â†’ a=1, b=3, c=1 â†’ c_count=1. Is 1 equal to a (1) or b (3). Yes. So output YES.\n\nWait, but in this case, the a_count is 1, which is >=1, b_count 3, c_count 1.\n\nSo condition is met.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbbccc' â†’ a=3, b=3, c=3 â†’ c_count=3, which equals a and b. So output YES.\n\nWhat about 'aaabbbcccaaa'? Groups are a, b, c, a â†’ len=4 â†’ invalid.\n\nSo, the code correctly handles that.\n\nAnother point to consider: the string must consist only of a, b, c. But the problem statement says the input will only consist of these, so we don't need to check for other characters.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, handling the grouping:\n\nWait, using itertools.groupby, the keys are the characters, and the groups are the runs.\n\nSo, for the string 'aabbbcc', the groupby function will give us ('a', 2), ('b',3), ('c',2).\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code would look like this.\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you use groupby, it returns the key and an iterator over the group. So, for each group, you can get the count by converting the iterator to a list and getting its length.\n\nSo, for each group, you have (key, sum(1 for _ in g)).\n\nThus, the code:\n\nimport itertools\n\ns = input().strip()\nif not s:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\ngroups = []\nfor k, g in itertools.groupby(s):\n    groups.append( (k, sum(1 for _ in g)) )\n\nif len(groups) != 3:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if groups[0][0] == 'a' and groups[1][0] == 'b' and groups[2][0] == 'c':\n        a_count = groups[0][1]\n        b_count = groups[1][1]\n        c_count = groups[2][1]\n        if a_count >=1 and b_count >=1 and c_count >=1:\n            if c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about cases where the groups are a, b, c, but the counts don't meet the criteria?\n\nLike 'aabbbc' â†’ a:2, b:3, c:1.\n\nc_count is 1, which is not equal to a or b counts. So the code correctly outputs NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbccd' â†’ groups are a, b, c, d â†’ len=4 â†’ output NO.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nWait, but what about a string like 'ab' â†’ groups are a, b â†’ len=2 â†’ output NO.\n\nAnother edge case: 'abc' â†’ groups are a, b, c â†’ len=3. a_count=1, b_count=1, c_count=1. So c_count equals a and b. So output YES.\n\nAnother edge case: 'aabbaaccc' â†’ groups are a, b, a, c, c. So len=5 â†’ output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaaccc' â†’ the group structure is a, b, a, c, c. So order is wrong.\n\nSo, the code correctly identifies that.\n\nI think this covers all the cases.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations. The string is constructed in three steps: appending 'a's, then 'b's, and finally 'c's with the count of 'c's equal to either the count of 'a's or 'b's.

The count of 'c's must be equal to either the count of 'a's or 'b's.\n3. **Non-zero Check**: Ensure there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c' in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ns = input().strip()\nif not s:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\ngroups = []\nfor k, g in itertools.groupby(s):\n    groups.append((k, sum(1 for _ in g)))\n\nif len(groups) != 3:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if (groups[0][0] == 'a' and groups[1][0] == 'b' and groups[2][0] == 'c'):\n        a_count = groups[0][1]\n        b_count = groups[1][1]\n        c_count = groups[2][1]\n        if a_count >= 1 and b_count >= 1 and c_count >= 1:\n            if c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Grouping Characters**: The string is grouped into consecutive runs of the same character using `itertools.groupby`.\n2. **Order Check**: The groups must be exactly three in number, corresponding to 'a', 'b', and 'c' in that specific order.\n3. **Count Validation**: After ensuring the correct order, the counts of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's are checked to ensure the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's.\n4. **Non-zero Check**: Ensures there is at least one of each character ('a', 'b', 'c') in the string.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine if the string could have been formed as described.",
