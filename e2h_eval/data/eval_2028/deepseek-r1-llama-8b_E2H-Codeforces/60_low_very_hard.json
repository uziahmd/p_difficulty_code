Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, Morse code and some dynamic programming, maybe? The task is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nThe problem says that each time we add a '0' or '1' to the string S, we need to compute the number of non-empty substrings that represent valid English letters according to Morse code. And since the numbers can get really big, we have to output them modulo 1e9+7.\n\nFirst, let's understand the Morse code part. Each letter is represented by a string of 1-4 characters, consisting of 0s and 1s. But not all possible combinations are valid. There are four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So any substring that maps to one of these four shouldn't be counted.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each new character added to S, we need to consider all possible substrings ending at that character and check if they form a valid Morse code. Then sum all the valid ones.\n\nBut wait, how do we efficiently track this as each character is added? Because checking every possible substring each time would be too slow, especially since m can be up to 3000, which isn't too bad, but with substrings up to length 3000, that's O(n^2) operations—might be manageable, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nI think dynamic programming is the way to go here. Let's model the problem with states that track the validity of the current substring.\n\nLet me think about the possible states:\n\nFor each position i in the string S, we can track the number of valid substrings ending at i of length l (where l ranges from 1 to 4). But since each new character only appends to the end, we can build this incrementally.\n\nWait, another idea: for each position, keep track of the number of valid substrings ending at that position. But considering that substrings can be of varying lengths, perhaps using a DP array where dp[i] represents the number of valid substrings ending at position i.\n\nBut how do we handle the different lengths? Oh right, because a valid substring could be of length 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for each new character, we need to check all possible substrings ending at it with lengths from 1 to 4, and see if they are valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each position i, we can track for each possible length l (1 to 4) whether the last l characters form a valid Morse code. Then, the total number of valid substrings up to i is the sum over all l of the count of valid substrings of length l ending at i.\n\nYes, that sounds promising. So, for each new character, we can look back up to 3 positions and check if the substring of length 1, 2, 3, or 4 is valid.\n\nLet's formalize this:\n\nWe'll maintain a DP table where dp[l] represents the number of valid substrings of length l that end at the current position. As we process each character, we update these dp values.\n\nBut wait, we also need to ensure that when adding a new character, we don't create any forbidden substrings beyond those that are valid.\n\nSo, for each new character c, we'll look back 1, 2, 3 steps (since the maximum substring length is 4). For each possible k (1 to min(4, current length)), we'll check if the substring ending at the current position with length k is valid. If it is, then we add the number of such substrings to our total.\n\nWait, no. Maybe it's better to think in terms of cumulative counts. Let's say after each step, we have a variable total that holds the sum of all valid substrings up to that point.\n\nEach time a new character is added, we look at the previous 1, 2, 3, 4 characters (but not more than the string length allows). For each possible substring ending at the current position of length l (1<=l<=4), check if it's a valid Morse code. For each valid l, add the number of such substrings to the total.\n\nBut how to manage this efficiently. Because for each new character, you might have to check up to 4 possibilities.\n\nWait, but for each new character, the substrings to consider are those ending at this character and having lengths from 1 to 4. So for each l in 1..4, we take the last l characters (including the new one) and see if they form a valid Morse code. If they do, then we add 1 to the total for each occurrence.\n\nBut since the problem requires the sum of all possible substrings that are valid, each valid substring",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of valid Morse code substrings after each modification to a string `S`. Each modification appends either a '0' or '1' to `S`, and we need to count the valid substrings that correspond to English letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Valid Morse Codes**: Each letter in Morse code is represented by a unique string of '0's and '1's of lengths 1 to 4. However, some combinations are invalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: We use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid substrings ending at position `i`. This helps us efficiently track valid substrings as each character is added to the string.\n\n3. **Incremental Update**: For each new character added to `S`, we check all possible substrings ending at this character with lengths 1 to 4. If a substring is valid, it contributes to the total count of valid substrings.\n\n4. **Efficiency Considerations**: By only checking the last 3 characters (since the maximum length is 4), we ensure our solution runs efficiently even for the upper limit of modifications.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n# Precompute the valid codes\nvalid_codes = {\n    '0': {'1'},\n    '1': {'0', '11', '111', '1111'}\n}\n\n# The reverse mapping from code to whether it's valid\nreverse_valid = {}\nfor code in valid_codes:\n    for val in valid_codes[code]:\n        reverse_valid[val] = True\n\nm = int(input())\ns = []\ntotal = 0\n# dp[0], dp[1], dp[2], dp[3], dp[4] represent counts for substrings of length 1,2,3,4\ndp = [0] * 5\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    c = input().strip()\n    s.append(c)\n    # Check for all possible lengths up to 4\n    for l in range(1, 5):\n        if len(s) < l:\n            continue\n        current_sub = ''.join(s[-l:])\n        if current_sub in reverse_valid:\n            dp[l] += 1\n            dp[l] %= MOD\n    # Now update the dp array\n    # The previous dp values may have been modified, so we need to accumulate them\n    # We can't just sum all dp because they might overlap\n    # Wait, no. Because each new character can contribute to new substrings of various lengths\n    # So, for each l from 1 to 4, add dp[l] to the total\n    current_total = 0\n    for l in range(1, 5):\n        current_total += dp[l]\n        current_total %= MOD\n    total = (total + current_total) % MOD\n    # Now, update the dp array for next steps\n    # For l=1: only the last character\n    # For l=2: last two characters\n    # But wait, since we're building on the previous state, maybe we should reset dp for the next step\n    # Or perhaps it's better to compute a new dp for each step based on the current s\n    # Hmm, perhaps my initial approach was incorrect.\n    # Let me rethink.\n    # When processing the i-th character (0-based), the new substrings added are those ending at i with lengths 1,2,3,4.\n    # So, for each l in 1..4, check if the substring s[i-l+1 ... i] is valid.\n    # Then, for each valid substring, add 1 to the total.\n    # So, the correct approach is:\n    # For each new character, check all possible substrings ending at it with lengths 1-4.\n    # If a substring is valid, increment the total.\n    # Thus, the DP approach I tried earlier isn't directly applicable. Instead, for each new character, check all possible substrings ending at it, of lengths 1-4.\n    # So, let's reorganize the code.\n\n    # Reset dp for the next step\n    dp = [0] * 5\n    for l in range(1, 5):\n        if len(s) >= l:\n            sub = ''.join(s[-l:])\n            if sub in reverse_valid:\n                dp[l] = 1  # Only one such substring ends here for each length\n    # Now, sum all dp[1..4] to get the total for this step\n    current_step_total = sum(dp) % MOD\n    total = (total + current_step_total) % MOD\n    print(total)\n\nWait, but this approach is flawed. Because for each new character, we need to consider all possible substrings ending at it, but the way I'm handling the DP is incorrect. Let me try to think differently.\n\nI think the correct approach is to keep track of the number of valid substrings ending at each position for each possible length. So, for each new character, we can look back up to 3 positions (since the maximum substring length is 4) and check if any of those substrings are valid. \n\nLet me structure it properly:\n\n- For each new character, iterate over possible substring lengths (1 to 4).\n- For each length, check if the substring ending at the current character is valid.\n- If valid, add the number of such substrings to the total.\n\nBut how do we efficiently track this? Maybe using a rolling array where for each position, we store the count of valid substrings ending there for each length.\n\nSo, let's define a DP array where `dp[i][l]` is the number of valid substrings ending at position `i` with length `l`. Since we only need the previous state, we can optimize space by using a single array and updating it as we go.\n\nHere's the corrected approach:\n\n1. **Precompute Valid Codes**: Create a set of all valid Morse code strings.\n2. **Iterate Through Modifications**: For each modification, append the character to the string `S`.\n3. **Check Substrings**: For each new character, check all possible substrings ending at this character with lengths 1 to 4. If a substring is valid, count it.\n4. **Update Total**: Sum all valid substrings found in the current step and add to the running total.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nvalid_codes = {\n    '0': ['1'],\n    '1': ['0', '11', '111', '1111']\n}\n\nreverse_valid = set()\nfor code in valid_codes.values():\n    reverse_valid.update(code)\n\nm = int(input())\ns = []\ntotal = 0\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    c = input().strip()\n    s.append(c)\n    current_total = 0\n    for l in range(1, 5):\n        start = max(0, len(s) - l)\n        substring = ''.join(s[start:len(s)])\n        if substring in reverse_valid:\n            current_total = (current_total + 1) % MOD\n    total = (total + current_total) % MOD\n    print(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Precompute Valid Codes**: We first identify all valid Morse code strings for each character and store them in a set for quick lookup.\n- **Process Each Modification**: For each new character added to `S`, we check all possible substrings ending at this character with lengths 1 to 4.\n- **Check Validity**: For each substring, we check if it exists in our set of valid codes.\n- **Update Total**: Sum the valid substrings found in the current step and update the running total, ensuring results are modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks valid substrings using a set for quick lookups and ensures we only consider substrings of relevant lengths, making the solution both effective and efficient.",
