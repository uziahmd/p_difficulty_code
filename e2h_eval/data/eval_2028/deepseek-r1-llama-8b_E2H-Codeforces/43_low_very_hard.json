He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Check the string,\" and from the description, it seems a bit tricky but manageable.\n\nHmm, let me read the problem again. So, the string is built in three steps: first by A adding 'a's, then B adding 'b's, and finally C adding 'c's. The conditions are that after each step, certain things must be true.\n\nWait, the process is:\n1. A creates a string with some 'a's. So the initial string has only 'a's.\n2. B appends some 'b's. So now the string has at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'.\n3. C appends some 'c's. The number of 'c's must equal the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before C adds them. It could also be equal to both.\n\nSo, the final string must satisfy a few conditions based on this process.\n\nThe task is to check if a given string S could have been formed this way. If yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nLet's think about what the string must look like.\n\nFirst, the order of the characters must be correct. The string should consist of some 'a's followed by some 'b's followed by some 'c's. Because each step appends letters, not interleaves them.\n\nSo the first part is to check if the string is non-decreasing in terms of the character order. That is, all 'a's come first, then 'b's, then 'c's. Any deviation from this would immediately make it invalid.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial string is all 'a's. Then B appends 'b's. So the string up to B's step is a bunch of 'a's followed by a bunch of 'b's. Then C appends 'c's, which come after all the 'b's. So the entire string must be a sequence of 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's, with no interleaving. So the string must be such that after some point, all characters are 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's. So for example, 'aabbbccc' is okay, but 'aabc' is not because 'b's are between 'a's and 'c's.\n\nSo the first thing to check is whether the string is strictly divided into 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's. No 'a's after a 'b', no 'b's after a 'c'. So any occurrence of 'a' after a 'b' or 'c' is invalid. Similarly for 'b's after 'c's.\n\nSo step one: Check the order. Split the string into runs of the same character. There should be exactly three runs: 'a's, 'b's, 'c's. And their order must be a's first, then b's, then c's.\n\nIf this isn't the case, return NO.\n\nSo for example, the sample input includes 'bbacc' which would split into ['b','a','c','c'] — wait, no, the string is 'bbacc'. Let's see: it starts with two 'b's, then 'a', then 'c's. So the runs are b, a, c. But the order is b first, which is incorrect. So it's invalid, hence output is NO as per the sample.\n\nSo the first condition is to check that the string is in the form a^+ b^+ c^+. So the runs must be exactly three, in the correct order.\n\nOnce we confirm the structure is correct, we can proceed.\n\nNext, we need to count the number of a's, b's, and c's.\n\nLet’s denote:\n- a_count = number of 'a's\n- b_count = number of 'b's\n- c_count = number of 'c's\n\nWe know that:\n\nAfter B appends 'b's, the string has at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'. So a_count >=1, b_count >=1.\n\nThen, C appends 'c's. The number of 'c's (c_count) must be equal to either a_count or b_count, or both.\n\nBut wait, how? Because when C appends the 'c's, the count is determined by the state before C added them. So the a_count and b_count are the same as before C started appending.\n\nWait, the a_count and b_count remain the same during C's step. Because C doesn't modify the 'a's or 'b's, only appends 'c's. So, the a_count is the total 'a's in the string before C's step, which is the same as after A and B's steps. Similarly for b_count",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations. The string must be constructed in the order of 'a's, followed by 'b's, and ending with 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must equal the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order Structure**: The string must consist of consecutive runs of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in that exact order. Any deviation from this structure (such as an 'a' appearing after a 'b' or 'c') makes the string invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: After verifying the order, count the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n3. **Check 'c' Condition**: Ensure the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. If both conditions are met, it is valid.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the string has exactly three runs: a, b, c in order\nruns = []\nprev_char = None\nfor char in s:\n    if char != prev_char:\n        runs.append(char)\n        prev_char = char\nif len(runs) != 3 or runs[0] != 'a' or runs[1] != 'b' or runs[2] != 'c':\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Now check counts\n    a_count = s.count('a')\n    b_count = s.count('b')\n    c_count = s.count('c')\n    \n    # Check if c_count equals a_count or b_count\n    if c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The string is divided into segments (runs) of consecutive identical characters. We ensure there are exactly three segments in the order 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n2. **Character Counts**: After confirming the order, we count the number of each character.\n3. **Condition Check**: Finally, we verify if the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If both conditions are satisfied, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the necessary conditions using a single pass through the string for order validation and another pass for counting characters, ensuring the solution is both correct and efficient.",
