They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about a playoff tournament with 2^n teams. The tournament has multiple phases, and in each phase, certain games are played where the winner advances. Each game's outcome depends on the corresponding character in the string s.\n\nWait, the string s has n characters. For each i-th phase (starting from 0 maybe?), the games in that phase have certain rules based on s[i]. If s[i] is '0', then in each match of that phase, the lower-skilled team wins. If it's '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nThe goal is to find all integers x such that there exists a permutation p of the skill levels (1 to 2^n) where x is the champion. So x must be possible as the winner of the tournament given the s string.\n\nHmm, okay. So how do I model this? I think it's about figuring out the possible ranges for x based on the tournament structure and the rules given by s.\n\nLet me break down the problem. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half, because each game eliminates one team. The first phase has 2^(n-1) games, which leaves 2^(n-1) teams. Then the next phase has 2^(n-2) games, etc., until only one remains.\n\nEach phase's outcome is determined by the current s[i]. So for each phase, we can model how the matches proceed.\n\nWait, but the key is that each phase's matches are between certain groups of teams, depending on their previous wins. So the structure of the tournament is a binary tree: each node is a match, and the leaves are the initial 2^n teams. The root is the final match determining the champion.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to model the tournament as a binary tree, and for each node (match), determine the possible winners based on the phase's rule.\n\nBut since the permutation of skills is variable, I need to find all x such that there's some permutation where x can reach the top through the tournament's structure, respecting the phase rules.\n\nHmm, thinking recursively. For each phase, the way the teams group depends on the structure. Wait, in each phase, the teams are grouped into pairs, each pair playing. The winners then form the next set of teams.\n\nWait, let's think about the grouping. For example, the first phase groups the teams as 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc. So in the first phase, the teams are paired sequentially.\n\nThen, the second phase groups the winners of the first phase's adjacent pairs. Like, the winner of 1v2 plays against the winner of 3v4, then the winner of 5v6 plays against 7v8, and so on.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the second phase's groupings are in blocks of four: each block contributes two games, which produce two winners. Then these are merged into larger blocks as we go up the phases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each phase k (starting from 0) has 2^{n - k} games, and the teams are arranged into groups of 2^k+1, or something like that. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the tournament as a series of rounds, each round determining certain groupings.\n\nAnother thought: the tournament structure can be viewed as a binary tree where each non-leaf node represents a match, and each leaf is a team. The value of each node determines which two children (teams or sub-matches) it combines.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think differently.\n\nIn each phase i (0-based?), the number of games is 2^{n-i}. Each game is between two teams that survived the previous phase. So the way the teams are paired depends on the phase.\n\nWait, perhaps the pairing is done in a way that the group size doubles each phase. Like, in phase 0, each game is between two consecutive teams. In phase 1, each game is between two groups of two consecutive teams, which won their respective phase 0 games. And so on.\n\nFor example, with n=3, total teams 8.\n\nPhase 0: 4 games:\n1v2, 3v4, 5v6, 7v8.\n\nPhase 1: 2 games:\nwinners of 1v2 vs winners of 3v4 → game A\nwinners of 5v6 vs winners of 7v8 → game B\n\nPhase 2: 1 game: winners of game A vs game B → champion.\n\nSo the structure is a binary tree of depth n.\n\nEach phase corresponds to a level in this binary tree. The leaves are at level 0 (phase 0), and the root is at level n.\n\nNow, for each match at a certain level, the outcome depends on whether the phase's rule is 0 or 1.\n\nWait, the phase's rule is s[i], where i is the phase index. But wait, for n=3, the string s is of length 3. So phase 0, 1, 2 correspond to s[0], s[1], s[2].\n\nWait, so phase i (from 0 to n-1) corresponds to s[i].\n\nYes, because for n=3, the phases are 0,1,2, and s is length 3.\n\nSo each phase i has 2^{n-i} games. So for phase i, the group size is 2^i, but wait, no—because each game reduces the number of participants by half.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each phase i, the group size is 2^{i+1}, meaning that each game is between two groups of 2^i teams.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think of the initial phase (i=0): each game is between two single teams, so group size is 2.\n\nPhase i=1: each game is between two groups of two teams each. So group size is 4.\n\nPhase i=2: each game is between two groups of four teams each. So group size is 8.\n\nWait, but the total number of teams is 8, so for phase i=2, there's only one game.\n\nSo for phase i, the group size is 2^{i+1}.\n\nBut how does this help us?\n\nI think the key is to model the tournament structure as a binary tree, where each node represents a match. Each match has two children, which are the two sub-matches that feed into it. For each match, based on its phase (i), the outcome depends on s[i].\n\nSo for each match in the tree, if s[i] is '0', then the lower-skilled team wins; otherwise, the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nWait, but the phase i is associated with the match's level. So each node in the tree is a match in a particular phase, and its outcome is determined by s[i].\n\nSo for example, in the initial phase (i=0), each match is a single game between two teams. The winner of that game proceeds to the next phase.\n\nIn the next phase (i=1), each match is between two winners of phase 0's matches. So the winner of that match proceeds to phase 2, and so on.\n\nSo each match in the tournament tree is associated with a phase i, and the outcome of that match depends on s[i].\n\nThus, the entire tournament can be modeled as a binary tree with n levels, each level corresponding to a phase.\n\nNow, the question is: for each node in the tree, what are the possible winners of that match, given the phase's rule and the possible winners of the child matches.\n\nThis sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where for each node, we track the possible skill values that can emerge as the winner of that node, considering the rules of the phase.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each node in the tree, we'll compute a set of possible skill values that can win that match.\n\nThe base case is the leaves (phase 0). For each leaf node (which represents a match between two teams), the possible winners are the two teams that play in that match.\n\nWait, but wait: the leaves are the initial phase 0 matches. So for each leaf, the possible winners are the two teams that participate in it.\n\nBut since the initial teams are all the 2^n teams, and their order is determined by the permutation p, the exact teams that meet in each phase depends on how the permutation is structured.\n\nHmm, this seems tricky. Because the permutation p determines which teams end up in which matches at each phase.\n\nSo perhaps for each node, we can represent the possible range of the winner's skill based on the phase's rule.\n\nWait, here's an alternative approach: for each match, the winner must be someone who can beat their opponent in that match. The outcome of the match is determined by the phase's rule.\n\nSo for a match in phase i, the outcome is:\n\n- If s[i] is '0', the winner is the lower-skilled of the two.\n- If s[i] is '1', the winner is the higher-skilled.\n\nSo, for each match, the winner's skill must be either higher or lower than the opponent, depending on s[i].\n\nThus, for each match, the possible winner can be expressed as a function of the possible opponents.\n\nBut how do we model the opponents, given that they come from sub-matches?\n\nAh, this is where recursion comes into play. For each match, the two participants are the winners of their respective sub-matches. So for a parent match in phase i, its two children are two matches in phase i-1.\n\nThus, the possible winners for the parent match depend on the possible winners of the two children matches.\n\nWait, yes! So for each match node, we can model the possible winners as a set of possible values, which are derived from the possible winners of its two children.\n\nSo, the approach would be to build the tournament tree, and for each node (match), compute the possible winners based on the phase's rule and the possible winners of the two child nodes.\n\nOnce we've processed all nodes, the root node will have the possible winners of the entire tournament. Those are the x's we need to collect.\n\nSo, how do we model this?\n\nWe can represent each match as a node, and for each node, keep a set of possible winner skills. We can process the nodes in a bottom-up manner, starting from the leaves and moving up to the root.\n\nEach node's possible winners are determined by the possible winners of its two children, and the phase rule.\n\nLet's formalize this:\n\n- For a leaf node (phase 0), the possible winners are the two teams that play in that match. So for each leaf, the possible winners are the two teams in that match. But since the permutation p is arbitrary, the exact teams are not known. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of tracking specific team numbers, we can track the possible minimum and maximum values that a winner can have, given the phase's rule.\n\nWait, perhaps for each match, the possible winner must lie within a certain interval. For example, if the phase is '0' (lower skill wins), then the winner is the smaller of the two. So the possible winner could be either of the two, but it's the smaller one. So the maximum possible winner in this case is the smaller of the two possible maxima from the children.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node, we can track the possible range of the winner's skill. For instance, for a node in phase i, the possible winner's skill is either the minimum or maximum of the two children, depending on s[i].\n\nWait, let's consider this:\n\nEach match in phase i has two children matches. Each child returns a set of possible winners. For the current match, the winner is determined by s[i].\n\nCase 1: s[i] is '0'. The winner is the lower-skilled of the two participants. So the winner must be less than or equal to both participants. Therefore, the maximum possible winner is the minimum of the two participants.\n\nBut wait, the participants are the winners of the two children. So the maximum possible winner in this case is the minimum of the maximum possible winners of the two children.\n\nWait, no. Because the two participants are the winners of their respective children. So the participants are two values, say a and b. The winner is min(a,b) if s[i] is '0'.\n\nBut since a and b can vary, the possible winner can be any min of two possible a and b.\n\nHmm, but to find the possible range of the winner for this match, perhaps we can model the minimal and maximal possible values.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. For a node in phase i:\n\nIf s[i] == '0':\n   The winner is the smaller of the two participants.\n   So the possible winner must be ≤ min(participant1, participant2).\n   So the maximum possible winner for this node is min(participant1_max, participant2_max).\n   Similarly, the minimal possible winner is min(participant1_min, participant2_min).\n\nWait, but participant1 and participant2 are themselves the winners of their own matches.\n\nWait, maybe the possible winners for the current node can be represented as the intersection of the possible winners of the two children, adjusted by the phase rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node, we can track the minimum and maximum possible winner. So for a node, we have low and high, which are the possible ranges for the winner.\n\nThis might be manageable.\n\nLet's try this approach.\n\nFor a leaf node (phase 0), the two participants are two consecutive teams. Since the permutation is arbitrary, the possible winners are any two distinct numbers from 1 to 2^n.\n\nWait, no. Because for the initial phase, each match is between two consecutive teams. So for the first match, it's 1 vs 2. The winner is either 1 or 2, depending on s[0].\n\nWait, no. Wait, phase 0 is the first phase. So for phase 0, the matches are between 1&2, 3&4, etc.\n\nSo for phase 0, each leaf node is a match between two consecutive odd and even teams.\n\nSo for a leaf node (phase 0), the possible winners are the two participants, but the permutation p can arrange them in any way.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the permutation p is fixed. So for example, if s[0] is '0', then in each phase 0 match, the lower-skilled team wins. So the winner is min of the two.\n\nBut since p is a permutation, the actual participants are determined by p.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe the key insight is that for each phase, the way the participants are grouped is fixed based on the structure of the tournament.\n\nWait, no. Because the permutation p determines the skill levels, but the tournament structure (which teams face whom in each phase) is determined by the structure of the tree.\n\nWait, perhaps the tournament structure is fixed regardless of p. Like, the way teams are paired in each phase is determined by their position in the initial list. So for example, in phase 0, it's 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc.\n\nYes, that's correct. Because the tournament structure is based on the initial ordering of the teams, which is determined by the permutation p. So each phase's pairings are fixed based on the initial 2^n teams ordered in a certain way.\n\nSo the structure of the tournament is a fixed binary tree, with leaves being the initial matches between consecutive teams. Each internal node represents a match between two winners of their respective sub-trees.\n\nTherefore, the structure of the tournament tree is fixed once the permutation p is chosen. So for a given p, the tournament structure is known, and the possible outcomes can be determined.\n\nBut our task is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the champion.\n\nHmm, but since the permutation is arbitrary, perhaps the structure of the tournament allows certain ranges for x based on the s string.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to model the possible minimum and maximum x that can be the champion, given the s string.\n\nEach node in the tournament tree has a phase, and based on that, the possible winner is determined.\n\nSo, for each node, we can compute the possible range of the winner's skill.\n\nThe idea is to represent for each node (match), the possible minimum and maximum values that the winner can have.\n\nFor a leaf node (phase 0), the possible winners are two consecutive numbers. For example, in phase 0, the first match is between team 1 and 2. So the possible winners are 1 and 2. Depending on s[0], the winner is either 1 or 2.\n\nWait, but s[0] is '0' or '1', which determines whether the lower or higher skill wins.\n\nSo for a leaf node, if s[i] is '0', the winner is the lower of the two, so the possible winner is min(1,2) = 1. But wait, the permutation p determines the actual teams, but the positions in the initial list are 1,2,... So phase 0 matches are between 2k-1 and 2k for k from 1 to 2^{n-1}.\n\nSo for phase 0, each match is between 2k-1 and 2k.\n\nThus, for each leaf node (phase 0), the possible winner is either 2k-1 or 2k, depending on s[0].\n\nWait, but s[0] determines the rule for phase 0.\n\nSo, for each leaf node (phase 0), the possible winner is either the left or right team, based on s[0].\n\nThus, for phase 0, each leaf node's possible winner is:\n\nif s[0] == '0': the winner is the lower-skilled, which is the left team (since 2k-1 < 2k).\n\nif s[0] == '1': the winner is the higher-skilled, which is the right team.\n\nSo for each leaf node, the possible winner is 2k-1 if s[0] is '1', else 2k.\n\nWait, no. Because when s[0] is '0', the winner is the lower-skilled, which is 2k-1.\n\nWhen s[0] is '1', the winner is the higher-skilled, which is 2k.\n\nSo each leaf node's possible winner is either 2k-1 or 2k, depending on s[0].\n\nBut wait, the permutation p is arbitrary, so the initial arrangement can be anything. Or is the permutation fixed as the initial list? No, the permutation p is given, but in our problem, we can choose p to make x the champion.\n\nSo, for the purpose of finding all possible x, we can arrange the permutation p such that x is the champion.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to model this is to, for each node in the tournament tree, determine the possible range of the winner's skill, given the phase's rule.\n\nSo, for a node in phase i, the two children are two matches in phase i-1. The winner of this node is determined by s[i]: if '0', it's the lower of the two children's winners; else, the higher.\n\nThus, for each node, we can compute the possible minimum and maximum values that the winner can have.\n\nLet's formalize this:\n\nFor each node, we'll store two values: min_possible and max_possible.\n\nInitially, for the leaves (phase 0):\n\nIf s[0] is '0', then the winner is min(a, b), where a and b are the two teams in the match. Since the two teams are consecutive (like 1 and 2), the winner is the lower one. So for the leaf node, the min is 2k-1, max is 2k-1 (since it's always the same in this case).\n\nWait, no. Because for a leaf node, the two teams are fixed as 2k-1 and 2k. So if s[0] is '0', the winner is 2k-1, so min and max are both 2k-1.\n\nIf s[0] is '1', the winner is 2k, so min and max are both 2k.\n\nWait, no. Because for a leaf node, the two possible winners are 2k-1 and 2k, but s[0] determines which one is the winner. So for a leaf node, the min and max are either 2k-1 or 2k, depending on s[0].\n\nWait, perhaps for a leaf node, the possible winner is either 2k-1 or 2k, but only one of them can be the winner based on s[0].\n\nNo, because the permutation p can arrange the initial teams in any way. So for phase 0, the initial match is between team 1 and 2. So regardless of p, the initial matches are between consecutive numbers.\n\nWait, no. Because p is a permutation of the skills. So the actual teams in the initial matches are determined by the permutation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think again.\n\nThe permutation p is a rearrangement of 1..2^n. The tournament structure is fixed: phase 0 matches are between 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc. So the initial phase is determined by the numbering of the teams, not their skill levels.\n\nWait, no. Oh! Wait, no. Because the permutation p assigns the skill levels to the teams. So team 1's skill is p[0], team 2 is p[1], etc.\n\nBut the tournament structure is fixed: phase 0 matches are between team 1 and 2, 3 and 4, etc. So the actual teams playing in each phase are fixed based on their initial numbering, not their skill.\n\nWait, no, because p is a permutation of the skill levels. So team 1's skill is p_1, team 2's is p_2, etc. So the actual teams in each phase are determined by their initial numbering, not their skill.\n\nSo the tournament structure is fixed: phase 0 matches are 1v2, 3v4, ..., 2^{n-1}-1 v 2^{n-1}.\n\nThen, phase 1 matches are between the winners of 1v2 and 3v4, then 5v6 and 7v8, etc.\n\nSo, the way the teams are paired in each phase is based on their initial numbering, not their skill levels.\n\nBut the permutation p determines their skill levels. So, for each phase, the teams that are playing are determined by the initial numbering, but their skill levels are determined by p.\n\nThus, the tournament structure is fixed, but the teams' skills are assigned via permutation p.\n\nSo, the problem is: given the tournament structure (fixed based on phase pairings), and for each phase, a rule (s[i]) indicating whether the lower or higher skill team wins, can x be the champion for some permutation p.\n\nSo, the approach is to model the tournament structure as a binary tree, where each node represents a match in a phase, and each match has two children (sub-matches) that feed into it.\n\nFor each match node, we need to compute the possible skill values of the winner, given the phase's rule and the possible winners of the children.\n\nSo, for each match, we can represent the possible winner's skill as a range [min, max], which can be derived from the children's ranges.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\n1. Build the tournament tree as a binary heap. Each node represents a match in a phase, and has two children representing the sub-matches that feed into it.\n\n2. For each node, starting from the leaves and moving up to the root, compute the possible [min, max] of the winner's skill.\n\n3. For the root node, collect all x that lie within [min, max], considering all possible permutations p that allow x to be the champion.\n\nWait, but how do the children's ranges affect the parent's range?\n\nLet's think about a node in phase i with two children, left_child and right_child.\n\nThe phase's rule is s[i].\n\nIf s[i] is '0', the winner is the lower-skilled of the two participants. So the winner must be <= min(left_winner, right_winner).\n\nThus, the max possible winner for this node is min(left_max, right_max).\n\nSimilarly, the min possible winner is the min of the two participants, which would be the min of left_min and right_min.\n\nWait, no. Because if s[i] is '0', the winner is the lower of the two, so the maximum possible winner is min(left_max, right_max), and the minimum possible winner is min(left_min, right_min).\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Because the participants are the winners of the left and right children. The left_child's possible winners are [left_min, left_max], and similarly for the right_child.\n\nSo, when s[i] is '0', the winner is the lower of the two, so it's the minimum of the two participants.\n\nThus, the maximum possible winner for this node is the minimum of the left and right possible winners.\n\nWait, no. Because the two participants can vary. So for example, if the left_child can have a winner ranging from a to b, and the right_child can have a winner ranging from c to d, then the possible participants are any pair (x, y) where x is in [a,b], y is in [c,d].\n\nThe winner when s[i] is '0' is min(x, y). So the possible min and max of this node are min_x_y and max_x_y.\n\nBut min_x_y is the minimum of all possible min(x,y), which would be min(a,c) (if a < c, else c if a > c and s[i]=0).\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node, the possible winner must satisfy certain constraints based on the phase rule and the children's ranges.\n\nLet me think of each node as having a range [low, high], which is the possible range of the winner's skill.\n\nFor a node in phase i, the two children are left and right.\n\nIf phase i is '0', then the winner is the smaller of the two children's winners.\n\nSo, the possible winner must be ≤ min(left_winner, right_winner).\n\nThus, the maximum possible winner is min(left_high, right_high).\n\nBut what about the minimum? It can be as low as the minimum of the left's low and right's low.\n\nWait, perhaps the new node's [low, high] is:\n\nlow = min(left_low, right_low)\nhigh = min(left_high, right_high)\n\nBecause the winner must be the smaller of the two, so the maximum possible is the smaller of the two maximums, and the minimum possible is the smaller of the two minimums.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nLet's test this with an example.\n\nSuppose left has [2,5], right has [3,6].\n\nPhase is '0', so the winner is min of the two.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\nleft's winner can be 2,3,4,5.\n\nright's winner can be 3,4,5,6.\n\nThe min of each pair is:\n\n2,3,3,4 → min is 2, but wait, no. For each possible pair (x,y), the min is considered. The overall possible min of the node is the minimum of all possible min(x,y), which would be 2 (when x=2, y=3), but also 3 when x=3, y=3, etc.\n\nWait, no. For the node, the possible winners are all the possible min(x,y) where x is in left's [2,5], y is in right's [3,6].\n\nSo the possible winners are:\n\nmin(2,3)=2,\n\nmin(2,4)=2,\n\nmin(2,5)=2,\n\nmin(2,6)=2,\n\nmin(3,3)=3,\n\nmin(3,4)=3,\n\n... up to min(5,6)=5.\n\nSo the possible winners are 2,3,4,5.\n\nSo the node's [low, high] is [2,5].\n\nWhich matches the calculation above.\n\nSo, for phase '0', the node's [low, high] is [min(left_low, right_low), min(left_high, right_high)].\n\nSimilarly, for phase '1' (s[i] is '1'), the winner is the higher of the two.\n\nSo the possible winners are all the possible max(x,y) where x is in left's [a,b], y is in right's [c,d].\n\nThe maximum possible winner is max(b,d).\n\nThe minimum possible winner is max(a,c).\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nLeft: [2,5], right: [3,6].\n\nPhase is '1', so winner is max(x,y).\n\nPossible maxes:\n\nmax(2,3)=3,\n\nmax(2,4)=4,\n\nmax(2,5)=5,\n\nmax(2,6)=6,\n\nmax(3,3)=3,\n\nmax(3,4)=4,\n\n... up to max(5,6)=6.\n\nSo the possible winners are 3,4,5,6.\n\nThus, the node's [low, high] is [3,6].\n\nWhich is [max(left_low, right_low), max(left_high, right_high)].\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the algorithm is as follows:\n\n- For each node in the tournament tree, compute its [low, high] based on its children and the phase's rule.\n\n- Start processing the nodes from the leaves (phase 0) and move up to the root.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute the tournament tree structure. Each node has two children, except the leaves.\n\n2. For each node, starting from the leaves, compute the [low, high] based on the children and phase rule.\n\n3. Once the root node's [low, high] is computed, all x in [low, high] are possible winning integers.\n\nBut wait, is that sufficient?\n\nBecause, for the root node, the possible winners are all x in [low, high], but the permutation p must be arranged such that x can indeed reach the top through the tree.\n\nBut according to the way we model the [low, high], any x in [low, high] is possible.\n\nWait, but how do we know that for every x in [low, high], there exists a permutation p that allows x to be the champion?\n\nBecause the [low, high] is built by considering all possible ways the children can contribute, based on the phase rules.\n\nThus, the [low, high] for the root node gives the range of possible x's.\n\nSo, the solution is to compute the root's [low, high] and output all x in that range.\n\nWait, but in the example provided:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3\n\n101\n\nSample Output:\n\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nWait, wait, the sample input is actually:\n\nFirst line is 3, then a string '101'.\n\nWait, n is 3, so 8 teams.\n\ns is \"101\".\n\nSo for phase 0: s[0] is '1' → higher skill wins.\n\nPhase 1: s[1] is '0' → lower skill wins.\n\nPhase 2: s[2] is '1' → higher skill wins.\n\nSo, the root node is phase 2.\n\nLet's compute the [low, high] for each node.\n\nStarting from phase 0.\n\nPhase 0: s[0] is '1', so for each leaf node, the winner is the higher of the two in the match.\n\nSo, for each of the four leaf nodes in phase 0:\n\nLeaf node 0: 1 vs 2 → winner is 2.\n\nLeaf node 1: 3 vs 4 → winner is 4.\n\nLeaf node 2: 5 vs 6 → winner is 6.\n\nLeaf node 3: 7 vs 8 → winner is 8.\n\nSo each phase 0 node's [low, high] is [2,2], [4,4], [6,6], [8,8].\n\nMoving to phase 1: s[1] is '0' → each match in phase 1 is between two phase 0 winners.\n\nPhase 1 has two nodes: node A (children 0 and 1), node B (children 2 and 3).\n\nFor node A:\n\ns[i] is '0', so winner is the lower of the two phase 0 winners.\n\nThe phase 0 winners are 2 and 4. So the lower is 2.\n\nSo node A's [low, high] is [2,2].\n\nSimilarly, node B's phase 0 winners are 6 and 8. Lower is 6.\n\nSo node B's [low, high] is [6,6].\n\nNow, phase 2: s[2] is '1' → higher of the two phase 1 winners.\n\nThe two phase 1 winners are 2 (node A) and 6 (node B).\n\nHigher is 6.\n\nSo the root node's [low, high] is [6,6].\n\nWait, but the sample output includes 4,5,6,7 as possible x's.\n\nHmm, that suggests that my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the tournament tree is built.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the phase indices.\n\nWait, the sample input is '101', which is of length 3.\n\nSo for n=3, the phases are 0,1,2.\n\nEach phase corresponds to the level in the tournament tree.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the children are grouped is different.\n\nWait, perhaps in phase i, the matches are grouped into blocks of size 2^{i+1}.\n\nFor example, phase 0: each match is between two consecutive teams.\n\nPhase 1: each match is between two groups of two teams each.\n\nPhase 2: each match is between two groups of four teams each.\n\nWait, perhaps the phase i's matches are between two groups of 2^i teams.\n\nSo for phase i, each match is between two groups of size 2^i, and the winner of each group proceeds to the next phase.\n\nThus, for n=3:\n\nPhase 0: 4 matches (each between two teams).\n\nPhase 1: 2 matches (each between two groups of two teams).\n\nPhase 2: 1 match (between two groups of four teams).\n\nWait, but earlier reasoning suggested that phase 0 has 4 matches for n=3.\n\nBut the initial phase for n=3 is 2^(3-1) =4 matches.\n\nYes.\n\nSo perhaps for phase i, the number of matches is 2^{n - i}.\n\nSo phase 0: 4 matches (n=3, i=0 → 2^3 =8 → phase 0 has 8/2=4 matches).\n\nPhase 1: 2 matches (8/4=2).\n\nPhase 2: 1 match (8/8=1).\n\nThus, the tree is built such that each match in phase i is composed of two sub-matches from phase i+1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for phase i, each match is a group of 2^{i+1} teams, which is split into two groups of 2^i each, each group playing a sub-match in phase i+1.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, each match in phase i is a grouping of two sub-matches from phase i-1.\n\nNo, perhaps the other way around: each match in phase i+1 is formed by merging two matches from phase i.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the tree as a complete binary tree with height n.\n\nEach node at level i (0-based) corresponds to a phase i, and has 2^{n-i} matches.\n\nThus, for n=3, the tree has 3 levels:\n\nLevel 0 (phase 0): 4 matches.\n\nLevel 1 (phase 1): 2 matches.\n\nLevel 2 (phase 2): 1 match.\n\nEach match at level i is formed by combining two matches from level i+1.\n\nWait, no. Because phase i has 2^{n-i} matches, which is twice the number of matches in phase i+1.\n\nSo for example, phase 0 has 4 matches (n=3), phase 1 has 2, phase 2 has 1.\n\nThus, each match in phase i is formed by combining two matches from phase i+1.\n\nSo, for the root (phase 2), it's formed by combining the two phase 1 matches.\n\nEach phase 1 match is formed by combining two phase 0 matches.\n\nThus, the structure is:\n\nRoot (phase 2) → two children (phase 1 matches).\n\nEach phase 1 match → two children (phase 0 matches).\n\nEach phase 0 match → no children (leaves).\n\nSo, for the sample input, let's recompute.\n\ns = '101' → phase 0: '1', phase 1: '0', phase 2: '1'.\n\nPhase 0:\n\nEach match is between two consecutive teams.\n\nPhase 0 has four matches:\n\nMatch 0: 1v2 → s[0]='1' → higher wins. So winner is 2.\n\nMatch 1: 3v4 → s[0]='1' → winner is 4.\n\nMatch 2:5v6 → s[0]='1' → winner is6.\n\nMatch3:7v8 → s[0]='1' → winner is8.\n\nThus, phase 0 matches' possible winners are 2,4,6,8.\n\nPhase 1: each match is between two phase 0 matches' winners.\n\nThere are two matches in phase 1.\n\nMatch A: combines the first two phase 0 winners (2 and4). s[1] is '0' → lower wins.\n\nSo the winner is 2.\n\nMatch B: combines the last two phase 0 winners (6 and8). s[1] is '0' → lower wins. So winner is6.\n\nThus, phase 1 matches' possible winners are 2 and6.\n\nPhase 2: combines the two phase 1 winners (2 and6). s[2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all possible integers that can be the champion of a tournament given specific rules for each phase. The tournament structure is a binary tree where each node represents a match, and the outcome of each match depends on whether the lower or higher skill team wins.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured as a binary tree with `n` levels. Each level corresponds to a phase in the tournament, where each match in the current phase is between the winners of two sub-matches from the previous phase.\n2. **Phase Rules**: For each phase `i`, the result of each match is determined by the character at position `i` in the string `s`. If `s[i]` is '0', the lower-skilled team wins; if '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n3. **Dynamic Programming on Tree**: We use dynamic programming to compute the possible range of winner skills for each match. Each node in the tree will store the minimum and maximum possible skill values of the winner for that match.\n4. **Bottom-Up Processing**: Starting from the leaves (phase 0 matches), we process each node up to the root, updating the possible winner ranges based on the phase rules and the children's ranges.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Build the tournament tree\n    # Each node is represented as a tuple (low, high)\n    # Nodes are stored in a list where index represents the node's position in a flattened tree\n    # For a tree with height n, the total nodes are 2^n - 1\n    # We'll process nodes in reverse order, from leaves to root\n    size = 1 << n  # 2^n\n    tree = [None] * (size * 2)  # Placeholder for easier indexing, but not used directly\n    \n    # Create a list of nodes, each node has its phase, left and right children indices\n    # Nodes are numbered in a way that the first node is the root, then left and right children, etc.\n    # So for a tree of height n, the root is at 1, left child at 2, right at 3, and so on.\n    nodes = []\n    for i in range(size):\n        # For each match in the tournament, calculate its phase\n        phase = n - i\n        # Wait, perhaps this approach is incorrect.
