    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Golden Plate,\" and from the description, I need to calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding k rings of gilding.\n\nHmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully. Oh right, each ring is formed by the perimeter of a rectangle that's progressively smaller. The first ring is along the edge, then the next is two cells in, and so on. Each ring is one cell thick.\n\nSo the input gives me w (width), h (height), and k (number of rings). My task is to compute the total number of gilded cells.\n\nLet me think about how to model each ring. For each i-th ring (starting from 1 to k), the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)). Because each ring reduces both width and height by 4 each time? Wait, no—wait, because each ring is two cells away from the previous, which would subtract 2 from each side, so 4 in total for both left and right, and top and bottom. So yeah, each step reduces the size by 4 in each dimension.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify: for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). So for i=1, it's w x h, which is the outermost ring. For i=2, it's (w-4) x (h-4), which is two cells inside on each side. That makes sense.\n\nNow, for each such rectangle, the number of cells in the ring is the perimeter minus the four corners since they'd be counted twice if we just multiply 2*(w + h) but that includes the four corners twice. Or wait, no—the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(w + h - 2), because each side has (length - 1) * 2 (top and bottom) plus the other sides. Wait, maybe I should calculate it differently.\n\nLet me think: for a rectangle of a x b cells, the number of cells around the perimeter is 2*(a + b - 2). Because for the top row, there are a cells, the bottom row also a, and the left and right columns (excluding the top and bottom) have (b-2) each. So total is 2a + 2(b-2) = 2a + 2b -4, which is 2*(a + b) -4. Alternatively, 2*(a + b) - 4 = 2*(a + b - 2).\n\nSo for each ring i, the number of cells is 2*( (w_i) + (h_i) - 2 ), where w_i = w -4*(i-1), h_i = h -4*(i-1). But wait, when does this stop being possible? Because for each subsequent ring, the size must be at least 3x3, otherwise, we can't form a ring.\n\nBut according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's valid. So I don't have to worry about invalid cases.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each ring from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute current w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute current h_i = h -4*(i-1)\n   c. Compute the perimeter cells as 2*(w_i + h_i - 2)\n   d. Sum all these perimeters for each ring.\n\nSo the total is the sum of 2*(w_i + h_i - 2) for i from 1 to k.\n\nLet me test this with the examples provided.\n\nFirst example:\nInput: 3 3 1\nSo w=3, h=3, k=1.\nRing 1: 3x3, perimeter is 2*(3+3-2)=2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example:\n7 9 1\nRing 1: 7x9, perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the second output.\n\nThird example:\n7 9 2\nRing 1:7x9 → 28\nRing 2:7-4=3, 9-4=5 → 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2)=2*6=12. So total is 28+12=40. Which matches the third output.\n\nGreat, so the formula seems correct.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\n- Read w, h, k from input.\n- For each i from 1 to k:\n   compute w_i = w -",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding k rings of gilding. Each ring is formed by the perimeter of an increasingly smaller rectangle inside the plate.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is formed by the perimeter of a rectangle that is progressively smaller. The first ring is along the edge of the plate, and each subsequent ring is two cells inward from the previous one.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells is calculated as the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` is `2 * (w + h - 2)`.\n3. **Iterative Summation**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the corresponding rectangle and sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k` which represent the width, height, and number of rings respectively.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the dimensions of the rectangle for that ring. The width and height decrease by 4 for each subsequent ring because each ring is two cells inward on all sides.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each ring, calculate the perimeter using the formula `2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)` and add this value to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total count of gilded cells after processing all rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal for the given constraints.",
