The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Rudolf and Snowflakes, hard version. Hmm. From the description, it says that a snowflake is an undirected graph constructed in a specific way. \n\nLet me try to understand the structure of a snowflake. The initial step is one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to it, where k must be greater than 1. So after this first step, we have 1 + k vertices. Then, for each vertex that has only one edge (the leaves), we connect them to k new vertices. And importantly, this step must be done at least once.\n\nSo the snowflake grows in layers. The first layer is the center with degree k. Each subsequent layer adds another level, with each node in the previous layer branching into k children.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each vertex that is connected by only one edge (so the leaves) must connect to k new vertices. But this step must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake will have at least two steps beyond the initial.\n\nFor example, when k=4, the smallest possible snowflake has 1 (center) + 4 (first layer) + 4*4 (second layer) = 1+4+16=21? Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the initial vertex is connected to k new vertices—so that's the first step. So the total nodes after step 1 are 1 + k = 1 +4 =5. Then, each of those k nodes must add k new vertices. So each of the 4 nodes adds 4 more, making 4*4=16. So total nodes now would be 1 +4 +16=21. So yes, that's the minimal case.\n\nBut the problem says that the process should be done at least once. So the initial step is adding the first layer, and then at least one more step.\n\nSo the structure is a tree where the root has k children, each of which has k children, and so on for m levels, but wait, no—the process is that each leaf (node with degree 1) must branch out at least once. So the minimal structure is the root, plus one layer, plus another layer.\n\nWait, no: because after the initial step, the root has k children. Those children are leaves. So in the next step, each of them must add k children. So the minimal snowflake is three layers: center, layer 1, layer 2. So the number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. For k=4, that's 1+4+16=21.\n\nSo the snowflake's total number of nodes is 1 + k*(1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{m-1}), but wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the initial step is step 0: one node.\n\nStep 1: add k nodes connected to it. Total nodes: 1 +k.\n\nStep 2: each of the k nodes adds k children. So add k^2 nodes. Now total is 1 +k +k².\n\nStep 3: each of the k² nodes adds k children. So add k^3. Now total is 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nAnd so on. But the process can stop at any step after step 1. Wait no: the problem says that the step of adding to the leaves must be done at least once. So the minimal structure is the initial step (step 1) and then step 2. So the minimal total is 1 +k +k².\n\nWait no: the initial step is the first step, where the center is connected to k nodes. Then, the step of adding to the leaves is done at least once. So the initial step is step 1, and then step 2 must be done. So the minimal structure has 1 +k +k² nodes.\n\nSo for each k>1, the possible numbers of nodes n are of the form:\n\nn = 1 + k*(s), where s is a sum of some powers of k.\n\nWait, let's model it.\n\nThe snowflake is built as follows:\n\n- The center node is added.\n- Then, in the first expansion, each existing leaf (only the center is a leaf) is expanded by adding k children. This is the first expansion. So after this, the structure is 1 (center) +k (children) = 1 +k nodes.\n- Then, in the second expansion, each leaf (all the k children) is expanded by adding k children each. So now, each of the k nodes adds k, leading to k^2 new nodes. Total becomes 1 +k +k².\n- In the third expansion",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with exactly `n` vertices can exist. A snowflake graph is defined as an undirected graph that grows in layers starting from a single central vertex and expanding outward in a specific manner.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph starts with one central vertex. Each leaf node (a node with only one edge) must expand into `k` new nodes, where `k > 1`. This expansion must occur at least once beyond the initial setup.\n2. **Formulating the Problem**: The total number of vertices `n` in a valid snowflake graph can be expressed as `n = 1 + k * (1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m)`, where `m` is the number of expansions beyond the initial setup. This simplifies to `n = 1 + k*(k^m - 1)/(k - 1)` because the sum of a geometric series is used here.\n3. **Checking Validity**: For each test case, we check if there exists an integer `k > 1` such that `n` can be represented in the form derived above. This involves iterating over possible values of `k` and checking if the corresponding geometric series sum fits `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 3:\n        return False\n    # We need to find k>1 and m>=1 such that n = 1 + k*(k^m -1)/(k-1)\n    # Let's try possible k values up to cube root of n or so\n    max_k = int((n-1)**(1/3)) + 2\n    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        s = 0\n        current = 1\n        while True:\n            s += current\n            if s > n -1:\n                break\n            current *= k\n        if s == n -1:\n            return True\n    return False\n\nt = int(sys.stdin.readline())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    if is_snowflake(n):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple test cases from standard input.\n2. **Checking Each Case**: For each test case, it checks if the given number of vertices `n` can form a valid snowflake graph by iterating through possible values of `k`.\n3. **Geometric Series Check**: For each `k`, it calculates the sum of the geometric series to see if it matches `n-1`, which is derived from the structure of the snowflake graph.\n4. **Output Result**: Based on the check, it prints \"YES\" if a valid snowflake graph can be formed, otherwise \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible values of `k` up to a reasonable limit, ensuring that even very large values of `n` are handled within feasible computation time.",
