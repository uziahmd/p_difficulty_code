Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about determining the direction of each edge in a flow network such that the resulting directed graph satisfies certain conditions. Hmm.\n\nAlright, the problem says that for each vertex v (not the source or sink), the sum of incoming edges' flows equals the sum of outgoing edges' flows. Also, the source (vertex 1) shouldn't have any incoming edges, and the graph must be a DAG (no cycles). Oh right, because if there's a cycle, you can't have a maximum flow that's feasible.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Well, I remember that in a flow network, especially when considering the residual graph, the flow conservation at each node except the source and sink is already enforced. But here, we need to assign directions to each undirected edge so that these conditions hold.\n\nWait, but the given graph is undirected, meaning each edge is bidirectional in the input. So for each edge, I have to decide whether it's going from ai to bi or vice versa. And the way I assign the directions must satisfy the constraints mentioned.\n\nHmm, maybe I can model this as a directed graph where for each original undirected edge, one direction is chosen. Then, the sum of flows into each non-source/non-sink node must equal the sum out.\n\nLet me think about the approach. One idea is to build the directed graph step by step, ensuring that all flow conservation is respected.\n\nAnother thought: the flow through each edge contributes to the balance of the nodes it connects. For example, if an edge is directed from a to b, then adding ci to a's outgoing and b's incoming. So, for each node except 1 and n, the total outgoing flow should equal the incoming.\n\nWait, but how do I determine the direction for each edge? Maybe we can model this as a system of equations. But that might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use BFS or DFS to assign directions in a way that ensures the flow conservation.\n\nWait, another approach: the problem is similar to finding a DAG orientation of the graph such that the flow conservation holds. Since the solution exists, perhaps we can greedily assign the direction for each edge in a way that doesn't create cycles and satisfies the constraints.\n\nWait, but how? Because each edge's direction affects two nodes' balances.\n\nMaybe I can compute for each node v (excluding 1 and n) the net flow that must come into it. Wait, but in the problem statement, the sum of incoming edges' flows equals the sum of outgoing edges' flows. That means for each node v (1 < v <n), the sum of ci for edges entering v equals the sum for edges leaving v.\n\nBut since the initial graph is connected and the solution exists, I can compute the required flow in each edge based on some criteria.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this using the concept of potential functions. Like, for each node, assign a potential, and direct edges from lower potential to higher. But I'm not sure if that directly applies here.\n\nWait, another angle: the problem requires that the directed graph is a DAG. So, the assignment of directions must form a topological order. How can I find such an order?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartitioning problem where edges are directed in a way that the graph is a DAG, and for each node, the sum of incoming and outgoing flows match.\n\nBut I'm not seeing the exact steps yet.\n\nWait, let's think about the flow. Each edge has a certain capacity, and the maximum flow is achieved when the sum of flows in the graph is as large as possible. But the problem is more about directing the edges correctly rather than computing the max flow.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the given graph is connected and the solution exists. So, perhaps the way to assign directions is to find a way to make the directed graph satisfy the flow conservation for all nodes except 1 and n, which is the source and sink.\n\nHmm, I think I can model this by considering the flow as a function of the edges' directions. For each edge (u, v), choosing to direct it as u→v will add c to u's outgoing and v's incoming. Similarly, if it's directed v→u, then it adds c to v's outgoing and u's incoming.\n\nThe goal is to assign directions such that for each node v (2 <= v <= n-1), the sum of outgoing c's equals the sum of incoming c's. Also, node 1 has no incoming edges, and the graph is a DAG.\n\nWait, but node n is the sink, so it shouldn't have any outgoing edges.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. Assign the direction of each edge in such a way that the resulting directed graph is a DAG, and for each node, the flow conservation is satisfied.\n\nBut how to achieve",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the direction of each edge in an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies specific flow conservation conditions. The goal is to ensure that for each vertex (except the source and sink), the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows, and the graph remains a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the given undirected graph using adjacency lists where each node keeps track of its connected edges along with their flow values.\n2. **Topological Sorting**: Use Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting to determine the order of nodes such that all edges can be directed without forming cycles.\n3. **Direction Assignment**: For each node in the topological order, assign directions to its edges based on the flow values.
