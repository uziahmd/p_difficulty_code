The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, Xenia is in a city with houses arranged in a ring, right? She needs to do some tasks, and each task requires her to be at a specific house. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks.\n\nWait, the problem says that each task i must be done after all tasks j where j < i. Oh, right, because the list is given in order. So for each task ai, she must reach it after completing all previous ones.\n\nHmm, how do we model this? Well, since the ring is one-way and clockwise, moving from a house to the next takes one unit of time. So, the movement is only forward around the ring.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Maybe we can process each task in order and keep track of the current position. For each ai, we need to calculate the distance from the current position to ai, considering the ring structure.\n\nBut wait, the ring is circular, so the distance could be either clockwise or counter-clockwise. But since traffic is only clockwise, she can't move backward. So, the path is always in one direction. So, the distance from a to b is (b - a) mod n if b >= a, but wait, no. Wait, because the ring is circular, the minimal distance from a to b is min( (b -a) % n, (a - b) % n ). Wait, no, because she can't go backward. So, for example, if she's at house 1, and needs to get to 4, she goes 1 → 2 →3 →4, which is 3 steps. So the distance is (4-1) = 3. But if she's at 4 and needs to get to 2, she can't go back to 1, then 2. So she has to go 4 →1 →2, which is two steps. So the distance is (n - (4-2)) + (2-1) ? Wait, maybe I'm complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, for any two points a and b on a ring, the minimal clockwise distance is (b - a) if a <= b, else (b - a + n) % n. Or more accurately, when a <= b, the distance is b - a. When a > b, the distance is (b + n - a). Because moving clockwise, you have to go from a to n, then 1 to b.\n\nSo, for each step, the required distance is the minimal number of steps from the current position to the next task's position, considering the ring's circular nature.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Sort the tasks in the order they are given (since the first task is 1, then others follow in order).\n- Start at position 1.\n- For each task in the list, compute the distance from the current position to the task's position, and add it to the total time.\n- Update the current position to the task's position.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's think about the example given. In the first sample input, the sequence is 3, 2, 3.\n\nWait, the initial position is 1. First task is 3: distance is 2 steps (1→2→3). Time += 2. Current position is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2: now, how do we get from 3 to 2? Since the ring is 4 houses in total. So from 3, moving clockwise, the next is 4, then 1, then 2. So the distance is 3 steps (3→4 is 1, 4→1 is 2, 1→2 is 3). So time becomes 2+3=5.\n\nThird task is 3: already there, so nothing added. Total time 5? Wait, but the sample output is 6.\n\nOh, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the note. Oh, the sample says the sequence is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. So the steps are 6. How does that happen?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nAfter the first task, she's at 3. Then she needs to do the second task at 2. So from 3, she has to go 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps. So time is 2+3=5. Then third task is 3 again. So from 2, she goes 2→3, which is 1 step. Total 5+1=6. Oh right, so I forgot that after each task, she may have to move again for the next task.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the process as follows:\n\nShe starts at 1.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks given that she starts at house number 1 and can only move clockwise around a ring of houses.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Ring Structure**: The houses are arranged in a ring, meaning moving from the last house to the first requires going through each house in between. This circular nature affects the distance calculation.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For any two houses `a` and `b`, the clockwise distance from `a` to `b` is `(b - a) % n` if `a <= b`. If `a > b`, the distance is `(b + n - a)`.\n3. **Task Processing**: Process each task in the order they are given. For each task, calculate the distance from the current position to the task's house and update the total time and current position accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent_pos = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor ai in tasks:\n    if ai == current_pos:\n        continue  # No movement needed\n    # Calculate the minimal steps clockwise\n    if ai > current_pos:\n        steps = ai - current_pos\n    else:\n        steps = (ai + n - current_pos)\n    total_time += steps\n    current_pos = ai\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with a total time of 0.\n2. **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each task, determine the required movement from the current position to the task's house.\n3. **Update Time and Position**: Add the calculated steps to the total time and update the current position to the task's house.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, print the total time.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time by leveraging the circular nature of the ring and processing each task in the given order.",
