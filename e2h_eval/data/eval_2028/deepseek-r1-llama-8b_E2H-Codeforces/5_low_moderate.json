Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Colored Boots.\" Hmm.\n\nSo, the setup is that there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color represented by a lowercase letter or a question mark. We need to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of one left and one right boot, and their colors are compatible.\n\nWhat counts as compatible? Two specific colors are compatible if they're the same. An indefinite (question mark) is compatible with any color. So, for example, a left boot with color 'a' can pair with a right boot that's 'a' or '?'. Similarly, a '?' left can pair with anything.\n\nThe output should be the maximum number of such pairs and then list each pair's indices.\n\nHmm. So, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about the constraints. The n can be up to 150,000, which is pretty big. So any O(n^2) approach is definitely out of the question. We need something efficient, like O(n) or O(n log n).\n\nLet me consider the problem in terms of counting compatible pairs for each possible left-right combination.\n\nEach left boot i can pair with some right boots j. But we can't pair a boot more than once. So it's about matching lefts to rights optimally.\n\nWait, but considering that each left can be matched to multiple rights, but each right can only be matched once. So this sounds like a bipartite matching problem where each left is connected to all rights it's compatible with, and we need a maximum matching.\n\nBut with n up to 150,000, even using standard bipartite matching algorithms like the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm might be too slow. Hopcroft-Karp is O(E√V), but E could be up to n^2, which is way too big.\n\nSo that approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For each left boot, determine which right boots it can pair with, and then assign as many as possible without overlapping.\n\nBut again, how to manage that efficiently.\n\nAnother angle: Since the question marks are compatible with everything, perhaps we can pre-process the left and right arrays, count how many lefts are fixed to each character, and how many rights are fixed to each character. Then, handle the question marks separately.\n\nWait, but the question marks can be on either side. Maybe the problem can be broken down into two cases:\n\n1. Pairs where both have a specific color (not ?). These must match exactly.\n2. Pairs where one or both have a ?. These can be matched with any other color.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize the total pairs, so we need to find an optimal way to combine these.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a bipartition where for each specific color c, we can pair as many left c's with right c's as possible. Then, use the remaining lefts and rights (including those that couldn't pair due to specific colors) to form pairs with the question marks.\n\nHmm, maybe that's manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps I can take:\n\n1. Count the frequency of each specific color in left and right boots. For example, count how many 'a's are in left, 'b's in right, etc.\n\n2. For each color c, the minimum of left_count[c] and right_count[c] is the number of pairs we can make from specific matches. Summing this over all c gives the base number of pairs.\n\n3. Then, the remaining lefts and rights (those that couldn't be matched in step 2) can be considered as available for pairing with question marks.\n\n4. Now, the question is, how to pair the remaining lefts and rights with the question marks in such a way that the total pairs are maximized.\n\nWait, but the question marks can also pair among themselves. So, perhaps the total number of pairs is equal to:\n\nsum_over_c min(left[c], right[c]) + sum of the maximum possible between the remaining lefts and rights and question marks.\n\nWait, not exactly. Because after step 2, the remaining lefts and rights can be:\n\n- Lefts that have specific colors but no corresponding right of the same color.\n- Rights that have specific colors but no corresponding left of the same color.\n- Plus, any lefts that are '?' and any rights that are '?'.\n\nSo, after step 2, the remaining lefts and rights (including '?') can be used to form additional pairs.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, after step 2, for the specific colors, the remaining lefts would be (left_count[c] - min(left[c], right[c])) for each c, but summed across all c.\n\nSimilarly, the remaining rights would be (right_count[c] - min(left[c], right[c])) for each c, summed.\n\nPlus, the number of lefts that",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. Each boot can be part of at most one pair. Compatibility is defined such that two specific colors must match exactly, while an indefinite color (denoted by '?') can pair with any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Specific Colors**: First, count the frequency of each specific color (a-z) in both left and right boot strings.\n2. **Form Specific Pairs**: For each color, form as many pairs as possible between left and right boots of that specific color.\n3. **Handle Indefinite Colors**: After forming specific pairs, handle the remaining left and right boots, including those with indefinite colors.
