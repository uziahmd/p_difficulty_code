Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Colored Boots.\" Hmm.\n\nSo, the setup is that there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color represented by a lowercase letter or a question mark. We need to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of one left and one right boot, and their colors are compatible.\n\nWhat counts as compatible? Two specific colors are compatible only if they're exactly the same. A question mark is compatible with any color, including another question mark. So, for example, '?' can pair with 'a', 'b', or '?'. But 'a' can't pair with 'b'.\n\nThe goal is to compute the maximum number of such pairs, and also output the pairs themselves. Oh right, each boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\nHmm, the constraints are tight since n can be up to 150,000. So any O(n^2) approach is definitely out of the question. We need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n) or O(n log n).\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's consider each left boot and each right boot. For each possible pair (l_i, r_j), we can check if they are compatible. But checking all possible pairs is way too slow—n is 150k, so n^2 is 22.5e9 operations. That's impossible.\n\nSo, we need a smarter way.\n\nMaybe we can categorize the left and right boots into different groups based on their colors, and then count how many compatible pairs exist between these groups.\n\nBut wait, because the question marks are wildcards, any left boot with a question mark can pair with any right boot, regardless of its color. Similarly, a right boot with a question mark can pair with any left boot.\n\nThis suggests that the problem can be split into two parts:\n\n1. Pairs where both boots have specific colors.\n2. Pairs involving at least one question mark.\n\nWait, but handling the question marks is tricky because they can pair with anything. So perhaps we should first count all possible pairs that don't involve question marks, and then handle the question mark cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model it in terms of frequencies of each color and the number of question marks on each side.\n\nLet's break down the problem.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- L: the list of left boot colors.\n- R: the list of right boot colors.\n\nWe can count for each specific color c, how many left boots have c (call it cnt_l[c]), and similarly cnt_r[c] for right boots.\n\nThen, the number of pairs for specific colors would be the sum over all c of min(cnt_l[c], cnt_r[c]).\n\nAdditionally, we have the question marks. Let's say:\n\n- q_left: number of left boots with color '?'\n- q_right: number of right boots with color '?'\n\nThese can form pairs with any other boot, but also with each other. Wait, no—wait, a left with '?' can pair with any right (including those with '?'), and a right with '?' can pair with any left (including those with '?').\n\nWait, but when considering a pair, if either is a '?', the pair is compatible.\n\nSo, the total number of pairs is the sum of:\n\n1. Specific pairs: sum over c of min(cnt_l[c], cnt_r[c]).\n2. Cross-pairs involving at least one '?': which includes left '?', right specific; right '?', left specific; and both being '?'.\n\nBut how do we calculate this without double-counting?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute all possible pairs where at least one is a '?', and add that to the specific pairs.\n\nBut wait, no. Because some pairs might have been counted already in the specific pairs if both are '?'. For example, a left '?' and a right '?' would be a compatible pair, but they are not considered in the specific color count because their color is '?'.\n\nWait, the specific color count only considers when both have the same specific color. So, the cross pairs involving '?'s are separate from the specific pairs.\n\nSo, the total is:\n\nTotal = Specific_pairs + Cross_pairs.\n\nWhere:\n\nSpecific_pairs = sum over c (min(cnt_l[c], cnt_r[c])).\n\nCross_pairs is the number of pairs where at least one is a '?'.\n\nBut how to compute cross_pairs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps cross_pairs can be calculated as:\n\ncross_pairs = q_left * q_right + q_left * (total_right - q_right) + q_right * (total_left - q_left) - q_left * q_right.\n\nWait, no. Let me think differently.\n\nThe cross_pairs include all pairs where at least one is a '?'. So, the number of such pairs is:\n\n(q_left * total_right) + (q_right * total_left) - (q_left * q_right).\n\nBecause",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. Each boot can be part of at most one pair.
