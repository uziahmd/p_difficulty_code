The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, Xenia is in a city with houses arranged in a ring, right? She needs to do some tasks, and each task requires her to be at a specific house. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks.\n\nWait, the problem says that each task i must be done after all tasks j where j < i. Oh, right, because the list is given in order. So for each task ai, she must reach it after completing all previous ones.\n\nHmm, how do we model this? Well, the movement is along the ring, which is a circle. So the distance between two houses depends on which way you go. Since the traffic is one-way clockwise, moving from house A to B in a clockwise direction takes (B - A) mod n steps if B > A, but if B < A, it's (n - A + B) steps.\n\nBut wait, the initial position is house 1. And she has to process the tasks in order: a1, then a2, etc., up to am. So for each step, she needs to move from her current position to the next required house, but also considering that she might have multiple occurrences of the same house.\n\nI think the key here is to compute the optimal path that covers all the required positions in the order they appear, possibly revisiting some houses if needed. But since each task can be done once, perhaps the optimal path is determined by the maximum distance between consecutive required houses, considering their order around the ring.\n\nWait, maybe it's similar to the traveling salesman problem on a circular track. But since the order is fixed, perhaps we can model the minimal path by looking at the distances between consecutive points in the sorted order.\n\nLet me think. Let's sort the list of required houses, but not just any order—since the sequence must be processed in the given order, but sometimes the next required house could be earlier in the ring than the current one, meaning she'll have to loop around the ring to get there.\n\nWait, no. Because the tasks are in a specific order. For example, if the first task is a1, then the second a2, etc. So she must reach a2 after a1, a3 after a2, and so on. So the positions are visited in the order of the input, but each time she moves from the previous position to the next required house.\n\nSo the path is a1 → a2 → ... → am. But the way she moves from a_i to a_{i+1} may require going all the way around the ring, depending on the positions.\n\nWait, but the initial position is 1. So the first task is a1, then she moves to a2, then to a3, and so on until am. So the total time is the sum of the distances between consecutive required houses, plus the distance from the last required house back to the starting point (if needed). Wait, no—because the last task is am, and she doesn't need to return to 1. Or does she?\n\nWait, the problem says she needs to complete all tasks with numbers less than i. So for the m-th task, she doesn't have to go anywhere else. So the total time is the sum of the distances from her current position to each next required house, in the order of the tasks, starting from 1.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the initial position is 1, and the first task is a1. So she starts at 1, goes to a1, then from a1 to a2, and so on until am. So the total time is the sum of the distances from each step.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct. Because when she moves from a_i to a_{i+1}, it's possible that a_{i+1} is behind a_i in the ring, which means she has to go all the way around. So the distance between a_i and a_{i+1} is min( (a_{i+1} - a_i) % n, (a_i - a_{i+1}) % n )? Or perhaps it's the minimal path, which would be the shorter of the two possible paths around the ring.\n\nWait, the ring is unidirectional, right? So movement is only clockwise. So the distance between a_i and a_j is computed as follows: if a_j is ahead of a_i in the clockwise direction, then the distance is (a_j - a_i) % n. Otherwise, it's (a_j + n - a_i) % n, but wait, no—since the ring is circular, the minimal distance when moving clockwise is either (a_j - a_i) if a_j >= a_i, or (n - a_i + a_j) if a_j < a_i.\n\nYes, that's",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving clockwise around a ring of houses. Each task must be completed in the given order, and moving from one house to another adjacent house takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to complete tasks in the given order. The key challenge is to find the optimal path that minimizes the total time taken to complete all tasks.\n2. **Intuition**: The optimal path can be derived by considering the distances between consecutive task locations. Since the ring is circular, the distance between two points can be computed in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, but since movement is only allowed clockwise, we need to calculate the shortest clockwise path.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute the initial position as 1.\n   - For each task location, compute the distance from the current position to the next task location in the clockwise direction.\n   - Sum these distances to get the total time required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor x in a:\n    # Calculate the clockwise distance from current to x\n    if x >= current:\n        dist = x - current\n    else:\n        dist = n - current + x\n    total_time += dist\n    current = x\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initial Position**: Xenia starts at house 1.\n- **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each task location `x`, compute the clockwise distance from the current position to `x`. If `x` is ahead of the current position, the distance is `x - current`. If `x` is behind, the distance wraps around the ring, calculated as `n - current + x`.\n- **Update Current Position**: After computing the distance to each task location, update the current position to `x` and accumulate the total time.\n- **Output the Result**: Print the accumulated total time which represents the minimum time needed to complete all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required time by iterating through each task once, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(m), where m is the number of tasks.",
