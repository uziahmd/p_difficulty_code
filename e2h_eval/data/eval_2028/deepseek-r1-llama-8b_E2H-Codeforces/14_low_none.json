He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about finding the number of positive integers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeros. And then I have to output all those n's in increasing order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n, because there are usually more 2s than 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is sum of n divided by 5, plus n divided by 25, and so on until n divided by 5^k is zero.\n\nSo, for example, for n=5: 5//5 =1, 5//25=0. So total is 1. For n=6, same as 5, since 6//5 is 1. Wait no, wait, 6//5 is 1, yes. So 6! has one trailing zero.\n\nWait, but in the sample input given, when m is 1, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. Because each of these numbers adds a new 5 factor only at 5, but for 6,7,8,9, the count remains 1 until 10. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the approach is to find all n where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do we find these n's?\n\nI think the key is to find the smallest n where the trailing zeros are >=m, and then check if any consecutive numbers after that also give the same count.\n\nWait, but another way is to realize that once you hit a multiple of 5, the count increases. So, for a given m, the possible n's form a range from some lower bound to an upper bound, and the count is either zero or one or more.\n\nWait, let me think differently. For a given m, the minimal n that gives exactly m trailing zeros can be found using binary search. Then, the maximum n that gives exactly m trailing zeros is the next number before the minimal n for m+1.\n\nBut wait, no. Because sometimes adding a 5 might not change the count. Like between 5 and 9, the count remains 1. So the numbers 5,6,7,8,9 all have one trailing zero. So for m=1, the count is 5 numbers.\n\nSo perhaps for each m, there's a range of n's that all give the same trailing zero count. So our task is to find the start and end of that range.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the smallest n such that the number of trailing zeros is m. Let's call this low.\n2. Find the largest n such that the number of trailing zeros is m. Let's call this high.\n3. The number of such n's is high - low + 1.\n4. Then, output all numbers from low to high inclusive.\n\nBut how do I compute the number of trailing zeros? Let's write a helper function for that.\n\nFunction count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to find all n where count_trailing_zeros(n) == m.\n\nNow, to find the minimal n where count is >= m. We can perform a binary search.\n\nWait, but maybe we need to adjust the binary search conditions.\n\nAlternatively, find the minimal n_low such that count(n_low) == m and count(n_low-1) < m (if m>0). Similarly, find the maximal n_high where count(n_high) == m and count(n_high+1) < m.\n\nWait, but for m=0, but in this problem m starts from 1.\n\nSo for a given m, find the first n where count(n) == m, and the last n where count(n) == m.\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, implement a helper function to count the trailing zeros.\n\nThen, find the minimal n where count(n) >= m. But wait, no, because for m=1, the minimal n is 5, which is the first n where count is 1. So perhaps for m, the minimal n is the smallest n where count(n) == m. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps we can use binary search to find the lower bound and upper bound.\n\nWait, but for m=5, let's compute the counts:\n\nLet me compute for some n's:\n\nn | count\n5 →1\n6→1\n7→1\n8→1\n9→1\n10→2\n11→2\n12→2\n13→2\n14→2\n15→3\n...\nWait, so for m=5, what is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list all such integers \\( n \\) in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{count} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division results in zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To find the range of \\( n \\) values that produce exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros:\n   - Use binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) (let's call it `lower_bound`) where the count of trailing zeros equals \\( m \\).\n   - Similarly, use binary search to find the largest \\( n \\) (let's call it `upper_bound`) where the count of trailing zeros equals \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Generate the Result**: Once the bounds are found, generate all integers between `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` inclusive and count them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_bounds(m):\n    left, right = 0, 5 * m  # Initial bounds, adjusted based on m\n    \n    def find_min():\n        left = 0\n        right = 5 * m\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            c = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n            if c < m:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid\n        return left\n    \n    def find_max():\n        left = 0\n        right = 5 * m\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right + 1) // 2\n            c = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n            if c > m:\n                right = mid - 1\n            else:\n                left = mid\n        return left\n    \n    lower = find_min()\n    upper = find_max()\n    \n    # Verify that lower and upper actually have m trailing zeros\n    if count_trailing_zeros(lower) != m or count_trailing_zeros(upper) != m:\n        return None, None\n    # Also check if lower-1 and upper+1 don't have m\n    if lower > 0 and count_trailing_zeros(lower - 1) == m:\n        lower -= 1\n    if upper < (5 * m) and count_trailing_zeros(upper + 1) == m:\n        upper += 1\n    return lower, upper\n\nm = int(input().strip())\nif m == 0:\n    print(\"0\")\nelse:\n    lower, upper = find_bounds(m)\n    if lower is None or upper is None:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = upper - lower + 1\n        print(k)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower, upper + 1))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Helper Function**: The `count_trailing_zeros` function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by repeatedly dividing \\( n \\) by 5 and summing the quotients.\n2. **Binary Search**: The `find_bounds` function uses binary search to determine the smallest and largest \\( n \\) values that yield exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros.\n3. **Edge Cases**: Handles cases where \\( m = 0 \\) separately since no positive integer \\( n \\) will have zero trailing zeros.\n4. **Result Generation**: After determining the bounds, the code generates the list of integers between the bounds and prints them.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the required range of \\( n \\) values using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of \\( m \\).",
