The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem is called \"The Number Games.\" Hmm. The setup is that there are n districts connected in such a way that each pair has exactly one path between them. So it's a tree structure.\n\nEach district's contestant has a number of fans equal to 2^i, where i is the district number. The president wants to remove k contestants, but when he does, the districts they're from become inaccessible. So all the remaining districts must form a connected component. Oh right, because otherwise, someone can't reach others.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if you remove a contestant from a district, then that district becomes impassable. So any other district connected to it via a road can't be reached anymore unless they have their own roads. So the remaining districts must form a connected subgraph where none of the removed districts are present on any of the paths.\n\nSo the goal is to remove k districts such that the remaining form a connected subtree, and the sum of 2^d for each d in the remaining districts is maximized.\n\nHmm, okay. So how do we model this? It seems like we need to find a connected subset of the tree with (n - k) nodes, and among all possible such subsets, choose the one with the maximum sum of 2^d.\n\nWait, but since 2^d grows exponentially, larger districts contribute much more to the sum. So to maximize the sum, we want as many large districts as possible. But the constraint is that the subset must be connected.\n\nSo the approach is probably to find a subtree that includes the largest possible districts, ensuring that they form a connected component.\n\nBut how do we determine which districts to keep and which to remove?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the optimal solution. Since the sum is maximized by including higher-numbered districts, the optimal connected component will include all the highest-numbered districts possible, connected in a way that forms a subtree.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is to select a subtree that consists of a path where each node is as high as possible. Like, maybe the root of the tree is part of this subtree, but perhaps not necessarily. Or perhaps the subtree is a star shape, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to model this as finding a connected subtree with (n - k) nodes, and the sum is maximized when the included nodes have the highest possible 2^d values.\n\nSo the key is to include as many high-numbered districts as possible, provided they are connected.\n\nWait, but how to ensure connectivity. Maybe the best approach is to find the subtree with the maximum possible sum, which would consist of the largest m = n -k nodes arranged in a way that they form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree rooted at the highest possible node, and include as many children as possible. Because higher-numbered nodes contribute more to the sum.\n\nWait, let's think about it. Let's imagine the tree as a collection of nodes, each with a certain depth. The deeper the node, the higher its value.\n\nIn a tree, each node except the root has exactly one parent. So if we decide to include a node, we must also include its ancestors up to some point.\n\nWait, no. If we include a node, say x, then all nodes along the path from x to the root (if the root is included) must be included as well. Otherwise, x would be disconnected.\n\nSo to include x, the path from x to the root must be entirely included in the connected component.\n\nWait, that's not necessarily true. Because if x is connected via a different path that doesn't go through the root, but that's only possible if the tree has multiple roots, which it doesn't. So the tree is a single connected component.\n\nWait, no. In a tree, every node is connected via exactly one path to any other node. So if x is included, then all nodes on the path from x to any other included node must be included as well.\n\nSo for example, if x is included and y is included, and they are in different branches from a common ancestor, then the path between x and y goes through that ancestor. So if x is in one branch and y is in another, the ancestor must be included as well.\n\nThus, the connected component must form a subtree that is connected, meaning that the subtree is a connected part of the original tree.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a connected subtree of size s = n -k, such that the sum of 2^d for all nodes in the subtree is as large as possible.\n\nHow do we find such a subtree?\n\nSince the sum is maximized by having as many high-numbered nodes as possible, the optimal subtree will include the highest possible nodes, but connected in a way that forms a subtree.\n\nSo the strategy is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component with the maximum possible sum of fans. The key insight is that higher-numbered districts contribute more to the sum due to their exponential fan count, so we aim to include as many high-numbered districts as possible while maintaining connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Exponential Fan Contribution**: The number of fans for a district `i` is `2^i`, which grows exponentially. Thus, higher-numbered districts are more valuable.\n3. **Connected Subtree**: After removing `k` districts, the remaining districts must form a connected subtree. This means all included districts must be reachable from each other without going through any removed districts.\n4. **Optimal Subtree Selection**: To maximize the sum, we need to select a connected subtree that includes the highest possible districts. This can be achieved by identifying the subtree rooted at the highest possible node and including as many of its children as possible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n    \n    parent = [0] * (n + 1)\n    depth = [0] * (n + 1)\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    \n    # Find the root (since it's a tree, any node without a parent is root)\n    root = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if parent[i] == 0:\n            root = i\n            break\n    \n    # Build the tree with parent pointers using BFS\n    stack = [(root, -1)]\n    while stack:\n        u, p = stack.pop()\n        if visited[u]:\n            continue\n        visited[u] = True\n        parent[u] = p\n        for v in edges[u]:\n            if not visited[v]:\n                depth[v] = depth[u] + 1\n                stack.append((v, u))\n    \n    # Now, for each node, collect all its children\n    children = defaultdict(list)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        p = parent[i]\n        if p != -1:\n            children[p].append(i)\n    \n    # We need to find the subtree where the sum of 2^d is maximized\n    # The subtree should be as large as possible (n -k nodes) but also have the highest sum\n    # Since higher d contributes more, we want to include as many high d as possible\n    # So we can model this as selecting a subtree where the root has the highest possible d\n    # and as many children as possible\n    \n    # Let's collect all possible candidates: each node's subtree size\n    # For each node, the subtree size is 1 + sum of sizes of its children\n    # We need to select a subtree of size s = n -k, which can be done by choosing a root with enough size\n    \n    # We'll perform a post-order traversal to compute the size of each subtree\n    # Then, for each node, check if the size of its subtree is >= s\n    # If yes, then we can take some of its children\n    \n    # Compute subtree sizes\n    subtree_size = [1] * (n + 1)\n    for u in range(1, n+1):\n        for v in children[u]:\n            subtree_size[u] += subtree_size[v]\n    \n    s = n - k\n    result = []\n    visited_sub = [False] * (n + 1)\n    \n    # We need to find a subtree of size s, starting from the root of the largest possible\n    # We can try to find the deepest possible nodes to include\n    # Another approach: since higher depth implies higher value, we can prioritize including deeper nodes\n    \n    # Let's process nodes in decreasing order of depth\n    nodes_by_depth = defaultdict(list)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        nodes_by_depth[depth[i]].append(i)\n    \n    # Process nodes from highest depth to lowest\n    for d in reversed(range(n)):\n        for u in nodes_by_depth[d]:\n            if not visited_sub[u]:\n                # The subtree rooted at u has size 'subtree_size[u]'\n                if subtree_size[u] <= s:\n                    # Take all nodes in this subtree\n                    for node in nodes_by_depth[d][::-1]:\n                        if not visited_sub[node]:\n                            result.append(node)\n                            visited_sub[node] = True\n                    break\n                else:\n                    # We can take all nodes up to current depth, then add as much as needed from lower depths\n                    # But this might not be correct;
