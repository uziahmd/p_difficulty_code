There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a tennis tournament where players are eliminated in each game, and the tournament grid isn't fixed yet. But there's a specific rule: two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. My task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in.\n\nHmm, right. So the winner needs to play as many games as possible, but each time he plays, the opponent must have a similar number of prior games. And since it's a knockout tournament, every game eliminates one player.\n\nLet me think about the structure here. The winner starts with zero games played. Each game they win increases their count by one. For each opponent they face, that opponent must have either played the same number of games or one less than the winner's current count.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because when the winner has k games played, the opponent could have k-1 or k games. Because the rule says the difference can't be more than one. So when the winner is about to play their (k+1)th game, their opponent could have either k or k-1 games.\n\nBut how does this translate into the path the winner takes to reach the final?\n\nI think the key is to model the maximum number of games the winner can have, given that each opponent they face has a certain number of prior games.\n\nThis feels like a dynamic programming problem or maybe a recursive approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the Fibonacci sequence because each step depends on previous steps in a way that might accumulate.\n\nWait, let's think about small examples.\n\nFor n=2, there's only one game. So the winner plays once. That's straightforward.\n\nFor n=3, the winner can play two games. Like, first against someone, then another. How? Let's say the winner (player 1) plays against player 2 in the first round. Then in the second round, plays against player 3. But wait, player 3 hasn't played any games yet. So after the first game, player 1 has 1 game, player 2 is out. Then in the next game, player 1 vs player 3. Player 3 has 0 games, which is a difference of 1 from 1, so it's allowed. So total of 2 games.\n\nAnother example: n=4. What's the maximum? According to the sample, it's 2. Oh wait, no, wait the sample input for 4 gives output 2. Wait, how? Because when the winner has played 2 games, the opponents must have played 1 or 2. But after the first game, the winner has 1, so the next opponent can have 0 or 1. If they have 1, that would mean they've already played a game, but with whom? So perhaps the structure is such that the winner can't play more than 2 games.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the maximum number of games as f(n), and find a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me try to see for small n:\n\nn=2: 1 game.\nn=3: 2 games.\nn=4: 2 games.\nn=5: Let's see. The winner could play 3 games. How?\n\nFirst, he plays someone with 0 games, then someone with 1, then someone with 2.\n\nWait, but each opponent must have played either same or one less than the winner's current count before facing them.\n\nSo for the third game, the opponent must have played 2 games. So how do we arrange that?\n\nMaybe the path is something like:\n\nGame 1: winner (0) vs A (0). Now, A is out. Winner has 1 game.\nGame 2: winner (1) vs B (0). B has 0, difference is 1. So allowed. Now, winner has 2 games.\nGame 3: winner (2) vs C (1). So C must have 1 game. How did C get to 1? Because C had to win a previous game. So perhaps in an earlier round, C defeated someone else.\n\nWait, but in n=5, the initial rounds have 4 games (since it's a knockout, each round halves the players until the final). But the order of the games is determined by the grid arrangement, but under the constraint that two players can only meet if their prior games differ by at most one.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: the maximum number of games the winner can play is equal to the maximum m such that the sum of the series 1 + 2 + ... + m <= n.\n\nNo, wait. Because each game the winner plays requires that the opponent comes from a subtree where each of those players has a certain number of games played.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest m where the (m+1)-th Fibonacci number is <= n. Because each step adds the possibility of a new game, which depends on the sum of the previous possibilities.\n\nWait, that rings a bell. Let me think about the Fibonacci sequence. For example, for n=10, the output is 4. Let's see what the Fibonacci numbers are up to 10. The Fibonacci sequence starting from 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc. Hmm, wait 1+2=3, 3+2=5, etc. So for m=4, the sum would be 1+2+3+4=10, which is exactly n=10. So that matches the sample.\n\nWait, but let's check n=5. The maximum m is 3. Because 1+2+3=6, which is larger than 5, but perhaps the sum of the series is not exactly the way. Or maybe it's the (m+1)th term in the Fibonacci-like sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of games is the largest m where F(m+2) <= n, where F is the Fibonacci sequence starting with F(1)=1, F(2)=2.\n\nWait, let's test this hypothesis.\n\nFor n=2: F(3)=3 > 2, so m=1. Which is correct.\n\nn=3: F(4)=5>3, so m=2. Correct.\n\nn=4: F(4)=5>4, so m=2. Correct.\n\nn=5: F(4)=5 ==5, so m=3? Because F(4) is 5, which is equal to n=5. So m=3.\n\nn=10: F(6)=8 <10, F(7)=13>10. So m=5? Wait, no, because the sample says m=4.\n\nWait, maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the maximum number of games as follows.\n\nEach time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have either x or x-1 games played, where x is the current number of games the winner has played.\n\nSo, for the first game, x=0. So the opponent must have 0 or 1 games. But since the tournament starts, the opponent must have 0 games.\n\nAfter that, the winner has 1 game. So next opponent can have 0 or 1. But if the opponent has 1, that means they have won one game, implying that their own opponent must have 0 games.\n\nWait, this seems like building a binary tree where each node represents a player, and each edge represents a game. The winner's path is a chain where each step branches off in a way that allows the next opponent to have x-1 or x games.\n\nThis seems complex. Maybe another way to model it is to think recursively. Let dp[k] be the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games.\n\nThen, for each k, dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2], because the winner's k-th game requires an opponent who has either k-1 or k-2 games played.\n\nWait, that sounds familiar. Because for the k-th game, the opponent must have either k-1 or k-2 games. So the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have k games is the sum of the minimal players needed for k-1 and k-2.\n\nBecause:\n\nTo play the k-th game, the winner has already played k-1 games. So the opponent could have played k-1 or k-2 games.\n\nIf the opponent has k-1 games, then that opponent's own path required dp[k-1] players.\n\nIf the opponent has k-2 games, then that path required dp[k-2] players.\n\nSo the total players needed is dp[k-1] + dp[k-2].\n\nWait, yes! So the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games is dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2], with base cases.\n\nWhat are the base cases?\n\ndp[0] = 1 (the winner doesn't play any game, but that's trivial).\n\ndp[1] = 2: the winner plays one game, so two players.\n\nLet's compute this:\n\ndp[0] = 1\ndp[1] = 2\ndp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0} = 2+1=3\ndp[3}= dp[2}+dp[1} =3+2=5\ndp[4}=5+3=8\ndp[5}=8+5=13\netc.\n\nSo for each k, the minimal number of players is the (k+1)th Fibonacci number.\n\nWait, because dp[k] is the (k+1)th Fibonacci number.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\ndp[0] = 1 → Fib(1) =1\n\ndp[1}=2 → Fib(3)=2\n\ndp[2}=3 → Fib(4)=3\n\ndp[3}=5 → Fib(5)=5\n\nYes, so dp[k] = Fib(k+2), perhaps.\n\nSo the maximum k is the largest value such that dp[k] ≤n.\n\nSo, for each n, find the maximum k where dp[k] ≤n.\n\nSo the approach is to precompute dp up to some maximum, and for each n, find the largest k where dp[k] ≤n.\n\nSo, the steps for the solution:\n\n1. Precompute dp for k starting from 0, where dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2], with dp[0]=1, dp[1}=2.\n\n2. For the given n, find the largest k where dp[k] ≤n.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nWe can compute dp up to a point where dp[k] exceeds 1018, since n can be up to 1018.\n\nLet's compute the dp array.\n\nCompute until dp[k] exceeds 1018.\n\nLet's compute:\n\ndp[0] =1\n\ndp[1] =2\n\ndp[2] =3\n\ndp[3]=5\n\ndp[4]=8\n\ndp[5]=13\n\ndp[6]=21\n\ndp[7}=34\n\ndp[8}=55\n\ndp[9}=89\n\ndp[10}=144\n\ndp[11}=233\n\ndp[12}=377\n\ndp[13}=610\n\ndp[14}=987\n\ndp[15}=1597\n\nWait, 1597 is larger than 1018. So for n up to 1018, the maximum k is 14, since dp[14}=987 ≤1018, and dp[15}=1597>1018.\n\nSo for each n, we can find the maximum k such that dp[k] ≤n.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the dp array up to k=15.\n\n- For each input n, find the largest k where dp[k] ≤n.\n\nNow, code-wise:\n\nWe can create a list dp, starting with [1,2], and then iteratively compute each next term until it exceeds 1018.\n\nOnce that's done, for each n, iterate from the highest k down to 0, and find the first k where dp[k] <=n.\n\nBut wait, what about n between dp[k] and dp[k+1}? For example, n=5: dp[3}=5, so k=3.\n\nn=6: dp[3}=5<=6, dp[4}=8>6, so k=3.\n\nSo, the maximum number of games is 3.\n\nSo, the code will read n, loop through the dp array, find the maximum k where dp[k] <=n.\n\nImplementing this:\n\nRead n.\n\nInitialize dp as [1,2].\n\nCompute next terms until it exceeds 1018.\n\nThen for each n, find the maximum k.\n\nWait, but how to handle n=1? Well, the constraints say n>=2.\n\nWait, the problem statement says n >=2.\n\nSo, for each test case, the answer is the maximum k such that dp[k] <=n.\n\nLet's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input: ['2','3','4','10']\n\nSample Output: ['1','2','2','4']\n\nTesting for n=2: the dp array is [1,2,3,...]. So dp[1}=2<=2, dp[2}=3>2. So k=1, output 1.\n\nn=3: dp[2}=3<=3, dp[3}=5>3 → k=2 → output 2.\n\nn=4: dp[2}=3<=4, dp[3}=5>4 → k=2 → output 2.\n\nn=10: dp[4}=8<=10, dp[5}=13>10 →k=4 → output 4.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\ndp[3}=5<=5, so k=3 → output 3.\n\nn=6: same as above, output 3.\n\nn=8: dp[4}=8 →k=4.\n\nn=9: dp[4}=8 <=9, dp[5}=13>9 →k=4.\n\nn=10: same as before.\n\nn=7: dp[4}=8>7, so k=3.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe steps:\n\n1. Read the input as a list of strings, split into integers.\n\n2. For each integer n in the list, compute the maximum k as described.\n\n3. Collect all the outputs, convert to strings, and print them space-separated.\n\nImplementing the dp:\n\nStart with dp = [1,2]\n\nnext_val = 3\n\nwhile next_val <=1018:\n\n    append to dp\n\n    compute next_val as sum of last two elements.\n\nWait, but initial dp is [1,2], then 3,5,8, etc.\n\nWait, no: dp[0] =1, dp[1}=2, dp[2}=3, dp[3}=5, etc.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndp = [1, 2]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = dp[-1] + dp[-2]\n\n    if next_val > 1018:\n\n        break\n\n    dp.append(next_val)\n\nOnce this is done, for each n, find the maximum k where dp[k] <=n.\n\nBut since the dp is built from 0 to k, we can loop from the end backwards until the condition is met.\n\nSo for each n:\n\nmax_games = 0\n\nfor i in reversed(range(len(dp))):\n\n    if dp[i] <=n:\n\n        max_games =i\n\n        break\n\nprint(max_games)\n\nWait, no. Because len(dp) is the number of elements, which is 16 (from 0 to 15). So for n=10, dp[4}=8 <=10, so i=4.\n\nThus, the code for each n is:\n\nk =0\n\nfor i in range(len(dp)-1, -1, -1):\n\n    if dp[i] <=n:\n\n        k =i\n\n        break\n\nreturn k\n\nYes.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead the input as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the dp array.\n\nFor each n in the list, find the maximum k where dp[k] <=n.\n\nPrint the results.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead the input line as a list, split into integers.\n\nCompute the dp.\n\nLoop through each n, find the k, collect the results.\n\nBut wait, the input may have multiple test cases, but according to the problem statement, it's a single line input, which is n.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput is a single line containing a single integer n.\n\nSo, the input is one integer, not a list.\n\nWait, the sample input shows ['2', '3', '4', '10'], but perhaps that's just for illustrative purposes. Wait, no, the actual input is a single integer, but in the problem statement, the sample input is given as a list, which probably is a typo.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n.\n\nSo the input is a single integer, not a list.\n\nSo in the code, we can read it as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo, the code steps are:\n\n- Compute dp.\n\n- For each n, find the maximum k where dp[k] <=n.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nFirst, compute the dp.\n\nInitialize dp as [1,2], then keep adding until the next value exceeds 1018.\n\nThen, for each n, iterate through the dp from high to low to find the maximum k.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nn = int(input())\ndp = [1, 2]\nwhile True:\n    next_val = dp[-1] + dp[-2]\n    if next_val > 1018:\n        break\n    dp.append(next_val)\nmax_k = 0\nfor num in dp:\n    if num <= n:\n        max_k = len(dp) -1  # since dp is 0-based, the index is len(dp)-1\n        break\n# Now, find the maximum k where dp[k] <=n\n# Alternative approach: loop from highest to lowest\nfor k in range(len(dp)-1, -1, -1):\n    if dp[k] <=n:\n        max_k = k\n        break\nprint(max_k)\n\nWait, no. The code as written first sets max_k=0 if none found, but in reality, dp[0]=1 <=n, so it will find at least k=0.\n\nWait, for n=2, dp[0}=1 <=2, dp[1}=2 <=2, so the loop from high to low will set k=1.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach of checking from high to low is better.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nn = int(input())\ndp = [1, 2]\nwhile True:\n    next_val = dp[-1] + dp[-2]\n    if next_val > 1018:\n        break\n    dp.append(next_val)\nmax_games = 0\nfor k in reversed(range(len(dp))):\n    if dp[k] <= n:\n        max_games = k\n        break\nprint(max_games)\n\nWait, but the reversed(range(len(dp))) goes from len(dp)-1 down to 0.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input: 10.\n\nThe dp is [1,2,3,5,8,13,... up to 987, 1597]. So len(dp) is 15 (indices 0-14).\n\nFor n=10:\n\nCheck dp[14]=987 <=10? No.\n\ndp[13]=610 <=10? No.\n\n... until dp[4}=8 <=10 → yes. So max_games=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test: n=5.\n\ndp[3}=5 <=5 → yes. So max_games=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about n=1? The problem states n >=2, so no need to handle that.\n\nAnother test: n=8.\n\ndp[4}=8 → yes, so max_games=4.\n\nn=9: dp[4}=8 <=9, dp[5}=13>9 → so max_games=4.\n\nYes.\n\nn=6: dp[3}=5 <=6, dp[4}=8>6 → max_games=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nTherefore, the code should be:\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute dp.\n\nLoop from highest k down to 0, return the first k where dp[k] <=n.\n\nThus, the code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given a specific rule about the number of games each player must have played before facing each other.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached by recognizing that the maximum number of games the winner can play follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. This is because each game the winner plays depends on the sum of the previous two games' requirements.\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: We use dynamic programming to precompute the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games. This is stored in an array `dp`, where `dp[k]` represents the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play `k` games.\n2. **Fibonacci-like Sequence**: The sequence `dp` is built such that each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, starting from `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 2`.\n3. **Finding the Maximum Games**: For a given number of players `n`, we find the largest `k` such that `dp[k]` is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ndp = [1, 2]\nwhile True:\n    next_val = dp[-1] + dp[-2]\n    if next_val > 1018:\n        break\n    dp.append(next_val)\nmax_games = 0\nfor k in reversed(range(len(dp))):\n    if dp[k] <= n:\n        max_games = k\n        break\nprint(max_games)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single integer `n`, representing the number of players.\n2. **Precomputing dp Array**: We initialize the `dp` array with the first two values (1 and 2). We then iteratively compute each subsequent value until it exceeds 1018, which covers all possible values of `n` up to the problem's constraints.\n3. **Finding Maximum Games**: For the given `n`, we check each precomputed value in the `dp` array from the highest down to the lowest to find the largest `k` such that `dp[k]` is less than or equal to `n`.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of games the winner can play by leveraging the properties of a Fibonacci-like sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of `n = 1018`.",
