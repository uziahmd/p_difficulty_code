In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about determining the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu in her hand. Mentsu can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). \n\nHmm. So the input is three tiles, each represented by a string like '1m', '2p', etc. The output is three integers, each representing the minimal draws needed for each of the three cases. Oh wait, no—wait, the output is the minimal number of draws needed overall, but looking back, the sample shows three outputs. Wait, no, the sample input gives three lines, and the output has three numbers. Wait, perhaps each line is a separate test case. Because the sample input is three separate cases, each with their own output. So for each of the three given hands, compute the minimal draws required.\n\nSo the first step is to process each of the three tiles as separate inputs, and for each, compute the minimal number of tiles needed to complete a mentsu.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. For each initial hand, we need to consider all possible ways to form a mentsu, whether it's a triplet or a sequence, and find the minimal number of tiles needed to achieve that.\n\nWait, but the initial hand is three tiles. When you add tiles, the total becomes more than three, but you just need at least one mentsu somewhere in the entire set. So the plan is: for each possible way to form a mentsu, calculate how many tiles are missing, then choose the minimal such count across all possible mentsu options.\n\nSo for each possible mentsu (all possible triplets and sequences), determine how many tiles from the initial hand are already present, subtract that from 3, and that gives the number of tiles needed to complete that mentsu. Then, find the minimal value among all these possibilities.\n\nBut considering that the initial hand has three tiles, maybe some mentsu can be formed with zero additional tiles if the hand already includes it.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each of the three input hands, process each separately.\n2. For each hand, generate all possible mentsu options (triplets and sequences) that could be formed.\n3. For each mentsu option, count how many tiles from the hand are present in the mentsu.\n4. The number of tiles needed is 3 minus the count from step 3.\n5. Find the minimal number of tiles needed across all possible mentsu options.\n6. Output this minimal number for each hand.\n\nBut wait, considering that the initial hand has three tiles, it's possible that a mentsu is already present. For example, if all three are the same, then zero tiles are needed.\n\nSo the plan is solid.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, for each hand, we need to consider all possible triplets and sequences.\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nTriplet: a triplet consists of three identical tiles. So for any tile x, the triplet is [x, x, x]. So for a given hand, check if all three are the same, which would require zero draws. Otherwise, check if two are x, then one more is needed. Or one is x, so two more are needed, etc.\n\nWait, but the triplet is three of the same. So for a given x (like '1m'), the triplet requires exactly three copies. So for each x, the number of tiles in the hand that match x is the count. So the deficit is 3 - count.\n\nFor sequences, it's more complex. A shuntsu is three consecutive numbers in the same suit. For example, '1m', '2m', '3m' is a shuntsu. Or '4p', '5p', '6p'. Also, sequences can wrap around? No, because in the examples, something like [9m, 1m, 2m] is not considered a sequence. So sequences must be in increasing order, consecutive, without wrapping.\n\nSo for each suit, we need to consider all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers.\n\nFor each possible sequence (like 1-2-3 in m, 2-3-4 in p, etc.), check how many of those are present in the hand. The deficit is 3 minus that count. So for each sequence, compute the needed tiles.\n\nAdditionally, note that when adding tiles, you can have multiple mentsus, but we just need one. So the minimal is based on the best possible mentsu.\n\nNow, how do we model this?\n\nWe'll process each hand as follows:\n\nFor each hand:\n\n1. Extract the three tiles.\n2. For each possible triplet:\n   a. Calculate how many of the three are already present.\n   b. Compute the required tiles (3 - count).\n3. For each possible shuntsu in each suit:\n   a. Check how many of the required tiles are present.\n   b. Compute the required tiles (3 - count).\n4. Find the minimal required tiles across all triplets and shuntsus.\n\nThe minimal required is the answer for that hand.\n\nSo the key is to generate all possible triplets and shuntsus, compute for each the required tiles, and find the smallest.\n\nNow, let's think about how to represent the tiles.\n\nEach tile can be represented as a tuple of (number, suit). For example, '1m' becomes (1, 'm').\n\nWe can split the initial hand into a list of these tuples.\n\nFor triplets:\n\nLoop through all possible numbers (1-9) and suits ('m', 'p', 's'). For each x in 1-9, and s in the suits, create the triplet (x, x, x, s). Then, count how many of the triplet's tiles are present in the hand.\n\nWait, but for a triplet, the count is the number of times x appears in the current hand. Because the triplet requires exactly three x's of suit s.\n\nWait, no. Because the triplet is three identical tiles. So, for example, if the current hand has two x's of suit s, then one more is needed.\n\nSo for each possible triplet (x, s), compute the number of x's in the hand with suit s. That count can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\nWait, but the hand can have other tiles as well. But for the triplet, only the count of x's in the hand (regardless of other tiles) matters.\n\nNo, wait: the triplet is a set of three identical tiles. So if the hand has any other tiles, they don't affect whether the triplet is present. So for the triplet, it's only the count of x's in the current hand that matters.\n\nFor example, if the hand is ['1m', '2m', '3m'], then the triplet for 1m would have a count of 1, so 2 more needed. But the shuntsu for 1m-2m-3m has a count of 3, so zero needed.\n\nSo, for each possible triplet (x, s):\n\ncount = number of tiles in the hand that are (x, s).\n\nrequired = max(3 - count, 0). Because if count is >=3, required is zero.\n\nSimilarly for each possible shuntsu, which is a sequence of three consecutive numbers in a suit.\n\nFor a shuntsu, the sequence is (a, a+1, a+2) where a is from 1 to 7.\n\nSo for each a in 1..7, and for each suit s in 'mps', the shuntsu is [(a, s), (a+1, s), (a+2, s)].\n\nFor each such sequence, count how many tiles in the hand are present in the sequence. The required is 3 - count.\n\nSo for each possible shuntsu, compute required.\n\nNow, the minimal required across all triplets and shuntsus is the answer.\n\nWait, but for each triplet and shuntsu, the required is 3 - count, but the count can't be more than 3. Because the hand has three tiles, so for any triplet or shuntsu, the maximum count is 3.\n\nWait, for example, if the hand is ['1m', '1m', '1m'], then the triplet (1m) has count 3, so required is 0.\n\nSo, for each possible triplet and shuntsu, calculate the required, and the minimal required across all is the answer.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\nFor each hand:\n\n- Generate all possible triplets (each possible x and s) and compute the required tiles.\n\n- Generate all possible shuntsus (each possible a and s) and compute the required tiles.\n\n- Among all these required values, find the minimal one. That's the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nSo, now, the question is: how to efficiently generate all possible triplets and shuntsus.\n\nLet's structure this.\n\nFirst, for each hand, we can process as follows.\n\nFor the triplet part:\n\nLoop over each possible x from 1 to 9.\n\nLoop over each suit s in ['m', 'p', 's'].\n\nFor each (x, s), count how many tiles in the hand are (x, s). The required is 3 - count.\n\nWe can collect all these required values.\n\nFor the shuntsu part:\n\nLoop over a from 1 to 7.\n\nLoop over each suit s in ['m', 'p', 's'].\n\nFor each (a, a+1, a+2) in suit s, count how many tiles in the hand are in this sequence.\n\nThe required is 3 - count.\n\nAgain, collect all required values.\n\nOnce all possible triplet and shuntsu required values are collected, find the minimal one.\n\nWait, but for the shuntsu, the sequence must consist of exactly three consecutive numbers. So for a=1, the sequence is 1,2,3; for a=2, it's 2,3,4, etc., up to a=7 (giving 7,8,9).\n\nSo for each a and s, the sequence is fixed.\n\nSo, for the hand, for each of these sequences, count how many of the three tiles are present.\n\nSo, for each hand, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three tiles, parse into a list of (number, suit) tuples.\n\n2. Initialize a variable min_draws to a large number, say 4, since the maximum needed is 3.\n\n3. For each possible triplet (x, s):\n\n   a. count = number of tiles in the hand where the number is x and suit is s.\n\n   b. required = 3 - count.\n\n   c. if required < current min_draws, update min_draws.\n\n4. For each possible shuntsu (a, s):\n\n   a. create the sequence [(a, s), (a+1, s), (a+2, s)].\n\n   b. count how many of these are present in the hand.\n\n   c. required = 3 - count.\n\n   d. if required < current min_draws, update min_draws.\n\n5. After checking all triplets and shuntsus, the min_draws is the answer.\n\nBut wait, is there a possibility that a combination of triplet and shuntsu requires fewer draws? For example, maybe completing a triplet in two draws allows for a shuntsu in one draw. But no, because each mentsu is considered individually. We need the minimal draws for any single mentsu.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nThe hand is a list of three tuples: each is (int, str), e.g., (1, 'm').\n\nFor checking triplets: for each (x, s), count the occurrences of (x, s) in the hand.\n\nFor shuntsus: for each (a, s), the sequence is a, a+1, a+2. So for each tile in the sequence, count how many are present in the hand.\n\nSo, for a given (a, s, a+1, s, a+2, s), how many of these are present in the hand.\n\nWait, but in the hand, the tiles may have duplicates. For example, the hand might have two 2m's and one 3m. So, for the shuntsu 2m,3m,4m: the count is 2 (since 2m and 3m are present).\n\nSo, for each shuntsu, iterate through each of the three tiles in the sequence and count how many are present in the hand.\n\nSo, for each shuntsu, count is sum(1 for t in sequence if t in hand).\n\nSo, in code:\n\nhand = list of (num, suit)\n\nfor a in 1..7:\n\n   for s in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n       seq = [(a, s), (a+1, s), (a+2, s)]\n\n       cnt = 0\n\n       for tile in seq:\n\n           if tile in hand:\n\n               cnt +=1\n\n       req = 3 - cnt\n\n       if req < min_draws:\n\n           min_draws = req\n\nWait, but this is incorrect because the hand may contain multiple copies of the same tile. For example, if the hand is ['1m', '1m', '2m'], then the triplet '1m' requires 1 more tile, but the shuntsu '1m,2m,3m' has two tiles present, so requires 1.\n\nBut in the code above, for the shuntsu, we're checking if each tile in the sequence exists in the hand, regardless of how many times. So for the sequence, the count is the number of distinct tiles in the sequence that are present in the hand.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because in the hand, for a shuntsu, it's about having at least one of each required tile.\n\nWait, no. Because to form a shuntsu, you need one of each of the three consecutive tiles. So the count is how many unique tiles in the sequence are present in the hand.\n\nWait, no. Because in the hand, the same tile can appear multiple times. For example, if the hand has two 2m's and one 3m, then the shuntsu 2m,3m,4m has two tiles present (2m and 3m), so the required is 1 (needs 4m).\n\nBut wait, the count is how many of the three tiles are present in the hand. Each tile can contribute to the count only once, even if it's present multiple times.\n\nSo, for the shuntsu, the count is the number of unique tiles in the sequence that are present in the hand. So, for the sequence, we need to check each tile, but count each occurrence only once.\n\nSo, for a given sequence, the count is the number of tiles in the sequence that are present in the hand.\n\nSo, the code should:\n\nFor each tile in the sequence, check if it's in the hand. If yes, increment the count. But since the same tile can appear multiple times in the sequence, but in the hand, we can have duplicates, but the count should not exceed 1 per tile.\n\nWait, no. Because the sequence is three distinct tiles. So, for example, if the sequence is 1m, 2m, 3m, and the hand has two 1m's, one 2m, and one 3m, then all three tiles are present. So the count is 3, and required is 0.\n\nBut if the hand has three 1m's, the sequence 1m,2m,3m has only one tile present (1m), so required is 2.\n\nSo, for the shuntsu, the count is the number of unique tiles in the sequence that are present in the hand.\n\nThus, in code, for each sequence in shuntsu:\n\ntiles_in_seq = set(sequence)  # so each tile is unique\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor t in tiles_in_seq:\n\n    if t in hand:\n\n        count +=1\n\nreq = 3 - count\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo, the code for checking the shuntsu is:\n\nfor a in range(1, 8):  # 1 to 7 inclusive\n\n   for s in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n       # create the three tiles in the sequence\n\n       tiles = [(a, s), (a+1, s), (a+2, s)]\n\n       # get unique tiles in the sequence\n\n       unique_tiles = list(set(tiles))  # though they are already unique, but just in case\n\n       # count how many are present in the hand\n\n       count = 0\n\n       for t in unique_tiles:\n\n           if t in hand:\n\n               count +=1\n\n       req = 3 - count\n\n       if req < min_draws:\n\n           min_draws = req\n\nSimilarly, for triplets, for each x in 1-9, s in 'mps':\n\ntiles = [(x, s), (x, s), (x, s)]\n\nunique_tiles = [(x, s)]\n\ncount = 1 if (x, s) is in hand else 0\n\nreq = 3 - count\n\nSo, for each triplet, the count is either 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor x in range(1, 10):\n\n   for s in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n       tile = (x, s)\n\n       if tile in hand:\n\n           count = 1\n\n       else:\n\n           count = 0\n\n       req = 3 - count\n\n       if req < min_draws:\n\n           min_draws = req\n\nWait, but the triplet requires three identical tiles, so if the hand has at least one, then one more is needed if count is 1, two more if count is 0, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nIn Python, the hand can be stored as a list of tuples. Then, for each triplet and shuntsu, the count is determined as described.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead three lines, each being a tile. For each line, parse into a tuple (int, str). Collect them into a list called 'hand'.\n\nThen, for each hand:\n\nmin_draws = 3  # worst case is adding all three\n\nfor each possible triplet (x, s):\n\n   count = 1 if (x, s) in hand else 0\n\n   req = 3 - count\n\n   if req < min_draws:\n\n       min_draws = req\n\nfor each possible shuntsu (a, s):\n\n   create the three tiles: (a, s), (a+1, s), (a+2, s)\n\n   unique_tiles = list of these three (they are unique)\n\n   count = sum(1 for t in unique_tiles if t in hand)\n\n   req = 3 - count\n\n   if req < min_draws:\n\n       min_draws = req\n\nprint min_draws\n\nWait, but in code, for the triplet, it's possible that the hand has two or three of the same tile. For example, hand is ['1m', '1m', '2m']. Then, for the triplet '1m', count is 1, so req is 2. But maybe a better option is the shuntsu 1m,2m,3m, which has two tiles present, so req is 1.\n\nSo the code correctly considers all possibilities.\n\nAnother example: the third sample input:\n\n['3p 9m 2p']\n\nHand is [(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]\n\nPossible triplet: 2p has one, so req 2.\n\n3p has one, req 2.\n\n9m has one, req 2.\n\nAlternatively, shuntsu: looking for 2p,3p,4p.\n\nCheck if 2p is present: yes.\n\n3p: present.\n\n4p: not present.\n\nSo count is 2, req is 1.\n\nAlternatively, 2p,3p,4p requires adding 4p.\n\nOr, another shuntsu: 1p,2p,3p. Present: 2p and 3p. So count is 2, req is 1.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input is ['9m 9m 9m'], which forms a triplet. So for that hand, the triplet (9m) has count 3, req 0.\n\nThus, the minimal is zero.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where the hand has no possible triplet or shuntsu, so the minimal is 3.\n\nFor example, hand is ['1m', '2p', '3s'].\n\nTriplet: none have enough, so req for each is 2.\n\nShuntsu: for 1m,2m,3m: only 1m and 3m are present, but 2m is not. So count is 2, req is 1.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the sequence 1m, 2m, 3m: the hand has 1m and 3m. So count is 2. So req is 1.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal is 1.\n\nWait, but according to the code, the minimal is 1.\n\nBut wait, what if the hand is ['1m', '2m', '4m'].\n\nThen, for the shuntsu 1m,2m,3m: count is 2 (1m and 2m), req is 1.\n\nFor the shuntsu 2m,3m,4m: count is 2 (2m and 4m), req is 1.\n\nSo, the minimal is 1.\n\nAnother case: hand is ['1m', '2m', '4m'].\n\nPossible shuntsu:\n\nLooking for 1m,2m,3m: present are 1m and 2m, so req 1.\n\nLooking for 2m,3m,4m: present are 2m and 4m, so req 1.\n\nThus, the minimal is 1.\n\nWait, but is there a way to have a mentsu with less than 1? No, because you need three tiles.\n\nSo the code correctly returns 1.\n\nAnother test case: hand is ['1m', '1m', '2m'].\n\nTriplet: 1m has two tiles, so req is 1.\n\nShuntsu: 1m,2m,3m: present are 1m and 2m, so req is 1.\n\nSo minimal is 1.\n\nSo, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead three lines, each line is a tile.\n\nFor each line, parse into (int, str), and collect into a list of hands.\n\nThen, for each hand in hands:\n\nCompute min_draws as described.\n\nPrint min_draws.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    # Read the three lines\n\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\n    # Parse each line into a tuple (num, suit)\n\n    hand = []\n\n    for line in lines:\n\n        num_part, suit = line.split()\n\n        num = int(num_part)\n\n        hand.append( (num, suit) )\n\n    # Now process each hand\n\n    for h in hand:\n\n        min_draws = 3  # maximum possible is 3\n\n        # Check all triplets\n\n        for x in range(1, 10):\n\n            for s in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n                tile = (x, s)\n\n                if tile in h:\n\n                    count = 1\n\n                else:\n\n                    count = 0\n\n                req = 3 - count\n\n                if req < min_draws:\n\n                    min_draws = req\n\n        # Check all shuntsus\n\n        for a in range(1, 8):\n\n            for s in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n                # Create the three tiles\n\n                tiles = [ (a, s), (a+1, s), (a+2, s) ]\n\n                # Get unique tiles (they are already unique)\n\n                unique_tiles = tiles\n\n                # Count how many are present in h\n\n                count = 0\n\n                for t in unique_tiles:\n\n                    if t in h:\n\n                        count +=1\n\n                req = 3 - count\n\n                if req < min_draws:\n\n                    min_draws = req\n\n        print(min_draws)\n\nBut wait, this code will process each hand in the lines as a separate case. So for each of the three lines, it processes them as individual hands and prints the result.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, it's three lines, each line is a separate hand, and the output is three numbers, each for each hand.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nProcessing each hand:\n\nFirst hand: ['1s', '2s', '3s'] → (1, 's'), (2, 's'), (3, 's').\n\nTriplet checks:\n\nFor x=1, s='s': tile (1,s) is present → count 1, req 2.\n\nx=2, s=s: present → req 2.\n\nx=3, s=s: present → req 2.\n\nx=4: no, req 3.\n\nEtc. So for triplet, minimal req is 2.\n\nShuntsu checks:\n\nFor a=1, s='s': 1s,2s,3s → all present → count 3 → req 0.\n\nSo min_draws is 0.\n\nThus, output is 0.\n\nSecond hand: all 9m.\n\nTriplet (9m): present 3 times → req 0.\n\nShuntsu: none would have 3 tiles, except for a=7, s=m: 7m,8m,9m. Hand has 9m → count 1, req 2.\n\nSo minimal is 0.\n\nThird hand: 3p,9m,2p.\n\nTriplet for 2p: present → count 1 → req 2.\n\nTriplet for 3p: present → count 1 → req 2.\n\nTriplet for 9m: present → count 1 → req 2.\n\nShuntsus:\n\nLooking for 2p,3p,4p: present 2p and 3p → count 2 → req 1.\n\nAlso, looking for 1p,2p,3p: present 2p and 3p → count 2 → req 1.\n\nThus, minimal is 1.\n\nSo output is 0, 0, 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for each hand in the 'hand' list, which is built from the three input lines, we process each as a separate case. So for the sample input, it's correct.\n\nBut wait, the code reads three lines and processes each as a separate hand, and prints three lines of output.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: hand is ['1m', '2m', '4m'].\n\nShuntsus:\n\n1m,2m,3m: count 2, req 1.\n\n2m,3m,4m: count 2, req 1.\n\nThus, minimal is 1.\n\nAnother test case: hand is ['1m', '2m', '3m'].\n\nShuntsu is 1m,2m,3m: count 3 → req 0.\n\nSo output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: hand is ['1m', '2m', '5m'].\n\nShuntsu 1m,2m,3m: count 2 → req 1.\n\nShuntsu 2m,3m,4m: count 1 → req 2.\n\nTriplet for 1m: count 1 → req 2.\n\nSo minimal is 1.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about the time complexity? For each hand, we loop through 9 suits * 3 =27 triplets, and 7 a's * 3 suits =21 shuntsus. So 27+21=48 iterations per hand, which is negligible.\n\nThus, the code is efficient.\n\nNow, the only thing is that in the code, for each hand, the code is processing each of the three lines as a separate hand, and outputting three lines. So for the sample input, each of the three lines is processed as a separate case.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the lines are:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSo, each of these is a separate hand. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) from her current hand of three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - A mentsu can be either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n   - We need to check all possible triplets and sequences that can be formed from the given tiles and determine the minimum number of additional tiles required to complete any such mentsu.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - For each possible triplet (each tile from 1-9 in each suit), count how many of those tiles are already present in the hand. The number of additional tiles needed is `3 - count`.\n   - For each possible sequence (three consecutive numbers in each suit), count how many of those tiles are present in the hand. The number of additional tiles needed is `3 - count`.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each hand, generate all possible triplets and sequences.\n   - For each triplet, calculate the number of additional tiles needed.\n   - For each sequence, calculate the number of additional tiles needed.\n   - Track the minimum number of additional tiles needed across all triplets and sequences.\n\n4. **Complexity**:\n   - The approach involves checking 27 triplets (9 numbers × 3 suits) and 21 sequences (7 starting points × 3 suits), resulting in a total of 48 checks per hand. This is efficient and feasible for the given problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n    \n    # Parse each line into a tuple of (number, suit)\n    hands = []\n    for line in lines:\n        num, suit = line.split()\n        hands.append((int(num), suit))\n    \n    for hand in hands:\n        min_draws = 3  # Maximum possible is 3\n        \n        # Check all possible triplets\n        for x in range(1, 10):\n            for s in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n                tile = (x, s)\n                if tile in hand:\n                    count = 1\n                else:\n                    count = 0\n                req = 3 - count\n                if req < min_draws:\n                    min_draws = req\n        \n        # Check all possible shuntsus\n        for a in range(1, 8):\n            for s in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n                # Create the sequence of three consecutive tiles\n                seq = [(a, s), (a+1, s), (a+2, s)]\n                count = 0\n                for t in seq:\n                    if t in hand:\n                        count += 1\n                req = 3 - count\n                if req < min_draws:\n                    min_draws = req\n        \n        print(min_draws)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of three lines, each representing a tile. Each tile is parsed into a tuple of its number and suit.\n- **Triplet Check**: For each possible triplet (each number from 1-9 in each suit), we check how many of these tiles are present in the hand and calculate the number of additional tiles needed.\n- **Sequence Check**: For each possible sequence (three consecutive numbers in each suit), we check how many of these tiles are present in the hand and calculate the number of additional tiles needed.\n- **Result Calculation**: The minimum number of additional tiles needed across all triplets and sequences is determined and printed for each hand.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimal number of tiles needed to form a mentsu, covering both triplets and sequences.",
