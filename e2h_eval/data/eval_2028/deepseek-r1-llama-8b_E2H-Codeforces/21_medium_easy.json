The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Neko Finds Grapes.\" Hmm, sounds interesting. So, Neko found some treasure chests and keys. The goal is to open as many chests as possible using the keys.\n\nLet me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, each chest has a number a_i and each key has b_j. A key can unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd. That means either one is even and the other is odd because even + odd = odd. Oh right, but wait, no: wait, 1+2=3 which is odd. Yes, that's right.\n\nEach key can be used once on one chest, and each chest can be opened at most once. So, we need to assign keys to chests such that as many chests as possible are unlocked.\n\nThe input gives n chests and m keys. We have to find the maximum number of chests we can open.\n\nHmm, okay. So, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I think we should categorize the chests and the keys based on whether their numbers are even or odd. Because for a key to unlock a chest, their parities must be different.\n\nWait, let me think. For a_i + b_j to be odd, exactly one of them must be even, right? Because even + odd is odd, and odd + even is also odd. But even + even is even, and odd + odd is even.\n\nSo, for a key to unlock a chest, the key's parity must be different from the chest's.\n\nTherefore, the approach is to count how many chests are even and how many are odd, and similarly for keys. Then, match the two in a way that maximizes the usage.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nLet’s denote:\n- E_a: number of chests with a_i even.\n- O_a: number of chests with a_i odd.\nSimilarly, E_b: number of keys with b_j even.\nO_b: number of keys with b_j odd.\n\nNow, the maximum number of chests we can open is the sum of the minimum between E_b and O_a (since each even key can only unlock an odd chest) plus the minimum between O_b and E_a (each odd key can unlock an even chest). Wait, wait. Or is it the other way around? Let me think again.\n\nNo, wait: each even key can be paired with an odd chest. So, the number of such pairings is min(E_b, O_a).\n\nSimilarly, each odd key can be paired with an even chest, so the number of pairings here is min(O_b, E_a).\n\nSo the total maximum is the sum of these two minima.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me take an example. Suppose there are 3 even keys and 5 odd chests. Then, the even keys can't all be used, since there are more even keys than odd chests. So, the number used would be the number of odd chests. Similarly, if there are 2 odd keys and 4 even chests, then only 2 can be used.\n\nSo yes, adding the two minima gives the correct maximum.\n\nBut wait, is that all? Are there any cases where this approach doesn't work?\n\nLet me think about the example given in the problem.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nChests: [9,14,6,2,11]. Let's compute E_a and O_a.\n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So E_a is 3 (14,6,2), O_a is 2 (9,11).\n\nKeys: [8,4,7,20]. 8 is even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So E_b is 3 (8,4,20), O_b is 1 (7).\n\nSo, min(E_b, O_a) is min(3,2) = 2.\n\nmin(O_b, E_a) is min(1,3) =1.\n\nTotal 2+1=3, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: second sample.\n\nChests: [2,4,6,8,10] all even. So E_a=5, O_a=0.\n\nKeys: [5], which is odd. So E_b=0, O_b=1.\n\nSo, min(E_b, O_a)=min(0,0)=0.\n\nmin(O_b, E_a)= min(1,5)=1.\n\nTotal 1, which is correct.\n\nThird sample: chest is 10, which is even. Keys are 20,30,40,50, all even.\n\nE_a=1, O_a=0.\n\nE_b=4, O_b=0.\n\nSo min(E_b, O_a)=0, min(O_b, E_a)=0. Total 0, which is correct.\n\nSo, the approach seems to hold.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd a_i (E_a, O_a).\n2. Count the number of even and odd b_j (E_b, O_b).\n3. The maximum number of chests is min(E_b, O_a) + min(O_b, E_a).\n\nThat's simple enough.\n\nSo now, the code steps.\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the next line as list a.\n\nRead the next line as list b.\n\nCompute E_a, O_a: for each element in a, check if even or odd.\n\nSimilarly for E_b and O_b.\n\nThen compute the sum as min(E_b, O_a) + min(O_b, E_a).\n\nPrint that sum.\n\nYes, that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's think about handling the inputs.\n\nIn Python, reading from stdin can be done via input().split().\n\nBut since the input may have multiple lines, perhaps separated by newlines, we can read each line as needed.\n\nWait, looking back at the input format:\n\nThe first line is n and m.\n\nSecond line: n integers a_i.\n\nThird line: m integers b_j.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the sample input description, it says:\n\nThe input is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nWhich suggests that the first line is n and m, then the second line is the a_i, third is the b_j.\n\nWait, but in the code sample provided, the user shows three inputs as separate strings. Wait, perhaps that was a formatting mistake. No, looking at the sample input, the actual input is three lines: first line n and m, second line the a array, third line the b array.\n\nWait, but the initial part of the problem statement shows that the input is like:\n\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\nWait, that's not correct. It's probably a typo because the actual input is three lines: n m, then a_1 ... a_n, then b_1 ... b_m.\n\nSo, in code, we can read the first line as n, m.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of n integers.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of m integers.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen compute E_a, O_a.\n\nE_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n\nO_a = n - E_a\n\nSimilarly for b:\n\nE_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n\nO_b = m - E_b\n\nThen compute res = min(E_b, O_a) + min(O_b, E_a)\n\nPrint(res)\n\nWait, that's all? That's very straightforward.\n\nTesting against the samples:\n\nSample 1:\n\na has 3 evens, 2 odds.\n\nb has 3 evens, 1 odd.\n\nmin(3, 2) is 2, min(1,3) is 1. Sum 3.\n\nSample 2:\n\na is all even (5), b has 1 odd.\n\nSo min(0,0) is 0, min(1,5)=1. Sum 1.\n\nSample 3:\n\na is 10, even. b is all even.\n\nmin(4, 0) is 0, min(0,1) is 0. Sum 0.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where all a are even, all b are even.\n\nThen E_a =n, O_a=0.\n\nE_b=m, O_b=0.\n\nThen min(E_b, O_a) is min(m,0)=0.\n\nmin(O_b, E_a)= min(0, n)=0.\n\nSum is 0.\n\nWhich is correct because a_i + b_j is even+even=even, which doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nAnother case: all a are odd, all b are odd.\n\nThen, a_i are O_a =n, E_a=0.\n\nb_j are O_b=m, E_b=0.\n\nSo min(E_b, O_a) = min(0, n)=0.\n\nmin(O_b, E_a) = min(m,0)=0.\n\nSum 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: some a and b.\n\nSuppose a has 2 evens, 3 odds.\n\nb has 4 evens, 2 odds.\n\nThen:\n\nE_a=2, O_a=3.\n\nE_b=4, O_b=2.\n\nmin(4,3)=3.\n\nmin(2,2)=2.\n\nTotal 5.\n\nSo maximum 5 chests can be opened.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nI think that's all. So the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the given keys. Each key can unlock a chest if their numbers have different parities (i.e., one is even and the other is odd).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Categorize Chests and Keys by Parity**: First, we categorize the chests and keys into two groups each: those with even numbers and those with odd numbers.\n2. **Count Even and Odd Numbers**: For both chests and keys, count how many have even numbers and how many have odd numbers.\n3. **Match Keys to Chests**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the number of valid key-chest pairs where one is even and the other is odd. Specifically:\n   - Use even keys to unlock odd chests.\n   - Use odd keys to unlock even chests.\n4. **Calculate Maximum Openable Chests**: Sum the minimum counts of the above valid pairs to get the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_a = n - even_a\n\neven_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_b = m - even_b\n\nmax_chests = min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a)\nprint(max_chests)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three lines. The first line contains the number of chests `n` and keys `m`. The second line contains the numbers on the chests, and the third line contains the numbers on the keys.\n2. **Counting Evens and Odds**: We count how many chests and keys have even numbers. The remaining will be odd.\n3. **Matching Keys and Chests**: The number of chests that can be opened using even keys is the minimum of the count of even keys and the count of odd chests. Similarly, the number of chests that can be opened using odd keys is the minimum of the count of odd keys and the count of even chests.\n4. **Summing Up**: The total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the two values calculated in the previous step.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of chests Neko can open by leveraging parity checks and counting, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
