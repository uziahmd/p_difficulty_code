Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Crazy Town,\" and from the description, it seems like it involves lines dividing a plane into regions, and moving between these regions with certain rules.\n\nHmm, the task is to find the minimum number of steps to get from the home block to the university block. Each step is moving from one block to another if they share a common border of non-zero length. So, the key here is understanding how the lines partition the plane and how the regions are connected.\n\nWait, the problem says that two blocks are adjacent if their shared boundary has non-zero length. So, for example, if two regions meet only at a single point (an intersection), that's not considered a valid move. They have to share a line segment as a border.\n\nI think each road is an infinite line, and all the roads together divide the plane into several regions. The home and university are in some regions, and I need to find how many steps it takes to go from home's region to the university's region by moving through adjacent regions.\n\nSo the approach probably involves figuring out which side of each road the home and university are on. Because, for each road, the home and university will be on opposite sides or the same side. If they're on opposite sides, then that road contributes to the path.\n\nWait, but how does that translate into steps? Because each step is moving across a road. Or maybe not exactly, because you might have to cross multiple roads to get from one region to another.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and university. Because each such road must be crossed once, and each crossing is a step.\n\nBut wait, no. Because if you have a situation where two roads intersect, maybe you can cross both in a single step, but I'm not sure. Or maybe each road that separates home and university adds a step.\n\nLet me think about this. Suppose home and university are on opposite sides of k different roads. Then, to get from home to university, you need to cross each of those roads exactly once. But how do you traverse them?\n\nEach time you cross a road, you move into a new region. So the minimal steps would be the number of such roads that lie between the two points. Because each crossing is a step, and you can't skip any of them.\n\nWait, but that depends on whether the regions are arranged in a way that allows you to cross multiple roads in a single step. But according to the problem statement, you can move between two adjacent blocks in one step. So, two blocks are adjacent if their common border is non-zero length. That means that if two regions are separated by a single road, then moving from one to the other requires crossing that road, which is one step.\n\nBut if two regions are separated by more than one road, then you'd have to cross each road one by one. Because each crossing is a step, and each step moves you across a single road.\n\nWait, but the way the roads are arranged could influence this. For example, imagine three roads forming a triangle. The home is on one side of each road, and the university is on the other side. So to get from home to university, you have to cross each of the three roads, right? So the minimal steps would be three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to cross two roads in two steps, but perhaps that's not possible because the regions are divided such that you can only cross one road per step.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the home and the university. That is, the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each such line must be crossed exactly once, and each crossing is a step. So the minimal steps are the count of lines where home and university are on different sides.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each of the n roads, determine if home and university are on the same side or different sides.\n2. Count the number of roads where they are on different sides. That's the answer.\n\nWait, but how do we determine if two points are on the same or different sides of a line?\n\nThe line equation is a*i + b*j + c = 0. For a point (x, y), plugging into the equation gives a value s = a*x + b*y + c. If s is zero, the point is on the line, but the problem states that home and university are not on any road, so we don't have to worry about that.\n\nSo for each road, compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c and s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If s1 and s2 have the same sign, then the points are on the same side. If they have different signs, they are on different",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. The town is divided by multiple lines, and each step allows moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each line in Crazy Town divides the plane into two regions. The key insight is that if two points (home and university) are on opposite sides of a line, then crossing that line is necessary to move between their respective regions. Each such crossing represents a step.\n2. **Determine Sides of Lines**: For each line, compute the value of the line equation at the coordinates of the home and university. If these values have opposite signs, it means the points are on opposite sides of the line.\n3. **Count Crossings**: The minimum number of steps required is equal to the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    x1, y1 = int(input[idx]), int(input[idx+1])\n    idx +=2\n    x2, y2 = int(input[idx]), int(input[idx+1])\n    idx +=2\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx +=1\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        b = int(input[idx+1])\n        c = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx +=3\n        s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if (s1 > 0 and s2 < 0) or (s1 < 0 and s2 > 0):\n            count +=1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n- **Line Evaluation**: For each road (line), the equation is evaluated at the home and university coordinates. The result of this evaluation determines which side of the line each point is on.\n- **Counting Steps**: Each line where the home and university are on opposite sides contributes to one step. The total count of such lines gives the minimum number of steps required to reach the university from the home.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their evaluations, ensuring an optimal solution.",
