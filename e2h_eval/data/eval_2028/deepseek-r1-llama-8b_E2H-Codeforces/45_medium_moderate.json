There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a tennis tournament where players are eliminated in each game, and the tournament grid isn't fixed yet. But there's a specific rule: two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. My task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in.\n\nHmm, right. So the winner needs to play as many games as possible, but each time he plays, the opponent must have a similar number of prior games. Let's think about how the tournament can be structured to maximize this.\n\nLet's start with small examples. For n=2, there's only one game. So the answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. Like, first he plays someone, then plays another. Because after the first game, he has 1 game, and the next opponent also has 0 or 1 games. Wait, no. Wait, the second opponent could have played a game that the winner didn't, but how?\n\nWait, maybe the key is to model how the winner's path looks. Each game the winner plays, he must have beaten someone, and each such opponent had a certain number of games themselves before facing the winner.\n\nI think the maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by building a binary-like structure, but considering the constraints on the opponents' previous games.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a Fibonacci sequence. Because each step depends on the sum of previous possibilities.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. Suppose f(k) is the maximum number of games a winner can play when starting with k players. How does f(k) relate to smaller values?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible number of players, what's the maximum depth of games the winner can have?\n\nWait, let's consider that for the winner to play m games, he must have m opponents, each of whom must have played either m-1 or m-2 games before facing him. Because the difference in their games can't be more than one.\n\nSo, for example, in the first game, the opponent has 0 games. Then, for the second game, the opponent must have either 1 or 0 games. Wait, but since the winner has already played one game, the opponent can have either 0 (if he just won his first game) or 1 (but that would mean the opponent already played once). Hmm, but in that case, the opponent could have come from a different branch.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum number of games is similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Because each new opponent requires that the number of games they have played is either equal or one less than the winner's current count.\n\nLet me think about the sample input:\n\nFor n=10, the output is 4. So the winner played 4 games. How is that possible?\n\nThe way this happens is probably by structuring the tournament such that each game the winner plays allows for a certain number of other players to be used up, each contributing to allowing deeper games.\n\nPerhaps the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest m such that the sum of the first m terms of a certain sequence is less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, wait. Let's model this. Let’s say that the number of players required to achieve m games is the sum of the Fibonacci sequence up to m+2 or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's similar to the Fibonacci numbers, where each step adds the two previous steps. Let me try to build some examples.\n\nLet’s compute for small m:\n\nm=1: To have one game, you need 2 players. So for n>=2, it's possible.\n\nm=2: How many players are needed? The winner plays two games. Let's see:\n\nIn the first game, the winner plays someone (game 1). Then, in the second game, he plays someone else. But that someone else must have played either 1 or 0 games before. Wait, if he played 0, that means that player only came to the second game because he won their first game. So, for the second game, the opponent could have been part of a subtree where another player was eliminated.\n\nWait, maybe for m=2, the minimal number of players is 3. Because:\n\n- The winner plays two games. In the first, he plays against player A. Then, he plays against player B. Player B must have played either 1 or 0 games. If B has 0, then he's a direct participant. But then, how did A get eliminated? Because in the first game, the winner beat A, but then A didn't play any more games. So, the structure is: winner plays A, then plays B. So total players is 3.\n\nBut wait, that's 3 players, which matches the sample input where n=3 gives output 2.\n\nThen, for m=3: How many players are needed?\n\nWe need the winner to play three games.\n\nEach opponent in each game must have played either the same or one less number of games.\n\nSo, for the third game, the opponent must have played either 2 or 1 games.\n\nIf the opponent has played 2 games, that means he has already won two games. How is that possible? Because in each of those two games, he must have faced someone who has played either 1 or 0 games.\n\nSo, for the third game, the opponent must have played two games. So, for that, we need two other players who each played in their own subtrees.\n\nWait, let's break it down:\n\nGame 1: Winner plays X. X had 0 games before.\n\nGame 2: Winner plays Y. Y had 0 or 1 games before. Let's say Y had 0.\n\nGame 3: Winner plays Z. Z must have played 2 or 1 games before.\n\nIf Z played 2 games, then that means Z had two wins. So, Z must have played two games before facing the winner. So, in those two games, Z must have beaten two opponents, each of whom played 0 or 1 games.\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\nWinner → Z\n\nZ → W1 → Winner\nZ → W2 → ?\n\nWait, not exactly. Wait, Z's two games: in the first, he plays W1, who had 0 games, then in the second, he plays W2, who had 0 games. So, now Z has two wins and is ready to play the final against the winner.\n\nSo, in total, the players are:\n\nWinner, X (played once), Y (played once), W1 (played once), W2 (played once).\n\nThat's 5 players. So for m=3, you need at least 5 players.\n\nWait, but wait: is there a way to have m=3 with fewer players? Or is that the minimal?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of players for m games is the (m+2)-th Fibonacci number.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nm=1: 2 players → Fib(3)=2.\n\nm=2: 3 players → Fib(4)=3.\n\nm=3: 5 players → Fib(5)=5.\n\nm=4: Let's compute. For m=4, the opponent in the fourth game must have played 3 or 2 games.\n\nIf the opponent played 3 games, then that means that opponent had to have beaten three players, each requiring their own chains.\n\nSo, for the fourth game:\n\nOpponent A has played 3 games. So, opponent A must have beaten three players, each of whom had 0, 0, and 1 games respectively.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe the minimal number of players required for m games is Fib(m+2), and the maximum m is the largest such that Fib(m+2) ≤ n.\n\nSo for example, for n=10:\n\nFib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13.\n\nWait, wait, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13.\n\nSo for m=4, the minimal number is Fib(6) = 8. Since 8 <=10, m=4 is possible.\n\nIndeed, the sample input for n=10 gives output 4.\n\nAnother sample is n=4. The minimal for m=2 is 3, but n=4 is more than 3, but less than 5. So for m=3, we need 5 players, which is more than 4. So the maximum m is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is to find the largest m such that Fib(m+2) ≤n.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain point, until Fib(m+2) exceeds 1018 (since n can be up to 1018).\n\n2. For each n, find the maximum m where Fib(m+2) ≤n.\n\n3. Return m as the answer.\n\nNow, let's test this logic with some examples.\n\nFor n=2: Fib(3)=2 → m=1.\n\nn=3: Fib(4)=3 → m=2.\n\nn=4: Fib(4)=3 ≤4, Fib(5)=5>4 → m=2.\n\nn=5: Fib(5)=5 → m=3.\n\nn=6: Fib(5)=5 ≤6, Fib(6)=8>6 → m=3.\n\nn=7: same as above.\n\nn=8: Fib(6)=8 → m=4.\n\nYes, that seems to fit.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the point where the value exceeds 1018.\n\n- For each given n, find the largest m where Fib(m+2) ≤n.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to generating this sequence and finding the maximum m.\n\nHow do I generate the sequence? Well, let's start with Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, then each next term is the sum of the two previous.\n\nWait, wait. Wait Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, etc. So for m=1, Fib(3)=2 is the minimal number of players.\n\nSo for m=1, minimal players is 2.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nCompute Fib numbers until it's beyond n.\n\nFor each test case, find the largest m where Fib(m+2) ≤n.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nGenerate Fib sequence up to 1018.\n\nRead n.\n\nInitialize m=0.\n\nIterate through the Fib sequence, checking if Fib[m+2] <=n.\n\nOnce the Fib[m+2] exceeds n, stop and return m.\n\nWait, but the initial Fib indices may vary. Let me re-examine:\n\nm=1 → Fib(3)=2.\n\nm=2 → Fib(4)=3.\n\nm=3 → Fib(5)=5.\n\nSo the Fib sequence starts at Fib[1]=1, Fib[2]=1, Fib[3]=2, Fib[4]=3, Fib[5]=5, etc.\n\nSo the code can be:\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next > 1018*2: # Just to be safe, but 1018 is the max n.\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next)\n\nThen, for each n, iterate through fib, starting from index 3 (since Fib(3)=2) and see the maximum m where Fib[m+2] ≤n.\n\nWait, no. Because for m, Fib(m+2) is the minimal players needed.\n\nSo for example, for Fib[3] =2 → m=1.\n\nFib[4]=3 → m=2.\n\nFib[5]=5 → m=3.\n\nSo to find m, for each Fib[i], if Fib[i] <=n, then m=i-2.\n\nWait, yes. Because i is the position in the Fib array, which starts at 1.\n\nSo for each i, if Fib[i] <=n, then m =i-2.\n\nWe need to find the maximum i where Fib[i] <=n, then m =i-2.\n\nWait, but let's test:\n\nn=2: Fib[3]=2 → i=3 → m=3-2=1.\n\nn=3: Fib[4]=3 → m=4-2=2.\n\nn=5: Fib[5]=5 → m=5-2=3.\n\nn=8: Fib[6]=8 → m=6-2=4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Precompute Fib sequence starting from 1,1,2,3,5,8, etc.\n\n- For each n, find the largest i where Fib[i] <=n.\n\n- Then m =i-2.\n\nBut wait, what about n=1? Oh, but according to the problem statement, n is at least 2.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nCompute the Fib sequence until Fib[i] exceeds n.\n\nThen, for each Fib[i], check if it's <=n.\n\nKeep track of the maximum i where Fib[i] <=n.\n\nThen, m =i-2.\n\nBut wait, for n=2, the maximum i is 3, so m=1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: n=4.\n\nThe Fib sequence up to i=4 is 3, which is <=4.\n\ni=5 is 5>4.\n\nSo maximum i is 4, m=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code can be:\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute Fib list.\n\nLoop through Fib to find the largest i where Fib[i] <=n.\n\nm =i-2.\n\nOutput m.\n\nSo let's write code accordingly.\n\nNow, let's handle the edge cases.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible n? 1018.\n\nCompute Fib up to when Fib[i] <=1018.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\nFib(1)=1\n\nFib(2)=1\n\nFib(3)=2\n\nFib(4)=3\n\nFib(5)=5\n\nFib(6)=8\n\nFib(7)=13\n\nFib(8)=21\n\nFib(9)=34\n\nFib(10)=55\n\nFib(11)=89\n\nFib(12)=144\n\nFib(13)=233\n\nFib(14)=377\n\nFib(15)=610\n\nFib(16)=987\n\nFib(17)=1597\n\nWait, 1597 is greater than 1018, so the last Fib[i] <=1018 is 987, which is Fib(16).\n\nSo for n=1018, the maximum i is 16, so m=14.\n\nWait, no: i=16, m=16-2=14.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should correctly handle all n up to 1018.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute the Fib list.\n\nFind the largest i where Fib[i] <=n.\n\nm =i-2.\n\nPrint m.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nRead n from stdin.\n\nCompute the Fib list.\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_val > n * 2:  # Since for n=1018, we need to include up to Fib(16)=987, which is less than 1018.\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_val)\n\n# Now find the largest i where fib[i] <=n.\n\nmax_i = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(fib)):\n\n    if fib[i] > n:\n\n        break\n\n    max_i = i\n\nm = max_i - 2\n\nprint(m)\n\nWait, let's test this code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input: ['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\nWait, no, the input is a single integer, but the sample shows four outputs, but that's perhaps a typo. Wait, the problem says, \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and then the input is a single integer n.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\nSo the input is a single integer.\n\nBut in the sample, it's given as ['2', '3', '4', '10'], which is likely a typo.\n\nBut in the actual code, we'll read n as an integer.\n\nSo, for n=2, the code should output 1.\n\nTesting the code:\n\nn=2.\n\nfib starts as [1,1].\n\nnext_val =2 → add to fib.\n\nloop continues:\n\nnext_val=1+2=3 → added.\n\nnext_val=2+3=5, which is >2*2=4? No, 5>4.\n\nSo fib becomes [1,1,2,3].\n\nNow, loop through fib:\n\nfib[0]=1<=2 → yes.\n\nfib[1]=1<=2 → yes.\n\nfib[2]=2<=2 → yes.\n\nfib[3]=3>2 → break.\n\nmax_i=2.\n\nm=2-2=0? Wait, no. Wait, wait, no.\n\nWait, the code is wrong here. Because when n=2, the fib list after the loop is [1,1,2,3]. So during the loop, for i in 0,1,2,3:\n\nfib[0]=1 <=2 → yes, max_i=0.\n\nfib[1]=1 → max_i=1.\n\nfib[2]=2 → max_i=2.\n\nfib[3]=3>2 → break.\n\nSo max_i is 2.\n\nm=2-2=0. But the correct answer is 1.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So the code is incorrect.\n\nAh, I see! The issue is that the Fib list includes Fib[0]=1, Fib[1]=1, Fib[2]=2, etc. So for n=2, the maximum i is 2, because Fib[2] is 2 which is <=2.\n\nSo m=2-2=0, which is wrong.\n\nSo the code is wrong.\n\nWhat's wrong with the logic?\n\nAh, because the Fib list is built incorrectly. Let's see:\n\nInitially, fib = [1,1]. That's Fib[0]=1, Fib[1]=1.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial setup is wrong. Because Fib(1) is 1, Fib(2) is 1, Fib(3)=2, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the Fib list should start as Fib[1]=1, Fib[2]=1, Fib[3]=2, Fib[4]=3, etc.\n\nSo the way the Fib list is generated is wrong.\n\nSo in the code, the initial fib is [1,1], which represents Fib[1]=1 and Fib[2]=1.\n\nThen, each next_val is the sum of the last two elements.\n\nSo for n=2, the loop appends 2, making fib = [1,1,2].\n\nThen, the next_val is 3, which is >2, so loop stops.\n\nSo the Fib list is [1,1,2].\n\nNow, the loop to find max_i:\n\ni=0: fib[0]=1<=2 → max_i=0.\n\ni=1: fib[1]=1<=2 → max_i=1.\n\ni=2: fib[2]=2<=2 → max_i=2.\n\nSo for n=2, max_i=2.\n\nm=2-2=0. Which is wrong.\n\nBut the correct answer is m=1.\n\nWait, why? Because Fib[3]=2. So for m=1, Fib[3]=2 is <=n=2.\n\nSo the code is missing Fib[3]=2.\n\nWait, because in the code, the while loop condition is adding next_val only if it's <=n*2. So for n=2, n*2=4. 3 is added because 3<=4.\n\nSo Fib becomes [1,1,2,3].\n\nThen, when checking, for i=3, Fib[3]=3>2 → no.\n\nSo the maximum i is 2.\n\nWhich is wrong, because Fib[3]=2 is equal to n=2.\n\nWait, no. Fib[3]=2 is 2, which is equal to n=2.\n\nSo the code is wrong because it's not including Fib[3] in the list.\n\nWait, in the code, the while loop is adding next_val only if it's <=n*2. So for n=2, n*2=4.\n\nSo next_val after 2 is 3, which is <=4 → added.\n\nSo the Fib list for n=2 is [1,1,2,3].\n\nThen, the loop for i in range(len(fib)):\n\ni=0: 1 <=2 → max_i=0.\n\ni=1:1 → max_i=1.\n\ni=2:2 → max_i=2.\n\ni=3:3>2 → break.\n\nSo max_i=2.\n\nThus, m=0, which is wrong.\n\nBut the correct m is 1, because Fib[3]=2 <=2.\n\nSo the code is incorrect.\n\nWhat's the issue here?\n\nThe code is considering Fib[3]=3 as part of the list, but Fib[3] is 2, right? Wait no, Fib[3] is 2.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, initial fib is [1,1].\n\nThen:\n\nnext_val =1+1=2 → add to fib → [1,1,2].\n\nnext_val=1+2=3 → add to fib → [1,1,2,3].\n\nnext_val=2+3=5 → 5>2*2=4 → loop breaks.\n\nSo Fib list is [1,1,2,3].\n\nNow, for n=2, the maximum Fib[i] is 2, which is at i=2.\n\nSo max_i is 2, m=0.\n\nBut for n=2, the correct m is 1, because Fib[3] is 2.\n\nWait, no, Fib[3] is 2?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the Fib indexes.\n\nWait, maybe the Fib list is built as Fib[0]=1, Fib[1]=1, Fib[2]=2, Fib[3]=3, Fib[4]=5, etc.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8.\n\nSo for n=2, the maximum i where Fib[i] <=2 is 3, because Fib[3]=2.\n\nSo the code is not including Fib[3]=2 in the list.\n\nBecause the initial Fib list is [1,1], then next is 2 → [1,1,2], next is 3 → [1,1,2,3], which is Fib[3]=3. So for n=2, the code is not considering Fib[3]=2.\n\nSo the initial setup is wrong.\n\nAh! So the problem is that the Fib list is being built starting from Fib[0]=1, Fib[1]=1, Fib[2]=2, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Because the standard Fibonacci sequence starts as Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, etc. But in our case, Fib starts with 1,1,2,3,5, etc.\n\nSo perhaps the initial Fib list is [1,1], and each next term is the sum of the previous two.\n\nSo the Fib list is:\n\nindex 0: 1 (Fib(1))\n\nindex 1: 1 (Fib(2))\n\nindex 2: 2 (Fib(3))\n\nindex 3: 3 (Fib(4))\n\nindex 4:5 (Fib(5))\n\nand so on.\n\nSo for n=2, Fib(3)=2 is present in the list.\n\nBut in the code, the Fib list is built as [1,1,2,3,...]. So for n=2, the Fib list includes 2, which is Fib(3).\n\nSo in the code, for i=2, Fib[i]=2.\n\nSo for n=2, max_i=2.\n\nm=2-2=0.\n\nBut the correct m is 1, because Fib(3)=2 is the minimal number of players for m=1.\n\nWait, wait. Because m=1 corresponds to Fib(3)=2.\n\nSo for n=2, the maximum m is 1.\n\nBut according to the code, m=0, which is incorrect.\n\nSo the problem is that the code is treating Fib[2] as 2, which is Fib(3), and thus assigning m=0, which is wrong.\n\nSo the code's logic is flawed.\n\nWhat's the mistake?\n\nAh, the code is setting m = i-2, where i is the index in the Fib list.\n\nBut the Fib list starts with Fib[0]=1, Fib[1]=1, Fib[2]=2, Fib[3]=3, etc.\n\nSo for Fib[2]=2, i=2, m=0.\n\nBut for m=1, Fib(3)=2 is needed.\n\nSo the mapping between i and m is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the Fib list should represent Fib[1]=1, Fib[2]=1, Fib[3]=2, etc. So that i=3 corresponds to Fib(3)=2.\n\nBut in the code, the Fib list is [1,1,2,3,...], which is Fib(1), Fib(2), Fib(3), Fib(4), etc.\n\nSo for i=2, Fib[i] is 2, which is Fib(3).\n\nSo for m=1, we need Fib(3)=2.\n\nSo the correct way is, for each Fib[i], if Fib[i] <=n, then m = i-2.\n\nBecause Fib[3] is 2, i=3, m=1.\n\nBut in the code, when n=2, the Fib list is [1,1,2,3], and during the loop, for i=2, Fib[i]=2, which is Fib(3)=2.\n\nSo the code considers i=2, which is Fib(3)=2.\n\nSo m=2-2=0, which is wrong.\n\nSo the problem is that the code is using i as the index in the Fib list, but the Fib list starts with Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, etc.\n\nSo for i=2, Fib[i]=2, which is Fib(3)=2, which is the minimal number of players for m=1.\n\nThus, the code should set m = i-2, but wait, i is 2, which gives m=0.\n\nNo, that's wrong.\n\nSo perhaps the code is not correctly mapping i to m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Fib list should start differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial Fib list should be [2,3,5,8,...], but that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Fib list should represent the minimal number of players for each m.\n\nLike, for m=1, minimal is 2.\n\nm=2:3.\n\nm=3:5.\n\netc.\n\nSo the Fib list can be built as follows:\n\nfib = [2, 3, 5, 8, ...]\n\nThen, for each m, the minimal number is fib[m].\n\nSo for n=2, the maximum m is 1 because 2 >=2.\n\nn=3: m=2 because 3>=3.\n\nn=4: m=2 because 5>4.\n\nSo the code can precompute this Fib list.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nWell, the minimal number of players for m games is Fib(m+2), as earlier thought.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct Fib list is the minimal number of players for each m.\n\nSo m=1 → 2.\n\nm=2 →3.\n\nm=3 →5.\n\nm=4→8.\n\nSo the Fib list for the minimal players is [2,3,5,8,13,21,...].\n\nSo for a given n, find the maximum m where the minimal number (Fib[m]) <=n.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfib_min = [2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597]\n\nBut wait, for m=1, it's 2.\n\nFor m=14, it's 1597.\n\nSo, for n=1018, the maximum m is 14, since 1597>1018, but 987<=1018.\n\nSo, for each n, find the largest m where Fib_min[m] <=n.\n\nSo, in code, the Fib_min list can be precomputed up to m=20, which covers n=1018.\n\nSo the code can be:\n\nprecompute Fib_min as [2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597].\n\nWait, but 1597 is larger than 1018, so for n=1018, the maximum m is 14, as 987<=1018<1597.\n\nSo the code can be:\n\nread n.\n\nfor m in range(len(Fib_min)):\n\n    if Fib_min[m] <=n:\n\n        possible_m = m\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nso the maximum m is the highest possible where Fib_min[m] <=n.\n\nSo for example:\n\nn=2: Fib_min[0]=2<=2 → possible_m=0.\n\nWait, but Fib_min is zero-based, but m starts from 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the Fib_min list is 1-based, with m=1 corresponding to 2, m=2 to 3, etc.\n\nSo the list is:\n\nm | Fib_min[m]\n\n1 | 2\n\n2 |3\n\n3|5\n\n4|8\n\netc.\n\nSo in code, the list can be defined as:\n\nfib_min = [2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597]\n\nThen, for each n, find the largest m such that fib_min[m] <=n.\n\nSo for n=2:\n\nCheck m=1: 2<=2 → yes.\n\nm=2:3>2 → no.\n\nSo maximum m=1.\n\nFor n=3:\n\nm=1: yes.\n\nm=2: yes.\n\nm=3:5>3 → no.\n\nSo maximum m=2.\n\nSo the code can be:\n\nfib_min = [2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597]\n\nn = int(input())\n\nm =0\n\nfor i in range(len(fib_min)):\n\n    if fib_min[i] >n:\n\n        break\n\n    m =i\n\nprint(m)\n\nTesting this for n=2:\n\nfib_min[0]=2<=2 → m=0.\n\nWait, but m should be 1.\n\nWait, no. Because in the list, the first element is 2, which is for m=1.\n\nWait, perhaps the list is 1-based. So for i=0, it's m=1.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nfor i in range(len(fib_min)):\n\n    if fib_min[i] >n:\n\n        break\n\n    m =i+1\n\nBecause i starts at 0, which is m=1.\n\nSo for n=2, i=0: 2<=2 → m=1.\n\ni=1:3>2 → break.\n\nThus, m=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3:\n\ni=0:2<=3 → m=1.\n\ni=1:3<=3 → m=2.\n\ni=2:5>3 → break.\n\nSo m=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nFor n=4:\n\ni=0:2<=4 → m=1.\n\ni=1:3<=4 → m=2.\n\ni=2:5>4 → break.\n\nm=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nn=5:\n\ni=0:2<=5 → m=1.\n\ni=1:3<=5 → m=2.\n\ni=2:5<=5 → m=3.\n\ni=3:8>5 → break.\n\nSo m=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nfib_min = [2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597]\n\nn = int(input())\n\nm =0\n\nfor i in range(len(fib_min)):\n\n    if fib_min[i] >n:\n\n        break\n\n    m = i+1\n\nprint(m)\n\nWait, but what about when n=1? The problem says n>=2, so no issue.\n\nTesting for n=987:\n\nIt will find i=13, as fib_min[13]=987, so m=14.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nFor n=1018:\n\nfib_min[13]=987 <=1018.\n\nfib_min[14]=1597>1018.\n\nSo m=14.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct now.\n\nThus, the solution is to precompute the list fib_min as [2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597], and for each n, find the largest i where fib_min[i] <=n, then output i+1.\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, for the list, the index i starts at 0, which is m=1.\n\nSo for each i in 0..len(fib_min)-1:\n\nif fib_min[i] <=n → m is i+1.\n\nElse, break.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo the final code is:\n\nfib_min = [2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597]\nn = int(input())\nm = 0\nfor i in range(len(fib_min)):\n    if fib_min[i] > n:\n        break\n    m = i + 1\nprint(m)\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given that each game is a knockout round and two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the problem can be modeled using Fibonacci numbers. Specifically, the minimal number of players required for the winner to play `m` games is given by the `(m+2)`-th Fibonacci number. This is because each subsequent game the winner plays requires an opponent who has either played the same number of games or one fewer than the winner.\n\n1. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: We precompute the Fibonacci sequence up to a point where the value exceeds the maximum possible number of players (1018). This sequence helps us determine the minimal number of players required for the winner to play `m` games.\n2. **Determine Maximum Games**: For a given number of players `n`, we find the largest `m` such that the minimal number of players required (given by the Fibonacci sequence) is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfib_min = [2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597]\nn = int(input())\nm = 0\nfor i in range(len(fib_min)):\n    if fib_min[i] > n:\n        break\n    m = i + 1\nprint(m)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The sequence `fib_min` is precomputed where each element at index `i` represents the minimal number of players required for the winner to play `i+1` games.\n2. **Finding Maximum Games**: For a given `n`, iterate through the precomputed Fibonacci sequence to find the largest `m` such that the corresponding Fibonacci number is less than or equal to `n`. The result is the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of games using precomputed values, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of 1018 players.",
