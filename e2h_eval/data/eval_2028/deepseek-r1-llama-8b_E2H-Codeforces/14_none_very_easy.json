He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

It initializes two variables: `count` to keep track of the number of trailing zeroes in the current factorial, and `n` to represent the current number being multiplied into the factorial.\n\nThe script then enters a loop where it increments `n` until it either reaches the target number of trailing zeroes or exceeds it. Inside the loop, it checks if the current number of trailing zeroes `count` equals the target `m`. If so, it adds the current number `n` to the result list.\n\nAfter the loop, the function returns the length of the result list (which represents the number of values of `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` zeroes) and the result list itself as a string.\n\nIn the main part of the script, it reads the target number `m` from standard input, calls the `solve` function with `m` as input, and prints the returned values.",
