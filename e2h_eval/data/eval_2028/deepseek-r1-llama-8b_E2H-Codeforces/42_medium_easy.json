    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Копирование файлов I\", which translates to something like \"File Copying I\". Hmm, the description says that we're dealing with two progress bars when copying files.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step. We have n files to copy in a specific order. Each file has a certain size. As we copy each byte, two progress bars update: one shows the percentage of the current file being copied, and the other shows the overall percentage across all files.\n\nThe goal is to find all integers from 0 to 100 (inclusive) that are shown on both progress bars at the same time during the copying process. Then, we need to output these numbers in increasing order.\n\nSo, the input gives us n followed by the list of file sizes. The output is the list of such percentages as described.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about the progress bars. After each byte is copied, both progress bars update. For each file i, after x bytes are copied, the current file's progress is floor( (100 * x) / a_i ). The global progress is floor( (100 * total_copied) / total_size ), where total_copied is the sum of all bytes copied so far.\n\nWe need to find all times (i.e., after each byte is copied) where both progress bars equal the same percentage.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Because for each file, we can iterate through each byte, compute the percentages, and check if they match any of the required numbers.\n\nBut considering that each file can be up to 1000 bytes, and n is up to 100, the total number of steps is up to 1e5, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but wait: For each file, we can represent the progress as x increases from 0 to a_i, in steps of 1. So for each step, we can compute the current progress for that file, and also the cumulative progress across all files up to that point.\n\nThen, for each step, we can compute both percentages and see if they match any required value.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the progress bars change after each byte. So for each x in 0..a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n, but actually, x represents the cumulative bytes up to that point. Wait, no—x is per-file, but the global is the sum.\n\nWait, perhaps we should model the process as:\n\n- For each file i, in order, we process each byte from 1 to a_i.\n\n- After processing each byte x (from 1 to a_i), we calculate the current progress for the current file (file i) as (x / a_i) * 100, floored. Let's call this p_current.\n\n- Also, after processing x bytes of file i, the total bytes copied so far is the sum of all previous a_j's plus x. Let's call this total_copied. The global progress is (total_copied / total_size) * 100, floored. Call this p_global.\n\n- Now, for each such step, we check if p_current equals p_global. If yes, then that percentage is a candidate to include in the result.\n\nWait, but for each step, which is each individual byte, we need to check whether p_current and p_global are equal. But considering that each byte is processed one by one, and after each, both progress bars update, so each byte corresponds to a possible state.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the total size S = sum(a_i).\n\n2. For each file i from 1 to n:\n   a. For x from 1 to a_i (since after 0 bytes, it's not yet started, but wait, the initial state is 0, but the first byte is x=1).\n   b. Compute current_file_progress = floor( (100 * x) / a_i )\n   c. Compute total_copied_so_far = sum of a_1 to a_{i-1} + x.\n      Then, global_progress = floor( (100 * total_copied_so_far) / S )\n   d. Check if current_file_progress == global_progress. If yes, add this value to a set of possible results.\n\n3. After processing all files and all bytes, collect all unique values from 0 to 100 that were found in the set, sort them in ascending order, and output.\n\nWait, but wait: the initial state before any copying is 0 for both progress bars. That's included. So for the case where all files are zero? Well, according to the problem statement, a_i >=1, so that's not a case.\n\nWait, the problem says a_i is >=1, so the initial state is 0, which is included.\n\nBut according to the note, in the first test case, the output includes 0. So we need to include that.\n\nSo, for each step, including the initial 0, we need to consider the state.\n\nWait, but in the initial state, no bytes have been copied. So the progress is 0 for both. So 0 is always included.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says 'all such integers from 0 to 100 inclusive that exist in the set of moments when both progress bars show the same value.' So 0 is definitely in the output because it's the starting point.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the first output line starts with 0, so yeah.\n\nSo our approach is to simulate each step, including the initial 0, and for each step, compute the two progress bars and see if they are equal. Then collect all such values.\n\nWait, but how to model the initial 0? Because before any copying, the progress is 0. So the initial state is included.\n\nSo, perhaps, the steps are:\n\n- Before any copying, both progress bars are 0. So 0 is added.\n\n- Then, for each file, and for each x from 1 to a_i, compute the current progress, and the global progress, and check.\n\nWait, but that may not capture all the steps correctly. For example, after the first file's first byte, the progress is x=1, but the global is 1/S * 100.\n\nWait, but maybe the correct way is to model the process as a series of states, each representing the cumulative bytes copied so far, and for each possible cumulative, compute the progress bars.\n\nWait, but the progress can change between each byte. So for example, after the first byte, the current file's progress is 100*1/a_i, but the global is 100*(sum_so_far)/S.\n\nBut for each step, the progress is based on the exact number of bytes copied so far.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to track all possible states where the two progress bars are equal, regardless of the order or which file is being processed.\n\nWait, but for each x in 0 to total_bytes, x is the number of bytes copied so far. For each x, we can compute the current progress for each file and the global progress.\n\nWait, no. Because each file's progress depends on how much of it has been copied so far. So for a given x, the progress for file i is floor(100 * (sum of a_1 to a_{i-1} + x_i) / a_i), where x_i is the number of bytes copied from file i so far.\n\nWait, but this complicates things because x is the total bytes copied so far, and for each file, the x_i is min(x, a_i). So for each x, the progress for each file i is floor(100 * (x_i) / a_i), where x_i is min(x, a_i).\n\nSo the progress bars are determined by x, the total bytes copied.\n\nWait, but for each x, the global progress is floor(100 * x / S). And for each file i, the current progress is floor(100 * (min(x, a_i)) / a_i). So for a given x, we can compute for all files i their current progress, and the global progress.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the moment when both progress bars (the current file's and the global) are equal. So, for each x, we can compute the current file's progress (assuming it's the last file being processed) and the global progress.\n\nWait, no. Because the progress bars are updated after each byte. So the current file's progress is for the file that's currently being copied. So the sequence is: process file 1, then file 2, etc. So for each x, it's part of a single file's processing.\n\nSo, the initial state is x=0, both progress bars are 0.\n\nThen, for each file i, we process each byte x from 1 to a_i:\n\n- When processing the x-th byte of file i, the current progress for file i is (100 * x) // a_i.\n\n- The total bytes copied so far is the sum of all a_j for j < i, plus x.\n\n- So the global progress is (100 * (sum_so_far)) // S.\n\n- So, for each such x, we can check if (current_file_progress == global_progress). If yes, add this value to the result.\n\nAdditionally, after all files are processed, the global progress is 100%, but the current file's progress would have stopped at 100% once it's fully processed.\n\nWait, but after the last byte of the last file, the global progress is 100%, and the current file's progress is 100%. So 100% is included.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute S = sum(a_i).\n\n2. Initialize a set to store the valid percentages.\n\n3. Add 0 to the set.\n\n4. For each i from 0 to n-1 (each file):\n\n   a. Get a_i.\n\n   b. Compute the prefix sum up to i-1: sum_so_far_before = sum(a_0 to a_{i-1}).\n\n   c. For x in 1 to a_i:\n\n      i. current_file_progress = (100 * x) // a_i\n\n      ii. total_copied = sum_so_far_before + x\n\n      iii. global_progress = (100 * total_copied) // S\n\n      iv. if current_file_progress == global_progress, add to the set.\n\n5. After all steps, collect all the numbers from 0 to 100 that are in the set, sorted.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n6\n\nSo n=1, a=[6].\n\nWe process each x from 1 to 6.\n\nFor each x:\n\ncurrent_file_progress = (100*x)//6\n\nglobal_progress = (100*(x))//6, since S=6.\n\nSo for each x, the two are equal, so all x will contribute.\n\nThus, the percentages are 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100.\n\nWhich matches the first output line.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nSecond input:\n\n2\n100 500\n\nTotal S=600.\n\nProcess file 1 (100 bytes):\n\nx runs from 1 to 100.\n\nEach x, current_file_progress is (100x)/100 = x.\n\nglobal_progress is (100x)/600 = x/6.\n\nSo when does x = x/6? Only when x=0. Which is already in the set.\n\nWait, but for x=0, it's included. But for x>0, it's only when x is 0, which is the initial state.\n\nThen, process file 2 (500 bytes):\n\nx runs from 1 to 500.\n\nAt each x:\n\ncurrent_file_progress is (100x)/500 = 20x.\n\nglobal_progress is (100*(sum_so_far_before +x )) / 600.\n\nSum_so_far_before is 100.\n\nSo global is (100*(100 +x )) / 600.\n\nSo we need 20x = (100+ x)*100/(600)\n\nWait, 20x = (100 +x)*100/(600)\n\nMultiply both sides by 600:\n\n12000x = (100 + x)*100\n\n12000x = 10000 + 100x\n\n12000x - 100x = 10000\n\n11000x = 10000 → x ≈ 0.909, which isn't an integer. So for x=0, it's included, but for x>=1, no.\n\nWait, but then why in the sample output, the second line has 0, 95, 96, 97,98,99,100.\n\nHmm. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read.\n\nAh! Oh wait, I think I made a mistake. The current_file_progress is based on the file being processed, not the global. So for each step, the current_file_progress is the progress of the current file being copied. The global_progress is the progress of all files.\n\nSo, for each x in the current file, the current_file_progress is (x / a_i) * 100, floored. The global_progress is (sum_so_far + x) / S * 100, floored.\n\nWait, but when processing file i, the sum_so_far is the sum of a_1 to a_{i-1}, plus x (the current x is the x-th byte in file i). So yes, the global progress is (sum_so_far + x) / S * 100, floored.\n\nWait, but for the second sample, let's compute:\n\nn=2, a=[100,500], S=600.\n\nProcess file 1:\n\nx from 1 to 100.\n\nAt x=1:\n\ncurrent_file_progress = (1 * 100) / 100 = 1.\n\nglobal_progress = (100 +1) /600 *100 = 101/600*100 = 16.833... → 16%.\n\nSo 1 !=16, so not added.\n\nx=2: current 2%, global (102)/600*100=17% → 2≠17.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWhen x=100:\n\ncurrent is 100%.\n\nglobal is (100 + 100)/600 *100 = 200/600*100=33.333 → 33%.\n\nSo 100% !=33%, so no.\n\nThen, process file 2:\n\nsum_so_far_before is 100.\n\nx runs from 1 to 500.\n\nAt x=1:\n\ncurrent_file_progress is (1/500)*100=0.\n\nglobal_progress is (100+1)/600 *100=101/6→ 16.833 →16%.\n\nSo 0 !=16.\n\nx=2: 0 vs (102)/600*100=17% → no.\n\n...\n\nx=95:\n\ncurrent_file: 95/500 *100=19%.\n\nglobal: (100+95)/600 *100=195/6 →32.5 →32%.\n\nNo match.\n\nx=96:\n\ncurrent: 96/500*100=19.2 →19%.\n\nglobal: 196/600*100=32.666 →32%.\n\nNo.\n\nx=97: 19.4 →19% vs 197/600*100=32.83 →32%.\n\nNo.\n\nx=98: 19.6 →19% vs 198/600*100=33%.\n\nSo 19% vs 33% → no.\n\nx=99: 19.8 →19% vs 199/600*100=33.166 →33% → no.\n\nx=100: 20% vs 200/600*100=33.333 →33% → no.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, the second line is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nHmm, so how does that happen?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating something.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample's second test case is n=2, a = [100, 500]. So the output is:\n\n0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100.\n\nWait, that's the second output line.\n\nSo the percentages are 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nHow do these values come about?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nAfter processing file 1, the progress bars are at 100% for the current file, and 100/600=16.666 →16% for the global.\n\nThen, processing file 2, each byte.\n\nSo for x=95 in file 2:\n\ncurrent_file progress is (95/500)*100=19%.\n\nglobal progress is (100+95)/600 *100= 195/6=32.5 →32%.\n\nNot matching.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the global progress is computed as (sum_so_far_before + x) / S *100, but sum_so_far_before is the sum of all a_j for j < i.\n\nWait, when processing file i, the sum_so_far_before is sum(a_1 ... a_{i-1}).\n\nThen, for x bytes in file i, the total is sum_so_far_before + x.\n\nSo for file 2, when x is 95:\n\nsum_so_far_before is 100, x=95. Total is 195.\n\n195/600 = 0.325 → 32.5% →32%.\n\nCurrent file progress is 95/500 *100 =19%.\n\nSo 19 vs 32 → no match.\n\nHmm. So why is 95 in the output?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding which file's progress is considered.\n\nWait, the current_file_progress is for the file being processed, but perhaps after some files have been processed, the next file's progress is zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the progress bars are displayed for the entire process, but each time a new file starts, its progress is zero until it's being processed.\n\nWait, no. Because the progress bars are updating after each byte. So for example, when processing file 2, after the first byte, the current progress is 1/500 *100=0.2% →0%. Global progress is 101/600*100=16.833 →16%. So 0 and 16. Not matching.\n\nWait, but perhaps after all bytes of the previous file are processed, the next file's progress starts from zero.\n\nWait, but during the processing of the next file, the current_file_progress is based on x (the bytes processed in that file), and the global is based on the total.\n\nSo, perhaps after the first file is done, the global is 100% for the first file, but when the second file starts, the global is 100% plus whatever is processed in the second file.\n\nWait, no. Because S is 600. So after processing the first file (100 bytes), the global is 100% (since 100/600 is 1/6, but multiplied by 100 is 16.666, which is 16%).\n\nWait, that's not right. 100 bytes out of 600 is 100/600=1/6=16.666...%.\n\nSo after the first file, the global is 16%.\n\nThen, when processing the second file, each byte adds to the total.\n\nSo for x=95 in the second file:\n\nsum_so_far_before is 100.\n\nx=95: sum_so_far_total = 195.\n\n195 /600 = 0.325 →32.5 →32%.\n\nSo global is 32%.\n\nThe current_file_progress is 95/500 *100=19%.\n\nNo match.\n\nHmm. So why is 95 present in the output? Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial state (0) is included, and after that, during the processing of the second file, some x makes the two progress bars equal.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLooking for when current_file_progress equals global_progress.\n\nSo for file 2, x ranges from 1 to 500.\n\nWe need to find x where (100 * x)/500 = floor( (100*(100 +x )) /600 )\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\n(100x)/500 = (100*(100 +x )) /600\n\nSimplify:\n\nx/5 = (100 +x)/6\n\nMultiply both sides by 30:\n\n6x = 5(100 +x )\n\n6x =500 +5x →x=500.\n\nSo when x=500, the current_file_progress is 100% and the global is 600/600=100%.\n\nSo at x=500, both are 100% → included.\n\nWhat about x=95:\n\n19% vs 32.5% →32% (floored).\n\nNo match.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, 95 is present. So there must be a case where during the processing of file 2, the progress bars meet.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm making a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute for each x in 1 to 500 and see when current_file_progress equals global_progress.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample explanation says that after the first file is processed, the global progress is 16.666..., then the second file is processed, and during that, at some points the two progress bars coincide.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that during the processing of the second file, the global progress can reach 95, 96, etc., and the current file's progress is also 95, etc.\n\nWait, let me compute for x=95 in file 2:\n\ncurrent_file_progress is 95/500 *100=19%.\n\nglobal is (100 +95)/600 *100 = 195/6 =32.5 →32%.\n\nNo match.\n\nx=195:\n\ncurrent_file: 195/500=39%.\n\nglobal: (100+195)/600 *100=295/6=49.166 →49%.\n\nNo match.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for when the current_file_progress is equal to the global.\n\nWe can model it as:\n\ncurrent_file_progress = (100 * x) // a_i\n\nglobal_progress = (100 * (sum_so_far_before +x )) // S\n\nSo for a_i=500, sum_so_far_before=100.\n\nWe can write:\n\n(100x)/500 = (100*(100+x))/600\n\nSimplify:\n\nx/5 = (100 +x)/6\n\nCross multiply: 6x =5(100 +x)\n\n6x=500 +5x →x=500.\n\nSo only when x=500.\n\nBut in the sample output, 95 is present. So perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing that the current_file_progress is not for the entire file, but only the current file being processed.\n\nWait, perhaps for the second file, when x=95, the current_file_progress is 19%, but the global is 32.5 →32%.\n\nNo match. So why is 95 in the output?\n\nWait, maybe the sample explanation refers to a different scenario.\n\nIn the note, it says: \"В первом тесте копируется всего один файл, поэтому оба прогресс-бара всегда показывают одинаковые значения.\"\n\nIn the second test case, the output is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nSo perhaps during the processing of the second file, the global progress reaches 95% when some x is processed, and the current file's progress is also 95% at that x.\n\nWait, let me compute for x= (95/100)*500 = 475 bytes in the second file.\n\nWait, 475 bytes into file 2:\n\ncurrent_file_progress is 475/500 *100=95%.\n\nglobal progress is (100 +475)/600 *100=575/6=95.833 →95%.\n\nSo 95% equals 95% → included.\n\nAh! So here's the mistake: earlier, I thought x was 95, but in reality, x is 475.\n\nSo, for file 2, x=475.\n\ncurrent_file_progress: (475 *100)/500=95.\n\nglobal: (100+475)*100/600 =575*100/600=57500/600=95.833 →95%.\n\nSo yes, both are 95% → included.\n\nSimilarly, for x=476:\n\ncurrent_file: 476/500*100=95.2 →95%.\n\nglobal: (100+476)/600*100=576/6*100=96%.\n\nSo 95 vs 96 → no.\n\nx=480: current 96%, global (580/600)*100=96.666 →96% → yes.\n\nWait, 580/600 is 0.966666… →96.666… →96%.\n\nSo 96% and 96% → included.\n\nSimilarly, x=484: current 96.8 →96%, global (584/600)*100=97.333 →97%.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, but wait:\n\nAt x=484:\n\ncurrent_file: 484/500 *100 =96.8 →96%.\n\nglobal: (100+484)=584 →584/600=0.973333… →97.333 →97%.\n\nSo 96 vs 97 → no.\n\nSo, x=95: no.\n\nx=475: yes.\n\nSo, the x is 475, which is within the 1 to 500 range.\n\nSo, the current_file_progress is 95% and global is 95% → included.\n\nSimilarly, x=480: 96% and 96% → included.\n\nWait, 480 is 480 bytes into file 2.\n\ncurrent_file: 480/500=96% →96.\n\nglobal: 580/600=96.666 →96 → yes.\n\nSo, 96 is included.\n\nSo, for each x in 475, 480, etc., we need to find when current_file and global progress are equal.\n\nSo, the algorithm needs to check for all x in 1..a_i, compute both progress bars, and see if they match.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\nFor each x in 0..sum_a (but in practice, x increments by 1 as each byte is processed), compute current_file_progress (based on which file is being processed at that x) and global_progress.\n\nWait, no. Because x is per-byte, but each byte is part of a specific file.\n\nSo, to model this correctly, we need to process each file, and for each x in 1..a_i, compute the current_file_progress and the global_progress, and check for equality.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead n, read a list.\n\nCompute sum_a = sum(a).\n\nInitialize a set with 0.\n\nFor each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n    sum_before = sum(a[0:i])\n\n    ai = a[i]\n\n    for x in 1 to ai:\n\n        current = (100 * x) // ai\n\n        total = sum_before + x\n\n        global = (100 * total) // sum_a\n\n        if current == global:\n\n            add to the set.\n\nSo, this loop will process each file, and for each x in that file, compute the progress.\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nSo, the code will:\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Read a list of integers.\n\n- Compute sum_a.\n\n- Initialize a set with 0.\n\n- For each i, 0-based index, process a[i] as the current file.\n\n- sum_before is sum(a[0..i-1]).\n\n- For x from 1 to a[i]:\n\n   current = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\n   total = sum_before + x\n\n   global = (100 * total) // sum_a\n\n   if current == global, add to the set.\n\nOnce all x are processed, collect all elements in the set from 0 to 100, sort, and print each in a separate line.\n\nNow, let's test this logic with the second sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\nsum_a = 600.\n\nProcessing i=0 (a=100):\n\nsum_before = 0.\n\nfor x in 1..100:\n\ncurrent = (100x)/100 =x.\n\ntotal =0 +x.\n\nglobal = (100x)/600 = (x*100)/600 = x/6.\n\nSo, for each x, check if x == x/6 → x=0, which is already in the set.\n\nSo, no new entries except 0.\n\nThen, i=1 (a=500):\n\nsum_before =100.\n\nfor x in 1..500:\n\ncurrent = (100x)/500 = 20x/100 = x/5.\n\nglobal = (100*(100 +x )) /600 = (100 +x)*100/600 = (100 +x)/6.\n\nWe need x/5 = (100 +x)/6.\n\nMultiply both sides by 30:\n\n6x =5(100 +x) →6x=500+5x →x=500.\n\nSo when x=500, current is 100%, global is 100%.\n\nSo, add 100 to the set.\n\nBut earlier, when x=475:\n\ncurrent is 95%, global is 95.833 →95.\n\nSo, 95 is added.\n\nSimilarly, x=480:\n\ncurrent is 96%, global is (580/600)*100=96.666 →96 → added.\n\nx=484:\n\ncurrent 96.8 →96.\n\nglobal: 584/600=0.973333 →97.333 →97%.\n\nSo 96 vs 97 → no.\n\nx=485:\n\ncurrent 97%, global (585/600)*100=97.5 →97%.\n\nSo, 97 is added.\n\nWait, 97.5 is 97 when floored.\n\nSo, current is 97, global is 97 → added.\n\nSo, in this case, 97 is added.\n\nSo, the set after processing all x's for i=1 will include 95,96,97,98,99,100, along with others.\n\nSo, the output for this case is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, the task is to implement this in Python.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the list a as integers.\n\nsum_a = sum(a).\n\nCreate a set, res_set = {0}\n\nFor each i in range(n):\n\n    ai = a[i]\n\n    sum_before = sum(a[0:i])\n\n    for x in 1 to ai:\n\n        current = (100 * x) // ai\n\n        total = sum_before + x\n\n        global_p = (100 * total) // sum_a\n\n        if current == global_p:\n\n            res_set.add(current)\n\nConvert res_set to a list, sort it, and print each number in a separate line.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n- n=1: all x in 1..a[0] will have current equal to global, so all 0, 1, 2,..., a[0] (if 100% is reached) are in the set.\n\nWait, but for a[0] =6, the x's are 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\ncurrent progresses are 1, 2, 3,4,5,6.\n\nglobal progresses are 1, 2,3,4,5,6 → same as current. So all x's are included, and 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,100.\n\nWait, no: 6 is 100%, but for x=6, current is 6, global is 6 → same.\n\nSo for a[0]=6, the percentages are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,100.\n\nBut wait, for x=6, current is 6 →6%, global is 6 →6% → same.\n\nSo the output is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,100.\n\nBut in the sample input 1, the output is 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nWait, why? Because for a[0]=6:\n\nx=1: 1% and 1% → added.\n\nx=2: 2% and 2% →added.\n\nx=3:3% and 3% →added.\n\nx=4:4% and4% →added.\n\nx=5:5% and5% →added.\n\nx=6:6% and6% →added.\n\nWait, but 6% is less than 100. So why in the sample, the output is 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample. Let me look back.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\nAh, so for the first case, n=1, a=6. The output is 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nWait, that suggests that the current_file_progress is 16, etc., but according to our code, when x=1, current is 1%, and global is 1% → included.\n\nSo why is 16 in the output?\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the code logic.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps the current_file_progress is for the entire process, not just the current file being processed.\n\nNo, that can't be. Because the current_file_progress is the progress of the current file being copied, and the global is the progress of all files.\n\nSo, in the first case, the current_file_progress and global are always the same.\n\nBecause for each x, the current_file is the only one, so the global is x/6*100, same as current.\n\nSo, the output should be all x from 0 to 6, plus 100% (when x=6, it's 6% → not 100%).\n\nWait, no, because x=6 is 6 bytes, which is 100% of the file.\n\nSo, for x=6, current is 6 →6%, global is 6 →6% → included.\n\nSo, the output should include 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,100.\n\nBut the sample output for the first case is 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nSo, clearly, my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, this suggests that I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWhat's the correct way to model the progress bars?\n\nPerhaps, the current_file_progress is the progress of all files processed so far, not just the current one.\n\nWait, no. The problem statement says:\n\n\"after copying each byte, the first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file, and the second shows the overall percentage.\"\n\nSo, during the processing of file i, the first progress bar is for file i only, showing how much of it has been copied so far. The second progress bar is for all files, showing the overall progress.\n\nSo, for the first file, each x contributes to both progress bars.\n\nThus, in the first case, the current_file_progress and global_progress are the same, because the current file is the only one.\n\nSo, for each x, current is x/6 *100, and global is x/6 *100 → same.\n\nThus, all x from 0 to 6 should be included, and 100 as well.\n\nBut sample output is 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nSo, this suggests that perhaps the current_file_progress is the progress of all files processed so far, not just the current one.\n\nWait, perhaps the progress bars are updated after each byte, and the first progress bar shows the progress of all files processed so far, not just the current one.\n\nThat would make more sense with the sample.\n\nSo, let's re-express the problem.\n\nAfter each byte is copied, the first progress bar shows the progress of all files processed so far, while the second shows the global progress.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says:\n\n\"first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file, and the second — overall.\"\n\nSo, no, that's not correct.\n\nBut perhaps I misread it.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\n\"the first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file, and the second — overall percentage.\"\n\nSo, no, the first is the current file, the second is global.\n\nSo, in the first test case, each x is 1, 2, 3,4,5,6.\n\ncurrent_file_progress is x/6*100.\n\nglobal is x/6*100.\n\nThus, all x's current and global progress are equal.\n\nSo, the output should be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,100.\n\nBut the sample output shows 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nSo, this suggests that my understanding is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps the current_file_progress is the progress of all files processed so far, not just the current one.\n\nWait, perhaps the first progress bar is the progress of all files processed before the current one, plus the current file's partially processed part.\n\nNo, that doesn't fit the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first progress bar is the progress of all files processed so far, including the current file's x bytes.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the definition wrong.\n\nLet me re-express the formal definitions.\n\nFormally:\n\nAfter copying byte x from file i:\n\ncurrent_file_progress = floor( (100 * x) / a_i )\n\nglobal_progress = floor( (100 * (a_1 + ... + a_{i-1} + x )) / (a_1 + ... + a_n) )\n\nSo, the current_file_progress is only for file i, and the global is for all files.\n\nSo, in the first case, when i=0, a_1=6.\n\nx runs from 1 to 6.\n\ncurrent_file_progress is 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nglobal is (x)/6 *100 → same as current.\n\nThus, all x's current and global are equal → 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,100.\n\nBut",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the moments when both progress bars show the same percentage during the file copying process. The progress bars update after each byte is copied, and we need to find all such percentages from 0 to 100.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Understanding**: We have `n` files to copy, each with a specific size. After each byte is copied, two progress bars update: one showing the current file's progress and another showing the overall progress across all files. We need to find all percentages where both progress bars show the same value at the same time.\n\n2. **Progress Calculation**:\n   - The current file's progress after `x` bytes is calculated as `floor((100 * x) / a_i)`, where `a_i` is the size of the current file.\n   - The global progress after `x` bytes is calculated as `floor((100 * total_copied) / total_size)`, where `total_copied` is the sum of all bytes copied so far and `total_size` is the sum of all file sizes.\n\n3. **Simulation Approach**: For each file, simulate the copying process byte by byte, updating both progress bars after each byte and checking if they show the same percentage.\n\n4. **Collect Results**: Track all unique percentages where both progress bars match, including the initial state (0%).\n\n5. **Edge Cases Handling**: Ensure that all edge cases, such as the initial state and complete file copying, are handled correctly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_a = sum(a)\nresult = {0}\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    ai = a[i]\n    sum_before = sum(a[:i])\n    for x in range(1, ai + 1):\n        current = (100 * x) // ai\n        total = sum_before + x\n        global_p = (100 * total) // sum_a\n        if current == global_p:\n            result.add(current)\n\n# Prepare the output\noutput = []\nfor p in range(0, 101):\n    if p in result:\n        output.append(str(p))\n\nprint('\\n'.join(output))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Initialization**: It initializes a set to track the matching percentages starting with 0.\n3. **Processing Each File**: For each file, it calculates the progress after each byte and checks against the global progress.\n4. **Updating Result Set**: If both progress bars match, the percentage is added to the result set.\n5. **Output Preparation**: The results are collected, sorted, and printed in the required format.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible matching percentages are efficiently tracked and outputted in ascending order.",
