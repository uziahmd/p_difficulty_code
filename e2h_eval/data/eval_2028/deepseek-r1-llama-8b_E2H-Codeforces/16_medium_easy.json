Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Crazy Town,\" and from the description, it seems like it involves lines dividing a plane into regions, and moving between these regions with certain rules.\n\nHmm, the task is to find the minimum number of steps to get from the home block to the university block. Each step allows moving to a neighboring block that shares a common border of non-zero length. So, essentially, we're looking for the shortest path in terms of adjacency steps between these blocks.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Maybe each line represents a road that splits the plane into two regions. The home and university are on opposite sides of some roads. The key idea here might be that each road can split the space, and the parity of being on one side or the other determines which regions you can move through.\n\nOh right! This reminds me of the concept where each line contributes to a binary state—like, whether you're on the positive side or negative side of the line. So, for each road, the home and university will lie on either the same side or different sides. The number of roads where they are on different sides would determine something about the steps needed.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of steps required is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and the university. Because each such road requires crossing once, and each crossing can be done in one step. But wait, no—because crossing multiple roads at once isn't possible. Or maybe it is? Hmm.\n\nNo, because each step is moving across a single road. Or is it?\n\nWait, think about this: Each step allows moving to an adjacent block. Each block is separated by some roads. For two points that are on opposite sides of k roads, the minimal steps would be k, assuming that each step crosses exactly one road. But is that always the case?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of steps is the number of lines that separate the two points. Because each such line must be crossed, and each crossing is a step.\n\nWait, let's think with an example. Suppose there are two lines that cross each other. If the home and university are on opposite sides of both lines, then moving from home to university would require crossing each line once. But since the lines intersect, maybe you can cross both in two steps, not necessarily two steps per line.\n\nWait, no. Wait, each step is moving across a single road. So if you have two roads that intersect, but the home and university are on opposite sides of both, then to get from home to university, you have to cross each road. But the order might matter. So perhaps the minimal steps would be the maximum of the individual crossings, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to model each point as a set of binary values indicating which side of each line they are on. Then, the problem reduces to finding the Hamming distance between these two sets. Because each line that separates the two points contributes to a differing bit, and the number of differing bits is the number of lines that need to be crossed.\n\nSo, for each line, compute whether the home is on the positive side (a*x + b*y + c > 0) and the university is on the negative side, or vice versa. The count of such lines is the answer.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each such line represents a boundary that needs to be crossed. And since each step allows crossing one such boundary, the total number of steps is equal to the number of lines that separate the two points.\n\nYes, because each line that separates them contributes exactly one step. Because the blocks are connected in a way that each step flips the state across one line.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\n1. For each of the n roads, check if the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n2. Count how many such roads exist. That count is the minimal number of steps.\n\nBut wait, how to determine if two points are on opposite sides of a line. For a line equation a*x + b*y + c = 0, the product of (a*x1 + b*y1 + c) and (a*x2 + b*y2 + c) should be negative. Because if one is positive and the other is negative, the points are on opposite sides.\n\nYes, exactly. So for each line, compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c and s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If s1 * s2 < 0, then the two points are on opposite sides of the line. So, for each such line, increment the count.\n\nThe result is the count of such lines.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read home coordinates (x1, y1)\n- Read university coordinates (x2, y2)\n- Read n lines, each with a, b, c\n- For each line, calculate s1 and s2. If s1*s2 < 0, count it.\n- Output the count.\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nHome is (1,1)\nUniversity is (-1,-1)\nn=2\nLines:\n0 1 0 --> line is y = 0. Home is y=1, positive; University is y=-1, positive. Same side. So no count.\n1 0 0 --> x=0. Home is x=1, positive; University is x=-1, negative. Different sides. So count +=1.\n\nWait, but the sample output is 2. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the sample.\n\nWait no, wait the sample input seems to have two lines, but the second line is 1 1 -3. Or wait, perhaps I'm misreading the sample.\n\nWait no, the sample input is given as two blocks, perhaps. Let me look again.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the third line is 3, meaning three roads. The first line is 0 1 0, which is y=0. Second line is 1 0 0, x=0. Third line is 1 1 -3.\n\nWait, let's compute for each line whether home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nFor each line:\n\nLine 1: 0x +1y +0=0 → y=0.\ns1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0=1>0.\ns2=0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1<0.\nSo s1*s2 = -1 <0. So counts.\n\nLine 2: 1x +0y +0=0 → x=0.\ns1=1*1 +0 +0=1>0.\ns2=1*(-1)+0+0 =-1<0. So s1*s2=-1 <0. Counts.\n\nLine3: 1x +1y -3=0 → x+y=3.\ns1=1*1 +1*1 -3 = -1 <0.\ns2=1*(-1)+1*(-1) -3 = -1 -1 -3 = -5 <0.\ns1*s2 = (-1)*(-5) =5>0. So same side. No count.\n\nSo total count is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nWe'll read the home and university coordinates as floats, but perhaps as integers because the input is given as integers. Then for each of the n lines, read a, b, c as integers.\n\nCompute s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\ns2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\nIf s1 and s2 have opposite signs, count it.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead x1, y1 from first line.\n\nRead x2, y2 from second line.\n\nRead n from third line.\n\nInitialize count =0.\n\nLoop n times:\n\n   Read a, b, c.\n\n   Compute s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n   Compute s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n   If s1 * s2 <0: count +=1\n\nAt the end, print count.\n\nYes, that's simple.\n\nWait, but what about when s1 is zero or s2 is zero? Well, according to the problem statement, neither home nor university lie on any road. So s1 and s2 can't be zero. So we don't have to worry about that case.\n\nSo the code can proceed as described.\n\nTesting the sample:\n\nSample input:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nWait, no, the third line is 3, n=3.\n\nWait, the sample input in the problem is:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nWait, no, the user provided the sample input as a string, but perhaps it's better to just think of the code.\n\nSo, the code reads the first two lines as home and university, then n, then n lines.\n\nSo in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nLet me test with the sample.\n\nSample input:\n\nHome: 1 1\n\nUniversity: -1 -1\n\nn=3\n\nRoads:\n\n1 0 0 → x=0.\n\ns1=1*1 +0*1 +0=1>0.\n\ns2=1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0 =-1<0 → product is -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 0 1 0 → y=0.\n\ns1=0*1 +1*1 +0=1>0.\n\ns2=0*(-1)+1*(-1) +0= -1<0 → product is -1 → count +=1. Now count is 2.\n\nThird road: 1 1 -3.\n\ns1=1*1 +1*1 -3= 1+1-3= -1 <0.\n\ns2=1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3= -1-1-3= -5 <0 → product is positive → no count.\n\nSo total is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step allows moving to an adjacent block that shares a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that each road (line) in Crazy Town can be considered as a boundary that divides the plane into two regions. By checking whether the home and university lie on opposite sides of each road, we can count how many such roads exist. Each such road contributes to one step required to move between the blocks.\n\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads.\n2. **Check Each Road**: For each road defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\), compute the values of the equation at the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Determine Sides**: If the home and university lie on opposite sides of a road, their computed values will have opposite signs. This indicates that the road separates the two points.\n4. **Count Separating Roads**: Count the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. This count gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads.\n- **Loop Through Roads**: For each road, defined by coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), compute the value of the line equation at the home and university coordinates.\n- **Check Opposite Sides**: If the product of these values is negative, it means the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n- **Count Steps**: The total count of such roads is the minimum number of steps needed to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the required steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their geometric interpretations.",
