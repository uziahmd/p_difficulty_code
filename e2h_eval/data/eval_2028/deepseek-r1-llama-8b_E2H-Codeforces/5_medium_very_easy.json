Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves.

The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Colored Boots.\" Hmm.\n\nSo, the setup is that there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color represented by a lowercase letter or a question mark. We need to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of one left and one right boot, and their colors are compatible.\n\nWhat counts as compatible? Two specific colors are compatible only if they're exactly the same. A question mark is compatible with any color, including another question mark. So, for example, '?' can pair with 'a', 'b', or '?'. But 'a' can't pair with 'b'.\n\nThe goal is to compute the maximum number of such pairs and list them. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nHmm. So, the approach here must involve figuring out which left and right boots can form compatible pairs and then selecting as many as possible without overlapping.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, I think we can process each position i (from 0 to n-1) and check whether l[i] and r[i] are compatible. Wait, no, because maybe a better pairing exists by matching different indices. For example, maybe the first left can pair with the second right, and vice versa, allowing more pairs overall.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because if you have multiple options for pairing, you might have to choose which ones to include to maximize the total.\n\nThis seems like a bipartite matching problem. One side is the left boots, the other is the right boots, and edges exist between left i and right j if l[i] and r[j] are compatible. Then, finding the maximum matching would give the maximum number of pairs.\n\nBut wait, bipartite matching is usually O(n^3) time, which is way too slow for n up to 150,000. So that approach isn't feasible.\n\nHmm. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the constraints on compatibility. Since each pair must consist of one left and one right, perhaps we can group the left and right boots based on their color or question mark, and then find the best matches between these groups.\n\nWait, another idea: for each right boot, count how many left boots are compatible with it. Then, assign each right boot to the first available left boot that is compatible with it. Or something along those lines.\n\nBut that might not be optimal because choosing certain pairs could block better options elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as an assignment problem, but again, the size is too big for standard algorithms.\n\nWait, let's think about the problem differently. Since each left can be paired with any right that is compatible, and each right can also be paired with any left compatible, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is determined by the sum over the minimum of the counts of each compatible pair.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because some lefts are compatible with multiple rights, and vice versa.\n\nAnother angle: since the question marks are wildcards, perhaps we can precompute for each right boot how many lefts are compatible, including those that are also question marks.\n\nWait, but how to efficiently compute all possible pairs?\n\nLet me try to break down the problem into steps.\n\n1. For each left boot, determine which right boots are compatible.\n2. Similarly, for each right boot, determine which left boots are compatible.\n3. Find a matching that selects the maximum number of non-overlapping pairs.\n\nBut with n up to 150,000, this approach is computationally expensive.\n\nAlternative idea: consider that each pair is a left and a right. So, for each i, j, if l[i] and r[j] are compatible, then (i,j) is a possible edge.\n\nWe need to find the maximum matching in this bipartite graph, but again, it's not feasible for large n.\n\nSo perhaps we can model this as a bipartite graph where each left node is connected to all right nodes that are compatible, and then find the maximum matching. But again, with n up to 150,000, this is impossible with standard algorithms.\n\nWait, but perhaps the graph has a special structure that allows us to compute the maximum matching quickly.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the structure of the graph. Each left node is connected to all right nodes where their colors are compatible. Now, considering that a question mark on either side is compatible with everything.\n\nSo, for example, a left node with color '?' can connect to all right nodes, regardless of their color. Similarly, a right node with '?' can connect to all left nodes.\n\nSo, the key here is that the question marks act as universal connectors.\n\nNow, perhaps the maximum matching can be found by greedily matching as many as possible, starting from the left or the right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by processing the left and right arrays and counting the number of pairs possible, considering the question marks as wildcards.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach: \n\nLet's create two frequency tables:\n\n- For left boots, count the occurrences of each character, including '?'.\n- For right boots, count the occurrences of each character, including '?'.\n\nThen, for each possible pair of characters (c_l, c_r), if they are compatible (including when either is '?'), compute the number of possible pairs and add that to the total.\n\nWait, but this approach doesn't account for the fact that each left and right can be used only once. So, for example, if a left 'a' is used to pair with a right 'a', then it can't be used again.\n\nSo, the initial thought of summing all possible compatible pairs would overcount because each left and right can only be used once.\n\nTherefore, that approach won't work directly.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph and the maximum matching can be found using some efficient algorithm.\n\nBut given the size, standard algorithms won't work. So we need a way to model this in a way that can be computed efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into counting the maximum possible pairs, considering that each left can be matched to any right that is compatible.\n\nSo, the maximum possible pairs would be the sum of all left-right compatible pairs, but each left and right can be used at most once.\n\nWait, but how do we compute that efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into:\n\n1. Compute the number of pairs where both left and right have specific colors and they match.\n2. Compute the number of pairs where left is '?', right is anything.\n3. Compute the number of pairs where right is '?', left is anything.\n4. Subtract overlaps where both are '?' because they've been counted twice.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a direction. Let's formalize this.\n\nLet me define the following variables:\n\n- Let L be the set of left boots.\n- Let R be the set of right boots.\n\nCompute four cases:\n\nA. Both left and right are specific colors and match.\n\nFor each specific color c, the number of pairs is min(count_left[c], count_right[c]).\n\nSumming over all c gives the number of pairs where both are specific and matching.\n\nB. Left is '?', right is any (specific or '?').\n\nThe number of such pairs is the number of left '?' multiplied by the total number of right boots (since each '?' can pair with any right).\n\nSimilarly, C is the number of right '?' multiplied by the total number of left boots.\n\nD. However, when both are '?', they are counted in both B and C. So the total would be B + C - D, where D is the number of pairs where both are '?'.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that each left and right can be used only once. So this approach is overcounting because it's treating each as independent, but in reality, each can be used once.\n\nSo this approach isn't correct because it's not considering the mutual exclusivity.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the correct approach is to model this as a bipartite graph and find the maximum matching, but with optimizations based on the structure.\n\nWait, another thought: since each left can be matched to any right that is compatible, the maximum matching is equal to the minimum of the number of left and right compatible options for each left.\n\nWait, but that's not accurate because some rights may have overlapping compatible lefts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum for each right of the number of lefts compatible with it, but ensuring that each left is used at most once.\n\nBut again, this is similar to the bipartite matching problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is equal to the maximum possible between the left and right, considering that each can be used only once.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: the maximum possible number of pairs is the minimum between the total number of lefts and rights, but that's obviously incorrect because some may not be compatible.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of all possible compatible pairs, minus the overlaps where a left or right is used more than once.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to compute that.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be viewed as follows:\n\nEach left can be matched to any right that is compatible. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum bipartite matching where edges exist between compatible left and right boots.\n\nBut with n up to 150,000, standard algorithms like the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm would not be feasible because their time complexity is O(EâˆšN), which is around 1e5*sqrt(1e5) = 1e7, which might be manageable, but perhaps tight.\n\nWait, but Hopcroft-Karp is designed for bipartite graphs where each node has a high degree. In our case, each left node can be connected to all right nodes that are compatible, which could be up to 150,000 for each left node, leading to E being up to 150,000 * 150,000 = 2.25e10, which is way too big.\n\nSo Hopcroft-Karp is not feasible here.\n\nSo, perhaps we need a smarter way to model the problem.\n\nWait, but perhaps the structure of the graph allows for a greedy approach to find the maximum matching.\n\nIn particular, if the graph is such that each left can be connected to a large number of rights, but the maximum matching is limited by the number of lefts and rights.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to the maximum number of pairs where for each left, it can be matched to the earliest possible right that is compatible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a bipartite graph where the edges are compatible, but arrange the nodes in a way that allows for a greedy approach.\n\nWait, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. Since the question marks can pair with any color, perhaps the optimal strategy is to pair as many left and right question marks as possible, and then handle the specific colors.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Count the number of lefts and rights that are '?'. Let's denote them as L_q and R_q.\n\nThe maximum possible pairs from these is min(L_q, R_q). Let's say x = min(L_q, R_q). These pairs will be formed by taking x left '?'s and x right '?'s.\n\nWait, but perhaps not. Because if a left is '?', it can pair with any right, including those that are '?'. Similarly, a right '?' can pair with any left, including other '?'. So, perhaps the maximum number of pairs involving '?' is the minimum of the count of '?' in L and the count of '?' in R plus the sum of specific pairs.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because even if there are more '?', they can only be used once.\n\nWait, perhaps the total number of pairs is the sum of:\n\n- The number of specific pairs (where l_i == r_j).\n- The number of pairs where l is '?' and r is any (specific or '?').\n- The number of pairs where r is '?' and l is any (specific or '?'), minus the overlap where both are '?'.\n\nWait, but that's not considering the mutual exclusivity of the pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nTotal pairs = specific_pairs + (L_q * R_total) + (R_q * L_total) - (L_q * R_q)\n\nBut wait, that's because:\n\n- specific_pairs: pairs where both are specific and match.\n- L_q * R_total: pairs where left is '?', right is anything (including '?')\n- R_q * L_total: pairs where right is '?', left is anything (including '?')\n- But then, the pairs where both are '?' are counted in both L_q*R_total and R_q*L_total. So subtract L_q * R_q to avoid double-counting.\n\nBut this approach is wrong because each pair uses one left and one right. So the sum would overcount because it's adding all possible combinations, but each can only be used once.\n\nThus, this approach isn't correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to model this differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be considered as a bipartite graph where each left node is connected to all right nodes that are compatible. Then, the maximum matching is the solution.\n\nBut with n up to 150,000, the standard algorithms won't work due to time constraints.\n\nWait, but perhaps the graph has a special structure that allows for a more efficient solution.\n\nFor example, if the graph is a bipartition where each left node can connect to a range of right nodes, perhaps a greedy approach can be used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a bipartite graph and use the fact that the maximum matching is equal to the number of left nodes, provided that enough right nodes are compatible, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible pairs is the minimum of the number of left and right nodes, but only if all can be matched. Otherwise, it depends on the compatibility.\n\nBut again, this is not directly helpful.\n\nAnother approach: since each '?' can pair with any left or right, perhaps the presence of '?'s can help in maximizing the number of pairs beyond what would be possible without them.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be split into two parts:\n\n1. Count the number of pairs that can be formed without using any '?'s. Let's call this S.\n2. Then, see how the '?'s can be used to form additional pairs beyond S.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, the number of pairs without using any '?'s is the number of pairs where l_i and r_j are specific and equal. So for each specific color c, the number of pairs is the minimum of the count of c in l and the count of c in r. Summing this across all c gives S.\n\nThe remaining possible pairs are those that involve at least one '?'. Let's compute how many such pairs can be formed.\n\nBut again, the problem is ensuring that each left and right is used at most once.\n\nHmm. So, after S is calculated, we have some lefts and rights that couldn't be paired in S. Let's say:\n\n- Some lefts are still available: L_available = L_total - (number of lefts used in S)\n- Some rights are still available: R_available = R_total - (number of rights used in S)\n\nNow, for the remaining available lefts and rights, we can form pairs using the '?'. Because a '?' can pair with any available left or right.\n\nSo, the maximum number of additional pairs would be the minimum of the number of available lefts and available rights.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because some of the available lefts may not be compatible with any available rights except via '?'.\n\nWait, for example, suppose we have some lefts that are 'a' and some rights that are 'b' and '?'. Without using the '?', 'a' and 'b' can't pair. But if a left 'a' is available and a right '?' is available, they can form a pair.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum additional pairs is the minimum of the number of available lefts and available rights, regardless of their specific colors.\n\nBecause each available left can pair with any available right, because at least one of them is a '?'.\n\nWait, no. Because if both left and right are specific but not the same, but neither is '?', then they can't form a pair.\n\nBut in the scenario where after S is computed, the remaining lefts and rights may have some specific colors that can't pair. However, the presence of '?' can allow those to pair.\n\nWait, no. Because after S, the lefts and rights that are not used in S are either specific and couldn't pair with any specific right, or are '?'. So, perhaps in the remaining lefts and rights, if any are '?', they can be used to pair with any other available left or right.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me think of it step by step.\n\nSuppose after computing S (the number of specific pairs), we have some lefts and rights left. Let me denote:\n\n- A: the set of lefts not used in S. These can be either specific colors or '?'.\n- B: the set of rights not used in S. Similarly.\n\nThen, the additional pairs can be formed by pairing lefts from A with rights from B, as long as they are compatible.\n\nSince each left in A can pair with any right in B if either is a '?'.\n\nWait, but the question is whether for a particular left and right, their colors are compatible.\n\nBut perhaps, given that we have some '?'s, we can pair as many as possible.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum additional pairs is the minimum of |A| and |B|.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Because, for example, suppose all lefts in A are 'a' and all rights in B are 'b'â€”then they can't pair. But if some in A are '?' or B are '?', then they can pair.\n\nWait, but after S is computed, the remaining lefts and rights are those that couldn't form a specific pair. So, for a left 'a' in A, it couldn't have been paired with any right 'a' because perhaps there were none. But perhaps, the right is a '?', so it can pair.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of additional pairs is indeed the minimum of |A| and |B|. Because, for any left in A and right in B, if at least one of them is a '?', then they can form a pair. If both are '?', they can pair.\n\nWait, but what if all lefts in A are 'a' and all rights in B are 'b'? Then, they can't pair. So the additional pairs would be zero.\n\nSo, the maximum additional pairs is the minimum between |A| and |B|, but only if there's at least one '?' in A or B.\n\nWait, no. Because if both A and B have only specific colors that don't match, but there are '?'s in either A or B, they can pair.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum additional pairs is the minimum of |A| and |B|, because for each pair, you can choose a left and a right that are compatible.\n\nWait, but this might not always hold. For example, if A has 3 'a's and B has 3 'b's, but no '?', then they can't form any additional pairs. So the maximum is zero.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to compute the maximum possible pairs after S, which is the number of specific pairs, and then the additional pairs are the minimum of |A| and |B|, but only if there's at least one compatible pair in A and B.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum additional pairs is the minimum of |A| and |B|, but we have to ensure that at least one pair is compatible.\n\nWait, but how to compute whether any pair is compatible.\n\nWait, but if either A has a '?' or B has a '?', then there are compatible pairs.\n\nWait, no. Suppose A has a 'a' and B has a 'b', but neither A nor B have a '?'. Then, no pairs can be formed.\n\nSo, the maximum additional pairs is min(|A|, |B|) only if there exists at least one pair in A Ã— B that is compatible.\n\nOtherwise, it's zero.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Compute S: the number of specific pairs where l_i == r_j.\n\n2. Compute A and B:\n\n   A is the set of lefts not used in S (so, lefts that couldn't be paired with any right that was specific and matched). So, for a left 'a', it couldn't be paired because there are no 'a's in the rights not used in S.\n\n   Similarly for B.\n\n3. Now, among A and B, find if any pair is compatible. If yes, then the maximum additional pairs is min(|A|, |B|). Else, zero.\n\nWait, but how to compute if any pair in A Ã— B is compatible.\n\nWell, for that, we can check if any left in A is compatible with any right in B.\n\nBut checking this naively would take O(|A| * |B|) time, which is not feasible for large n.\n\nSo, we need a way to determine if any pair in A Ã— B is compatible.\n\nHow?\n\nWell, for a left in A, its color could be a specific color or a '?'. Similarly for a right in B.\n\nSo, for the entire A and B sets:\n\n- If there exists any left in A that is '?', then it can pair with any right in B. So, there's at least one compatible pair.\n\n- Similarly, if there exists any right in B that is '?', then it can pair with any left in A.\n\n- If neither A nor B contains any '?', then we need to check if any specific color in A has a matching specific color in B.\n\nSo, the steps to determine if there are any compatible pairs in A and B:\n\n- If A has any '?', then yes.\n\n- Else if B has any '?', then yes.\n\n- Else, check if there exists a color c such that the count of c in A is greater than zero and the count of c in B is also greater than zero. If yes, then yes.\n\nElse, no.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nCompute S as the sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for each c.\n\nCompute A as the set of lefts not used in S, which are the lefts whose color is such that left_counts[l_i] > right_counts[r_i] where r_i is the corresponding right color.\n\nWait, no. Because for a left 'a', it couldn't be paired in S only if the number of 'a's in rights is less than the number of 'a's in lefts.\n\nWait, perhaps for each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]). So, for the lefts that are 'a', the number of pairs is min(left_counts['a'], right_counts['a']). Any left 'a's beyond that can't be paired in S, so they go into A.\n\nSo, for each left in l, if it's 'a', and the number of 'a's in right is less than the number of 'a's in left, then the excess left 'a's are in A.\n\nSimilarly for other colors.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to compute A is:\n\nFor each left i, its color is c.\n\nIf the count of c in left is greater than the count of c in right, then the excess (count_left[c] - count_right[c]) lefts are added to A.\n\nWait, no. Because for a particular i, if the number of rights with c is less than the number of lefts with c, then i can't be paired in S, so it's added to A.\n\nSo, for each i:\n\nif l[i] is '?': it can be paired in B, but not in S.\n\nWait, no. Because in S, we are only considering pairs where both are specific and equal.\n\nSo, for a left '?', it cannot be part of S. So, all left '?'s are in A.\n\nSimilarly, for a right '?', it can't be part of S, so all right '?'s are in B.\n\nWait, no. Because in S, we are only pairing specific colors. So, any left '?' cannot be in S, because there's no right specific color that can match it. So, all left '?'s are in A.\n\nSimilarly for right '?'s: they can't be part of S, so they are in B.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute S as sum over c of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\nCompute the number of lefts that are '?': L_q = left_counts['?'].\n\nCompute the number of rights that are '?': R_q = right_counts['?'].\n\nThese are the candidates for additional pairs.\n\nThen, the remaining lefts in A are all the lefts that are not part of S and are not '?'. Similarly, the remaining rights in B are all the rights not part of S and not '?'.\n\nWait, no. Because a left could be 'a' but not part of S if there are not enough 'a's in the rights. So, the lefts in A are:\n\nFor each left i:\n\nif l[i] is '?', then it's in A.\n\nelse, if the count of l[i] in left is greater than the count in right, then i is in A.\n\nSimilarly, for right j:\n\nif r[j] is '?', then it's in B.\n\nelse, if the count of r[j] in right is greater than the count in left, then j is in B.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because for a right j, if the count of r[j] in right is more than in left, then it can't be paired in S, so it's in B.\n\nBut perhaps I should model this as:\n\nCompute for each color c, the number of pairs in S is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\nSo, for each left i, if l[i] is c, and left_counts[c] > right_counts[c], then i is in A.\n\nSimilarly for right j.\n\nWait, but that's not accurate. Because for a left i with color c, if left_counts[c] <= right_counts[c], then all lefts with c can be paired in S, and none are in A.\n\nOnly when left_counts[c] > right_counts[c], the excess lefts are in A.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each left i:\n\nif l[i] is not '?', and left_counts[l[i]] > right_counts[l[i]], then i is in A.\n\nSimilarly, for each right j:\n\nif r[j] is not '?', and right_counts[r[j]] > left_counts[r[j]], then j is in B.\n\nAdditionally, all lefts that are '?' are in A.\n\nAll rights that are '?' are in B.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. Compute left_counts and right_counts for each color, including '?'.\n\n2. Compute S as sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for each c.\n\n3. For each left i:\n\n   a. if l[i] is '?', add to A.\n\n   b. else, if left_counts[l[i]] > right_counts[l[i]], add to A.\n\n4. Similarly, for each right j:\n\n   a. if r[j] is '?', add to B.\n\n   b. else, if right_counts[r[j]] > left_counts[r[j]], add to B.\n\n5. Now, compute the additional pairs:\n\n   a. Check if any pair in A Ã— B is compatible.\n\n      i. If A has any '?', then yes.\n\n     ii. Else if B has any '?', then yes.\n\n    iii. Else, check if the intersection of colors in A and B is non-empty (i.e., there exists a color c where A has some c's and B has some c's).\n\n   b. If yes, then the additional pairs are min(|A|, |B|).\n\n   c. Else, additional pairs is zero.\n\n6. The total pairs is S + additional_pairs.\n\nOnce we have the maximum number of pairs, we need to output the pairs themselves.\n\nBut how to construct the list of pairs.\n\nHmm. So, the plan is:\n\nCompute S, then compute the additional pairs.\n\nNow, the question is, how to collect the pairs.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is not sufficient because the way we compute A and B may not capture all possibilities.\n\nWait, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nn=10\n\nl = codeforces â†’ 'c o d e f o r c e s'\n\nr = dodivthree â†’ 'd o d i v t h r e e'\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the exact letters.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the maximum number of pairs is 5.\n\nSo, perhaps in this case, S is 3, and the additional pairs are 2, totaling 5.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nWait, the actual sample input isn't given in the problem statement, but the user provided a sample output.\n\nWait, perhaps the first sample input is:\n\nn=10\n\nl = \"codeforces\"\n\nr = \"dodivthree\"\n\nWait, but perhaps the actual sample is more complex.\n\nIn any case, perhaps the approach is correct.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute S, then compute the additional pairs as the minimum of |A| and |B|, provided that there's at least one compatible pair in A Ã— B.\n\nThen, the total is S + additional.\n\nNow, to implement this, we need to:\n\n- Create left_counts and right_counts, including '?'.\n\n- Compute S.\n\n- Collect A and B.\n\n- Determine if any pair in A and B is compatible.\n\n- If yes, the additional is min(|A|, |B|).\n\n- Else, zero.\n\nOnce the maximum is known, we need to collect the pairs.\n\nBut the problem requires us to list the pairs, which complicates things.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way to collect the pairs is:\n\nFirst, pair as many specific pairs as possible, and then pair the remaining using '?'s.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to collect the pairs is:\n\nFor S, we can pair each c in left_counts and right_counts as much as possible, but in practice, we'd have to find which specific lefts are paired with which rights.\n\nBut that's difficult because it's possible that for a color c, there are multiple lefts and rights, and we need to pair as many as possible.\n\nBut for the purposes of the problem, perhaps the output can be any valid set of pairs, not necessarily the one that maximizes the count.\n\nWait, no, the problem says to print any of them if there are multiple optimal solutions.\n\nSo, perhaps for the S part, we can just take any possible pairing.\n\nBut in terms of implementation, perhaps it's easier to collect the pairs as follows:\n\nFor the specific pairs S, for each color c, take the min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]), and then pair each left c_i with a right c_j.\n\nBut how to choose which ones.\n\nWait, perhaps the order doesn't matter, but the code must select the pairs correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the S part, we can pair each left c_i with a right c_j in a way that uses up the min count.\n\nBut this would require knowing which lefts and rights are used in S.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of the code, it's sufficient to collect the S pairs as:\n\nFor each color c:\n\n   num_pairs = min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c])\n\n   for i in 0 to num_pairs-1:\n\n       find a left in l that is c, and hasn't been paired yet.\n\n       find a right in r that is c, and hasn't been paired yet.\n\n       add the pair (left_index, right_index) to the list.\n\nBut this could be time-consuming for large n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can collect the S pairs in a way that for each c, we take the first m lefts and the first m rights, where m is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\nBut this may not always be correct.\n\nWait, but for the code, perhaps it's acceptable to collect the pairs in the order they appear.\n\nSo, for each c, iterate through the lefts and rights, and for each occurrence of c in l, pair it with the earliest possible occurrence of c in r.\n\nBut this may not be the most efficient way, but it's manageable.\n\nThen, for the additional pairs, we can pair the remaining lefts and rights using the '?'.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the additional pairs, we can pair each left in A with a right in B in the order they appear.\n\nBut again, the code needs to track which lefts and rights have been used.\n\nThis is getting complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nImplement the following steps:\n\n1. Read n, l, r.\n\n2. Compute left_counts and right_counts for each character.\n\n3. Compute S as sum over c of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\n4. For each left i, if l[i] is '?', add to A.\n\n   Else, if left_counts[l[i]] > right_counts[l[i]], add to A.\n\n5. For each right j, if r[j] is '?', add to B.\n\n   Else, if right_counts[r[j]] > left_counts[r[j]], add to B.\n\n6. Determine if any pair in A and B is compatible.\n\n   a. If A has any '?', then yes.\n\n   b. Else if B has any '?', then yes.\n\n   c. Else, check if the intersection of colors in A and B is non-empty.\n\n   d. If yes, then proceed.\n\n   e. Else, no.\n\n7. If yes, additional_pairs = min(|A|, |B|).\n\n8. Else, additional_pairs = 0.\n\n9. Total pairs = S + additional_pairs.\n\nNow, the next step is to collect the pairs.\n\nSo, for S:\n\nWe need to collect the pairs where l[i] == r[j], and we have as many as possible.\n\nTo do this, for each color c, we can collect the first m lefts and first m rights, where m is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\nBut to do this, perhaps we can pre-process for each color c, the list of indices where l[i] == c, and similarly for r[j].\n\nThen, for each c, take the first m elements from l_indices[c] and r_indices[c], and pair them.\n\nBut this requires for each c, having a list of positions in l and r.\n\nSo, during preprocessing:\n\n- For each c in left_counts, collect the list of indices in l where l[i] == c.\n\n- Similarly for right_counts.\n\nThen, for each c in left_counts:\n\n   m = min(left_counts[c], right_counts.get(c, 0))\n\n   take the first m lefts from l_indices[c]\n\n   take the first m rights from r_indices[c]\n\n   for i in 0 to m-1:\n\n       add (l_list[i], r_list[i]) to the pairs.\n\nSimilarly for other colors.\n\nBut this could be time-consuming for large n, but perhaps manageable.\n\nOnce S is collected, for the additional pairs:\n\nWe need to collect pairs from A and B.\n\nAssuming that A and B are lists of left and right indices that couldn't be paired in S.\n\nWe need to pair as many as possible, possibly using '?'.\n\nSo, for each left in A:\n\n   if l[i] is '?', then it can pair with any right in B.\n\n   else, it can pair with any right in B that has r[j] == l[i], or any right in B that is '?'.\n\nWait, but in the A and B sets, the lefts are those that couldn't be paired in S, which means that for a left 'a', there aren't enough 'a's in the rights.\n\nSo, for a left 'a' in A, it can't pair with any right 'a' because all are already used in S.\n\nBut perhaps it can pair with a right '?'.\n\nSimilarly for a right 'a' in B.\n\nSo, for the additional pairs:\n\nWe can pair as follows:\n\n- For each left in A, if it's '?', pair it with any right in B.\n\n- Else, pair it with a right in B that has r[j] == l[i] or is '?'.\n\nBut to avoid double-counting, perhaps it's better to process the pairs in a way that ensures each left and right is used once.\n\nSo, for the additional pairs:\n\nWe can process the lefts in A in order, and for each left, find the earliest possible right in B that is compatible.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, since the problem requires any valid set of pairs, perhaps the easiest way is to pair as many as possible by greedily matching lefts to rights, using the '?''s first.\n\nSo, for each left in A:\n\n   if it's '?', then pair it with any right in B.\n\n   else, look for a right in B that is '?' or has the same color.\n\nBut to make this efficient, perhaps the code can:\n\n- For the additional pairs, collect all the lefts in A and rights in B.\n\n- Then, for each left in A, try to find the first right in B that is compatible.\n\nBut again, for large n, this could be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can count the number of '?' in A and B, and see how they can be used.\n\nBut perhaps the code can proceed as follows:\n\n- For the additional pairs:\n\n   a. Find all lefts in A that are '?'. Let's say there are x of them.\n\n   b. Find all rights in B that are '?'. Let's say there are y of them.\n\n   c. The maximum possible pairs from these is min(x, y). Let's say z = min(x, y).\n\n   d. Then, the remaining lefts in A (non-?) are L = |A| - x.\n\n   e. The remaining rights in B (non-?) are R = |B| - y.\n\n   f. The maximum additional pairs from these is min(L, R), provided that there's a compatible pair.\n\nSo, the total additional pairs is z + min(L, R).\n\nBut this assumes that the remaining can be paired because of the presence of '?'.\n\nWait, but the '?'s are already accounted for.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the additional pairs as follows:\n\nThe additional pairs can be formed by:\n\n- Pairing all the '?' lefts with '?' rights, up to min(x, y",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs between left and right boots. Each boot has a color represented by a lowercase letter or a question mark ('?').
