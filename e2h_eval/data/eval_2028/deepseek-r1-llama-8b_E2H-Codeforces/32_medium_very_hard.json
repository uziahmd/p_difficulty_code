    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Array Stabilization. Hmm.\n\nThe task is, given an array of integers, to remove exactly one element such that the instability of the remaining array is minimized. Instability is defined as the maximum element minus the minimum element in the array.\n\nSo, I need to find which single element to remove so that the resulting array has the smallest possible max - min. And then output that minimal instability.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this efficiently? Because if I just try removing each element one by one and calculate the instability each time, that would be O(n^2), which won't work for n up to 1e5.\n\nWait, right. So for a large n, we can't do anything with O(n) per operation. We need a way to compute the best possible removal quickly.\n\nLet me think about what happens when you remove an element. The new array's max and min could either stay the same, or change if the removed element was contributing to either.\n\nBut since we have to remove exactly one element, the minimal instability can't be less than the current instability unless the removed element was either the current max or the current min.\n\nWait, no. Because maybe by removing a max or min, the next max or min could be lower, thus reducing the overall spread.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal approach is to consider all possible candidates where the removal could potentially reduce the max or increase the min, but that's not straightforward.\n\nWait, another angle: after removing an element, the new array's max is either the original max (if the removed element wasn't the max) or the second max. Similarly for the min.\n\nSo, maybe I should precompute the sorted array and track the possible max and min after each possible removal.\n\nAlternatively, let's sort the array. Then, for each position i, if I remove a[i], the new max and min will be determined by the surrounding elements.\n\nWait, but even in a sorted array, removing an element affects the range. For example, suppose the array is [1,3,3,7]. If I remove 7, the new max is 3, min is 1, so instability is 2. If I remove 1, the new min is 3, max is 7, instability is 4. So, in this case, removing the max or min may not always be the best choice.\n\nSo, the idea is that the minimal instability can be found by considering all possible elements, but we need an efficient way to find the best candidate.\n\nWhat's the minimal possible instability? It must be the minimal possible (max' - min'), where max' is the maximum of the array excluding some element, and min' is the minimum of the array excluding that element.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find for each element a_i, what is the max and min of the array without a_i, then compute the difference, and find the minimal among all those.\n\nBut again, calculating this naively for each a_i is O(n^2), which is too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nIdea: Pre-sort the array. Then, for each possible i, compute the max and min of the array without a_i. How?\n\nIn a sorted array, for each i, the new max would be the maximum between a[0..i-1] and a[i+1..n-1]. Similarly, the new min would be the minimum between a[0..i-1] and a[i+1..n-1].\n\nWait, but in the sorted array, the min of the array without a_i is either a[0] (if a[0] is still present) or the next element after a_i if a_i was the min. Wait, no. Wait, if the array is sorted, then the min is a[0]. So when you remove a_i, unless a_i is a[0], the min remains a[0]. But if a_i is a[0], then the new min is a[1].\n\nSimilarly, the max is a[-1] unless a_i is a[-1], in which case the new max is a[-2].\n\nWait, that's an interesting point. So for each i, if a_i is the max, then the new max is the previous element. Else, the max remains the same.\n\nSimilarly for the min.\n\nSo, for each i, the new max is max_prev = a[-1] if a[i] != a[-1], else a[-2].\n\nAnd the new min is min_prev = a[0] if a[i] != a[0], else a[1].\n\nThen, the instability for removing a[i] is (new_max - new_min).\n\nWait, but that's only true if the array is sorted. Because if the array is unsorted, removing a particular element might have a different effect on the max and min.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if I sort the array, then the new max and min are determined by the first and last elements (excluding a_i). But wait, that's not correct because other elements could be higher or lower.\n\nWait, no. Suppose the array is [1,3,3,7], sorted. If I remove 7, the new max is 3, and the min is 1. So yes, the new max is the element before 7, which is 3, and the min is 1.\n\nIf I remove 3 (the second occurrence), the new array is [1,3,7]. Max is 7, min is 1.\n\nWait, so in this case, removing a non-extremal element doesn't affect the max or min. So the new max and min are the same as the original.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the new max is either the original max (if a_i is not the max) or the second max. Similarly for the new min.\n\nBut in the sorted array, the second max is the element before the last, but only if there are multiple instances of the max.\n\nWait, this seems tricky.\n\nAlternative approach: After sorting the array, for each i, the new max is the maximum of the array except a[i]. Similarly for the new min.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently?\n\nWait, but the array is sorted. So the new max can be:\n\nIf a[i] is the max, then the new max is a[-2] (if there are multiple max elements, else it's a[-2]).\n\nOtherwise, the new max remains a[-1].\n\nSimilarly for the min:\n\nIf a[i] is the min, the new min is a[1] (if there are multiple min elements, else a[1]).\n\nOtherwise, the new min remains a[0].\n\nSo, for each i, the new_max is a[-1] if a[i] < a[-1], else a[-2].\n\nWait, no. Because if a[i] is the max, then the new max is the previous element, regardless of whether it's equal to the max or not.\n\nWait, for example, array [5,5,5]. Removing any one of them leaves [5,5], so max is 5.\n\nIn this case, a[i] is the max, and a[-2] is 5, which equals the max.\n\nSo, the new_max is a[-2] when a[i] is a[-1].\n\nSo, the general rule is:\n\nnew_max = a[-1] if a[i] < a[-1], else a[-2].\n\nSimilarly, new_min is a[0] if a[i] > a[0], else a[1].\n\nWait, but what if a[i] is equal to a[-1] but not the last element? Like [1,3,5,5,5]. If I remove one of the 5s, the new_max is still 5.\n\nSo the condition holds.\n\nSo, for each i, the new_max is a[-1] if a[i] != a[-1], else a[-2].\n\nSame for new_min: if a[i] == a[0], then new_min is a[1], else a[0].\n\nWait, but if a[i] is a[0], but the array has multiple a[0], like [1,1,2,3]. If I remove one of the 1s, the new_min is 1, not a[1] which is also 1.\n\nSo, in that case, the new_min is a[1], which is the same as the original a[0], since a[i] is a[0], but a[1] is also a[0].\n\nHmm, so perhaps the correct condition is:\n\nnew_max = a[-1] if a[i] < a[-1], else a[-2].\n\nWait, no. Because in the case where a[i] is a[-1], the new_max is a[-2], regardless of whether a[i] is the only a[-1] or not.\n\nSimilarly for the new_min: new_min is a[0] if a[i] > a[0], else a[1].\n\nWait, but in the case where a[i] is a[0], but a[1] is also a[0], then the new_min is a[1], which is same as a[0]. So in that case, the new_min is a[1], which is same as a[0].\n\nSo, the calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Sort the array.\n\n2. Compute the initial max and min, which is a[-1] - a[0].\n\n3. For each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   a. Compute new_max: if a[i] == a[-1], then new_max = a[-2], else new_max = a[-1].\n\n   b. Compute new_min: if a[i] == a[0], then new_min = a[1], else new_min = a[0].\n\n   c. Compute the instability as new_max - new_min.\n\n   d. Keep track of the minimal instability.\n\n4. The minimal among all these instabilities is the answer.\n\nWait, but in the sorted array, a[i] can't be both a[0] and a[-1], unless all elements are the same. So for each i, it's either a[i] is a[0], or a[-1], or neither.\n\nBut in code, for each i, we can check whether a[i] is the current max or min.\n\nWait, but the array is sorted, so for any i, a[0] <= a[1] <= ... <= a[i] <= ... <= a[n-1].\n\nSo, for a[i], if it's equal to a[0], then it's the min. If it's equal to a[-1], then it's the max.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the initial instability as a[-1] - a[0].\n\nFor each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   if a[i] == a[0]:\n      new_min = a[1] if n > 1 else 0  # but wait, n is at least 2.\n      new_max = a[-1]\n   elif a[i] == a[-1]:\n      new_max = a[-2]\n      new_min = a[0]\n   else:\n      new_max = a[-1]\n      new_min = a[0]\n\n   current_instability = new_max - new_min\n   if current_instability < min_instability:\n      min_instability = current_instability\n\nBut wait, what about when i is 0 or n-1?\n\nFor i=0, a[i] is a[0], so new_min is a[1], new_max remains a[-1].\n\nFor i=n-1, a[i] is a[-1], so new_max is a[-2], new_min remains a[0].\n\nYes, that works.\n\nWait, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4\n1 3 3 7\n\nAfter sorting: [1,3,3,7]\n\nInitial instability: 7-1=6.\n\nNow, for each i:\n\ni=0: a[i]=1. So new_max is 7, new_min is a[1]=3. So instability is 7-3=4.\n\ni=1: a[i]=3. Not min nor max. new_max remains 7, new_min remains 1. instability 6.\n\ni=2: same as i=1.\n\ni=3: a[i]=7. So new_max is 3, new_min is 1. instability 2.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2\n1 100000\n\nAfter sorting: [1, 100000]\n\nInitial instability: 99999.\n\nFor i=0: new_min is 100000, new_max is 100000. instability 0.\n\nFor i=1: new_max is 1, new_min is 1. instability 0.\n\nSo the minimal is 0.\n\nWhich also matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: [5,5,5]. Sorted as [5,5,5].\n\nInitial instability: 0.\n\nFor each i:\n\ni=0: new_min is 5 (a[1]), new_max is 5. instability 0.\n\nSame for i=1 and i=2. So the minimal is 0.\n\nAnother test case: [2,4,6,8]. Initial instability is 6.\n\nFor each i:\n\ni=0: new_max is 8, new_min is 4. instability 4.\n\ni=1: new_max is 8, new_min is 2. instability 6.\n\ni=2: same as i=1.\n\ni=3: new_max is 6, new_min is 2. instability 4.\n\nSo the minimal is 4.\n\nWait, but what's the actual best move? Removing 8 gives 2,4,6, which has instability 4. Removing 2 gives 4,6,8, which has instability 4 as well. So yes.\n\nAnother case: [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Removing 3: new max is 6, new min is 1. So instability 5.\n\nBut if I remove 6: new max is 5, min is 1. So instability 4.\n\nSo according to our method, when i=5 (a[i]=6), new_max is 5, new_min is 1. instability 4.\n\nWhich is better than the initial 5.\n\nSo the algorithm correctly finds this.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- Compute initial instability.\n\n- For each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   if a[i] is the min (a[i] == a[0]):\n\n      new_min is a[1], new_max is a[-1]\n\n   elif a[i] is the max (a[i] == a[-1]):\n\n      new_max is a[-2], new_min is a[0]\n\n   else:\n\n      new_min is a[0], new_max is a[-1]\n\n   compute the instability and track the minimal.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the array.\n\nSort it.\n\nCompute initial instability.\n\nInitialize min_inst to initial instability.\n\nLoop through each index i:\n\n   if a[i] == a[0]:\n\n      new_min = a[1]\n\n      new_max = a[-1]\n\n   elif a[i] == a[-1]:\n\n      new_max = a[-2]\n\n      new_min = a[0]\n\n   else:\n\n      new_max = a[-1]\n\n      new_min = a[0]\n\n   current = new_max - new_min\n\n   if current < min_inst:\n\n      min_inst = current\n\nAt the end, output min_inst.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nWait, but what if the array has all elements the same?\n\nLike [5,5,5,5]. Then, removing any element leaves [5,5,5], with instability 0.\n\nIn code:\n\nFor each i, a[i] == a[0] and a[i] == a[-1].\n\nSo for each i:\n\nnew_min is a[1] (5), new_max is a[-2] (5). So instability is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2.\n\nSample input 2: [1,100000], sorted. For i=0, new_min is 100000, new_max 100000. So 0.\n\nSimilarly for i=1: same.\n\nAnother case: n=3, [1,2,3]. Remove 2: new array [1,3], instability 2.\n\nRemove 1: new array [2,3], instability 1.\n\nRemove 3: new array [1,2], instability 1.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nWait, according to the code:\n\nsorted array is [1,2,3].\n\ninitial instability is 2.\n\nFor i=0: a[i]=1, which is min. new_min is a[1]=2. new_max is 3. instability is 1.\n\nFor i=1: a[i]=2. not min or max. new_max=3, new_min=1. instability is 2.\n\nFor i=2: a[i]=3, which is max. new_max is 2. new_min is 1. instability is 1.\n\nSo the code correctly finds the minimal is 1.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the list a.\n\nSort a.\n\nCompute initial instability.\n\nInitialize min_inst to initial.\n\nLoop for each i:\n\n   if a[i] == a[0]:\n\n      new_min = a[1]\n\n      new_max = a[-1]\n\n   elif a[i] == a[-1]:\n\n      new_max = a[-2]\n\n      new_min = a[0]\n\n   else:\n\n      new_max = a[-1]\n\n      new_min = a[0]\n\n   current = new_max - new_min\n\n   if current < min_inst:\n\n      min_inst = current\n\nAt the end, print min_inst.\n\nWait, but what if n is 1? But according to the problem statement, n >=2.\n\nSo, no problem.\n\nWait, but in code, when a has length n, and i runs from 0 to n-1.\n\nWait, for n=2, when i=0: a[0] is a[0], new_min is a[1], new_max is a[1]. So current is 0.\n\nSimilarly for i=1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nLet me write the code accordingly.\n\nTesting sample input 1:\n\nInput:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7\n\nAfter sorting: [1,3,3,7]\n\ninitial instability is 6.\n\nLoop over each i:\n\ni=0: a[i] is 1, which is a[0]. new_min is a[1]=3, new_max is 7. current is 4.\n\ni=1: a[i]=3, not min or max. new_max is 7, new_min is 1. current is 6.\n\ni=2: same as i=1.\n\ni=3: a[i]=7, which is a[-1]. new_max is a[-2]=3, new_min is 1. current is 2.\n\nmin_inst becomes 2.\n\nSo output 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2\n\n1 100000.\n\nsorted: [1, 100000].\n\ni=0: new_min is 100000, new_max is 100000. current 0.\n\ni=1: same as i=0.\n\nSo output 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1,2,3]. As above.\n\nThe code returns 1.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nNow, let's think about the constraints.\n\nn can be up to 1e5. Sorting takes O(n log n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nEach iteration is O(1), so total time is O(n log n), acceptable.\n\nSo, now, writing the code.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\nSort a.\n\nCompute initial instability: a[-1] - a[0].\n\nInitialize min_inst to this value.\n\nThen loop through each i in range(n):\n\n   if a[i] == a[0]:\n\n      new_min = a[1]\n\n      new_max = a[-1]\n\n   elif a[i] == a[-1]:\n\n      new_max = a[-2]\n\n      new_min = a[0]\n\n   else:\n\n      new_max = a[-1]\n\n      new_min = a[0]\n\n   current = new_max - new_min\n\n   if current < min_inst:\n\n      min_inst = current\n\nPrint min_inst.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should look like this.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps us efficiently determine the potential new maximum and minimum values when an element is removed.\n2. **Initial Instability**: Calculate the initial instability of the entire array, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n3. **Iterate Through Each Element**: For each element, consider removing it and compute the new maximum and minimum values of the resulting array:\n   - If the removed element is the current minimum, the new minimum will be the next smallest element.\n   - If the removed element is the current maximum, the new maximum will be the previous largest element.\n   - Otherwise, both the new maximum and minimum remain unchanged.\n4. **Track Minimum Instability**: For each removal, compute the instability of the resulting array and keep track of the minimum instability encountered.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal element to remove, resulting in an O(n log n) time complexity due to sorting, which is suitable for large input sizes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nmin_inst = a[-1] - a[0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if a[i] == a[0]:\n        new_min = a[1]\n        new_max = a[-1]\n    elif a[i] == a[-1]:\n        new_max = a[-2]\n        new_min = a[0]\n    else:\n        new_max = a[-1]\n        new_min = a[0]\n    current = new_max - new_min\n    if current < min_inst:\n        min_inst = current\n\nprint(min_inst)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Array**: This step ensures that we can easily access the smallest and largest elements, which are crucial for determining the effect of removing any element.\n2. **Initial Instability Calculation**: By subtracting the minimum from the maximum of the sorted array, we get the initial instability.\n3. **Element Removal Simulation**: For each element, we simulate its removal and adjust the maximum and minimum values accordingly.
