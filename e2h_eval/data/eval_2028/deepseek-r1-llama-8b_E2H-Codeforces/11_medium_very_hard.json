A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Soft Drinking,\" and from the description, I need to calculate how many toasts each friend can make given certain resources.\n\nHmm. Let me try to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe friends have bought k bottles of soft drink, each with l milliliters. So the total drink is k multiplied by l. Each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. Since each friend makes a toast, for one toast, all n friends together consume n * nl milliliters. Wait, no—wait, each toast is per friend. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for m toasts, each friend drinks m * nl ml. But since there are n friends, the total drink consumed is n * m * nl. Right.\n\nThen, they have c limes cut into d slices each. So the total number of lime slices is c * d. Each toast requires one slice per friend, so for m toasts, n * m slices are needed because each of the n friends takes one slice each toast. So total slices required is n * m.\n\nSalt is p grams. Each toast requires np grams per friend. So for m toasts, each friend uses m * np grams. So total salt used is n * m * np.\n\nSo the goal is to find the maximum number of toasts m that satisfies all three constraints: drink, lime slices, and salt.\n\nThe approach is to compute the maximum possible m such that:\n\n1. n * m * nl ≤ k * l\n2. n * m ≤ c * d\n3. n * m * np ≤ p\n\nThen, m is the minimum of the possible values from each constraint, divided by n.\n\nWait, no. Wait, m is the same for all constraints. So we need to find the maximum m where all three inequalities hold.\n\nSo, for each of the three resources, we can compute the maximum possible m based on that resource alone, and then take the smallest of those as the answer.\n\nSo, for each resource:\n\n- Drink: (k*l) / (n * nl) → gives maximum possible m from drink.\n- Lime slices: (c*d) / n → gives maximum m from limes.\n- Salt: p / (n * np) → maximum m from salt.\n\nBut wait, division might not be integer. So we have to take the floor of each of these.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again.\n\nThe drink constraint is n*m*nl ≤ k*l → m ≤ (k*l)/(n*nl). Since m must be an integer, the maximum possible m for drink is the floor of (k*l) / (n*nl).\n\nSimilarly, for limes: n*m ≤ c*d → m ≤ (c*d)/n → floor(c*d/n).\n\nFor salt: n*m*np ≤ p → m ≤ p/(n*np) → floor(p/(n* np)).\n\nThen, the overall maximum m is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, let's test this logic.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5 → total drink is 20ml.\n\nEach toast per friend is 3ml, so per toast, all friends need 3 *3 =9ml. So for m toasts, 9m <=20 → m <= 20/9 = ~2.222 → floor is 2.\n\nLimes: c=10, d=8 → slices =80. Each toast needs 3 slices (3 friends). So 80/3=26.666 → floor is 26.\n\nSalt: p=100, np=1 → each toast per friend is 1g. So 3 * m *1 <=100 → 3m <=100 → m<=33.333 → floor 33.\n\nSo the min is 2. So the output is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Calculate the total drink available: total_drink = k * l.\n\n   The maximum m allowed by drink is (total_drink) // (n * nl). Because each toast uses n * nl ml.\n\n2. Calculate the total lime slices: total_lime = c * d.\n\n   The maximum m allowed by limes is (total_lime) // n.\n\n3. Calculate the salt available: p.\n\n   Maximum m allowed by salt is p // (n * np).\n\n4. The answer is the minimum of these three m values.\n\nSo now, I need to implement this in Python.\n\nNow, considering the input:\n\nThe input is a single line with 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nSo first, read the line, split into individual strings, convert to integers.\n\nCompute each of the three constraints.\n\nThen, take the minimum of them and print as a string.\n\nWhat about when any of the denominators are zero? Wait, but the problem says all inputs are positive integers, so n, nl, np are at least 1. So no division by zero.\n\nSo let's write code.\n\nRead the input line as a list of strings, then map to integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute each possible m:\n\ndrink_m = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nlime_m = (c * d) // n\n\nsalt_m = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_m, lime_m, salt_m)\n\nPrint str(result).\n\nTesting against the sample:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → drink_m = (20) / (3*3) → 20//9=2.\n\nlime_m: 10*8=80 //3=26.\n\nsalt_m:100/(3*1)=33.\n\nmin(2,26,33) is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → drink_m = (1000) / (5*4) → 1000 /20=50.\n\nlimes:1*19=19. 19//5=3.\n\nsalt:90/(5*3)=90/15=6.\n\nSo min(50,3,6) is 3. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample:10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\nDrink:1000*1000=1e6. n=10, nl=50. 10*50=500. 1e6 /500=2000.\n\nLimes:25*23=575. 575//10=57.\n\nSalt:1/(10*1)=0.1 → floor is 0.\n\nSo min is 0. So output is 0.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- When one of the resources is insufficient for even 1 toast.\n\nE.g., if drink allows 1, limes allow 2, salt allows 3. Then min is 1.\n\nAnother case: all resources allow 0. E.g., p is 0, but according to input constraints, p is at least 1. So no.\n\nWhat about when one of the denominators is very large, but the numerator is zero?\n\nNo, since all inputs are positive.\n\nAnother thing: when the resources are exactly enough for some m, but others are more. Like in the first sample.\n\nI think the code should work.\n\nSo the code is straightforward:\n\nRead the variables, compute each m, take the min, print.\n\nSo the Python code would be something like:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ndrink = k * l\ndrink_m = drink // (n * nl)\n\nlime = c * d\nlime_m = lime // n\n\nsalt_m = p // (n * np)\n\nmax_toasts = min(drink_m, lime_m, salt_m)\n\nprint(max_toasts)\n\nThat's it.\n\nLet me test with the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n\nAs before, outputs 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nOutput:3.\n\nSample3: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1' → 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: what if drink allows 5, limes 3, salt 4. So the min is 3.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, k=1, l=1. c=1, d=1, p=1. nl=1, np=1.\n\nSo drink_m=1//1=1.\n\nlime_m=1//1=1.\n\nsalt_m=1//1=1.\n\nmin is 1. So each friend can make 1 toast.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=2, k=2, l=2 → drink is 4. Each toast requires 2*2=4ml (each friend 2ml). So m for drink is 4/(2*2) =1.\n\nLimes: c=1, d=1 → 1 slice. Each toast requires 2 slices → 1//2=0.\n\nSo the min is 0. So output 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, lime slices, and salt per friend. The goal is to find the maximum number of toasts that can be made without running out of any resource.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Resources**: Each friend needs a specific amount of drink, a lime slice, and a certain amount of salt for each toast.\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of each resource available.\n3. **Determine Constraints**: For each resource, calculate how many toasts can be supported based on the total amount available and the consumption rate per toast.\n4. **Compute Maximum Toasts**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. This is determined by taking the minimum value from the three constraints calculated above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ndrink_total = k * l\ndrink_toast = drink_total // (n * nl)\n\nlime_total = c * d\nlime_toast = lime_total // n\n\nsalt_toast = p // (n * np)\n\nmax_toasts = min(drink_toast, lime_toast, salt_toast)\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, limes cut into slices, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters per toast, and grams of salt per toast.\n2. **Total Drink Calculation**: Calculate the total milliliters of drink available by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle.\n3. **Drink Constraint**: Determine how many toasts can be made based on the total drink available, considering each friend's consumption.\n4. **Lime Constraint**: Calculate the total number of lime slices available and determine how many toasts can be supported by this resource.\n5. **Salt Constraint**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total salt available.\n6. **Determine Maximum Toasts**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum of the values obtained from the drink, lime, and salt constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum number of toasts each friend can make without running out of any resource.",
