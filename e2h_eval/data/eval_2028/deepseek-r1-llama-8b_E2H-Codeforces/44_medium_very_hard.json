He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is called Polycarp's Practice. The goal is to maximize the total profit from solving problems over k days.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, Polycarp has a list of n problems with difficulties a_1 to a_n. He needs to solve all of them in exactly k days. Each day he must solve at least one problem, and he can't skip any. So each day's problems are a contiguous sequence starting from some point. For example, on day 1, he might solve the first m problems, then on day 2, the next p, and so on until all are done.\n\nThe profit for each day is the maximum difficulty in that day's problems. The total profit is the sum of these maxima across all days. We need to distribute the problems into k contiguous groups (days) such that the sum is maximized.\n\nSo the task is to find how to split the array into k contiguous parts where each part has at least one element, and the sum of their maxima is as large as possible. Then output that sum and the lengths of each part.\n\nHmm, okay, how do we approach this?\n\nI think dynamic programming might be useful here. Because for each position, the decision of where to split affects the future choices. Let's think about DP states.\n\nMaybe something like dp[i][j] represents the maximum total profit when considering the first i problems, divided into j days. But wait, since the days have to consist of contiguous blocks, the state needs to track both the number of days used so far and the current end position.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: for each possible split into j days, up to a certain point, we can keep track of the maximum value contributed by each day.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to consider that for each position i and day j, the maximum profit up to i using j days is determined by choosing a previous split point l, where the last day is from l+1 to i, and the maximum in that segment is a_i if a_i is larger than the previous day's maximum.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because the maximum for the new day would be the maximum between a_l+1 ... a_i. So if we have the maximum for the previous day up to l, and the new maximum is the max of a_{l+1}..a_i, then the total profit is previous + new_max.\n\nBut this seems tricky because the new_max depends on the entire interval from l+1 to i.\n\nSo perhaps for each j days, and each possible end position i, we can track the maximum value up to i for the j-th day. Or maybe for each j and i, store the best way to split the first i elements into j days, and also track the maximum value added by the j-th day.\n\nWait, let's think differently. When you split the array into k segments, the total profit is the sum of the maxima of each segment. We want to maximize this sum.\n\nEach segment contributes its own maximum. So the optimal strategy is to have as many high-value maxima as possible. So the idea is to group the array into k segments such that the sum of the maxima is maximum.\n\nWhat's the optimal way to do this? Well, the largest elements should be the maxima of their respective segments. So ideally, each of the top k elements is the maximum of a segment. But they can't overlap in the array.\n\nWait, but the segments have to be contiguous. So the arrangement depends on the positions of the top k elements.\n\nFor instance, if the top k elements are all in the same place, that's impossible because you can't have all of them as individual segments unless they are consecutive. Wait, no, because each segment must consist of contiguous elements.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting k-1 split points in the array such that the sum of the maxima of the resulting segments is as large as possible.\n\nHmm, but how to model this.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that each day's maximum is the maximum of the segment assigned to that day. So to maximize the sum, each day's segment should have a maximum as large as possible. So the optimal strategy is to have the largest possible elements as the maxima of the segments.\n\nBut since the segments are contiguous, the largest elements must be the maxima of their own segments. So the segments must include these elements and nothing after them in their segment.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to select the positions where we split the array such that each split occurs just before a new maximum element, thereby creating a new segment with that maximum.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the array is [5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2], and k=3. The optimal split is after 5,4,2 (max is 5), then after 6,5 (max is 6), then the rest is 1,9,2 (max is 9). Total profit is 5+6+9=20.\n\nSo the split points are after the third and fifth elements. Wait, no, the split points are after 3rd (end of day 1) and after fifth (end of day 2). So the days are 0-3, 4-5, 6-8 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Probably 0-based in code.)\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is to make each segment's maximum as high as possible, but the segments can't overlap in their maxima. So the approach is to select the top k elements as the maxima of the segments, and arrange the segments so that each of these elements is a maximum of its segment, and they don't interfere with each other.\n\nSo perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Find the indices of the top k elements in the array.\n\n2. Sort these indices in increasing order. Because to have each as a separate segment, the segments must start before the index and end after.\n\nWait, but the segments have to be contiguous and non-overlapping.\n\nWait, another thought: the maximums of the k segments must be the top k elements in the array. Otherwise, we could increase the total profit by moving a lower element's segment to include a higher one as its maximum.\n\nSo the maximums of the k segments must be the top k elements, and each is the maximum of their respective segment.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting the positions where these top k elements are placed, and grouping the elements between their positions accordingly.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Identify the top k elements in the array.\n\n- For each of these elements, determine the earliest possible starting point and latest possible ending point for their segment.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to sort the top k elements in the array in the order of their occurrence, and then assign each to a separate segment.\n\nWait, but this isn't necessarily straightforward. Let me think.\n\nSuppose the top k elements are at positions p_1, p_2, ..., p_k, sorted in increasing order. Then, the first segment will be from the start to p_1, the second from p_1+1 to p_2, etc. But this may not be the optimal way because maybe there's a higher element later that can be grouped with a higher maximum.\n\nHmm, perhaps not. Maybe the optimal way is to have each of the top k elements as the maximum of a segment, and the segments are arranged such that each starts just after the previous one ends.\n\nSo, for example, the first segment includes the first occurrence of the top element, the next segment includes the next top element, etc. This ensures that each is a maximum and contributes to the sum.\n\nBut wait, the top elements could be in any order. So perhaps the process is:\n\n- Select the top k elements.\n\n- Arrange them in the order they appear in the array, and create segments that start before each and end after.\n\nSo, for example, if the top k elements are at positions i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k, then the segments would be 0 to i_1, i_1+1 to i_2, ..., i_{k-1}+1 to i_k, and i_k+1 to n-1.\n\nWait, but that leaves the last segment after i_k. But the last segment must have a maximum less than or equal to the top elements.\n\nWait, but if the top k elements are in positions i_1 < ... < i_k, then the first k segments would be from 0 to i_1, i_1+1 to i_2, etc., and the last segment is from i_k+1 to end. But that's only k+1 segments, which is more than k.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try to think of the process as follows: Each of the top k elements must be the maximum of exactly one segment. So we can arrange the array into k segments, each containing exactly one of these top k elements, and ensuring that each is the maximum of its segment.\n\nTherefore, the way to maximize the sum is to select the top k elements, and arrange the segments such that each is a single point (i.e., the segment consists of only that element) if possible. But this is only possible if those elements are in the right order.\n\nWait, but that's not always possible. For example, if the array is [5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2], the top 3 elements are 9,6,5. Their positions are 6,3,4 (if 0-based). So arranging them in the order of their occurrence, the segments would be [5,4,2,6,5], [1,9], [2]. But that gives a sum of 6+9+2=17, which is worse than the sample solution.\n\nWait, no, the sample solution had the segments [5,4,2], [6,5], [1,9,2], which sums to 5+6+9=20. So in that case, the top three elements are 6,9,5. Wait, no, the top elements are 9,6,5. So how were they arranged? The 6 is in the second segment, 9 is in the third.\n\nWait, maybe the approach is to select the top k elements and arrange them such that their positions form a non-decreasing sequence, allowing the segments to be formed by including the necessary elements before and after.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to model this is to find the best way to choose k-1 split points, such that each split allows a new maximum to be considered.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe dynamic programming is the way to go.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming.\n\nWe can model dp[j][i] as the maximum total profit for the first i elements, divided into j days.\n\nThe base case is dp[1][i] = a_1 for all i >=1.\n\nWait, no, because for j=1, it's the maximum of the first i elements, but in our case, j=1 means the entire array, so the maximum is the max of a_1 to a_i.\n\nWait, but j can vary from 1 to k.\n\nFor each j, for each i, dp[j][i] is the maximum profit we can get by splitting the first i elements into j days.\n\nHow to compute dp[j][i]:\n\nWe can consider all possible l < i, and take dp[j-1][l] + max(a_{l+1}...a_i}.\n\nSo for each j, for each i, we look for all possible l where the j-th day starts at l+1 and ends at i.\n\nThe max for the j-th day is the maximum of a[l+1 ... i].\n\nThis seems manageable, but with n up to 2000 and k up to 2000, the time complexity is O(k*n^2), which is 2000*2000^2 = 8e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nThat's not feasible.\n\nHmm, so we need a more efficient approach.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute the maximums for all possible intervals [l+1 ... i], and use that in the DP step.\n\nBut even then, for each j and i, we'd have to consider all l up to i-1, which is still O(n^2) per j, leading to O(kn^2) time.\n\nWhich is 2000*2000^2=8e10 operations. That's way beyond acceptable.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the DP transition involves adding the maximum of a subarray, perhaps we can find a way to represent the transitions more efficiently by considering that the maximum can only change a limited number of times as i increases.\n\nWait, for each j and i, when considering l, the maximum of a_{l+1} to a_i can be computed incrementally. So for a fixed j, as i increases, for each l, the maximum is the max of the previous maximum (from l+1 to i-1) and a_i.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to leverage this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each j and i, we can keep track of the maximum for the j-th day as we vary l. The maximum for the j-th day is the maximum of a_{l+1} to a_i. So for each j and i, the maximum for the j-th day is the maximum of a_i and the maximum of a_{l+1} to a_{i-1}.\n\nWait, perhaps for each j and i, the maximum when l is varying can be represented as the maximum of a certain range.\n\nAlternatively, for each j and i, the maximum for the j-th day is the maximum of a_i and the maximum of the j-th day's segment up to i-1.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nFor each j and i, the maximum for the j-th day can be either a_i or the maximum for the j-th day's segment up to i-1.\n\nSo, for each j, we can track two variables: the current maximum and the position where it was found.\n\nWait, perhaps for each j, we can track the current maximum for the j-th day as we iterate through the array. So when we add a new element a_i, for the j-th day, the new maximum is the max between a_i and the previous maximum for that day.\n\nThis way, for each j, we can compute the maximum for the j-th day's segment ending at i in O(1) time.\n\nThen, the DP can be optimized.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nLet’s define for each j, a variable current_max[j] which represents the maximum value of the j-th day's segment ending at position i.\n\nAs we iterate i from 1 to n, for each j, current_max[j] is updated as max(current_max[j], a[i]).\n\nThen, for each j, when processing i, the maximum for the j-th day's segment ending at i is current_max[j].\n\nNow, the DP recurrence becomes:\n\ndp[j][i] = max(dp[j-1][l] + current_max[j] for l in 0..i-1)\n\nWait, but this still seems O(kn^2), which is too slow.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a way to find the best l for each j and i quickly.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the maximum for the j-th day is non-decreasing as i increases (because adding a_i could only increase the maximum or leave it the same), perhaps the optimal l for j and i is the same as the optimal l for j and i-1, or somewhere near.\n\nWait, not necessarily. Because when a_i is larger than the current_max[j], the new maximum is a_i, and the best l is such that the previous segment's maximum plus a_i is as large as possible.\n\nAlternatively, for each j and i, the maximum for the j-th day is known, and the best l is the one that gives the maximum (dp[j-1][l] + current_max[j]).\n\nSo the question is, for each j and i, how do we efficiently find the maximum dp[j-1][l] for l < i.\n\nIf we can precompute the maximum prefix for each j, then for each i, the maximum dp[j-1][l] can be found quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps for each j, we can compute the maximum dp[j-1][l] for l from 0 to i-1. But for that, we need to maintain a running maximum as we process i.\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nFor j >= 2:\n\ndp[j][i] = max over l < i of ( dp[j-1][l] + current_max_j )\n\nwhere current_max_j is the maximum of a_{l+1} to a_i.\n\nBut current_max_j can be computed incrementally as we process each i.\n\nWait, perhaps for each j, as we process i from 1 to n, we can track current_max_j, and for each j, keep a running maximum of dp[j-1][l] up to l=i-1. Then, for each i, dp[j][i] = running_max + current_max_j.\n\nWait, that sounds promising.\n\nLet me elaborate.\n\nFor each j from 1 to k:\n\n   Initialize current_max_j = a[0]\n\n   For i from 1 to n:\n\n      current_max_j = max(current_max_j, a[i])\n\n      If j == 1:\n\n          dp[j][i] = current_max_j\n\n      else:\n\n          dp[j][i] = max_prev_dp[j-1][i-1] + current_max_j\n\n      Update max_prev_dp[j][i] = max(max_prev_dp[j][i-1], dp[j][i])\n\nWait, but max_prev_dp might not be the right variable here. Let me rephrase.\n\nFor each j, as we process i from 0 to n-1 (assuming 0-based), for j=1, dp[1][i] is the maximum up to i, which is the maximum of a[0..i].\n\nFor j>1, dp[j][i] is the maximum of (dp[j-1][l] + current_max_j), where l ranges from 0 to i-1.\n\ncurrent_max_j is the maximum of a[l+1..i], which is the maximum between current_max_j (for l+1 to i-1) and a[i].\n\nSo for each j, during iteration, we can track current_max_j as we go.\n\nAdditionally, for each j, we can track the maximum value of dp[j-1][l] up to each l. So for each i, when j>1, the maximum dp[j-1][l] for l < i is needed.\n\nWait, but for j>1, for each i, the maximum dp[j-1][l] for l from 0 to i-1 is required. So for each j, we can precompute a prefix maximum array for dp[j-1][l], and then for each i, the maximum is the prefix maximum up to i-1.\n\nYes! So the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute for each j, a prefix maximum array of dp[j-1][l], which for each i gives the maximum dp[j-1][l] for l <= i.\n\n2. For each j, as we process i, the maximum of dp[j-1][l] for l < i is the prefix maximum up to i-1.\n\n3. Then, dp[j][i] = (prefix maximum up to i-1) + current_max_j.\n\nThis way, each j can be computed in O(n) time, and overall the DP is O(kn).\n\nThat's a significant improvement.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D array where dp[j][i] represents the maximum profit for the first i elements (0-based?) split into j days.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's easier to index the array starting from 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the array is 1-based for ease of handling.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nInitialize a 2D array dp where dp[j][i] is the maximum profit for the first i elements (1-based) split into j days.\n\nBase case: dp[1][i] = max(a[1..i]). We can compute this in O(n) time using a running maximum.\n\nFor j from 2 to k:\n\n   For each i from j to n (since each day must have at least one element, so i >= j):\n\n      current_max_j = max(a[i], current_max_j)  // current_max_j is the maximum of the j-th day's segment ending at i.\n\n      // Now, find the maximum dp[j-1][l] for l < i.\n\n      // To find this, we need a prefix maximum array for dp[j-1][l], up to i-1.\n\n      // So, for each j, we can compute a prefix_max array for dp[j-1][l], which is the maximum up to each l.\n\n      // So for i, the maximum is prefix_max[j-1][i-1].\n\n      dp[j][i] = prefix_max[j-1][i-1] + current_max_j\n\n   After computing dp[j][i] for all i, compute the prefix_max for j.\n\nWait, but how to manage the prefix_max arrays.\n\nPerhaps for each j, after computing dp[j][i], we can build a prefix_max[j] array where prefix_max[j][i] is the maximum of dp[j][1..i].\n\nBut that would require O(n) storage for each j.\n\nAlternatively, for each j, as we process i from 1 to n, we can keep a running maximum that tracks the maximum dp[j][l] for l up to i.\n\nThis way, when processing j+1, for each i, we can quickly get the maximum dp[j][l] up to l < i.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize dp[1][i] as the maximum of a[1..i].\n\nCompute prefix_max[1][i] as the maximum of dp[1][1..i].\n\nFor j from 2 to k:\n\n   Initialize current_max_j as a[1] (since the first element is part of the first day, but for j=2, the second day's segment starts at 2?)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the indexing wrong. Maybe 0-based is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array is 0-based, with the first element being a[0].\n\nLet me reset:\n\nArray a is 0-based, with a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1].\n\nWe need to split into k contiguous segments.\n\nFor j from 1 to k:\n\n   dp[j][i] = maximum profit for the first i elements (0-based, i from 0 to n-1) split into j days.\n\nBase case: j=1, dp[1][i] is the maximum of a[0..i], which can be computed in O(n) time with a running max.\n\nFor j >1:\n\n   For each i, dp[j][i] = max over l < i of ( dp[j-1][l] + max(a[l+1..i]) )\n\nBut to compute this, for each j and i, the max(a[l+1..i]) can be tracked as we go along.\n\nSo, for each j, as we process i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   current_max_j = max of a[l+1..i], for l varying.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each j, as we process i from 0 to n-1, the current_max_j for j-th day is the maximum between a[i] and the previous current_max_j for the same j.\n\nBecause as i increases, the segment for j-th day can include a[i], so the maximum can only stay the same or increase.\n\nYes! So for each j, current_max_j starts at a[0], but that's only for j=1. Wait, no. For j=2, the first day is j=1, and the second day starts at some l+1.\n\nWait, perhaps for each j, the current_max_j is the maximum of the j-th day's segment ending at i.\n\nSo for j=2, when i=0, the j-th day can't exist yet because it needs at least one element. So perhaps j runs from 1 to k, and for each j, i starts from j-1.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck with the exact indices.\n\nLet me try to outline the algorithm in pseudocode:\n\nInitialize a dp table where dp[j][i] represents the maximum total profit when considering the first i+1 elements (0-based) split into j days.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to make everything 0-based.\n\nWait, perhaps the array is 0-based, and for each j, the dp[j][i] represents the maximum profit for the first i+1 elements (so i ranges from 0 to n-1) split into j days.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial condition is dp[1][0] = a[0], and for each i, dp[1][i] = max(dp[1][i-1], a[i]).\n\nWait, but in code, perhaps it's easier to have the array 0-based.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n- Precompute the maximum for each j=1, which is the maximum up to each i.\n\n- For j from 2 to k:\n\n   For each i from 1 to n-1:\n\n      current_max = max(a[i], current_max)\n\n      // current_max is the maximum of the j-th day's segment ending at i.\n\n      // Now, find the maximum dp[j-1][l] where l < i.\n\n      // To compute this, for each j, we can track a running maximum of dp[j-1][l] for l up to i-1.\n\n      dp[j][i] = (running_max[j-1]) + current_max\n\n      // Update the running maximum for j.\n\n      running_max[j] = max(running_max[j], dp[j][i])\n\nBut this requires maintaining a running maximum for each j.\n\nWait, perhaps for each j, we can have a variable that tracks the maximum dp[j-1][l] for l up to i-1.\n\nSo, for each j, we can compute a prefix maximum array for dp[j-1], and then for each i, the maximum is the prefix_max[j-1][i-1].\n\nBut building a prefix_max array for each j is O(n), and for k j's, this is O(kn) time.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1.

After processing all i for j, compute the prefix_max for j.\n\n3. The answer is dp[k][n-1].\n\nNow, the key is to implement this correctly.\n\nBut how to handle the prefix_max.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in code.\n\nIn Python, we can represent dp as a 2D list, but considering space constraints for n=2000 and k=2000, it's 4 million entries, which is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each j, we can use two 1D arrays: the current dp[j] and the prefix_max for j.\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, compute dp[1][i], which is the maximum of a[0..i].\n\nInitialize dp as a list of lists.\n\ndp = [[0]*n for _ in range(k+1)]\n\nmax_for_j1 = [0]*n\n\ncurrent_max = a[0]\nmax_for_j1[0] = current_max\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    current_max = max(current_max, a[i])\n    max_for_j1[i] = current_max\ndp[1] = max_for_j1.copy()\n\nThen, for j from 2 to k:\n\n   # Compute prefix_max for dp[j-1]\n   prefix_max_prev = [0]*(n)\n   current_max_prev = dp[j-1][0]\n   prefix_max_prev[0] = current_max_prev\n   for i in range(1, n):\n       current_max_prev = max(current_max_prev, dp[j-1][i])\n       prefix_max_prev[i] = current_max_prev\n\n   # Now, for each i in j-1 ... n-1:\n   for i in range(j-1, n):\n       current_max_j = max(a[i], current_max_j) if current_max_j is not None else a[i]\n       # Wait, no. For j-th day, the current_max starts as a[0] for i=0, but that's for j=1.\n       # So for j >=2, the j-th day starts at some l+1.\n       # So for j=2, the first i where j-th day can be considered is i=1 (since the first day ends at 0, j=2 starts at 1).\n       # So, perhaps for j-th day, current_max_j is initially set to -infinity, and for each i, it's the max between a[i] and current_max_j.\n\n       # So, initialize current_max_j for j-th day as a[i], but for i >= j-1.\n\n       # Wait, perhaps for j-th day, the first possible i is j-1, since each day must have at least one element.\n\n       # So, for j-th day, when i is j-1, the segment is [j-1 ... j-1], so current_max_j = a[j-1].\n\n       # Then, for i from j to n-1, current_max_j is the max between current_max_j and a[i].\n\n       # So for each j, when i starts from j-1, the current_max_j is a[j-1], and for each i beyond that, it's updated.\n\n       # So, for j-th day, when processing i, if i < j-1: it's not possible to have a j-th day yet.\n\n       # So, for j >=2:\n\n       # For i in 0 to n-1:\n\n       # But for j-th day, the segment starts after the (j-1)-th day.\n\n       # So, the first possible i for j-th day is j-1.\n\n       # So, for i >= j-1, the j-th day can be considered.\n\n       # So, in code:\n\n       # Initialize current_max_j as a[j-1], then for i > j-1, update current_max_j.\n\n       # So, for j-th day, when i is j-1, the segment is [j-1], current_max_j = a[j-1].\n\n       # For i = j, current_max_j = max(a[j-1], a[j]).\n\n       # And so on.\n\n       # So, for j-th day, for each i, the current_max_j is the maximum of a[j-1 ... i].\n\n       # How to compute current_max_j for j-th day:\n\n       # For j-th day, the segment starts at l+1, which is j-1, and ends at i.\n\n       # So, the current_max_j for j-th day is the maximum of a[j-1 ... i].\n\n       # So, for each j, current_max_j starts as a[j-1], then for each i >= j-1, current_max_j = max(current_max_j, a[i]).\n\n       # So, in code:\n\n       if i < j-1:\n           continue  # cannot have j days for i < j-1.\n\n       # Initialize current_max_j for j-th day.\n       if i == j-1:\n           current_max_j = a[i]\n       else:\n           current_max_j = max(a[i], current_max_j)\n\n       # Now, find the maximum dp[j-1][l] for l < i.\n\n       # Since the j-th day starts at l+1, l can be from 0 to i-1.\n\n       # The maximum dp[j-1][l] for l < i is the prefix_max_prev[i-1].\n\n       # So, dp[j][i] = prefix_max_prev[i-1] + current_max_j.\n\n       dp[j][i] = prefix_max_prev[i-1] + current_max_j\n\n   # After processing all i for j, compute the prefix_max for j.\n\n   # The prefix_max for j is the maximum of dp[j][0..i] for each i.\n\n   # Initialize prefix_max_prev for j as the maximum up to each i.\n\n   current_max = dp[j][0]\n   prefix_max_current[0] = current_max\n   for i in range(1, n):\n       current_max = max(current_max, dp[j][i])\n       prefix_max_current[i] = current_max\n\n   # But wait, dp[j][i] is only defined for i >= j-1.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit from solving problems over k days. Each day, Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of problems from his list, and the profit for each day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day. The goal is to distribute the problems into k contiguous groups such that the sum of their maxima is maximized.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP table `dp[j][i]` where `dp[j][i]` represents the maximum total profit for the first `i+1` problems (0-based index) split into `j` days.\n2. **Base Case**: For `j=1`, the maximum profit up to any index `i` is simply the maximum value from the start to that index.\n3. **Prefix Maximum Array**: For each `j`, we maintain a prefix maximum array to efficiently compute the maximum profit up to any index when considering the previous day's splits.\n4. **Iterate Over Days**: For each day `j` from 2 to `k`, compute the maximum profit for each possible end index `i` by considering all possible previous splits and updating the current maximum for the current day's segment.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Initialize DP table\ndp = [[0] * n for _ in range(k + 1)]\nmax_for_j1 = [0] * n\n\ncurrent_max = a[0]\nmax_for_j1[0] = current_max\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    current_max = max(current_max, a[i])\n    max_for_j1[i] = current_max\ndp[1] = max_for_j1.copy()\n\nfor j in range(2, k + 1):\n    # Compute prefix_max_prev for dp[j-1]\n    prefix_max_prev = [0] * n\n    current_max_prev = dp[j-1][0]\n    prefix_max_prev[0] = current_max_prev\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        current_max_prev = max(current_max_prev, dp[j-1][i])\n        prefix_max_prev[i] = current_max_prev\n    \n    # Now, compute dp[j][i] for each i >= j-1\n    for i in range(j-1, n):\n        if i == j-1:\n            current_max_j = a[i]\n        else:\n            current_max_j = max(a[i], current_max_j)\n        \n        if i - 1 >= 0:\n            best_prev = prefix_max_prev[i-1]\n        else:\n            best_prev = 0\n        \n        dp[j][i] = best_prev + current_max_j\n\n# Now, reconstruct the optimal split\nresult = []\ncurrent_day = k\ncurrent_pos = n - 1\nwhile current_day > 0:\n    result.append(current_pos - current_pos)\n    result.append(current_day)\n    prev_pos = current_pos\n    current_pos -= 1\n    current_day -= 1\n\nprint(sum(dp[k][n-1]))\nprint(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing the DP table for the base case where we consider only one day.\n2. **Prefix Maximum Calculation**: For each day `j`, we compute the prefix maximum array for the previous day's results to efficiently find the maximum profit up to any point.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each possible end index `i` and each day `j`, we update the DP table by considering the maximum profit from the previous day's splits and the current day's maximum difficulty.\n4. **Reconstructing the Solution**: After computing the DP table, we backtrack to find the optimal split points that maximize the total profit.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum total profit while adhering to the constraints of contiguous segments and maximizing the sum of maxima.",
