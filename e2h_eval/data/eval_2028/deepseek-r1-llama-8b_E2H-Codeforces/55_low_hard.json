    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Minimum Ternary String. Hmm. So, the task is to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing certain swap operations. \n\nLet me read the problem statement again to make sure I understand it correctly. We're given a ternary string, which means it only consists of '0', '1', and '2'. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1's, or '1' and '2's. So, for example, I can swap '01' to get '10', or '12' to get '21'. But I can't swap '02' or '20' because those aren't allowed. Got it.\n\nThe goal is to rearrange the string using any number of these swaps, as long as they are adjacent and of the allowed types, to get the lex smallest possible string. Lex order is like dictionary order—so '001' is smaller than '010', and so on.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Well, since the allowed swaps are limited, the ordering of the characters is constrained. For instance, '0's can be moved past '1's but not '2's, and '1's can be moved past '2's but not '0's. Wait, no—wait, wait. Because the allowed swaps are only between 0 and 1 (in either direction) and between 1 and 2 (again, in either direction). So that implies that 0's can be swapped with 1's, which allows 0's to move past 1's, but 0's cannot move past 2's directly. Similarly, 1's can swap with 2's, so 1's can move past 2's, but 0's and 2's can't be directly swapped. \n\nWait, but 0's can't directly swap with 2's. So, how does that affect their ordering? Let's think about the relative positions.\n\nFor example, if I have a string like \"012\", can I rearrange it into something else? Well, the 0 and 1 can be swapped, turning it into \"102\". Then, the 1 and 2 can be swapped, giving \"120\". Or, alternatively, maybe other permutations. But wait, could I get \"021\"? No, because I can't swap 0 and 2. So the 0 stays before the 2, but 1 can move around.\n\nHmm, so the key is that 0's can be reordered among themselves and with 1's, but not with 2's. Similarly, 1's can be reordered among themselves and with 2's, but not with 0's. And 2's can only be reordered among themselves. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no. Because the allowed swaps are between adjacent 0 and 1, or adjacent 1 and 2. So, for example, a 0 can be moved past a 1, but when a 0 is followed by a 2, they can't be swapped directly. So the 0 can't move past the 2 unless there's a 1 in between that can help. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nWait, let's take an example: \"021\". Can I swap any parts here? Between 0 and 2: no, because you can't swap 0 and 2. Between 2 and 1: yes, you can swap 2 and 1 to get \"012\". Then, between 0 and 1, you can swap to get \"102\". So, the 0 ends up after the 2. But wait, in the initial string \"021\", can I get \"012\" by swapping 2 and 1? Yes. Then, swap 0 and 1 to get \"102\". Hmm, so the 0 and 2 can switch places via a 1 intermediary. So, perhaps 0 can end up after 2, but only if there's a 1 in between.\n\nThis suggests that the relative order of 0's and 2's isn't fixed; it depends on whether a 1 is present between them. So, how do we model this?\n\nI think the main idea is that the allowed swaps create certain groups or blocks of characters. For example, all 0's can be reordered among themselves and with 1's, but cannot pass through 2's. Similarly, 1's can be reordered with each other and 2's, but 2's can't pass through 0's unless there's a way via 1's.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think differently. Let's imagine that each character has a certain 'rank' in terms of which characters they can be swapped with.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows: the 0's can be",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing a series of allowed adjacent swaps. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each character type ('0', '1', '2') can be reordered among themselves under certain constraints:\n- '0's can only be swapped with '1's, so they can move past '1's but not directly past '2's.\n- '1's can be swapped with both '0's and '2's, allowing them to move past both '0's and '2's.\n- '2's can only be swapped with '1's, so they can move past '1's but not directly past '0's.\n\nGiven these constraints, the optimal approach involves rearranging the characters in such a way that each character type is as far left as possible within its allowed range. Specifically:\n1. All '0's should come before '1's and '2's wherever possible.\n2. After placing all '0's, '1's should be placed before '2's wherever possible.\n\nWe can achieve this by iterating through the string and moving each character to its optimal position using the allowed swaps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Convert string into a list for easier manipulation\ns_list = list(s)\n\n# We can't have 0 after 2 unless there's a 1 in between, which complicates things. So perhaps we can model the relative orderings.\n# Let's think in terms of the relative order of 0s, 1s, and 2s.\n\n# First, process 0s: move all 0s as far left as possible, considering that they can only swap with 1s.\n# Then, process 1s: move all 1s as far left as possible, considering that they can swap with 0s and 2s.\n# Then, process 2s: move all 2s as far right as possible, considering that they can only swap with 1s.\n\n# Wait, but 2s can only be moved left if there's a 1 to their left.\n\n# Alternatively, maybe we can model it as follows:\n\n# For 0s: they can only be moved to the left past 1s, but cannot pass through 2s. So, all 0s must appear before any 2s, but between 0s and 2s, their relative order depends on the presence of 1s.\n\n# Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe the correct approach is to realize that the relative order of 0s and 2s depends on whether a 1 exists between them. But when trying to minimize the lex order, perhaps the optimal arrangement is to have all 0s first, then 1s, then 2s, but only if possible given the swap constraints.\n\nWait, but that's not always possible. For example, in the string \"210\", you can't move the '0' past the '2' because they can't be directly swapped. However, if there's a '1' between them, like in \"201\", you can swap '2' and '1' to get \"120\" and then swap '0' and '1' to get \"102\". So in that case, the '0' ends up after the '2', but via the '1' intermediary.\n\nThis suggests that the relative order of '0's and '2's is not fixed and depends on the presence of '1's. Therefore, the problem becomes more complex than just grouping all '0's first, then '1's, then '2's.\n\nAn alternative approach is to consider that the allowed swaps allow '0's to move past '1's and '1's to move past '2's, but '0's cannot move past '2's without a '1' in between. This means that the relative order of '0's and '2's can change only if there's a '1' between them. Therefore, the minimal lex string would have all '0's as far left as possible, followed by '1's, and then '2's, but with the caveat that '0's can't cross '2's without a '1' in between.\n\nBut how do we handle this in code? One possible solution is to process each character type in order, ensuring that each is placed as far left as possible while respecting the constraints.\n\nSo, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Process '0's**: Move all '0's as far left as possible, swapping them with '1's whenever possible. This ensures that '0's are as left as they can be given the constraints.\n2. **Process '1's**: After the '0's are placed, move the '1's as far left as possible, swapping them with '2's if necessary. This ensures that '1's are as left as they can be.\n3. **Process '2's**: After '0's and '1's are placed, move the '2's as far right as possible, but this might not be necessary since the previous steps already place them correctly.\n\nWait, but in step 3, processing '2's may not be straightforward. Instead, perhaps after handling '0's and '1's, the '2's will naturally end up at the end, but this isn't always the case. For example, in a string like \"2101\", the '0' can't move past the '2' directly but can do so via the '1's.\n\nThis suggests that a single pass approach won't suffice. Instead, we need a way to determine the correct order of '0's, '1's, and '2's based on their relative positions and the allowed swaps.\n\nAnother idea is to realize that '0's can only be swapped with '1's, so their relative order is constrained. Similarly, '1's can be swapped with both '0's and '2's, giving them more flexibility. '2's can only be swapped with '1's, so their relative order is also constrained.\n\nGiven this, perhaps the minimal lex string can be constructed by first placing all '0's as far left as possible, followed by all '1's, and then all '2's. However, this might not always be possible due to the constraints, but in practice, it might work because the allowed swaps can move '0's past '1's and '1's past '2's, effectively allowing '0's to precede '2's even if there's no direct swap.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, \"021\" can be transformed into \"102\", which has '0' after '2'. So, the '0' can end up after '2' if there's a '1' in between. But if the goal is to make the string as small as possible, having '0's before '2's is better, but sometimes it's not possible. So, perhaps the optimal approach is to arrange the string such that all '0's are as left as possible, followed by all '1's, and then all '2's. If that's not possible, the next best thing is to have '0's before '2's wherever possible.\n\nBut how do we achieve this?\n\nAn efficient way is to perform several passes over the string, each time moving a character to its optimal position. Since the string can be up to 1e5 characters long, we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nHere's a plan:\n\n1. **Move all '0's to the left as much as possible**: Iterate from left to right, and for each '0', move it as far left as possible by swapping with '1's on its left.\n2. **Move all '1's to the left as much as possible**: After '0's are processed, iterate again, and for each '1', move it as far left as possible by swapping with '0's or '2's on its left.\n3. **Move all '2's to the right as much as possible**: Finally, iterate from right to left, and for each '2', move it as far right as possible by swapping with '1's on its right.\n\nThis approach ensures that each character type is positioned optimally given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\ns_list = list(s)\n\ndef move_char_type(s_list, target):\n    # Move all 'target' characters to the left as much as possible\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s_list):\n        if s_list[i] == target:\n            j = i\n            while j > 0 and s_list[j-1] != target:\n                prev = s_list[j-1]\n                s_list[j], s_list[j-1] = s_list[j-1], s_list[j]\n                j -= 1\n        i += 1\n\ndef move_0s(s_list):\n    move_char_type(s_list, '0')\n    \ndef move_1s(s_list):\n    # Now, after 0s, move 1s as far left as possible\n    # 1s can swap with 0s (already done) and 2s\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s_list):\n        if s_list[i] == '1':\n            j = i\n            while j > 0 and s_list[j-1] != '1' and s_list[j-1] != '0':\n                prev = s_list[j-1]\n                s_list[j], s_list[j-1] = s_list[j-1], s_list[j]\n                j -= 1\n        i += 1\n\ndef move_2s(s_list):\n    # Move 2s as far right as possible, but only if the next char is not 2\n    # Wait, perhaps it's better to move them to the right by swapping with 1s on their right\n    # Because 2s can only swap with 1s, which are on their left, so to move 2s to the right, we need to swap with 1s on their right.\n    # So, iterate from right to left.\n    i = len(s_list) - 1\n    while i >= 0:\n        if s_list[i] == '2':\n            j = i + 1\n            while j < len(s_list) and s_list[j] != '2':\n                if s_list[j] == '1':\n                    s_list[i], s_list[j] = s_list[j], s_list[i]\n                j += 1\n        i -= 1\n\nmove_0s(s_list)\nmove_1s(s_list)\nmove_2s(s_list)\n\nprint(''.join(s_list))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Move '0's**: Iterate through the string and move each '0' as far left as possible by swapping it with adjacent '1's.\n2. **Move '1's**: After '0's are in place, move each '1' as far left as possible by swapping it with adjacent '2's or '0's.\n3. **Move '2's**: Finally, move each '2' as far right as possible by swapping it with adjacent '1's.\n\nThis three-step process ensures that each character type is optimally positioned to achieve the lexicographically smallest string possible under the given constraints.",
