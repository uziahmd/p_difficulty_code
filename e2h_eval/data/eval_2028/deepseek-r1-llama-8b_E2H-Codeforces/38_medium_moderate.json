    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about creating a directed graph that's p-reachable and then finding the minimum number of nodes required for that, along with the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs.\n\nHmm, first I need to understand what a p-reachable graph is. From the problem statement, a p-reachable graph has exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v, and u and v are reachable from each other. So these are edges that form a bidirectional path between two distinct nodes, and we count all such unordered pairs as one each.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says an ordered pair (u, v) where u != v, there's a path from u to v, and no path from v to u. Oh, right, that's the definition of a unidirectional pair. But p-reachable is a different concept. Oh wait, no—p-reachable refers to the number of such ordered pairs where u < v and they are reachable both ways. So each such unordered pair {u, v} contributes exactly one to p if u and v are mutually reachable.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem statement. It says: \"exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other.\" So for each such pair where u and v can reach each other, regardless of direction, but ordered as u < v. So the count is based on the number of such ordered pairs, which is equal to the number of unordered pairs {u, v}, since for each such pair, exactly one of (u, v) or (v, u) will satisfy u < v.\n\nSo, for example, if we have two nodes A and B connected both ways, then the count p is 1 because (A, B) is counted as (min(A,B), max(A,B)), which is one ordered pair. So in this case, p is 1.\n\nNow, the task is to find the minimal number of nodes needed to create such a p-reachable graph. Then, among all such graphs with this minimal node count, find the maximum possible number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nUnidirectional pairs are those where (u, v) is present (i.e., a path exists from u to v) but not from v to u. And for each such pair, u != v.\n\nSo, the problem has two parts:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that there exists a p-reachable directed graph with n nodes.\n2. Among all such graphs with n nodes, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet's think about part 1 first.\n\nTo minimize the number of nodes, we want to arrange the graph in a way that maximizes the number of bidirectional edges per node, thus allowing more p-reachable pairs with fewer nodes.\n\nWait, but p is the number of such ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and they are mutually reachable. So each such pair contributes 1 to p. So for a graph with n nodes, the maximum possible p is C(n, 2) = n*(n-1)/2. But that's only if every possible pair is connected both ways. But in our case, p is given, and we need to construct a graph where exactly p such ordered pairs exist.\n\nWait, no. Because in a directed graph, it's possible to have some pairs where u can reach v but v cannot reach u. So in that case, (u, v) is considered a unidirectional pair, but it doesn't contribute to p because p counts only the ordered pairs where u < v and they are mutually reachable.\n\nWait, no. p counts the ordered pairs (u, v) where u != v, there's a path from u to v, and no path from v to u. Or wait, no. No, the p-reachable definition is different. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the problem defines p as the number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. So, for each pair {u, v}, if they are reachable both ways, then exactly one ordered pair (the one where u < v) contributes to p. So, the value of p is equal to the number of such unordered pairs.\n\nSo, for example, if all n nodes form a single strongly connected component, then p would be C(n, 2). Because every pair is mutually reachable, and each contributes 1 to p.\n\nBut in our problem, p can be any number up to C(n, 2), depending on how the graph is structured.\n\nSo the first task is to find the minimal n such that the sum of the contributions of all the strongly connected components (SCCs) in the graph equals p.\n\nEach SCC contributes C(k, 2) to p, where k is the size of the SCC. Because within each SCC, every pair of nodes is mutually reachable, contributing exactly one to p for each unordered pair.\n\nAdditionally, nodes in different SCCs do not contribute to p. Because if u is in one SCC and v is in another, and u can reach v, then v can't reach u (since they are in different SCCs). So, (u, v) would be a unidirectional pair, but not contribute to p.\n\nSo, the total p is the sum over all SCCs of C(k_i, 2), where k_i is the size of the i-th SCC.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal n such that the sum of C(k_i, 2) over all SCCs equals p.\n\nOur goal is to find the minimal n where the sum of C(k_i, 2) equals p.\n\nWe can model this as a problem where we choose a set of integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_m such that the sum of C(k_i, 2) is p, and the sum of k_i is as small as possible.\n\nBecause each k_i is the size of an SCC, which must be at least 1, and all k_i are positive integers.\n\nSo, the minimal sum of k_i is achieved when the k_i are as large as possible. Because C(k, 2) increases quadratically with k, so larger k's contribute more to p per node. So to minimize the total number of nodes, we should maximize the sizes of the SCCs.\n\nWait, no. Because for a given p, choosing larger k_i's gives more contribution per node, thus requiring fewer nodes.\n\nWait, yes. For example, if p=3, the minimal n is 3. Because C(3,2)=3, so one SCC of size 3 gives p=3. So n=3.\n\nIf p=4, then the minimal n is 5. Because C(3,2) is 3, and then we can add an SCC of size 2, which contributes 1. So 3+1=4, but wait 3+1=4, but 3+1 is 4 nodes. Wait, but 3+1 is 4, but C(3,2)+C(1,2)=3+0=3, which is less than 4. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as trying to maximize the sum of C(k_i, 2) for a given n. So, to achieve the maximum sum, each k_i should be as large as possible. Because for a fixed n, the sum of C(k_i, 2) is maximized when the k_i are as unequal as possible. For example, having one large SCC and the rest as small as possible.\n\nWait, no, wait. Actually, for a given sum of k_i, the sum of C(k_i, 2) is maximized when the k_i are as unequal as possible. Because C(k, 2) is a convex function, so by Jensen's inequality, the sum is maximized when the variables are as spread out as possible.\n\nBut in our case, we're trying to find the minimal n such that the sum of C(k_i, 2) equals p. So, for a given p, what is the minimal n?\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest integer such that the maximum possible sum of C(k_i, 2) for that n is >= p.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: the maximum sum for a given n is when all the nodes are in a single SCC, so sum is C(n,2). So, for a given p, find the smallest n where C(n,2) >= p. But wait, no, because sometimes you can get p by combining smaller SCCs, leading to a smaller n.\n\nWait, no. Because C(n,2) is the maximum possible sum for n nodes. So if p is less than C(n,2), then perhaps you can have a smaller n. Wait, that's not correct. For example, if p is 3, the minimal n is 3 because C(3,2)=3. If p is 4, the minimal n is 5 because C(5,2)=10 >=4, but perhaps a smaller n can also achieve p=4.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose n=3: maximum sum is 3. So p=3 needs n=3. For p=4, can we have n=4? Because C(4,2)=6 >=4. But perhaps a combination of two SCCs: say, one of size 3 (contributing 3) and one of size 1 (contributing 0), total 3. Not enough. Alternatively, two SCCs of size 2 each: 2*(2*1/2)=2, which is less than 4. Or one SCC of size 3 (3) plus another of size 1: total 3. Still less than 4. So n=4 can't reach p=4. So we need n=5: perhaps one SCC of size 3 (3) and one of size 2 (1), sum 4. So n=5.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, can we have three SCCs of size 2 each? That would give 3 * 1 = 3, which is still less than 4. Hmm, no. So n=5 is needed.\n\nSo the approach is: for a given p, find the minimal n such that the sum of C(k_i, 2) over all possible k_i (summing to n) equals p.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest integer where the maximal sum of C(k_i, 2) for that n is >= p. But that doesn't seem right because the sum can be adjusted by varying the k_i.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest n where the sum of C(k_i, 2) can be made equal to p.\n\nBut how to compute this n.\n\nI think the way to approach it is to find the minimal n where the maximal possible sum for n nodes is >= p, but perhaps it's better to model the problem as finding the minimal n such that the sum of C(k_i, 2) can be p.\n\nWait, for example, if p=0, the minimal n is 0, since there are zero ordered pairs.\n\nWait, the sample input includes p=0, output 0 0. So yes.\n\nFor p=1, the minimal n is 2. Because one SCC of size 2 contributes 1.\n\nFor p=3, n=3.\n\nFor p=4, n=5.\n\nWait, but how to find the minimal n.\n\nPerhaps the minimal n is the smallest integer such that the sum of C(k_i, 2) across all k_i (summing to n) can be exactly p.\n\nWait, but that seems vague. Maybe it's better to model the problem as follows: for a given n, the maximum possible sum is C(n, 2). The minimal sum is 0 (when there are no edges). So for a given p, the minimal n is the minimal n where C(n, 2) >= p.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because for n=3, C(3,2)=3, which is exactly p=3. For p=4, n=3's maximum is 3 <4, so n must be at least 4. But wait, can n=4 have a sum of 4? Yes: for example, one SCC of size 3 (3) and one of size 1 (0), sum is 3. No. Or two SCCs of size 2 and 2: sum is 1+1=2. Or one SCC of size 4: sum is 6. So for n=4, the maximum sum is 6, but can you get a sum of 4?\n\nYes: for example, one SCC of size 3 (3) and another of size 1 (0), sum is 3. Or maybe a single SCC of size 4, but that gives sum 6. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, wait: the sum is the sum of C(k_i, 2) for each SCC. So for n=4, possible sums range from 0 to 6.\n\nCan we get sum 4? Let's see:\n\nWhat combinations of k_i's sum to 4, and their C(k_i, 2) sum to 4.\n\nPossible options:\n\n- One SCC of size 3 (C(3,2)=3) and one of size 1 (C(1,2)=0). Sum is 3. Not enough.\n\n- Two SCCs of size 2 (each C(2,2)=1). Sum is 2. Not enough.\n\n- One SCC of size 4: C(4,2)=6. Too much.\n\n- What about three SCCs: two of size 2 and one of size 0? No, size can't be zero.\n\nWait, maybe two SCCs of size 2 and one of size 0. No, because sizes are at least 1.\n\nWait, maybe three SCCs: sizes 2, 1, 1. Sum is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1. No.\n\nAlternatively, one SCC of size 3, one of size 1: sum is 3. Still not 4.\n\nWait, so can n=4 produce p=4? It seems like no. Because the maximum possible sum for n=4 is 6, but the minimal sum is 0. So is 4 achievable?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to find a set of k_i's where the sum of C(k_i, 2) equals 4.\n\nWhat's 4 as a sum of C(k_i, 2)'s.\n\nLooking for combinations:\n\nCase 1: One SCC of size 3 (3) and one of size 1 (0). Sum 3. No.\n\nCase 2: One SCC of size 4: sum 6.\n\nCase 3: Three SCCs: two of size 2 (each 1) and one of size 0. No, sizes can't be zero.\n\nCase 4: One SCC of size 2 and another of size 2: sum 2.\n\nCase 5: One SCC of size 2, another of size 1, and another of size 1: sum is 1 + 0 + 0 =1.\n\nCase 6: One SCC of size 3, another of size 1: sum 3.\n\nNo, none of these cases sum to 4. So perhaps for p=4, n=5 is required.\n\nWait, let's check n=5.\n\nWhat's the maximum sum for n=5: C(5,2)=10.\n\nCan we find a combination of k_i's that sum to 5 and their C(k_i, 2) sum to 4.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sum of C(k_i, 2) is 4.\n\nSo possible options:\n\n- One SCC of size 3 (3) and another of size 2 (1). Sum is 4. So total n=3+2=5.\n\nYes! So for n=5, we can have two SCCs: one of size 3 and one of size 2. Their C(k_i, 2) sum to 3+1=4.\n\nSo p=4 requires n=5.\n\nSo, for p=4, the minimal n is 5.\n\nSo, the approach is to find the minimal n such that there exists a partition of n into k_i's where the sum of C(k_i, 2) is p.\n\nThe question now is, how to compute this minimal n.\n\nIdea: For each possible n, determine the minimal number of nodes required, which is the smallest n where the maximum sum for that n is >= p, and there's a way to get exactly p.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model it as finding the minimal n such that the minimal sum of C(k_i, 2) for a given n is <= p, and the maximum sum is >= p.\n\nWait, no. Because for a given n, the sum can vary between 0 and C(n, 2). So for p to be achievable for a certain n, there must exist a set of k_i's whose sum is n and sum of C(k_i, 2) is p.\n\nSo, the minimal n is the smallest integer such that the maximal possible sum for n is >= p, but also that there exists a way to split n into k_i's so that the sum of C(k_i, 2) is p.\n\nWait, but for example, when p=4, the minimal n is 5. Because for n=4, the maximal possible sum is 6, but we can't reach 4. So n=5 allows us to reach 4.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find the minimal n such that the minimal sum for n is <= p <= maximal sum for n.\n\nWait, but the minimal sum for n is 0 (if all k_i are 1), and the maximal sum is C(n, 2). So for any p between 0 and C(n, 2), inclusive, n is sufficient.\n\nSo, the minimal n is the smallest n where C(n, 2) >= p.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because for n=3, C(3,2)=3. So p=3 can be achieved with n=3. But for p=2, can it be achieved with n=3? Well, yes: for example, one SCC of size 2 and one of size 1. Then C(2,2)=1. So p=1. To get p=2, perhaps n=3 isn't sufficient. Wait, but wait, n=3: the maximum sum is 3, and the minimal sum is 0. So for p=2, can we have a sum of 2?\n\nYes: for example, one SCC of size 2 (contributing 1) and one of size 1 (contributing 0). Sum is 1. Not 2.\n\nWait, or perhaps another arrangement. For example, two SCCs: one of size 3, but that would contribute 3. Or perhaps three SCCs of size 1 each, sum 0. So no. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. For n=3, can we have a sum of 2?\n\nYes: one SCC of size 3 contributes 3. No, that's too much. Alternatively, perhaps one SCC of size 2 and another of size 1: sum is 1. So to get sum 2, perhaps another configuration. Wait, perhaps two SCCs: one of size 2 and another of size 1. Sum is 1. Or perhaps three SCCs: two of size 1 and one of size 1. Sum is 0.\n\nHmm, so for n=3, the possible sums are 0,1,3. So p=2 is not achievable with n=3. Therefore, the minimal n for p=2 would be 4.\n\nWait, let's check n=4.\n\nFor n=4, can we have a sum of 2?\n\nYes: two SCCs of size 2 each. Each contributes 1. Sum is 2. So total n=4.\n\nYes. So for p=2, minimal n is 4.\n\nSo, this suggests that the minimal n is not necessarily the smallest n where C(n,2) >= p. Because in the case of p=2, C(3,2)=3 >=2, but n=3 is insufficient. So n=4 is needed.\n\nSo, the initial approach is incorrect. Thus, we need a more nuanced way to compute the minimal n.\n\nAlternative approach: The minimal n is the smallest integer such that the maximum possible sum for n is >= p, and the minimal possible sum for n is <= p.\n\nWait, but for any n, the sum can be anything between 0 and C(n,2). So for any p in [0, C(n,2)], it's possible. So, the minimal n is the smallest n where C(n,2) >= p.\n\nBut earlier examples show that this is not always the case. For p=2, C(3,2)=3 >=2, but n=3 is not sufficient. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering whether p can be achieved with n=3.\n\nIn n=3, can the sum be 2?\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nIf the graph consists of three nodes, and the structure is such that two of them form a bidirectional edge, and the third node is isolated.\n\nThen, the sum of C(k_i, 2) is C(2,2) + C(1,2) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nBut p=2 requires the sum to be 2.\n\nIs there a way to have sum=2 in n=3?\n\nNo, because the only possible SCCs are of size 1, 2, or 3.\n\n- All three in one SCC: sum is 3.\n- Two in one SCC (size 2), one isolated: sum is 1.\n- Three isolated: sum is 0.\n\nSo, for n=3, p can be 0,1,3. So p=2 is not achievable.\n\nThus, the minimal n for p=2 is 4, as earlier thought.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier logic, the minimal n is the smallest n where C(n, 2) >= p. For p=2, C(3,2)=3 >=2, so n=3 should suffice. But it's not possible. So the approach is incorrect.\n\nThus, the initial idea is wrong. So I need to find a better way.\n\nAnother approach: For a given n, the minimal possible sum is 0, the maximal possible sum is C(n,2). But the sum can take any value in between, depending on the distribution of the SCC sizes.\n\nWait, is that true? For example, can any integer between 0 and C(n,2) be achieved?\n\nNot necessarily. For instance, for n=3, the possible sums are 0,1,3. So 2 is missing.\n\nThus, the problem is to find the minimal n such that p can be expressed as the sum of C(k_i, 2) for some collection of k_i's, where the sum of k_i's is n.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of representing p as a sum of triangular numbers.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal n such that p can be written as the sum of C(k_i, 2), where each k_i >=1, and the sum of k_i is n.\n\nAnd then, for that minimal n, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nWait, but how to compute this.\n\nAn alternative idea is to find for each possible n, the minimal and maximal possible sum of C(k_i, 2) for that n, and see for which n p falls into that range.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n is determined by the following:\n\nThe maximum sum for n-1 is less than p, and the maximum sum for n is >= p.\n\nWait, but this is not necessarily the case. As seen in the p=2 example, n=3 has maximum sum 3, which is >=2, but p=2 cannot be achieved with n=3.\n\nSo, that approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative plan: We can model the problem as finding the minimal n such that there exists a way to represent p as a sum of triangular numbers, where the sum of the roots (k_i) is n.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each n, the minimal sum is 0 and the maximal sum is C(n,2). And any p between 0 and C(n,2) is possible except for some cases.\n\nBut without a way to compute this, perhaps I should look for a mathematical pattern.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern for various p and n.\n\np=0: n=0.\n\np=1: n=2 (C(2,2)=1).\n\np=2: n=4 (two SCCs of size 2 each: 1+1=2).\n\np=3: n=3 (one SCC of 3).\n\np=4: n=5 (one SCC of 3, another of 2: 3+1=4).\n\np=5: n=4 (one SCC of 4: C(4,2)=6 >=5, but wait can we have p=5 with n=4? Let's see: perhaps one SCC of 3 (3) and another of 1 (0): sum 3. No. Or one SCC of 2 (1), and two of size 1 (0 each): sum 1. No. Or three SCCs: one of size 3 (3), others of 1. Sum 3. No. So for p=5, n=5 may be needed. Or perhaps n=4 can't reach 5, so n=5.\n\nWait, let's think: for n=4, can we have sum=5?\n\nOnly if we have an SCC of size 4: sum is 6, which is more than 5. So no. Or perhaps a combination: one SCC of 3 (3) and another of 1 (0), sum 3. No.\n\nSo for p=5, n=5 is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's see:\n\nOne SCC of size 4 contributes 6, which is more than 5. So no. So n=5 is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps for n=5, can we have sum=5?\n\nYes: one SCC of size 3 (3), one of size 2 (1): sum 4. No. Or one of size 4 (6), which is over. Or maybe two SCCs of size 3 (3+3=6), but that's more than 5. Or perhaps one of size 3 (3), and two of size 1 (0 each): sum 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps three SCCs: one of size 3 (3), and two of size 1 (0 each). Sum 3.\n\nNo, so for p=5, n=5 may not be sufficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to model the problem as the minimal n where the maximum sum for n is >= p, and then check if p can be represented as a sum of C(k_i, 2) for some k_i's that sum to n.\n\nBut without knowing the exact way to compute this, perhaps it's better to precompute for various p's.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest n where the maximum sum for n is >= p, and the minimal sum is <= p.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest n such that the sum of the first m integers' C(k_i, 2) can reach p.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the problem as finding the minimal n where the sum of C(k_i, 2) can be p, and the sum of k_i is n.\n\nThis feels similar to the problem of expressing a number as a sum of squares, but with triangular numbers.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nAn alternative idea is to realize that each C(k, 2) is (k*(k-1))/2.\n\nSo, the problem is to find a set of integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_m, each >=1, such that sum_{i=1 to m} (k_i*(k_i -1))/2 = p, and sum k_i = n, with n minimized.\n\nSo, perhaps for each n, we can try to find if p can be represented as the sum of C(k_i, 2) for some k_i's that sum to n.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest n such that the sum of the first t triangular numbers is >= p.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is roughly sqrt(2p), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, considering that C(k, 2) is about k²/2. So, for sum S = sum C(k_i, 2) = p.\n\nAssuming all k_i are as large as possible, perhaps the minimal n is around sqrt(2p).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is such that the sum of C(k_i, 2) can be p, with the sum of k_i being n, and n is the minimal possible.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think of the problem as follows: For a given n, the maximum possible sum is C(n, 2). So, for p <= C(n, 2), it's possible to have a graph with n nodes and p reachable pairs.\n\nThus, the minimal n is the smallest integer where C(n, 2) >= p.\n\nWait, but earlier examples show that this isn't always the case. Like for p=2, C(3,2)=3 >=2, but n=3 isn't sufficient. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps for n=3, it's possible to have p=2.\n\nWait, is that possible? Let me think.\n\nSuppose we have three nodes: A, B, C.\n\nSuppose A and B form a bidirectional edge. So, C(2,2)=1.\n\nB and C form a bidirectional edge. So, another 1.\n\nAnd A and C form no edge. So, the sum is 2. So p=2.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the graph is structured as two separate SCCs: {A, B} and {B, C}. Or wait, no. Because if A can reach B, and B can reach C, then A can reach C via B, but C cannot reach A. So the SCCs are {A, B, C} if all can reach each other. Wait, no. Because A can reach B and C, but B and C can reach each other but not A. So the entire graph is strongly connected? No, because from C, you can't reach A.\n\nWait, no. In this case, the graph is a chain: A → B → C. So the SCCs are {A}, {B}, {C}. So each is a single node. So the sum of C(k_i, 2) is 0 for each. So p=0.\n\nSo, that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, suppose A and B are in an SCC, and C is in another SCC, but A can reach C. Then, (A, C) is a unidirectional pair, but not a mutual pair. So it doesn't contribute to p.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the sum is still 1 (from the {A, B} SCC).\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Perhaps for n=3, it's impossible to have p=2. So, the minimal n is 4.\n\nThus, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect, and the minimal n is indeed the smallest n where C(n,2) >= p, but in some cases, even if C(n,2)>=p, n may not be sufficient.\n\nBut that seems complicated. So perhaps I should think of the problem differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest integer such that the sum of the first m terms of the series is >= p.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest n where the maximum possible sum (C(n,2)) is >=p and the minimal sum (0) is <=p.\n\nWhich is always true, but that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest integer such that the sum of the floor((sqrt(8p +1)-1)/2) is >= p.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, perhaps I should look for a pattern.\n\nLet me list the minimal n for various p values.\n\np=0: n=0.\n\np=1: n=2.\n\np=2: n=4.\n\np=3: n=3.\n\np=4: n=5.\n\np=5: n=5.\n\np=6: n=4 (since C(4,2)=6).\n\nWait, for p=6: n=4 is sufficient, as a single SCC of size 4.\n\nSo, for p=5: can n=5 be used? Yes, because C(5,2)=10 >=5, but can we arrange the sum to be 5?\n\nYes: one SCC of size 3 (3) and another of size 2 (1), sum 4. No. Wait, that's sum 4. To get 5, perhaps one SCC of size 4 (6) and another of size 1 (0): sum 6. No. Or perhaps two SCCs of size 3: sum 3+3=6. No. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. For p=5, n=5 may not be sufficient. So perhaps the minimal n is 5, but I'm not seeing how to get p=5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing that multiple SCCs can contribute.\n\nWait, perhaps for n=5, we can have an SCC of size 3 (3) and another of size 2 (1), sum 4. Or perhaps three SCCs: size 3, 1, 1: sum 3. Or four SCCs: 2, 2, 1, 0: but no, size can't be zero. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is 5 for p=5, and the way to achieve the sum is to have an SCC of size 4 (6) and subtract one, but that's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to achieve p=5 is to have one SCC of size 4 (6) and subtract 1 somehow, but that's not allowed because the sum can't be decreased beyond the sum of C(k_i, 2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n for p=5 is 6. Because C(5,2)=10 >=5, but perhaps for n=5, it's impossible to reach 5.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Maybe I should accept that the minimal n is the smallest n where C(n,2) >= p, and proceed accordingly, even though it may not hold for some cases.\n\nWait, but for p=2, C(3,2)=3 >=2, but n=3 isn't sufficient. So the approach is incorrect.\n\nThus, I'm stuck.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps the minimal n is the minimal integer such that the sum of C(k_i, 2) can be p, and the sum of k_i is n.\n\nBut to find this n, perhaps we can model it as follows:\n\nWe can represent p as the sum of C(k_i, 2), where each k_i >=1.\n\nWe can think of this as trying to find a set of integers where each term is a triangular number, and their sum equals p.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to note that C(k,2) = (k^2 -k)/2.\n\nSo, the problem becomes finding a set of integers k_i such that sum (k_i^2 -k_i)/2 = p, and sum k_i = n.\n\nWe can rewrite this as sum (k_i^2 -k_i) = 2p.\n\nSo, sum k_i^2 - sum k_i = 2p.\n\nBut sum k_i is n, so sum k_i^2 = 2p + n.\n\nWe need to find the minimal n such that there exists a set of k_i's with sum k_i =n and sum k_i^2 = 2p +n.\n\nHmm, that's an interesting equation.\n\nSo, for each possible n, we can check if 2p +n can be expressed as the sum of squares of k_i's, where sum k_i =n.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n is found by trying n starting from 0 upwards, and for each n, checking if 2p +n can be written as the sum of squares of positive integers that sum to n.\n\nBut for large p (up to 2e5), this approach may not be feasible.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a formula or pattern.\n\nLet me consider that the minimal n is the smallest n such that sum k_i^2 >= 2p +n.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is such that sum k_i^2 = 2p +n, and sum k_i =n.\n\nWe can rearrange this as sum (k_i^2 -k_i) = 2p.\n\nWhich is the same as sum (k_i(k_i-1)) = 2p.\n\nWhich is exactly the original condition.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the minimal n where sum (k_i(k_i-1)) = 2p, and sum k_i =n.\n\nBut again, this doesn't immediately suggest a solution.\n\nAnother Idea: For each n, the minimal sum of k_i(k_i-1) is when all k_i are as equal as possible.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a directed graph that is p-reachable and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-reachable Graphs**: A p-reachable graph has exactly `p` ordered pairs `(u, v)` where `u < v` and both nodes are reachable from each other. This means each unordered pair `{u, v}` contributes exactly one to `p`.\n\n2. **Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)**: Each SCC in the graph contributes `C(k, 2)` to `p`, where `k` is the size of the SCC. The goal is to partition the graph into SCCs such that the sum of these contributions equals `p`.\n\n3. **Minimizing Nodes**: To minimize the number of nodes, we need to maximize the contribution of each SCC. This is achieved by making the SCCs as large as possible.\n\n4. **Finding Minimum Nodes**: The minimum number of nodes `n` is determined by finding the smallest `n` such that the sum of contributions from SCCs can equal `p`. This involves checking possible partitions of `n` into sums of triangular numbers.\n\n5. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Among all such minimal node configurations, we need to find the configuration with the maximum number of unidirectional pairs. This is achieved by ensuring as few bidirectional edges as possible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_min_n(p):\n    if p == 0:\n        return 0\n    max_possible = (1 << 20)  # Some large number to cover possible p up to 2e5\n    for n in range(1, max_possible):\n        max_sum = n * (n - 1) // 2\n        if max_sum >= p:\n            # Now check if p can be formed as a sum of C(k_i, 2)\n            s = 0\n            k = n\n            while k > 0:\n                if s + k*(k-1)//2 <= p:\n                    s += k*(k-1)//2\n                    k -= 1\n                else:\n                    break\n            if s >= p:\n                return n\n    return 0\n\ndef main():\n    p = int(input().strip())\n    min_n = find_min_n(p)\n    if min_n == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n    max_uni = 0\n    # Now, for the minimal n, find the maximum unidirectional pairs\n    # The maximum unidirectional pairs is achieved when the graph has as many edges as possible without creating cycles.\n    # So, arrange the graph as a DAG with layers.\n    # The maximum number of unidirectional pairs is the total number of edges minus the number of edges in the transitive closure (bidirectional edges).\n    # Wait, no.
