You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vitaly and Cycle.\" Hmm, I need to find the minimum number of edges to add to a graph to form an odd-length cycle (that's more than one vertex) and also count the number of ways to do that.\n\nAlright, let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nThe input is an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges. No loops or parallel edges. The task is to compute two things: t, the minimal number of edges needed to form such a cycle, and w, the number of ways to achieve this.\n\nWait, the cycle has to be simple, meaning no repeated vertices except for the start and end. And it has to be an odd length, like 3,5,7 etc., not even like 4,6.\n\nSo, first, I need to find all possible cycles that can be formed by adding edges, find the ones with the smallest size, and then count how many ways to achieve that.\n\nBut wait, the minimal t is the key. So perhaps we can approach this by checking each connected component of the graph and see if it already has a cycle, or can easily form one by adding edges.\n\nHmm, but maybe the problem can be broken down into analyzing each connected component separately because adding edges can't help between components unless they are connected somehow, but that would require edges between them. But since the added edges can be any, perhaps it's better to consider each component on its own and see how much it contributes to forming an odd cycle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal t is determined by the component that can form an odd cycle with the least additions.\n\nWait, but the overall graph may consist of multiple connected components. For each component, I can calculate the minimal edges required to form an odd cycle within that component. Then, the overall minimal t is the minimum across all components. And the number of ways is the sum of the ways for each component that achieves this minimal t.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because adding edges to one component doesn't affect another, except when considering the entire graph's structure. But since each way is a set of edges, adding edges to different components don't interfere with each other. So, the total number of ways is the product of the number of ways for each component that contributes to the minimal t.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem requires that the added edges form a single cycle. Oh wait, no. Wait, the cycle can be formed in any connected component. So, perhaps the minimal t is the minimal over all components of the minimal edges needed for that component to have an odd cycle.\n\nAnd the number of ways is the sum of the number of ways for each component that can reach that minimal t, multiplied together? Or wait, no—because each way is a combination of adding edges to any of the contributing components.\n\nWait, no. Because each way corresponds to choosing a particular component to form an odd cycle, adding the necessary edges. So the total number of ways is the product of the number of ways for each component that can contribute to the minimal t.\n\nWait, no. Suppose there are two components, A and B. Component A can form an odd cycle with t1 edges in w1 ways, and component B can form an odd cycle with t2 edges in w2 ways. If t1 is the minimal t across all components, then the total number of ways is the sum of w1 and w2. Because you can choose either component A or B to form the cycle, and each contributes their own ways.\n\nWait, no. Because the cycle must be in a single component. So, if I have multiple components, each of which can form an odd cycle, then for each component, I can compute how many ways to make it form an odd cycle, and then the minimal t is the minimal t among all these possibilities, and the total number of ways is the sum of the ways for each component that achieves that minimal t.\n\nWait, but the problem allows adding edges to any part of the graph. So, for example, if component A needs 1 edge to form a 3-cycle, and component B needs 2 edges to form a 5-cycle, then the minimal t is 1. The number of ways is the number of ways for component A, which is w_A. Because adding those edges to component A forms the cycle, and the other edges are optional. So, for each component, compute the minimal edges and ways, then take the component(s) with the smallest t, and sum their w's.\n\nAh, right. So the approach is:\n\n1. For each connected component in the graph, determine the minimal number of edges that need to be added to form an odd cycle. Also, determine the number of ways to do this.\n\n2. Among all components, find the component(s) that have the minimal t. Sum their w's to get the total w.\n\n",

Now, the minimal edges to add depends on the component's structure\n        # We need to find the minimal edges to add to make an odd cycle\n        # This can be tricky, but perhaps we can model it as finding the minimal number of edges to connect a back edge in a tree-like structure\n        #

This is equivalent to finding the minimal number of edges to connect two nodes in a way that forms an odd cycle\n        # So, for each component, compute the minimal edges required to form an odd cycle and the number of ways\n\n        # For now, let's assume that any component with at least two vertices can form an odd cycle by adding edges appropriately\n        # We'll need to compute for each component the minimal t and w\n\n        # Let's proceed step by step\n\n        # First, check if the component is a tree or not\n        # If it's a tree, then adding one edge will create exactly one cycle\n        # So, we need to see if the added edge creates an odd cycle\n\n        # Compute the number of vertices with odd degrees in the component\n        # According to the handshaking lemma, the number of vertices with odd degree is even\n        # So, to form a cycle, the component must have at least one cycle, but if it's a tree, adding an edge creates exactly one cycle\n\n        # But for our problem, the component may not form an odd cycle after adding edges, so we need to ensure that the cycle is odd\n\n        # This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to model the component and find the minimal edges needed.\n\n        # For the purpose of this problem, let's consider that any component with at least two vertices can potentially form an odd cycle by adding the minimal edges.\n\n        # However, to find the exact number of edges and ways, we need a more sophisticated approach.\n\n        # For now, let's proceed with the following:\n\n        # If the component has a cycle, check if it's odd. If yes, then t=0 and w=1.\n\n        # Else, find the minimal edges to add.\n\n        # But this is not sufficient because a component might not have a cycle but can form one by adding edges.\n\n        # So, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n        # For each component, if it's a tree, then adding one edge creates exactly one cycle. We need to check if that cycle is odd.\n\n        # If the tree has a path between two leaves where the distance is odd, adding the edge will create an odd cycle.\n\n        # Otherwise, it's even.\n\n        # So, for each component, we can compute the minimal edges and ways.\n\n        # This requires some graph traversal and cycle detection.\n\n        # But given time constraints, perhaps a simpler approach is to note that:\n\n        # The minimal number of edges to add is 1 if the component has at least two vertices and is not a single-edge bridge.\n\n        # Wait, but this is not accurate.\n\n        # So, perhaps the minimal t is 1 if the component is not already cyclic, but forming an odd cycle requires specific conditions.\n\n        # Given the complexity, perhaps the solution is to note that the minimal t is 1 if the component is not already containing an odd cycle, and the number of ways is based on the number of possible pairs of vertices that can form an odd cycle.\n\n        # Alternatively, considering the problem constraints, perhaps the minimal t is 1 for any component that is not already having an odd cycle, and the number of ways is the number of possible edges that can form such a cycle.\n\n        # But I'm not entirely sure. Perhaps the correct approach is to realize that for any connected component with at least two vertices, the minimal t is 0 if the component already contains an odd cycle, else 1 if the component can form an odd cycle by adding one edge, otherwise higher.\n\n        # However, for the sake of this problem, perhaps the minimal t is either 0 or 1.\n\n        # In the example provided, the first test case had a component that could form a cycle with 1 edge added, and another component that was a triangle (which is an odd cycle already), so the minimal t was 1.\n\n        # So, perhaps the minimal t is 1 if any component can form an odd cycle with 1 edge, and 0 if any component already has an odd cycle.\n\n        # Thus, the approach is:\n\n        # For each component, if it already has an odd cycle, then t can be 0, and w is the number of such components.\n\n        # Else, for each component, the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is the number of possible edges that can form an odd cycle.\n\n        # So, the overall minimal t is min(t_i for all components), and the number of ways is the sum of ways for components that achieve this t.\n\n        # So, in code:\n\n        # For each component:\n\n        # -
