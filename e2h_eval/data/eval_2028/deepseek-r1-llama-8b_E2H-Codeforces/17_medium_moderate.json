He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Prefixes and Suffixes.\" Hmm, Ivan has a string s of length n, and I don't know it. He tells me all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so lengths from 1 to n-1). But he doesn't say which are which—whether they're prefixes or suffixes. My task is to determine for each of the 2n-2 given strings whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the actual string s.\n\nWait, the output is a string of 'P's and 'S's where each character corresponds to one of the input strings. So for each input string, I need to decide if it's a prefix (mark as P) or a suffix (mark as S).\n\nThe first thing I need to figure out is how to determine the correct labels for each string. Since the problem says that the input is such that exactly two strings exist for each length, and that there exists at least one possible string s that satisfies all the conditions, I can work towards building s step by step.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Maybe I can reconstruct the string s based on the given information and then verify each input string's role.\n\nSo, the key idea is to find s such that for each string in the input, if it's a prefix, then s starts with it; if it's a suffix, s ends with it.\n\nBut how do I find s? Well, perhaps I can start by considering the shortest possible prefix and suffix and build up s from there.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For each possible pair of candidate prefix and suffix of a certain length, check if their combination forms a valid string s.\n\nBut that might be computationally expensive, but since n is up to 100, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find the correct s by considering the candidates for the entire string s and then checking which one fits all the input strings as either prefix or suffix.\n\nHmm, but how do I get s?\n\nAnother approach: Let's find all possible candidates for the full string s by looking for the longest possible common prefix among all possible candidates and similarly for the suffix. Wait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this as follows:\n\nEach input string can be a prefix or a suffix. So for each position in s, certain characters are fixed based on the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nLet's try to find the possible s by starting from the beginning and end.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe first character of s must be the first character of some prefix of length 1. Similarly, the last character of s must be the last character of some suffix of length 1.\n\nBut wait, since all the prefixes and suffixes are known, perhaps I can find the first character of s by looking at the prefixes of length 1. All the length-1 prefixes must have the same first character as s. Because if a string is a prefix of s, it must start with the first character of s. Similarly, any suffix of s must end with the last character of s.\n\nSo, for all length-1 prefixes, the first character is the same. Similarly, for all length-1 suffixes, the last character is the same.\n\nSo, the first step is to collect all the length-1 prefixes and suffixes.\n\nWait, no. Because the prefixes and suffixes are given in arbitrary order. So, among the 2n-2 strings, for length 1, there are exactly two strings. One is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\nWait, no. Because for n=5, the number of prefixes is 4, and the number of suffixes is 4. So for each length l from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings: one is a prefix of s, the other is a suffix of s.\n\nAh, right. So for each l, two strings, one P and one S.\n\nSo, for l=1, there are two strings: one is the first character of s, the other is the last character of s.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the prefixes for l=1 are all the possible single-character prefixes of s. But since s has only one first character, any length-1 prefix must be equal to that first character. So for l=1, the two strings provided must consist of the same character. Otherwise, it's impossible. But the problem says it's guaranteed that the input is consistent.\n\nSo, for l=1, both strings are the same character. So that's the first character of s.\n\nSimilarly, for l=1, the suffixes would also have the same character as the last character of s.\n\nSo, the first step is to find the first character of s and the last character of s.\n\nHow? For l=1, collect all the strings, and see which ones are the prefixes and suffixes. But wait, for l=1, the two strings are the same, because the first character of s is the only possible single-character prefix, and the last character is the only possible single-character suffix.\n\nSo, for l=1, both the prefix and suffix are the same string. Thus, the first character of s is the only character in both length-1 prefixes and suffixes.\n\nSo, let's extract all the length-1 strings. They should all be the same. That gives us the first and last character of s.\n\nOnce we have the first and last character, we can proceed.\n\nNow, for longer prefixes and suffixes.\n\nLet's think about the structure of s. It must start with a certain string of length k and end with a certain string of length m, where k + m <= n.\n\nBut how to find s.\n\nMaybe we can model s as the concatenation of a prefix P and a suffix S, where P is a certain string of length l, and S is a string of length m, such that l + m = n.\n\nBut how to find P and S.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to go is to find the maximum possible prefix P such that all longer prefixes are extensions of P. Similarly, find the maximum possible suffix S such that all shorter suffixes are compatible with S.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible candidate for the full string s, check whether all the given input strings can be either prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nBut how many candidates are there? For n=100, the number could be large, but perhaps manageable.\n\nWait, but reconstructing s directly is tricky. Let's think differently.\n\nAnother idea: For each position i in s, the ith character must be the same across all possible prefixes that end at i, and the same for the suffixes that start at i.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's think of s as a sequence of characters. Each position in s is determined by the intersection of all possible prefixes and suffixes that reach that position.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can build s step by step.\n\nLet's consider building s from the start and the end.\n\nStart from the first character: it's fixed as the only character in the length-1 prefixes.\n\nThen, for the second character, look for all length-2 prefixes and suffixes that fit.\n\nWait, perhaps for each length l, the possible prefixes are the ones that extend the previous prefix.\n\nSimilarly for the suffixes.\n\nWait, maybe we can model s as follows:\n\ns starts with a certain string P, and ends with a certain string S. The combined length of P and S must be exactly n.\n\nSo, for l in 1..n-1:\n\n- The prefix of length l is a substring of P.\n- The suffix of length l is a substring of S.\n\nBut how to find P and S.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that for each l, the prefix of length l must be a prefix of the suffix of length l. Or vice versa.\n\nWait, no. Because s has a certain prefix P and a suffix S, and for a certain l, the prefix P_l is the first l characters of s, and the suffix S_l is the last l characters of s.\n\nIf l is less than or equal to n-1, then P_l is a prefix, and S_l is a suffix.\n\nBut perhaps P_1 is the first character, P_2 is the first two, etc., up to P_{n-1}.\n\nSimilarly, S_1 is the last character, S_2 is the last two, etc.\n\nSo, for each l, the prefix P_l is the first l characters of s, and the suffix S_l is the last l characters.\n\nThus, for each l, P_l is a string, and S_l is another string.\n\nNow, for the given input, for each l, there are two strings: one is P_l, the other is S_l.\n\nSo, the approach could be:\n\n- For each l from 1 to n-1, collect the two strings, one of which is P_l and the other is S_l.\n\nBut how to assign which is which.\n\nWait, but P_l must be a prefix of P_{l+1}, and S_l must be a suffix of S_{l+1}.\n\nSo, for l=1, P_1 is the first character, and S_1 is the last character.\n\nFor l=2, P_2 must start with P_1, and S_2 must end with S_1.\n\nSo, perhaps we can build P and S step by step, ensuring that each step is consistent.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For l=1:\n   - All length-1 strings are the same (since both are the same), so c = the first character of s, and d = the last character of s.\n\n2. For l=2:\n   - There are two strings: one is P_2 (the first two characters of s), the other is S_2 (the last two characters of s).\n   - P_2 must start with P_1 (c).\n   - S_2 must end with S_1 (d).\n\n3. For l>2:\n   - P_l must be formed by adding a character to P_{l-1}.\n   - Similarly, S_l must be formed by adding a character to S_{l-1}.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because S_l is the last l characters of s, which could be formed by adding a character to S_{l-1}, but that depends on how s is built.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each l, the two strings for that l must satisfy that one is a prefix of the other, and the other is a suffix of the other.\n\nWait, no. Because for l=2, P_2 is the first two characters of s, and S_2 is the last two. So, for example, if s is \"ababa\", then for l=2, P_2 is \"ab\", S_2 is \"ba\".\n\nSo, in this case, neither is a prefix or suffix of the other, but they are related through the entire s.\n\nHmm, so that approach might not work.\n\nAlternative idea: For each l, the two strings for that l must have their own relationships.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, one string is the prefix and the other is the suffix. So, for each l, the two strings must satisfy that one is the prefix and the other is the suffix.\n\nWait, but how? Because the prefix and suffix for l are parts of s, but not necessarily directly connected.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to find, for each l, which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nWait, perhaps for l=2, the prefix P_2 must be the first two characters of s, and the suffix S_2 must be the last two. But how to determine which of the two strings is P_2 and which is S_2.\n\nWait, but for l=2, the P_2 must be a superstring of P_1. So, the first character is c. So, for the two options for l=2, we can check which one starts with c. That will be P_2.\n\nSimilarly, for the suffix S_2, it must end with d. So, for the two options for l=2, we can check which one ends with d. That will be S_2.\n\nSo, for each l, we can select P_l and S_l based on whether they start/end with the respective characters.\n\nWait, but what if for l=2, both of the two strings start with c? Then it's ambiguous. But according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the input is consistent, so this situation shouldn't happen.\n\nWait, for example, suppose for l=2, one string is \"ac\" and the other is \"ca\". And c is 'a' and d is 'c'. Then, for P_2, the correct one is \"ac\" since it starts with 'a'. For S_2, the correct one is \"ca\" since it ends with 'a'? Wait, no, because d is the last character of s, which for l=1 was 'c'. So S_2 must end with 'c'.\n\nWait, in this example, for l=2, the two strings are \"ac\" and \"ca\". S_2 must end with 'c', so \"ac\" ends with 'c'? No, \"ac\" ends with 'c'? Wait, \"ac\" is two characters, so ends with 'c'? Yes. Because the last character is the second character.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, for l=2, the two strings are the two possible options for the prefix and suffix. So, for example, if l=2, the two strings could be 'ab' and 'ba'. Now, the prefix for l=2 is 'ab' (assuming s starts with 'ab...'), and the suffix is 'ba' (ending with 'ba').\n\nBut how to decide which is which.\n\nWell, the prefix for l=2 must be the first two characters of s, which starts with the first character of the prefix for l=1. So, for l=2, the correct prefix must start with c (the first character of s).\n\nSimilarly, the suffix for l=2 must end with d (the last character of s).\n\nSo, for l=2, we can look at the two possible strings, and see which one starts with c. That's P_2. The other is either a suffix or not. Wait, no. Because the other string could be a suffix for l=2.\n\nWait, no. Because for l=2, the two strings are the prefix and suffix. So, one is P_2, the other is S_2.\n\nSo, for l=2, the two strings are the two possible candidates for P_2 and S_2.\n\nSo, for each l, after knowing c and d, we can determine P_l and S_l.\n\nBut wait, for l=3, the process continues.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   a. For the current l, collect the two strings.\n\n   b. Determine which of the two is the prefix (P_l) and which is the suffix (S_l).\n\n      - P_l must start with the first character of P_{l-1}.\n\n      - S_l must end with the last character of S_{l-1}.\n\nWait, but for l=2, P_2 must start with P_1, which is the first character. Similarly, S_2 must end with S_1, which is the last character.\n\nSo, for each l, we can check the two candidates for P_l and S_l and see which one satisfies these conditions.\n\nSo, let's formalize this:\n\nWe'll maintain two variables, current_prefix and current_suffix.\n\nFor l=1:\n\ncurrent_prefix = c\n\ncurrent_suffix = d\n\nFor l=2:\n\nWe have two strings, say s1 and s2.\n\nCheck which of them starts with current_prefix (c). That becomes current_prefix for l=2.\n\nThen, check which of the remaining string ends with current_suffix (d). That becomes current_suffix for l=2.\n\nWait, but what if both s1 and s2 start with c? Then it's ambiguous. But the problem says the input is consistent, so this shouldn't happen.\n\nSimilarly for the suffix.\n\nSo, for each l, we can do:\n\ncandidates = list of two strings for this l.\n\nprefix_candidate = None\n\nsuffix_candidate = None\n\nfor candidate in candidates:\n\n   if candidate starts with current_prefix:\n\n       prefix_candidate = candidate\n\n   if candidate ends with current_suffix:\n\n       suffix_candidate = candidate\n\nOnce we have the prefix_candidate and suffix_candidate, we set:\n\ncurrent_prefix = prefix_candidate\n\ncurrent_suffix = suffix_candidate\n\nAnd proceed to l+1.\n\nWait, but for l=3, current_prefix is the first three characters, which must start with current_prefix for l=2.\n\nSimilarly, current_suffix is the last three characters, which must end with current_suffix for l=2.\n\nThis way, for each step, we build up the prefix and suffix correctly.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo, the steps for the algorithm are:\n\n1. Read all the input strings, group them by their lengths.\n\n2. For each l from 1 to n-1, collect the two strings for that l.\n\n3. For l=1, extract c and d (the two strings are the same, so c is that character, d is the same).\n\n4. For l from 2 to n-1:\n\n   a. Take the two strings for this l.\n\n   b. Check which starts with the current_prefix (from l-1), that's the new prefix.\n\n   c. Check which ends with the current_suffix (from l-1), that's the new suffix.\n\n5. Once all l's are processed, we have the full prefix and suffix.\n\n6. Now, we can construct the full string s as current_prefix + some middle part + current_suffix.\n\nWait, but how to ensure that the middle part is correctly filled.\n\nWait, the full string s is current_prefix followed by some characters, then current_suffix.\n\nBut the length of current_prefix is l, and current_suffix is l, so l + (n - l) = n.\n\nWait, but the middle part is not known yet.\n\nWait, but perhaps the current_prefix and current_suffix are such that when you combine them, the overlapping part is the same. Or perhaps, the last character of current_prefix must match the first character of current_suffix.\n\nBecause s is built as [prefix][middle][suffix], so the last character of the prefix is the first character of the middle, and the last character of the middle is the first character of the suffix.\n\nWait, no. The middle is the part between prefix and suffix. So, the last character of the prefix is the last character of the middle's first character.\n\nWait, perhaps the current_prefix and current_suffix must overlap in a way that the last character of the prefix is equal to the first character of the suffix.\n\nWait, because the prefix is the beginning of s, and the suffix is the end. So, the prefix's last character is the same as the suffix's first character.\n\nYes, because the entire string is built as prefix + middle + suffix. So, the prefix ends with some character, the suffix starts with the same character.\n\nSo, for l >= 2, the current_prefix's last character must equal the current_suffix's first character.\n\nSo, during the process of building current_prefix and current_suffix, this condition must be satisfied.\n\nWait, but how does that help us in building s.\n\nWait, perhaps the current_prefix and current_suffix form a chain where the end of the prefix matches the start of the suffix.\n\nSo, once we have current_prefix and current_suffix, the full s is current_prefix + some middle part + current_suffix, where the middle part is of length n - l, and the last character of the prefix equals the first character of the suffix.\n\nBut wait, for example, if current_prefix is 'aba' and current_suffix is 'aba', then the middle part must be such that the last character of 'aba' is 'a', and the first character of 'aba' is 'a', so the middle can be any string starting with 'a' and ending before 'a'.\n\nWait, perhaps the middle part is uniquely determined by the rest of the input.\n\nBut perhaps it's not necessary to compute the full s. Instead, for each input string, determine whether it's a prefix or suffix of s based on the current_prefix and current_suffix.\n\nWait, but wait. Because for l=3, the current_prefix is the first three characters, and the current_suffix is the last three. So, any input string of length l must either be equal to the first l characters (prefix) or the last l characters (suffix).\n\nSo, for each input string, for its length l, we can check whether it's equal to current_prefix (then mark as P) or equal to current_suffix (mark as S).\n\nBut wait, that's not sufficient. Because for a certain l, the two strings could be the prefix and suffix, but for another l, the same string may appear again as a different role.\n\nWait, no. Because each string is given once for each l. So, each string is present exactly once in the input. So, for each string, we can determine its role based on its length.\n\nWait, no. Because for a string of length l, it's one of the two for that l (prefix or suffix). So, in the input, each string is unique per l.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input contains 2n-2 strings, which for each l from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings. So, each string is unique in the input, grouped by their length.\n\nWait, but in the input, each string's length is given. So, for each string, we can determine its l, and then see which of the two options it is for that l.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- After determining current_prefix and current_suffix for all l, for each input string s_i:\n\n   a. Compute its length l.\n\n   b. For l=1: it's either the prefix or the suffix. But since for l=1, both are the same, and we've already determined c and d, which are the same. So, any l=1 string is both a prefix and a suffix. But according to the problem statement, it's given as two strings, but they are the same.\n\n   Wait, no. Because for l=1, the two strings are the same, as both are the first and last character of s. So, for l=1, the two strings are the same, so in the output, both will be marked as either P or S.\n\n   Wait, but for l=1, the string is the first character (prefix) and the last character (suffix). So, it's both P and S. So, for the output, in the positions corresponding to l=1, we have two S's, but according to the problem statement, the output must have exactly n-1 P's and S's. Wait, no. The output is a string of 2n-2 characters. So, for l=1, there are two strings, both are the same. So, both will be considered as P and S.\n\n   But according to the problem, each string is either a prefix or a suffix. So, in the case of l=1, the same string is both a prefix and a suffix.\n\n   So, for the output, the two l=1 strings will be marked as S and S? Or P and S?\n\n   Wait, no. Because for l=1, the string is both the prefix and the suffix. So, for the output, both will be marked as S? Or both as P?\n\n   Wait, no. Because the first character is the prefix, and the last is the suffix. But since it's the same string, it's both. So, in the output, both will be marked as S and P? But that's impossible because each position can only be P or S.\n\n   Wait, no. The problem says that each string is either a prefix or a suffix. So, for l=1, the two strings are both the same string, which is both a prefix and a suffix. But in the output, each string is marked as either P or S.\n\n   So, in the output, the two l=1 strings can be marked as P and S? Or perhaps as S and P?\n\n   Wait, no. Because the first string is the prefix (so mark as P) and the second is the suffix (so mark as S). But in the input, the two strings are the same, so how do we differentiate?\n\n   Oh wait, no. Because for l=1, the two strings are the same. So, the first string is the prefix, the second is the suffix, but they are the same. So, in the output, for both, we have to mark one as P and the other as S.\n\n   But that's not possible because they are the same string. So, perhaps both are considered as both P and S. But according to the problem statement, each string is either a prefix or a suffix. So, perhaps for l=1, the two strings are both P and S, but in the output, both will be marked as S or both as P.\n\n   Wait, that can't be. Because the output requires that each string is labeled as either P or S.\n\n   Hmm, perhaps for l=1, the two strings are considered as both P and S. But since each input string must be assigned to P or S, perhaps in the output, for l=1, both are marked as S, since the suffix is the last character, which is the same as the prefix.\n\n   Or perhaps, it's better to treat l=1 as both being P and S, but in the output, each string is marked as S, because the problem statement says that the output must have exactly as many S's as P's. Since the total number of strings is even (2n-2), and n is at least 2.\n\n   Wait, for n=2, 2n-2=2. So, each l=1 has two strings, same. So, for the output, both are marked as S, because they are suffixes (last character) and prefixes (first character). So, their roles are both P and S. But in the output, each must be marked as P or S. So, perhaps for the two l=1 strings, one is marked as P and the other as S.\n\n   But how? Because they are the same string.\n\n   Oh wait, perhaps the problem allows for the same string to be both a prefix and a suffix. So, for l=1, the two strings are the same, and in the output, both are marked as P and S. But that's impossible because each character in the output can only be P or S.\n\n   Wait, but the problem states that the output must have exactly the same number of P's and S's. So, for 2n-2 strings, n-1 P's and n-1 S's.\n\n   Wait, no. Because the problem says: \"The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'.\" So, the output has 2n-2 characters, with n-1 P's and n-1 S's.\n\n   So, for l=1, since there are two strings, both are same, but in the output, one must be P and the other S. But how to decide which is which.\n\n   Hmm, perhaps in practice, for l=1, the two strings are considered as both P and S. So, in the output, for both positions, we can mark them as S. Or perhaps as P.\n\n   Wait, but that would make the count unequal. So, perhaps the two l=1 strings are marked as P and S. So, in the output, for l=1, one is P and the other is S.\n\n   But how do we know which is which.\n\n   Maybe the way to handle it is that for l=1, the two strings are both the same, so one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. So, in the output, one is marked as P, the other as S.\n\n   But in code, since the two strings are the same, how to choose which is which.\n\n   Hmm, perhaps in the code, for each l, we process the two strings, and for l=1, assign one as P and the other as S.\n\n   But since the strings are the same, perhaps in the output, both can be marked as S. Or perhaps as P.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps for l=1, the two strings are the same, so in the output, both are marked as S, because the suffix is the last character, which is the same as the prefix. So, they are considered as suffixes.\n\n   But that would cause the count of P's to be less than S's, which is not allowed.\n\n   Wait, no. Because for l=1, the two strings are both the same, so the output must have both marked as P and S, but since it's impossible, perhaps the problem expects both to be marked as S. Or perhaps it's not an issue because the problem says that the answer is acceptable as long as it's consistent with at least one possible s.\n\n   Hmm, perhaps it's better to process l=1 as follows:\n\n   For each l=1 string, assign one as P and the other as S. Since they are the same, perhaps in the output, the first occurrence is P, the second is S. Or vice versa.\n\n   But this would require knowing the order of the input, which isn't specified.\n\n   Wait, but the problem says that the input is given in arbitrary order. So, the order doesn't matter. So, perhaps for l=1, both strings are considered as both P and S. So, in the output, for l=1, both are marked as S.\n\n   But that would make the count of S's higher than P's, which is invalid.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps for l=1, the two strings are considered as both P and S, so in the output, they are marked as S, but that would make the count of S's exceed P's.\n\n   Wait, but the problem says that the output must have exactly the same number of P's and S's. So, for 2n-2 strings, n-1 P's and n-1 S's.\n\n   For n=2, 2n-2=2. So, one P and one S.\n\n   So, for l=1, the two strings are both the same. So, in the output, one is P, the other is S.\n\n   So, in code, for each of the two l=1 strings, we need to decide which is the prefix and which is the suffix. Since they are the same, it's ambiguous, but the problem says that the input is consistent, so it's possible.\n\n   So, perhaps in code, for l=1, the first string is P, the second is S.\n\n   So, in code, for l=1:\n\n   The two strings are s1 and s2, which are the same. So, the output will have s1 marked as P, s2 as S.\n\n   But in reality, they are the same string. So, in the output, both are marked as S? Or P.\n\n   Hmm, perhaps I need to just proceed with the approach, and in code, for l=1, the two strings are assigned as P and S.\n\n   So, moving on.\n\nSo, putting this together, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read all 2n-2 strings, along with their lengths.\n\n3. Group the strings by their lengths.\n\n4. For each l from 1 to n-1, collect the two strings for that l.\n\n5. For l=1:\n\n   a. The two strings are the same. Assign one as P, the other as S.\n\n6. For l from 2 to n-1:\n\n   a. Take the two strings for this l.\n\n   b. Check which starts with the current_prefix (from l-1). That becomes the new prefix.\n\n   c. Check which ends with the current_suffix (from l-1). That becomes the new suffix.\n\n7. Once all l's are processed, current_prefix is the full prefix, current_suffix is the full suffix.\n\n8. Now, for each input string, determine whether it is a prefix (equal to current_prefix for its l) or a suffix (equal to current_suffix for its l).\n\n9. Assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that for l=2, the current_prefix and current_suffix are built step by step.\n\nWait, but in code, for each l, we can keep track of the current_prefix and current_suffix.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe can create a dictionary, groups, where groups[l] is a list of two strings of length l.\n\nThen, for each l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   if l == 1:\n\n       c = groups[1][0]\n\n       d = c  # since the two are same\n\n       current_prefix = c\n\n       current_suffix = d\n\n   else:\n\n       candidates = groups[l]\n\n       # find prefix_candidate: starts with current_prefix\n\n       prefix_candidate = None\n\n       for candidate in candidates:\n\n           if candidate.startswith(current_prefix):\n\n               prefix_candidate = candidate\n\n       # find suffix_candidate: ends with current_suffix\n\n       suffix_candidate = None\n\n       for candidate in candidates:\n\n           if candidate.endswith(current_suffix):\n\n               suffix_candidate = candidate\n\n       # assign\n\n       current_prefix = prefix_candidate\n\n       current_suffix = suffix_candidate\n\nWait, but what if both candidates start with current_prefix and end with current_suffix? According to the problem statement, it's impossible because the input is consistent, so for each l, exactly one of the two is the prefix and the other is the suffix.\n\nSo, for l=2, the two candidates must have exactly one that starts with current_prefix (c) and exactly one that ends with current_suffix (d). So, the code above will find exactly one for each.\n\nOnce current_prefix and current_suffix are built for all l's, we can then for each input string, check which l it has, and see if it's equal to the current_prefix or current_suffix for that l.\n\nWait, but each input string is part of exactly one l. Because the input strings are grouped by their lengths.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCreate a list of tuples (length, string).\n\nGroup them by length into a dictionary, say by_length, where by_length[l] is a list of the two strings of length l.\n\nThen, for each string in the input, find its l, and then check if it's equal to the current_prefix or current_suffix for that l.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the current_prefix and current_suffix for each l are built as the two options for that l. So, for each l, the two strings are the current_prefix and current_suffix.\n\nSo, for each string in the input, find its l, then check if it's equal to current_prefix for that l (mark as P) or equal to current_suffix (mark as S).\n\nBut wait, no. Because for each l, the two strings are the two options for that l: one is the prefix, the other is the suffix.\n\nSo, for example, for l=2, the current_prefix is 'ab' and current_suffix is 'ba' (as in the example), then any string of length 2 that is 'ab' is a prefix (P), 'ba' is a suffix (S).\n\nBut the input strings for l=2 are the two strings, 'ab' and 'ba', which are the two options.\n\nWait, but for the input, each string is part of exactly one l. So, for each string, its l is known, and it's one of the two for that l.\n\nThus, for each string, it must be either the current_prefix or current_suffix for its l.\n\nSo, for each string s_i in the input:\n\n   l = len(s_i)\n\n   if s_i == current_prefix[l]: mark as P\n\n   elif s_i == current_suffix[l]: mark as S\n\n   else: impossible, but the problem says the input is consistent.\n\nBut wait, current_prefix and current_suffix for l are the two strings for that l. So, for each string of length l, it's one of the two.\n\nSo, in code, for each string, we can find its l, then see which of the two it is.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead 2n-2 lines, each line is a string, stripped of newline.\n\nFor each string, record its length and the string itself.\n\nGroup the strings by their lengths into a dictionary, say by_length. So, by_length[l] is a list of the two strings for that l.\n\nFor l=1:\n\n   current_prefix = by_length[1][0]\n\n   current_suffix = by_length[1][1]\n\n   But since they are the same, perhaps we can assign current_prefix and current_suffix as the same string.\n\nWait, for l=1, the two strings are same, so for the next step, current_prefix is that string, and current_suffix is the same.\n\nBut wait, perhaps in code:\n\ncurrent_prefix = by_length[1][0]\n\ncurrent_suffix = by_length[1][1]\n\nBut since they are same, current_prefix and current_suffix are same.\n\nProceed for l=2 to n-1:\n\n   for each l in 2..n-1:\n\n       candidates = by_length[l]\n\n       prefix_candidate = None\n\n       suffix_candidate = None\n\n       for candidate in candidates:\n\n           if candidate.startswith(current_prefix):\n\n               prefix_candidate = candidate\n\n       for candidate in candidates:\n\n           if candidate.endswith(current_suffix):\n\n               suffix_candidate = candidate\n\n       # assign\n\n       current_prefix = prefix_candidate\n\n       current_suffix = suffix_candidate\n\nOnce this is done, for each input string, determine its role.\n\nWait, but the input strings are in arbitrary order. So, for each string, we can process them one by one, determine their l, and then compare against the current_prefix and current_suffix for that l.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nresult = []\n\nfor string in all_strings:\n\n   l = len(string)\n\n   if l == len(current_prefix):\n\n       if string == current_prefix:\n\n           result.append('P')\n\n       else:\n\n           result.append('S')\n\n   elif l == len(current_suffix):\n\n       if",
