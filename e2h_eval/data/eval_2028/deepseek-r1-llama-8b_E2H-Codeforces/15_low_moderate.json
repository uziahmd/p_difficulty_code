They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about a playoff tournament with 2^n teams. The tournament has multiple phases, and in each phase, certain rules determine which teams progress to the next round. Each phase is determined by the string s, where each character represents whether higher or lower skill wins in that phase.\n\nThe goal is to find all winning integers x, meaning all x such that there exists a permutation p of the skills 1 to 2^n where team x becomes the champion after the entire tournament.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out for each possible x whether it can be the winner under the given s string conditions.\n\nLet me think about how the tournament works. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half. For example, in the first phase, it's 2^(n) teams, split into pairs, played in groups. The winners move on. Then in the second phase, those winners are again split into pairs, and so on until only one remains.\n\nEach phase's outcome depends on s[i], where i is the phase index (from 0 to n-1, perhaps). Wait, the input string s has length n, so for each phase from 1 to n, but maybe the indices are zero-based. Need to clarify.\n\nWait, the string s has n characters. Each character corresponds to a phase. For the i-th phase (0-based), the rule is s[i] determines who wins each match. So for phase 0, it's the first phase where 2^(n) teams play, resulting in 2^(n-1) winners. Phase 1 is the next phase with 2^(n-1) teams, and so on until phase n-1, which is the final phase with 2 teams.\n\nSo, for each phase i, during that phase's matches, if s[i] is '0', then in each match, the lower-skilled team wins. If s[i] is '1', then the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nMy task is to model this tournament and determine for each x whether x can be the overall winner.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 18, 2^18 is 262144, which is manageable but may require some efficient data structures.\n\nWait, but for n=18, 2^18 is 262,144. So the total number of possible x is up to 262,144. So we need an O(2^n) approach, but 2^18 is about 260k, which is manageable.\n\nBut wait, the tournament structure is a binary elimination tree. Each step is a round where teams are paired, and winners proceed to the next round. The outcome of each pair depends on the current phase's rule.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to model this is to represent each possible set of active teams and track which team can win based on the rules.\n\nBut for n=18, the maximum number of rounds is 18, so each round reduces the number of teams by half.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the tournament as a binary decision tree. Each node represents a group of teams, and each edge represents the outcome of a match in a particular phase.\n\nWait, maybe we can model the possible winners at each phase step by step.\n\nAt each phase i, the teams are grouped into 2^{n - i} matches. Each match will produce a winner, and these winners form the participants of the next phase.\n\nSo, for each phase, we can compute the possible winners based on the current phase's rule.\n\nLet me think of it recursively. For phase i, the teams are in the current round, and each match produces a single winner. The winners from each match proceed to the next phase.\n\nBut how do I model this process? It seems like a dynamic programming approach could work. For each round, I can track the possible winners and their required conditions.\n\nWait, maybe for each possible subset of teams, we can track whether a certain team can be the overall winner based on the current phase and the rules applied so far.\n\nBut that's probably not feasible because the number of subsets is too large.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent the possible \"survivors\" at each phase, along with the constraints imposed by the previous phases' rules.\n\nWait, another idea: Since the tournament progresses through phases, each phase imposes certain conditions on the relative strengths of the teams that must survive. So, for each phase, the teams that make it through must have met the required conditions.\n\nPerhaps we can model the necessary conditions for each team to reach each phase.\n\nLet's break down the tournament into each phase:\n\nPhase 0: 2^n teams, split into 2^{n-1} matches. Each match's winner proceeds.\n\nIf s[0] is '0', then in each match, the lower-skilled team wins. So, for a team to win its match, it must be among",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which teams can win the playoff tournament based on the given rules for each phase. The solution involves simulating the tournament and checking if each team can be the overall winner under the given conditions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured in phases, where each phase halves the number of teams until only one remains. Each phase has a rule that determines the winner of each match (either lower or higher skill level).\n\n2. **Phase Simulation**: For each phase, simulate the matches and track which teams can proceed to the next phase based on the current phase's rule.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming**: Use a dynamic programming approach to keep track of possible winners at each phase. For each phase, maintain a set of possible winners and their required conditions.\n\n4. **Permutation Check**: After simulating all phases, check if each team can be the overall winner by verifying if there exists a permutation of skills that allows the team to win through each phase.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    max_team = 1 << n\n    dp = [set() for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    dp[0].add(0)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        current_phase = i\n        matches = 1 << (n - i - 1)\n        rule = s[i]\n        new_dp = set()\n        for group_start in range(0, max_team, 1 << (i + 1)):\n            group_end = group_start + (1 << (i + 1))\n            for mask in dp[i]:\n                if not (mask & ((1 << (i + 1)) - 1)):\n                    continue\n                team = bin(mask).count('1') - 1\n                for prev_mask in dp[i]:\n                    if (prev_mask & ((1 << (i + 1)) - 1)) == (group_start & ((1 << (i + 1)) - 1)):\n                        prev_team = bin(prev_mask).count('1') - 1\n                        if rule == '1':\n                            if prev_team > team:\n                                winner = prev_team\n                        else:\n                            if prev_team < team:\n                                winner = prev_team\n                        new_dp.add(winner)\n        dp[i + 1] = new_dp\n    \n    result = set()\n    for x in range(max_team):\n        if x in dp[n]:\n            result.add(x)\n    \n    print(' '.join(map(str, sorted(result))) + ' ')\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` representing the rules for each phase.\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize a list `dp` where each element is a set to track possible winners at each phase.\n3. **Simulating Phases**: For each phase, we simulate the matches and update the possible winners based on the current phase's rule. This involves checking each team's ability to win its match and proceed to the next phase.\n4. **Checking Winners**: After processing all phases, we check which teams can be the overall winner by verifying if they are in the final set of possible winners.\n5. **Output**: Print the winning teams in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks the possible winners through each phase using dynamic programming, ensuring that we correctly simulate the tournament and determine the possible champions.",
