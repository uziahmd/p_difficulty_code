The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Neko Finds Grapes.\" Hmm, sounds interesting. So, Neko found some treasure chests and keys. The goal is to open as many chests as possible using the keys.\n\nLet me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, each chest has a number a_i and each key has b_j. A key can unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd. That means either one is even and the other is odd because even + odd = odd. Oh right, but wait, no: wait, 1+2=3 which is odd. Yes, that's right.\n\nEach key can be used once on one chest, and each chest can be opened at most once. So, we need to assign keys to chests such that as many chests as possible are unlocked.\n\nThe input gives n chests and m keys. We have to find the maximum number of chests we can open.\n\nHmm, okay. So, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I think we need to count the number of even and odd a_i and b_j. Because the condition depends on the parity.\n\nLet me think: for a key j and chest i, a_i + b_j must be odd. So, the parities must be different. So, if a_i is even, then b_j must be odd. Or vice versa.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal way is to:\n\n- Find how many keys are even and how many are odd.\n- Similarly, find how many chests are even and how many are odd.\n\nThen, match the even keys with the odd chests, and the odd keys with the even chests.\n\nWait, yes! Because each even key can only unlock an odd chest, and each odd key can only unlock an even chest.\n\nSo, the maximum number of chests we can open is the sum of the minimum between the number of even keys and the number of odd chests, plus the minimum between the number of odd keys and the number of even chests.\n\nBut wait, is that all? Because maybe there's a better way. Like, sometimes you might have more even keys than odd chests, but perhaps after assigning as much as possible, you can't do anything else. So, the sum would be correct.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because any key can only unlock a chest of opposite parity. So, the maximum possible is to take the sum of the two minima.\n\nBut wait, let me test this with the examples given.\n\nIn the first example:\n\nChests: [9,14,6,2,11]\nSo, a_i's are 9 (odd), 14 (even), 6 (even), 2 (even), 11 (odd). So, the number of odd chests is 2, even is 3.\n\nKeys: [8,4,7,20]\nb_j's are 8 (even),4 (even),7 (odd),20 (even). So, even keys: 3, odd keys:1.\n\nSo, even keys can unlock odd chests. Number of even keys is 3, odd chests is 2. So, the min is 2. So, 2 chests can be opened via even keys.\n\nOdd keys can unlock even chests. Number of odd keys is 1, even chests is 3. So, min is 1. So, total 3 chests. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: second input. Chests are [2,4,6,8,10] (all even) and keys are [5] (odd).\n\nSo, even chests:5, odd chests:0. Odd keys:1, even keys:0.\n\nSo, even keys can't help here. But odd keys can unlock even chests. So, min(1,5) is 1. So, total 1 chest, which matches the sample.\n\nThird example: chests are [10], keys are [20,30,40,50]. So, a_i is 10 (even). Keys are all even.\n\nSo, even key can unlock even chest only if a_i + b_j is odd. 10 is even, b_j is even. Sum is even, not odd. So, cannot unlock. So, output is 0.\n\nWhich again matches the sample.\n\nSo, seems like the approach is correct.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd in a array (chest parities).\n2. Count the number of even and odd in b array (key parities).\n3. The maximum number of chests is (min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a)).\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nBut wait, what about when the sum is larger than n? No, because the sum can't exceed the number of chests. Wait, no, because each key can only unlock one chest. So, the maximum is the sum of the two minima, but also, it can't exceed n.\n\nWait, no, because for each part, the min is taken. So, for example, if even_b is 10 and odd_a is 5, then min is 5. So, adding them up can't exceed n, since the sum is 5 + something else, but the total can't be more than n.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose we have even_b = 100, odd_a=50, then min is 50. Then, odd_b=100, even_a=50, min is 50. So, sum is 100. But if n is 100, that's fine. But if n is 80, then the sum is 100, but n is 80. So, we can't have more than n chests.\n\nAh, right! So, the sum could be up to min( (min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a)), n )\n\nWait, no. Because each chest can be used at most once. So, the sum is the number of keys used, but each key unlocks one chest. So, the maximum number of chests is the sum of the two minima, but cannot exceed the number of chests.\n\nWait, but the sum of the two minima could be larger than the number of chests. So, in that case, the maximum is the number of chests.\n\nFor example, if even_b is 10, odd_a is 10, but n is 5. Then, min(even_b, odd_a) is 5, min(odd_b, even_a) could be 0 or something. So, the sum is 5, which is <=n.\n\nWait, another example: even_b=3, odd_a=5. So, min is 3. odd_b=4, even_a=3. Min is 3. Sum is 6. But if n is 5, then the maximum possible is 5.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to take the sum of the two minima, but cap it at n.\n\nWait, but why would that happen? Because each key can unlock one chest, and each chest can be unlocked once. So, the total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the two minima, but that can't exceed n.\n\nWait, but the sum of the two minima can't be larger than the number of keys, because each min is based on the counts.\n\nWait, no. For example, even_b is 10, odd_a is 5. So, min(even_b, odd_a)=5. odd_b is 10, even_a is 3. min(odd_b, even_a)=3. Sum is 8. But if n is 7, then the maximum is 7.\n\nSo, the maximum is the minimum between (sum of the two minima) and n.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\nmax_chests = min( (min_even_b * min_odd_a) + (min_odd_b * min_even_a), n )\n\nWait, no. Because min_even_b is the number of even keys, and min_odd_a is the number of odd chests. So, each even key can unlock an odd chest. So, the maximum number of such assignments is the minimum of the two.\n\nSimilarly for the other part.\n\nSo, the total is the sum of these two minima. But this sum can't exceed n, because each assignment uses one chest.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\nmax_chests = min( (min_even_b + min_odd_b) * min( min_odd_a, min_even_b ), ... ) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should rephrase.\n\nLet me denote:\n\neven_a: number of chests with a_i even.\n\nodd_a: number of chests with a_i odd.\n\neven_b: number of keys with b_j even.\n\nodd_b: number of keys with b_j odd.\n\nThen:\n\nThe number of pairs where even key is used on odd chest: min(even_b, odd_a).\n\nThe number of pairs where odd key is used on even chest: min(odd_b, even_a).\n\nSum these two, and that's the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\nBut wait, this sum could be greater than n. For example, if even_b is 5, odd_a is 5, odd_b is 5, even_a is 5. So, sum is 10, but n is 9. So, in that case, the maximum is 9.\n\nSo, the maximum number of chests is the minimum between (sum) and n.\n\nWait, but no. Because if sum is 10 and n is 9, you can't have 10 chests, so the maximum is 9.\n\nSo, the correct formula is:\n\nmax_chest = min( (min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a)), n )\n\nWait, but wait: what if the sum is less than n? Then, you can't open more than sum, regardless of n.\n\nSo, the maximum is the minimum of the sum and n.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd in a and b arrays.\n\n2. Compute the possible pairs:\n\n   pair1 = min(even_b, odd_a)\n\n   pair2 = min(odd_b, even_a)\n\n3. sum_pairs = pair1 + pair2\n\n4. The answer is min(sum_pairs, n)\n\nBecause you can't open more than n chests.\n\nSo, that's the plan.\n\nNow, implementing this.\n\nIn Python, how to do this?\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read the a array as list of integers.\n\nCompute even_a and odd_a: even_a is the count of a_i % 2 == 0, odd_a is n - even_a.\n\nSame for b array: even_b = count of b_j % 2 ==0, odd_b = m - even_b.\n\nCompute pair1 = min(even_b, odd_a)\n\npair2 = min(odd_b, even_a)\n\nsum_pairs = pair1 + pair2\n\nans = min(sum_pairs, n)\n\nPrint ans.\n\nWait, that's it? So simple.\n\nTesting with sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\n\neven_a: 14,6,2 → 3 even, 2 odd.\n\nodd_a = 2.\n\nb = [8,4,7,20]\n\neven_b: 8,4,20 → 3 even, 7 is odd. So even_b=3, odd_b=1.\n\npair1 = min(3, 2) → 2.\n\npair2 = min(1, 3) →1.\n\nsum_pairs=3. n=5. So, min(3,5)=3. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=5, m=1\n\na = [2,4,6,8,10] → all even. even_a=5, odd_a=0.\n\nb = [5] → odd_b=1, even_b=0.\n\npair1 = min(0, 0) →0.\n\npair2 = min(1,5) →1.\n\nsum_pairs=1. n=5. So, min(1,5) is 1.\n\nSample 3:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\na=[10] → even_a=1, odd_a=0.\n\nb = [20,30,40,50] → all even. even_b=4, odd_b=0.\n\npair1 = min(4, 0)=0.\n\npair2 = min(0,1)=0.\n\nsum_pairs=0. n=1. So, 0.\n\nAll samples pass.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, m=3.\n\na = [1,3,5] → odd_a=3, even_a=0.\n\nb = [2,4,6] → even_b=3, odd_b=0.\n\npair1 = min(3,3)=3. pair2=0. sum is 3. n=3. So, 3.\n\nAnother case: a has 2 evens, 3 odds. b has 4 evens, 1 odd.\n\npair1 = min(4,3) →3. pair2 = min(1,2) →1. sum is 4. If n is 5, then min(4,5)=4.\n\nBut if n is 3, then min(4,3)=3.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when sum_pairs exceeds n? For example, a has 2 evens, 3 odds. b has 4 evens, 1 odd.\n\nSo, pair1 is 3, pair2 is 1. sum is 4. If n is 3, then the maximum is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code needs to compute this correctly.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead a list.\n\nCompute even_a = sum(1 for x in a if x%2 ==0)\n\nodd_a = n - even_a.\n\nRead b list.\n\neven_b = sum(1 for x in b if x%2 ==0)\n\nodd_b = m - even_b.\n\nCompute pair1 = min(even_b, odd_a)\n\npair2 = min(odd_b, even_a)\n\nsum_p = pair1 + pair2\n\nans = min(sum_p, n)\n\nprint(ans)\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nNow, handle the input.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the input is given as:\n\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the first line is n and m, followed by the second line as a's, third as b's.\n\nSo, the code will read from stdin.\n\nIn Python, reading the entire input can be tricky because sometimes lines may be split differently. So, perhaps read the entire input as a single string, then split into tokens.\n\nAlternatively, read line by line.\n\nBut in practice, for handling the input, perhaps read the first line as n, m.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nThen read the next line as another list.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n\n    ptr =0\n\n    n, m = data[ptr], data[ptr+1]\n\n    ptr +=2\n\n    a = data[ptr:ptr+n]\n\n    ptr +=n\n\n    b = data[ptr:ptr+m]\n\n    # compute even_a\n\n    even_a = sum(1 for x in a if x %2 ==0)\n\n    odd_a = n - even_a\n\n    even_b = sum(1 for x in b if x%2 ==0)\n\n    odd_b = m - even_b\n\n    pair1 = min(even_b, odd_a)\n\n    pair2 = min(odd_b, even_a)\n\n    sum_p = pair1 + pair2\n\n    ans = min(sum_p, n)\n\n    print(ans)\n\nmain()\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nWait, but what if the input is read as multiple lines, perhaps with leading/trailing spaces? But the split() function takes care of that.\n\nSo, this code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nProcessing:\n\nn=5, m=4.\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\n\neven_a: 14,6,2 →3.\n\nodd_a:2.\n\nb:8,4,7,20.\n\neven_b:3.\n\nodd_b:1.\n\npair1= min(3,2)=2.\n\npair2= min(1,3)=1.\n\nsum_p=3. n=5.\n\nans=3.\n\nSample 2:\n\n5 1\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n\n5\n\neven_a=5, odd_a=0.\n\neven_b=0, odd_b=1.\n\npair1=min(0,0)=0.\n\npair2= min(1,5)=1.\n\nsum_p=1. n=5 →1.\n\nSample 3:\n\n1 4\n\n10\n\n20 30 40 50\n\neven_a=1, odd_a=0.\n\neven_b=4, odd_b=0.\n\npair1= min(4,0)=0.\n\npair2= min(0,1)=0.\n\nsum_p=0.\n\nSo, yes, the code works.\n\nI think this should handle all test cases. It's efficient, O(n + m) time, which is acceptable for n and m up to 1e5.\n\nSo, the final code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the given keys. Each key can unlock a chest if their numbers' sum is odd, which means one must be even and the other must be odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parity**: First, count how many of the chests and keys are even and how many are odd. This helps us understand the distribution of even and odd numbers in both chests and keys.\n2. **Calculate Pairs**: For each key, determine how many chests it can unlock based on parity. Specifically:\n   - Even keys can unlock odd chests.\n   - Odd keys can unlock even chests.\n3. **Sum Pairs**: Compute the total number of pairs by summing the minimum of even keys and odd chests, and the minimum of odd keys and even chests.\n4. **Determine Maximum Chests**: The result is the minimum of the computed pairs and the total number of chests, ensuring we do not exceed the total number of available chests.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n    ptr = 0\n    n, m = data[ptr], data[ptr + 1]\n    ptr += 2\n    a = data[ptr:ptr + n]\n    ptr += n\n    b = data[ptr:ptr + m]\n    \n    even_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_a = n - even_a\n    \n    even_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_b = m - even_b\n    \n    pair1 = min(even_b, odd_a)\n    pair2 = min(odd_b, even_a)\n    sum_p = pair1 + pair2\n    \n    ans = min(sum_p, n)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single string split into tokens for efficient processing.\n- **Parity Counting**: We count how many chests and keys are even and odd using list comprehensions and modulo operations.\n- **Pair Calculation**: By determining the minimum number of compatible pairs between even keys and odd chests, and between odd keys and even chests, we ensure we maximize the number of chests opened.\n- **Result Calculation**: The final result is the minimum of the computed pairs and the total number of chests, ensuring we do not exceed the available chests.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures optimal performance for large inputs.",
