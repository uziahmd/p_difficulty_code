Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Feed the Golorp.\" Hmm, sounds a bit funny, but it's a programming competition problem. \n\nThe problem statement says that Golorps are creatures that eat variables. Each Golorp's name defines its diet. Some golorps can't be fed at all, and they want the lex smallest possible sequence of variable values. Oh right, and each variable can be from 0 to 9.\n\nWait, the input is a single string, which is the name of the visiting golorp. And I need to output either the lex smallest sequence or 'false' if it's impossible.\n\nSo, first, I think I need to parse the input string and figure out the structure of the golorp's name. Because the way the variables flow through the jaws into the stomach determines how the values are assigned.\n\nHmm, I remember in Befunge, which is similar, the code is written on a grid. So maybe the golorp's name represents a Befunge-like program. The structure of the program determines how the variables (or in Befunge, the stack) are manipulated.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the name is a valid Befunge-like sequence, so perhaps I should model the variables as a stack, where each step in the program pops or pushes variables.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the number of variables necessary is defined by the shape of the jaws. So perhaps the golorp's name represents a series of operations that manipulate a set of variables, and each variable is a digit from 0-9.\n\nI think the key here is to model the golorp's program as a series of operations that modify some variables, and the goal is to assign values to these variables such that when the program runs, it produces a certain output. But wait, no, the problem says that the golorp can choose the lex smallest sequence of variable values. So perhaps we need to find the minimal lex assignment of variables that makes the program produce a specific result.\n\nWait, but what is the result? Oh, perhaps the program's output is determined by the variables, and we need to find the minimal assignment that satisfies some constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the golorp's program has a certain structure where it reads some variables and outputs others, and our task is to find the lex smallest assignment of variables that makes the program output correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the golorp's program is a Befunge-like loop that requires certain variables to be set in a way that allows the loop to terminate, and then after the loop, the variables are output in the order they were used.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws. So the program must process variables through the jaws, and the order of the variables in the output is the order they enter the stomach.\n\nWait, perhaps the program is a series of steps where variables are pushed onto a stack, and the output is the order in which the variables are consumed from the stack.\n\nWait, maybe the program is a loop that continues until some condition is met, and during each iteration, it reads some variables and writes others. The minimal assignment is the one that allows the program to complete as quickly as possible, with the lex smallest variables.\n\nHmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about the sample input and output.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nThe input is a string with multiple lines, but in the problem statement, the input is a single string, which seems to have multiple test cases separated by newlines. Wait, the example shows an input that's a multi-line string, but the actual input is a single string. So perhaps each line in the example is a separate test case.\n\nWait, no. The sample input given is:\n\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.' ]\n\nAnd the output is ['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101'].\n\nSo for each of those strings, it's a different test case. So my program needs to process each of them and output the corresponding result.\n\nSo for each test case, the input is a string representing the golorp's name, and the output is the lex smallest sequence of variable values, or 'false' if impossible.\n\nSo I need to model each of these strings as a Befunge-like program, determine what variables are involved, and find the lex smallest assignment of variables that satisfies the program's requirements.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the program.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values that can be fed to a Golorp based on its name. The name of the Golorp is given as a string resembling a Befunge-like program. If it's impossible to feed the Golorp, we should output \"false\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Parse the Input**: Each line in the input represents a separate test case. We need to process each line individually.\n2. **Model the Golorp's Program**: The Golorp's name is modeled after a Befunge-like program where variables are manipulated using a stack. The program consists of a series of operations that modify the stack.\n3. **Determine Variable Usage**: Track which variables are used and how they are manipulated by the program. This helps in identifying the constraints for assigning values to these variables.\n4. **Generate Lexicographically Smallest Sequence**: Using backtracking, generate the smallest possible sequence of variable values that satisfies the constraints imposed by the program. This involves trying all possible combinations starting from the smallest lex order.\n5. **Check Feasibility**: If no valid sequence can be generated, output \"false\". Otherwise, output the smallest valid sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        grid = list(line)\n        stack = []\n        variables = set()\n        for c in grid:\n            if c in '0123456789':\n                stack.append(int(c))\n                variables.add(c)\n            elif c == '>':\n                if not stack:\n                    print('false')\n                    break\n                x = stack.pop()\n                stack.append(x)\n            elif c == '<':\n                if not stack:\n                    print('false')\n                    break\n                x = stack.pop()\n                stack.append(x)\n            elif c == '+':\n                if len(stack) < 2:\n                    print('false')\n                    break\n                a = stack.pop()\n                b = stack.pop()\n                stack.append(a + b)\n            elif c == '-':\n                if len(stack) < 2:\n                    print('false')\n                    break\n                a = stack.pop()\n                b = stack.pop()\n                stack.append(a -
