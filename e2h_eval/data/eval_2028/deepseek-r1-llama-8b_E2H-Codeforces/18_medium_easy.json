The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the frog starts at position 0 on the number line. It can jump either a or -b each time. We need to find f(x), which is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach without stepping outside [0, x]. Then, sum all f(i) from i=0 to m.\n\nHmm, first, I think I should understand what f(x) represents. For each x, f(x) counts all the positions the frog can reach without going beyond x. So for each i from 0 to m, we calculate f(i) and sum them up.\n\nBut wait, if m is up to 1e9, we can't compute each f(i) individually because that would be way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. The frog can make any number of jumps, each time adding a or subtracting b. But since it's starting from 0, the reachable positions are all numbers that can be written as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the position is >=0 and <=x.\n\nWait, but considering that after each jump, the frog's position must stay within [0, x], so for some x, certain jumps are not allowed. But how does that affect the reachable positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the reachable positions as a graph where each node is a position, and edges are the possible jumps. But that's probably not helpful for large x.\n\nAnother idea: The set of reachable positions is a linear combination of a and b. But since the frog can choose when to add a or subtract b, perhaps the reachable positions form an arithmetic progression or something similar.\n\nWait, let's consider the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. Let g = gcd(a, b). Then, the minimal step that can be achieved is g. So any reachable position must be a multiple of g.\n\nSo, the frog can reach positions that are multiples of g. So, the reachable positions are in the form kg, where k is some integer >=0.\n\nThis suggests that f(x) is determined by how many such positions are <=x and also satisfy some other conditions.\n\nBut how do the jumps work? Each time, the frog can choose to add a or subtract b. So, the reachable positions are 0, a, a-2b, a-3b, etc., as well as a + a - b, a +a - 2b, etc. Wait, no. Because the frog can choose any sequence of jumps, not just adding a repeatedly.\n\nWait, perhaps the reachable positions are all integers k such that k ≡ 0 mod g, and k can be expressed as a sum of a's minus b's multiplied by some coefficients. Hmm, but the order of jumps matters because you can't have negative positions.\n\nWait, no. Because the frog can't go below 0. So, the frog's path is constrained by the condition that it never steps outside [0, x].\n\nThis complicates things because the reachable positions depend on the path taken. For example, if the frog jumps to a position y, then from y it can only jump to y+a or y - b, provided those don't go below 0 or exceed x.\n\nBut considering all possible paths is computationally expensive, especially for large x.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a mathematical way to model the maximum reachable position. Like, the frog can reach a certain farthest point, and beyond that, it can't go further. So, for x beyond this maximum, the reachable positions are fixed.\n\nWait, let's think about the maximum position the frog can reach without constraints. That would be when the frog keeps jumping a as much as possible. So the maximum position is a * k for some k. Similarly, but wait, the frog could also take some steps back by subtracting b, which might allow it to reach further positions.\n\nWait, no. Because if you subtract b, you're moving backward. So, if the frog has enough space to move forward again, it can get further. But this depends on the values of a and b.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum reachable position is unbounded if a > b. Because each time you can add a and subtract b, effectively increasing your position by (a - b). So, for example, if a=5, b=3, then each cycle of adding a and subtracting b gives a net gain of 2. So the frog can keep doing this indefinitely, getting 0 →5→8→11→14→..., which is 5, 5+2, 5+4, etc.\n\nSo, in this case, the frog can reach all positions beyond a certain point as long as they are congruent to a modulo (a + b).\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, the reachable positions are all numbers of the form a * k - b * l, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the position is >=0. But also, the position must be <=x.\n\nBut with the constraint that the frog doesn't go beyond x, how does this affect the reachable positions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum position the frog can reach is determined by the relative sizes of a and b. If a > b, then the frog can keep making progress by adding a and then subtracting b, thereby moving forward each time. So the reachable positions can be as large as desired.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, for each x, f(x) is the number of reachable positions when the frog never steps outside [0, x]. So for x beyond a certain point, adding a would take it beyond x, so the frog cannot jump a anymore. Hmm, no, because the frog can choose to not jump a if that would take it beyond x. So the frog can choose to stop jumping a once it's at x.\n\nWait, no. The frog can only jump to positions within [0, x]. So if the frog is at position k, and wants to jump a, it can only do so if k + a ≤x. Similarly, it can jump -b only if k -b ≥0.\n\nSo, the frog's movement is bounded by x.\n\nWait, but how does that affect the reachable positions for various x's?\n\nI think this problem requires analyzing two cases:\n\n1. When x is less than some critical value. In this case, the frog can't perform certain jumps, so the reachable positions are limited.\n\n2. When x is beyond that critical value. Here, the frog can perform all possible jumps, leading to a predictable structure of reachable positions.\n\nSo, the key is to find this critical x, and then compute f(x) for x < critical and x >= critical differently.\n\nWhat's the critical x? It's the smallest x such that from x, the frog can't jump a anymore because x + a would exceed x. Wait, no, because x is the upper limit. So, for x, the frog can't make any more jumps that would take it beyond x.\n\nWait, perhaps the critical point is when x is such that the frog can't make any more a jumps because x + a > x. Wait, that's not possible. Because x is the upper limit; the frog can't jump beyond x. So, for x, the frog can't jump a from x, because x + a would be x + a, which is larger than x. So, the frog can't make any a jumps when it's at x.\n\nSimilarly, when the frog is at position k, it can jump a only if k + a ≤x.\n\nSo, the frog's ability to make a jumps depends on its current position and the x.\n\nBut how does this affect the overall reachable positions for different x's?\n\nHmm, perhaps the critical x is the point after which the frog can't make any more a jumps. Or maybe it's related to the point where the frog can't subtract b anymore.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the critical x is the point where the frog can't perform any further a jumps beyond that, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the case where a > b. As mentioned earlier, the frog can potentially reach very far by alternately adding a and subtracting b.\n\nFor example, if a=5, b=3: the frog can go 0 →5 (using a), then 5 →2 (using -b), then 2 →7 (using a), then 7 →4 (using -b), and so on. Each cycle adds 2 to the position (5-3=2). So, the frog can reach positions 0,5,2,7,4,9,6, etc.\n\nSo, for x beyond a certain point, the frog can reach all positions congruent to a modulo (a + b), or some other modulus.\n\nWait, perhaps the reachable positions are all the numbers that are congruent to 0 mod d, where d is the gcd of a and b.\n\nWait, yeah, because each jump is a multiple of a and b, so their linear combinations will be multiples of the gcd.\n\nSo, d = gcd(a, b). Then, any reachable position must be a multiple of d.\n\nSo, the frog can reach 0, d, 2d, 3d, etc., up to some maximum based on x.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let's say that d is the gcd. Then, the minimal step is d, so the frog can reach any multiple of d up to some maximum.\n\nBut in the earlier example where a=5, b=3, d=1. So the frog can reach any integer >=0, but only if it's possible.\n\nWait, no. Because in that example, the frog can reach 0,5,2,7,4,9,6, etc., which are all integers. So, for any x >= a certain value, f(x) is equal to the number of integers reachable, which is x + 1 (since all positions are reachable). But that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, in the second sample input, a=1, b=2019. So, the frog can jump +1 or -2019. But since 2019 is much larger than 1, the frog can't subtract 2019 from 0, because that would take it to -2019, which is below 0. So, the frog can only jump +1 each time. So, for any x, the frog can reach 0,1,2,...,x. So f(x) is x+1, and the sum is sum_{i=0}^m (i+1) = (m+1)(m+2)/2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo, in that case, the frog can't make any -b jumps because it's constrained by 0. So, the reachable positions are 0,1,2,...,x.\n\nHmm, so for cases where a > b, the frog can reach a lot of positions, but when a is small compared to b, it's more limited.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find the point after which the frog can reach every possible position up to x, given that it can make all necessary jumps without being blocked by x.\n\nSo, to model f(x), we need to find how many reachable positions there are, considering the constraints of x.\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. Let's imagine that the frog can reach all positions up to some maximum, beyond which it can't go further. Or, perhaps, the frog can reach all positions beyond a certain point, given that x is large enough.\n\nSo, for x beyond some threshold, the reachable positions are all multiples of d up to x, but only if certain conditions are met.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to find for each x the earliest position beyond which all higher positions are reachable. Then, for x >= that position, f(x) is (number of reachable positions up to x).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for x beyond a certain value, the reachable positions are all multiples of d, and the count is floor((x - s)/d) + 1, where s is the starting point.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's try to model this.\n\nLet me consider the case where a and b are such that the frog can reach all positions beyond a certain point.\n\nIn this case, for x beyond that point, f(x) is the number of reachable positions, which is (x - s)/d + 1, where s is the minimal reachable position.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: Find for each x, the maximum reachable position, and see if x is beyond that. If x is beyond, then the frog can't reach any further, so f(x) is fixed. Otherwise, f(x) increases as x increases.\n\nWait, but this might not capture all possibilities. Alternatively, perhaps f(x) grows until x reaches a certain point, after which it remains the same.\n\nWait, let's think about the process of the frog jumping. The frog can reach certain positions, and for each x, the reachable positions are all the positions it can reach without exceeding x.\n\nSo, for x less than a certain point, the frog can't make certain jumps, thus the reachable positions are limited. Once x is beyond that point, the frog can make all possible jumps, leading to more reachable positions.\n\nSo, perhaps for x >= t, the frog can reach all positions that are congruent to 0 mod d, and the count is (x//d + 1). But this is only true under certain conditions.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to find the earliest x where the frog can make all possible jumps without being limited by x. Beyond that x, the frog can reach any reachable position, regardless of x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any position that is >=0 and congruent to 0 mod d, but only up to a certain maximum.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find the maximum position that the frog can reach without considering x, but considering that each jump must not take it beyond x.\n\nNo, because x varies, and for each x, the reachable positions change.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me try to model f(x) mathematically.\n\nThe frog starts at 0. At each step, it can choose to add a or subtract b, but can't go below 0 or above x.\n\nWe can model the reachable positions as a set S, which starts with 0. For each position k in S, if k + a <=x, then k+a is added to S. Similarly, if k - b >=0, then k -b is added to S.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the size of S for each x, and then sum these sizes from x=0 to m.\n\nBut computing S for each x is O(m), which is impossible for m up to 1e9.\n\nSo, we need a way to find f(x) for all x from 0 to m efficiently.\n\nAn alternative approach is to find the x where the frog's reachable positions stabilize. Once x is beyond a certain value, the reachable positions don't change as x increases.\n\nSo, perhaps f(x) increases until a certain x, then becomes a linear function.\n\nLet me think about the case when a >= b.\n\nIf a >= b, then the frog can make progress by adding a and then subtracting b, which would result in a net gain of (a - b). So, the frog can keep doing this to reach higher positions.\n\nThus, for sufficiently large x, the frog can reach all positions up to x that are congruent to 0 mod d, where d is the gcd of a and b.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let's see.\n\nWait, suppose a=5, b=3, d=1. Then, the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of 1, i.e., all integers >=0. So for x>=0, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x.\n\nBut in the first sample input, the output for x=7 is 8, which is indeed 7+1=8.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, when a > b, the frog can reach all positions up to x, hence f(x) is x+1.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample, a=5, b=3, which is a > b. So, for x >=5, the frog can reach all positions up to x, right?\n\nWait, but according to the sample input, f(7)=8, which is 7+1=8. So yes.\n\nSo, for a > b, f(x) is x+1 when x >= some threshold. What is that threshold?\n\nWait, when a > b, the frog can reach any position up to x, so f(x) is x+1 for x >= (a - b), perhaps?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think: the frog can reach 0, a, a - b, a - 2b, etc. But if a > b, each time it subtracts b, it moves closer to zero, allowing it to add a again to reach a higher position.\n\nSo, eventually, the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, where d = gcd(a, b). Since in this case, d=1, so all positions are reachable.\n\nSo, for a > b, the frog can reach every position >=0, so for x >=0, f(x) is x+1.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, for x=5, f(x) is 1. Wait, no, the sample says f(5) is 3, not 6.\n\nWait, wait, that contradicts my previous thought. So, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the first sample, the output is 19. The breakdown is f(0)=1, f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=1, f(4)=1, f(5)=3, f(6)=3, f(7)=8.\n\nWait, why is f(5)=3? Let's see.\n\nFor x=5, the frog can't jump a=5 from 0 (it would reach 5, which is allowed). From 5, can it jump back? No, because 5 -b=5-3=2, which is >=0. So, from 5, the frog can reach 2.\n\nFrom 2, can it jump a=5? 2+5=7>5, so no. Can it jump -b=2-3=-1, which is invalid.\n\nSo, from 2, the frog can't jump further. So, the reachable positions are 0,5,2. So, f(5)=3.\n\nAh, I see. So, for x=5, the frog can't reach 1,2,3,4, etc., except 0,5,2.\n\nWait, but a=5, which is greater than b=3. So, the frog can reach 0,5,2,7 (but 7>5, so not included), so for x=5, the frog can reach 0,5,2.\n\nSo, f(5)=3.\n\nBut for x=6, the frog can reach 0,5,2,7 (but 7>6 is invalid, so 0,5,2,6 (from 0+5+1? No, wait, how does 6 come into play?\n\nWait, let me reevaluate.\n\nWait, x=6: the frog can start at 0.\n\nIt can jump +5 to reach 5.\n\nFrom 5, it can jump +5 again to 10, which is >6, so not allowed. So, can't jump +5 from 5. Instead, it can jump -3 to 2.\n\nFrom 2, it can't jump +5 (would be 7>6) or -3 (would be -1, invalid). So, from 2, no further jumps.\n\nBut wait, can the frog reach 6 in any way?\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can make a different sequence of jumps.\n\nWait, 0 →5 →2 →... but how to reach 6.\n\nAlternatively, 0 →5 → (can't go further). So, 6 isn't reachable.\n\nWait, but the sample says f(6)=3. So, 0,5,2: three positions.\n\nWait, but in the sample, f(7) is 8, which is 0,1,2,...,7. So, for x=7, the frog can reach all positions up to 7.\n\nSo, the frog can reach 7 by jumping +5 from 2 (2+5=7). So, for x=7, the frog can reach 7.\n\nSo, perhaps for x >= a certain value, the frog can reach all positions up to x.\n\nBut how to determine that certain value.\n\nSo, for a=5, b=3, the frog can reach 0,5,2,7,4,9, etc. But when x is 7, it can reach 7. So, for x >=7, the frog can reach all positions up to x.\n\nWait, but wait: 0 →5 →2 →7. So, 7 is reachable.\n\nThen, from 7, the frog can jump -3 to 4.\n\nFrom 4, it can't jump +5 (4+5=9>7). So, it can't proceed further. So, the reachable positions are 0,5,2,7,4.\n\nWait, but that's only five positions. But the sample says f(7)=8, meaning all positions up to 7 are reachable.\n\nHmm, I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can take a different path. For example:\n\n0 →5 →2 →7 →4 →9 (but 9>7 is invalid). Wait, but 9 is beyond x=7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can make other jumps.\n\nWait, maybe the frog can reach 1,3, etc. How?\n\nWait, 0 →5 →2 →7 is one path, but how to reach 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach 1 by making a series of jumps that involve subtracting b multiple times before adding a.\n\nWait, 0 →5 →2 →7 →4 →9 (no, 9>7). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can't reach 1,3, etc., even when x=7. So why does the sample say f(7)=8?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the explanation says:\n\nf(7) =8.\n\nSo, the frog can reach 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nSo, for x=7, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to7.\n\nHow is that possible?\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can make a series of jumps that allows it to reach any position.\n\nWait, for example:\n\n0 →5 →2 →7 →4 →9 (but 9>7 is not allowed, so from 4, can't jump a). So, how to reach 1?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can use multiple steps of a and b to reach lower positions.\n\nWait, maybe the frog can reach 1 by going 0 →5 →2 →5 →2 →5 →... but that doesn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can reach 1 by another route.\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can reach 1 via a different path, like:\n\n0 →5 →2 →7 →4 →9 (invalid). No, that doesn't help.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing a key insight here.\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can reach any position beyond a certain point, but for x >= that point, the frog can reach all positions up to x.\n\nBut in the first sample, the frog can reach all positions up to 7 when x=7.\n\nSo, perhaps when x is >= a certain value, the frog can reach every position up to x.\n\nSo, how to find that certain value.\n\nLet me think of the minimal x such that the frog can reach x via some sequence of jumps.\n\nIn the first sample, a=5, b=3.\n\nThe frog can reach 5, then from 5 can reach 2, then from 2 can reach 7 (2+5=7), which is within x=7.\n\nBut how to reach 1,3, etc.?\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can reach 1 via a different route.\n\nWait, maybe 0 →5 →2 →7 →4 →1.\n\nWait, how?\n\nWait, 0 →5 (jump a).\n\n5 →2 (jump -b).\n\n2 →7 (jump a).\n\n7 →4 (jump -b).\n\n4 →1 (how? 4 can't jump a (4+5=9>7) or -b (4-3=1).\n\nYes! So, 4 →1 is allowed because 4-3=1 >=0.\n\nSo, the frog can reach 1 via 0 →5 →2 →7 →4 →1.\n\nSo, the reachable positions include 0,5,2,7,4,1.\n\nSimilarly, from 1, the frog can jump a to 6, which is within x=7.\n\nSo, 1 →6.\n\nSo, the frog can reach 6.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the reachable positions are 0,5,2,7,4,1,6,3.\n\nWait, wait, how?\n\nLet me list all the reachable positions:\n\nStart at 0.\n\nJump +5 →5.\n\nFrom 5, jump -3 →2.\n\nFrom 2, jump +5 →7.\n\nFrom 7, jump -3 →4.\n\nFrom 4, jump -3 →1.\n\nFrom 1, jump +5 →6.\n\nFrom 6, jump -3 →3.\n\nFrom 3, jump +5 →8 (which is beyond x=7, so invalid). So, from 3, can't jump a.\n\nBut from 3, can we do anything else? 3-3=0, which is already visited.\n\nSo, the reachable positions are 0,5,2,7,4,1,6,3.\n\nSo, that's 8 positions, hence f(7)=8.\n\nSo, for x=7, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to7.\n\nSo, in this case, the frog can reach every position up to x=7 when x is >=7.\n\nSo, for x >=7, f(x) is x+1.\n\nBut what about x=6?\n\nAt x=6, the frog can reach 0,5,2,7 (but 7>6, so invalid). So, 0,5,2,1,6,3,4.\n\nWait, how?\n\nLet's see:\n\n0 →5.\n\n5 →2.\n\n2 →7 (invalid at x=6).\n\nSo, from 2, can't jump +5.\n\nFrom 2, can jump -3 →-1, which is invalid.\n\nSo, from 2, can't proceed.\n\nFrom 5, can't jump +5, so can't proceed.\n\nSo, the reachable positions are 0,5,2.\n\nAdditionally, from 0, can the frog make a jump via other means?\n\nWait, maybe 0 →5 →2, but then can't reach further.\n\nWait, but 0 can't reach 1 directly. Unless via a different path.\n\nWait, how else can the frog reach 1?\n\nMaybe via 0 →5 →2 →7 (invalid at x=6) →4 (4 is within x=6). From 4, jump -3 →1.\n\nSo, 4 is reachable from 7, but 7 is beyond x=6. So, for x=6, 7 is not reachable.\n\nSo, 4 is not reachable when x=6.\n\nHmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the reachable positions more carefully.\n\nAt x=6:\n\nThe frog starts at 0.\n\nPossible jumps:\n\nFrom 0:\n\n- Jump +5 →5.\n\nFrom 5:\n\n- Jump -3 →2.\n\nFrom 2:\n\n- Can't jump +5 (2+5=7>6).\n\n- Can't jump -3 (2-3=-1 <0).\n\nSo, from 2, no further jumps.\n\nFrom 5, can't jump +5 again.\n\nSo, reachable positions are 0,5,2.\n\nAdditionally, can the frog reach 1?\n\nNot via this path.\n\nIs there another way?\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can make a different sequence of jumps.\n\nLike 0 →5 →2 → ... but that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, can the frog reach 1 via 0 →5 →2 →7 (invalid), then 4 →1 (but 4 is not reachable unless it's reachable via some other path).\n\nWait, perhaps 0 →5 →2 →7 (invalid) →4 is not possible because 7 is beyond x=6.\n\nSo, 4 isn't reachable.\n\nSo, for x=6, the reachable positions are 0,5,2. So, f(6)=3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, for x=7, the frog can reach all positions up to 7, giving f(7)=8.\n\nSo, the key is to find the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and beyond that, all positions up to x are reachable.\n\nBut how?\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal x is a + b.\n\nIn the first sample, a=5, b=3: a + b=8. But for x=7, which is less than 8, the frog can reach all positions up to 7.\n\nWait, that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal x is a - b, but a=5, b=3: 5-3=2. But for x=2, the frog can reach 0,5,2, which is f(2)=3.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal x is the point where the frog can reach a certain position and then can reach any position beyond that via adding a and subtracting b.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: For a and b, compute the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and from x, the frog can reach any position beyond that via a series of a and -b jumps.\n\nWait, but how to model that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the minimal x such that the frog can reach x and then can make any number of a and -b jumps without exceeding x.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too abstract.\n\nPerhaps I should look for patterns in the sample and other test cases.\n\nLooking back at the sample:\n\nSample 3:\n\nInput: 100 100000 1\n\nOutput: 101\n\nExplanation: The frog can't make any jumps because a=100000 is much larger than b=1. So, the frog can only jump +100000, but that would take it to 100000, which is beyond x=100. So, the frog can't make any jumps beyond 0.\n\nThus, for x=100, the frog can only reach 0 and 100000, but 100000>100 is invalid. So, the frog can't reach 100000, but can it reach any intermediate positions?\n\nWait, no. Because the frog can't jump a=100000 from 0 as it would exceed x=100.\n\nAnd from 0, it can't jump -b= -1, which is invalid.\n\nSo, the frog can't make any jumps, so the reachable positions are only 0.\n\nThus, f(100)=1.\n\nWait, but the sample output is 101, which suggests that the sum from x=0 to 100 is 101. So, each x contributes 1, and 101 terms (0 to 100 inclusive) sum to 101.\n\nSo, in this case, for all x, f(x)=1.\n\nBecause the frog can't make any jumps.\n\nSo, how to model when the frog can't make any jumps beyond 0.\n\nThis happens when a > x and b >x.\n\nBecause, if a is larger than x, the frog can't jump a from 0. Similarly, if b is larger than x, the frog can't jump -b from 0.\n\nWait, no. Because if b is larger than x, jumping -b from 0 would take it to -b, which is invalid.\n\nSo, the frog can't make any jumps if a >x and b >x.\n\nWait, but in the third sample, a=100000 >100, b=1>100? No, b=1 is not larger than 100. So, the frog can't jump a from 0, but can jump -b once from 0, but that's not allowed.\n\nWait, no. Because from 0, the frog can choose to jump +a or -b.\n\nIf a=100000 >100, then +a would take it beyond x=100, which is invalid.\n\nIf b=1<=100, then the frog can choose to jump -b from 0, which would take it to -1, which is invalid.\n\nSo, the frog can't make any jumps, so the reachable positions are only 0.\n\nThus, for x=100, f(x)=1.\n\nSo, the sum is 101.\n\nSo, when a >x and b >x, the frog can't make any jumps.\n\nBut when a >x but b <=x, the frog can make -b jumps, but that would take it to negative positions, which are invalid.\n\nSo, the frog can't make any jumps, hence f(x)=1.\n\nSo, the sum is x+1.\n\nWait, but in the third sample, a=100000>100, but b=1<100. So, the frog can't make any jumps, hence f(x)=1 for all x.\n\nSo, the sum is 101.\n\nSo, the key is to find for each x whether the frog can make any jumps.\n\nBut for large x, this approach is computationally impossible.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be broken down into several cases:\n\nCase 1: The frog can't make any jumps for any x in [0, m]. So, f(x)=1 for all x, and sum is m+1.\n\nCase 2: The frog can make some jumps, but only for x >= some threshold. So, for x < threshold, f(x) is small, and for x >= threshold, f(x) increases.\n\nCase 3: The frog can reach all positions up to x for x >= some threshold.\n\nSo, the plan is to find for each x the f(x), and then sum them.\n\nBut for m up to 1e9, we need an O(1) or O(log n) solution.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Determine if the frog can make any jumps. If not, then f(x) is 1 for all x, and the sum is m+1.\n\n2. Else, find the minimal x where the frog can reach beyond x, i.e., find the point where the frog can reach x and then can make further jumps.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal x is the point where the frog can reach x, and then can make a jump a to x+a <=x, which is impossible unless x+a <=x, which is only possible if a=0, which is not the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm thinking in the wrong direction.\n\nAlternative approach: The frog can make any number of jumps as long as it can reach a position from which it can make more jumps.\n\nSo, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (d = gcd(a,b)) up to some maximum.\n\nBut how to find that maximum.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum position is unbounded if a and b allow it.\n\nBut in the first sample, for x=7, the frog can reach all positions up to 7, which is x.\n\nSo, perhaps for x >= (a + b), the frog can reach all positions up to x.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal x is a + b.\n\nWait, in the first sample, a=5, b=3: a +b=8.\n\nFor x=8, the frog can reach 0,5,2,7,4,1,6,3,8, etc.\n\nSo, for x=8, f(x)=9 (positions 0-8).\n\nBut for x=7, f(x)=8 (positions 0-7).\n\nSo, it seems that when x is >= a + b, the frog can reach all positions up to x.\n\nSo, for x >= a + b, f(x) = x +1.\n\nBut wait, for the second sample, a=1, b=2019: a +b=2020.\n\nBut for x=2020, the frog can't reach 2020 via a jump a (0+1=1, 1+1=2, etc.), but can reach all positions up to x.\n\nWait, but in the second sample, the frog can't make any -b jumps because b is larger than x initially. So, for x >= a + b, the frog can reach all positions up to x.\n\nBut in the second sample, a=1, so the frog can always jump a, and reach all positions up to x.\n\nSo, for x >= a + b, f(x) =x +1.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is:\n\nIf a > b:\n\n- For x >= a + b, f(x) =x +1.\n\nElse:\n\n- The frog can reach all positions up to x, but only if x is >= a certain value.\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to find the minimal x such that the frog can reach x, and then from x, can make any number of a and -b jumps without exceeding x.\n\nIn this case, x is the minimal x where x +a >x (so can't jump a from x), and x -b >=0.\n\nWait, but that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal x is the minimal x where the frog can reach x via some path, and then from x, can make a series of a and -b jumps that allow reaching any position up to x.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d (d = gcd(a, b)), provided that the position is >=0 and can be expressed as a combination of a and b steps, without exceeding x.\n\nBut",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct positions a frog can reach on a number line starting from position 0. The frog can jump either `a` units forward or `b` units backward, but it cannot go beyond the interval `[0, x]`.
