The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem is about radio towers in towns arranged along a coordinate line. The towns are numbered from 0 to n+1. We build a tower in each of the towns 1 to n with a probability of 1/2, independently. Then, for each tower built, we assign a signal power p (an integer between 1 and n). The signal from tower i covers all cities c where |c - i| < p. \n\nOur goal is to find the probability that after building the towers, there exists a way to set the signal powers such that:\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal.\n2. Each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal.\n\nHmm, okay. So I need to calculate the probability that the set of built towers can be configured in such a way.\n\nLet me think about the constraints. For each tower, its coverage area is determined by its position and power. We need to cover all towns 1..n exactly once, without overlapping, and ensuring that 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nWait, so the coverage intervals must form a partition of {1, 2, ..., n}, with each interval being [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)] because |c - i| < p is equivalent to c being in (i - p, i + p), so integers in [i - p + 1, i + p - 1], right? Or wait, maybe it's [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)]. Because |c -i| < p implies c is strictly less than i+p and strictly more than i-p. So the covered cities are those where c >= i - p + 1 and c <= i + p -1.\n\nSo for each tower at i with power p_i, the coverage is [i - p_i + 1, i + p_i -1]. The union of these intervals must be exactly 1..n, and they must be pairwise disjoint.\n\nAlso, town 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower.\n\nSo how do the towers' positions and their assigned powers need to look?\n\nI think the problem reduces to finding a set S of built towers, and a function f:S → [1,n], such that:\n\n1. For each i in S, f(i) is the power assigned to it.\n2. The intervals [i - f(i)+1, i + f(i)-1] for each i in S exactly cover the towns 1 to n, with no overlaps, and no town outside 1..n is covered.\n\nThis seems like a covering problem where each interval must be exactly one unit apart? Or perhaps not. Wait, each interval must be contiguous and non-overlapping, covering all the towns.\n\nWait, but each tower's coverage is an interval. So the entire set of intervals must form a partition of 1..n.\n\nMoreover, the intervals must fit together perfectly. So the way to model this is similar to tiling the line 1..n with non-overlapping intervals, each centered at some i in S, with certain lengths determined by f(i).\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a graph where each possible interval is a node, and edges represent compatible intervals. But that might get complicated.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to model this as a kind of independent structure. For each town, exactly one tower's coverage must include it. So the coverage intervals must form a partition of 1..n.\n\nSo the problem is to find whether the subset S of built towers can be assigned powers such that their coverage intervals form a partition of 1..n.\n\nBut given that the assignment of powers depends on the subset S, we need to count all subsets S for which such an assignment is possible.\n\nThe total number of possible subsets S is 2^(n), since each town from 1 to n has a 50% chance of being built. So the probability is (number of valid subsets) / (2^n), modulo 998244353.\n\nThus, the solution is to find the number of valid subsets S, then compute x/y mod MOD, where x is the count and y is 2^n, using modular inverses.\n\nBut n can be up to 2e5, so we need an O(n) or O(n log n) approach.\n\nHmm, so the main task is to find the number of subsets S where the towers in S can be assigned powers such that their coverage intervals form a partition of 1..n, without including 0 or n+1.\n\nHow to model this?\n\nLet me think about what the intervals must look like. Since each interval is [i - p_i +1, i + p_i -1], and the entire coverage is 1..n, the intervals must be non-overlapping and contiguous, covering all points.\n\nMoreover, the start of the first interval must be 1, and the end of the last interval must be n.\n\nSo perhaps the intervals must form a chain where each starts right after the previous ends.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, suppose you have two intervals: one starting at 1, ending at 3, and another starting at 5, ending at 7. That would cover 1-4, but wait, no, the second interval starts at 5, which is beyond 4, so the coverage is 5-7. So the entire coverage is 1-3 and 5-7, leaving 4 uncovered. That's invalid.\n\nSo the correct condition is that the intervals must form a perfect partition of 1..n, with no overlaps and no gaps.\n\nSo the intervals must form a sequence where each starts immediately after the previous ends.\n\nIn other words, the intervals are [a_1, b_1], [a_2, b_2], ..., [a_k, b_k], where a_1=1, b_k=n, and for each i>1, a_i = b_{i-1} + 1, and each [a_i, b_i] is covered by a single tower.\n\nEach such interval must correspond to exactly one tower in S, located somewhere within the interval.\n\nSo for each such interval [l, r], there must be a tower in S placed at position i, such that l ≤ i ≤ r, and the power p of that tower is such that l = i - p +1 and r = i + p -1.\n\nWhich implies that p = r - l + 1.\n\nWait, because l = i - (p-1) => p = i - l +1.\n\nSimilarly, r = i + (p-1) => p = r - i +1.\n\nSo p must equal both i - l +1 and r - i +1.\n\nWhich gives i - l +1 = r - i +1 => 2i = l + r => i = (l + r)/2.\n\nSo for each interval [l, r], the tower must be placed exactly at the midpoint of l and r, and the power is p = r - l +1.\n\nWait, but that's only possible if l + r is even, because i must be an integer.\n\nWait, no: l and r are integers, so (l + r) must be even for i to be integer. Otherwise, no such tower exists.\n\nBut wait, in our problem, the towers are built in some subset S. So for each interval [l, r], there must be a tower at i, which is the midpoint, and i must be present in S.\n\nSo for a subset S to be valid, it must allow for a partition into consecutive intervals where each interval [l, r] has a tower at i = (l + r)/2, and i is in S.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all subsets S where S contains exactly the midpoints of some partition of 1..n into intervals of odd length, and each interval's midpoint is in S.\n\nWait, because p is r - l + 1, which for an interval of length m must be m, so p is the same as the length of the interval. So the interval must have an odd length, since p is an integer and the interval starts and ends at specific points.\n\nWait, no. For example, if the interval is from 2 to 4, that's length 3, which is odd. p would be 3, so the tower is at (2+4)/2 = 3, which is indeed the midpoint.\n\nAnother example: interval 1-3: length 3, p=3, tower at 2.\n\nSo for each interval in the partition, the length must be odd, because otherwise, the midpoint is not an integer.\n\nThus, the intervals must consist of consecutive integers, each of odd length, with the midpoint in S.\n\nSo the problem becomes counting the number of subsets S such that S is exactly the set of midpoints of a partition of 1..n into intervals of odd length.\n\nMoreover, the midpoints must form a chain where each next interval starts right after the previous ends.\n\nSo the overall approach is to find all possible partitions of 1..n into intervals of odd length, and for each such partition, count the subset S consisting of the midpoints of those intervals.\n\nThen, the total number of valid S is the sum over all such partitions of 1.\n\nEach such S is a subset that can be assigned powers to satisfy the constraints.\n\nSo the key is to find the number of such valid partitions, considering that the towers are built in S, and the rest are not.\n\nBut wait, the problem allows any subset S of built towers, regardless of whether the midpoints are in S. So for a particular partition, the subset S must include exactly the midpoints, but may include other towers as well. However, any extra towers in S must not interfere with the partitioning.\n\nWait, no. Because if S includes a tower that is not a midpoint of any interval in the partition, then that tower's coverage would have to be within some interval, but since the intervals already cover all the towns, adding another tower would cause overlapping coverage or coverage outside the allowed area.\n\nSo S cannot contain any towers except the midpoints of the intervals in the partition. Because any other tower's coverage would either extend beyond the current intervals (thus including 0 or n+1, which is invalid), or overlap with an existing interval, which is also invalid.\n\nTherefore, the subset S must consist exactly of the midpoints of the intervals in the partition, and nothing else.\n\nSo for a given partition into intervals of odd lengths, the subset S is uniquely determined as the set of midpoints. Any other towers built in S would ruin the conditions.\n\nThus, the valid subsets S are exactly those that are the midpoints of some valid partition.\n\nHence, the number of valid S is equal to the number of ways to partition 1..n into intervals of odd lengths, each with a midpoint in S.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of such partitions.\n\nNow, the question is: How many ways are there to partition 1..n into intervals of odd lengths, such that the midpoints are all included in S, and the entire partition covers 1..n.\n\nEach such partition corresponds to a unique subset S, which is the set of midpoints.\n\nEach subset S is a valid solution only if it can be formed as the midpoints of some such partition.\n\nSo, the problem is now to find the number of such partitions.\n\nNow, let's model this. Let's think of the partition as a sequence of intervals [a_1, b_1], [a_2, b_2], ..., [a_k, b_k], where each a_i = b_{i-1} + 1, and each interval has odd length (b_i - a_i + 1 is odd). Also, the midpoint of each interval is in S.\n\nEach interval contributes exactly one point to S: the midpoint.\n\nSo, for each such partition, S is the set of midpoints, which must be exactly the towers built.\n\nSo, the number of valid subsets S is equal to the number of such partitions.\n\nSo, the problem now is to find the number of ways to split 1..n into intervals of odd length, each with a midpoint, and the intervals are consecutive and non-overlapping.\n\nThis seems like a combinatorial problem. Let's try to model it.\n\nLet me consider dynamic programming. Let dp[i] be the number of ways to partition the first i towns into intervals meeting the conditions.\n\nWe need to find dp[n].\n\nFor the base case, dp[0] = 1 (empty partition).\n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\n\ndp[i] = sum over all possible j < i, such that the interval [j+1, i] has odd length, of dp[j].\n\nBecause the last interval is [j+1, i], which has length i-j, which must be odd.\n\nWait, because the interval [j+1, i] has length i - (j+1) + 1 = i - j. So for it to be odd, i-j must be odd.\n\nSo j must have the same parity as i.\n\nSo for each i, we can look back at j's where j is i-1, i-3, etc., down to j=0.\n\nBut considering n up to 2e5, a straightforward DP approach would be O(n^2), which is too slow.\n\nWe need a way to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the recurrence:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k=1 to m} dp[i - k], where k is odd and i -k >=0.\n\nWait, because the interval [i -k +1, i] has length k, which must be odd.\n\nSo for each i, dp[i] is the sum of dp[i - 1], dp[i-3], dp[i-5], etc., down to i-k >=0.\n\nSo the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-3] + dp[i-5] + ... \n\nThis is similar to a Fibonacci-like sequence but with steps of 2.\n\nWait, no. Because the step is 1, but only for odd differences.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to model this as a linear recurrence.\n\nLet me think about the generating function.\n\nLet the generating function be G(x) = sum_{i=0}^{n} dp[i] x^i.\n\nThen, the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k=0}^{m} dp[i - (2k+1)}, where 2k+1 <= i.\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nG(x) = dp[0] + x dp[1] + x^2 dp[2} + ... \n\nBut I'm not sure if this approach will help.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for each i, dp[i] depends on the sum of dp at i-1, i-3, i-5, etc.\n\nThis is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different step.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this with matrix exponentiation or find a pattern in the dp array.\n\nLet's compute the initial terms to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nCompute dp[0] = 1.\n\ndp[1]: The only possible interval is [1,1], which has length 1 (odd). Midpoint is 1. So dp[1] = 1.\n\ndp[2]: Can't have an interval of length 2 (even). So no way to partition. dp[2] = 0.\n\ndp[3]: Two possibilities: either [1,3] as one interval (midpoint 2), or [1,2] (invalid as length 2) and [3,3]. But wait, no. Wait, for dp[3], the options are:\n\nOption 1: the interval is [1,3], which has length 3 (odd). Midpoint is 2. So dp[3] += dp[0} = 1.\n\nOption 2: the interval is [1,2], which is invalid (length 2). So no. So another option is to take the last interval as [3,3], which requires that j = 2. But dp[2} is 0, so that doesn't contribute.\n\nThus, dp[3] = 1.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, for dp[3], we can choose j=0, making the last interval [1,3], which is valid. So dp[3] += dp[0} = 1.\n\nAlternatively, can we have another way? Like [1,2] (invalid) and [3,3]. But [1,2] is invalid, so this is not allowed.\n\nSo dp[3} = 1.\n\ndp[4}: Let's see.\n\nPossible j's are i-1=3, but [4-3=1,4] has length 4, which is even. So no.\n\nj=1: [2,4], length 3 (valid). So dp[4} += dp[1} = 1.\n\nj= -1: not allowed. So dp[4} =1.\n\nWait, but wait: 4 is even, so any interval [j+1,4] must have length 4 - j, which must be odd. So j must be odd.\n\nPossible j's are 1,3,5, etc., but 4-j >=0.\n\nSo j can be 1 or 3.\n\nFor j=1: [2,4], length 3. Valid, so add dp[1}=1.\n\nFor j=3: [4,4], length 1. Valid, so add dp[3}=1.\n\nThus, dp[4} = 1 +1 =2.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with earlier conclusion. So I must recompute.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list the dp for small i:\n\nn=0: dp[0}=1.\n\nn=1: dp[1}=1.\n\nn=2: can't partition, dp[2}=0.\n\nn=3: j can be 0, giving [1,3], so dp[3}=1.\n\nn=4: j can be 1 (interval [2,4]) and j=3 (interval [4,4]).\n\nSo dp[4}= dp[1} + dp[3} = 1 + 1 =2.\n\nn=5: j can be 4,3,1, etc.\n\nWait, for n=5:\n\nj can be 4: interval [5,5], dp[4}=2.\n\nj=3: interval [4,5], length 2 (invalid).\n\nj=2: invalid.\n\nj=1: interval [2,5], length 4 (invalid).\n\nj=0: interval [1,5}, length 5 (valid), dp[0}=1.\n\nSo dp[5}= dp[0} + dp[4} = 1+2=3.\n\nHmm, that's interesting.\n\nn=6: j can be 5 (dp[5}=3), j=3 (dp[3}=1), j=1 (dp[1}=1).\n\nSo dp[6}=3+1+1=5.\n\nWait, let's compute a few more terms.\n\nn=0: 1\n\nn=1:1\n\nn=2:0\n\nn=3:1\n\nn=4:2\n\nn=5:3\n\nn=6:5\n\nn=7: ?\n\nLet's compute dp[7]:\n\nj can be 6,5,3,1,-1... So j=6: [7,7], dp[6}=5.\n\nj=5: [6,7], length 2 (invalid).\n\nj=4: [5,7], length 3 (valid), dp[4}=2.\n\nj=3: [4,7}, length4 (invalid).\n\nj=2: [3,7}, length5 (valid), dp[2}=0.\n\nj=1: [2,7}, length6 (invalid).\n\nj=0: [1,7}, length7 (valid), dp[0}=1.\n\nSo dp[7}=5 (from j=6) +2 (from j=4) +1 (from j=0)=8.\n\nWait, but j=2: [3,7}, length5. So 7-3+1=5. So yes, that's valid. But dp[2}=0, so it contributes 0.\n\nSo dp[7}=5+2+0+1=8.\n\nHmm, so the dp sequence is:\n\nn : dp[n]\n\n0 :1\n\n1 :1\n\n2 :0\n\n3 :1\n\n4 :2\n\n5 :3\n\n6 :5\n\n7 :8\n\nLooking at this, it seems like the dp sequence follows the Fibonacci numbers shifted by some indices.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nn=3:1\n\nn=4:2\n\nn=5:3\n\nn=6:5\n\nn=7:8\n\nYes! This looks like the Fibonacci sequence starting from 1,2,3,5,8,...\n\nFibonacci sequence is usually defined as F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2}=1, F(3}=2, F(4}=3, F(5}=5, etc.\n\nWait, in our case:\n\ndp[1}=1=F(2}.\n\ndp[2}=0.\n\ndp[3}=1=F(4}.\n\ndp[4}=2=F(5}.\n\ndp[5}=3=F(6}.\n\ndp[6}=5=F(7}.\n\ndp[7}=8=F(9}.\n\nSo it's like dp[n} = F(n-1} for n >=1.\n\nWait, for n=1, dp[1}=1=F(2}.\n\nn=2, dp[2}=0, but F(3}=2, which is not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to think of dp[n} as the (n-1)th Fibonacci number.\n\nWait, for n=1: dp[1}=1= F(2}=1.\n\nn=2: dp[2}=0, but F(3}=2.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dp sequence is the Fibonacci numbers shifted by some index.\n\nLooking at the values:\n\nn | dp[n] | Fib\n---|------|----\n0 | 1 | F(2)\n1 |1 | F(2)\n2 |0 | ?\n3 |1 | F(4)\n4 |2 | F(5)\n5 |3 | F(6)\n6 |5 | F(7)\n7 |8 | F(9)\n\nHmm, perhaps dp[n} = F(n-1) when n is odd, and something else when even?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dp[n} is the (n//2)th Fibonacci number, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is the same as the Fibonacci sequence starting from F(0)=1, F(1}=1, F(2}=2, etc.\n\nWait, F(0}=1, F(1}=1, F(2}=2, F(3}=3, F(4}=5, F(5}=8.\n\nCompare with dp:\n\nn | dp[n} | F(k)\n0 |1 | F(0}\n1 |1 | F(1}\n2 |0 |?\n3 |1 | F(3}=2? No.\n\nHmm, perhaps this isn't the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the recurrence relation.\n\ndp[i} = sum_{k=0}^{m} dp[i - (2k + 1)}.\n\nThis can be rewritten as dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-3} + dp[i-5} + ... \n\nLet me see if this is a known recurrence.\n\nWait, perhaps this is the same as the Fibonacci sequence but with a step of 2.\n\nWait, for example:\n\ndp[1} = 1\n\ndp[2} = 0\n\ndp[3} = 1 = dp[0} + dp[2} =1 +0=1.\n\ndp[4} = dp[3} + dp[1} =1+1=2.\n\ndp[5} = dp[4} + dp[2} + dp[0} =2+0+1=3.\n\ndp[6} = dp[5} + dp[3} + dp[1} =3+1+1=5.\n\ndp[7} = dp[6} + dp[4} + dp[2} =5+2+0=7. Wait, but earlier calculation said dp[7}=8.\n\nHmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's recalculate dp[7}.\n\nFor i=7, j can be 6,5,3,1, etc.\n\nFor j=6: [7,7}, which is valid (length 1). So add dp[6}=5.\n\nj=5: [6,7}, length 2 (invalid). So no contribution.\n\nj=4: [5,7}, length 3. Add dp[4}=2.\n\nj=3: [4,7}, length4 (invalid).\n\nj=2: [3,7}, length5. So add dp[2}=0.\n\nj=1: [2,7}, length6 (invalid).\n\nj=0: [1,7}, length7. Add dp[0}=1.\n\nSo dp[7} =5 +2 +0 +1=8.\n\nBut according to the recurrence as dp[i} = sum of dp[i-1}, dp[i-3}, etc., for i=7, it would be dp[6} + dp[4} + dp[2} + dp[0}.\n\nWhich is 5+2+0+1=8. Which matches.\n\nWait, but in the earlier step, I thought that j=5 leads to interval [6,7}, which is invalid. So the correct recurrence is indeed that for each i, dp[i} is the sum of dp[j} for j = i-1, i-3, i-5, etc., as long as j >=0.\n\nSo, the recurrence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with steps of 2.\n\nSo the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-3} + dp[i-5} + ... \n\nThis can be represented as a linear recurrence with a characteristic equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this using matrix exponentiation, treating it as a linear recurrence relation.\n\nBut for large n up to 2e5, we need an O(n) solution.\n\nWait, perhaps we can find that the dp sequence satisfies a linear recurrence relation of order 2.\n\nLet me check for the first few terms:\n\ndp[0}=1\n\ndp[1}=1\n\ndp[2}=0\n\ndp[3}=1\n\ndp[4}=2\n\ndp[5}=3\n\ndp[6}=5\n\ndp[7}=8\n\nSo, looking for a pattern:\n\ndp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} ?\n\nWait, for i=3: 1=1 +0=1.\n\nYes.\n\ni=4:2=1 +0=1? No, because dp[3}=1, dp[2}=0, 1+0=1 !=2.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps another relation.\n\nLooking at dp[3}=1, dp[4}=2, dp[5}=3, dp[6}=5, dp[7}=8.\n\nThese look like Fibonacci numbers starting from dp[3}=1, dp[4}=2.\n\nWait, 1,2,3,5,8: these are Fibonacci numbers starting from F(2}=1, F(3}=2, F(4}=3, F(5}=5, F(6}=8.\n\nSo, dp[3}=F(2}, dp[4}=F(3}, dp[5}=F(4}, etc.\n\nWait, but for n=3, dp[3}=1=F(2}=1.\n\nn=4, dp[4}=2=F(3}=2.\n\nn=5, dp[5}=3=F(4}=3.\n\nn=6, dp[6}=5=F(5}=5.\n\nn=7, dp[7}=8=F(6}=8.\n\nSo, in general, for n>=1, dp[n} = F(n-1} where F is the Fibonacci sequence with F(0}=1, F(1}=1, F(2}=2, etc.\n\nWait, let's confirm:\n\nF(0}=1.\n\nF(1}=1.\n\nF(2}=2.\n\nF(3}=3.\n\nF(4}=5.\n\nF(5}=8.\n\nYes, for n=3, dp[3}=1=F(2}=1.\n\nn=4, dp[4}=2=F(3}=2.\n\nn=5, dp[5}=3=F(4}=3.\n\nn=6, dp[6}=5=F(5}=5.\n\nn=7, dp[7}=8=F(6}=8.\n\nSo, yes, it's clear that dp[n} = F(n-1}, where F is the standard Fibonacci sequence starting with F(0}=1, F(1}=1.\n\nSo, the number of valid subsets S is equal to the (n-1)th Fibonacci number.\n\nWait, but what about n=2: dp[2}=0, but F(1}=1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps the formula holds for n>=1.\n\nWait, n=0: dp[0}=1, which is F(-1}? Not sure.\n\nBut for n>=1, it's holding.\n\nSo, the number of valid subsets S is equal to the (n-1)th Fibonacci number.\n\nBut wait, let's test for n=1.\n\nn=1: dp[1}=1, which is F(0}=1.\n\nYes.\n\nn=2: dp[2}=0, which is F(1}=1 minus 1? No, perhaps the formula is different.\n\nBut for n>=3, it's matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps for n >=1, dp[n} = F(n-1}, except for n=2, which is 0.\n\nBut why?\n\nLooking back, for n=2, the interval must have length 2, which is even. So no way to partition, hence dp[2}=0.\n\nSo, the general formula is:\n\nIf n == 0: dp[0} =1.\n\nElse, dp[n} = F(n-1}, where F is the Fibonacci sequence starting with F(0}=1, F(1}=1.\n\nWait, but for n=2, F(1}=1, but dp[2}=0.\n\nSo perhaps the formula is:\n\ndp[n} = F(n-1} if n is even, and some other condition.\n\nWait, no. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the recurrence is such that for n >=3, dp[n} = dp[n-1} + dp[n-3}.\n\nWait, let's test:\n\ndp[3}=1= dp[2}+dp[0}=0+1=1: yes.\n\ndp[4}=2= dp[3}+dp[1}=1+1=2: yes.\n\ndp[5}=3= dp[4}+dp[2}=2+0=2: no, but actual dp[5} is 3.\n\nSo this suggests that the recurrence is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct recurrence is dp[n} = dp[n-1} + dp[n-2}.\n\nWait, let's test:\n\ndp[3}=1= dp[2}+dp[1}=0+1=1: yes.\n\ndp[4}=2= dp[3}+dp[2}=1+0=1: no, but actual dp[4} is 2.\n\nSo that's not correct.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recurrence is dp[n} = dp[n-1} + dp[n-3}.\n\nFor n=3:1=0+1=1: yes.\n\nn=4:2=1+0=1: no.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recurrence is similar to the Fibonacci but with a different offset.\n\nWait, looking at the dp values:\n\ndp[1}=1\n\ndp[2}=0\n\ndp[3}=1\n\ndp[4}=2\n\ndp[5}=3\n\ndp[6}=5\n\ndp[7}=8\n\nIt seems that for n >=3, dp[n} = dp[n-1} + dp[n-2}.\n\nCheck:\n\nn=3:1= dp[2}+dp[1}=0+1=1: yes.\n\nn=4:2=1+0=1: no.\n\nHmm, no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the Fibonacci numbers starting from dp[3}=1, dp[4}=2, dp[5}=3, etc.\n\nSo the Fibonacci sequence from F(2}=1, F(3}=2, F(4}=3, F(5}=5, F(6}=8.\n\nSo dp[n} = F(n-2} for n >=2.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nn=2: F(0}=1, but dp[2}=0.\n\nNo.\n\nn=3: F(1}=1: yes.\n\nn=4: F(2}=1: no, because dp[4}=2.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nThis approach may not be the most efficient. Let's think differently.\n\nGiven that dp[i} is the sum of dp[i-1}, dp[i-3}, dp[i-5}, etc., perhaps for each i, dp[i} can be expressed as dp[i-1} + dp[i-2}.\n\nWait, for i=3: dp[3}=1 = dp[2} + dp[1}=0 +1=1: yes.\n\ni=4:2= dp[3} + dp[2}=1 +0=1: no.\n\nHmm, no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recurrence is dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} for i >=3.\n\nLet me check:\n\ni=3: 1 =1+0: yes.\n\ni=4: 2=1+1: yes.\n\ni=5:3=2+1: yes.\n\ni=6:5=3+2: yes.\n\ni=7:8=5+3: yes.\n\nYes! So the dp sequence from i=3 onwards follows the Fibonacci recurrence.\n\nSo, for i >=3, dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2}.\n\nWith initial conditions:\n\ndp[0}=1.\n\ndp[1}=1.\n\ndp[2}=0.\n\nSo, the dp sequence is:\n\ndp[0}=1.\n\ndp[1}=1.\n\ndp[2}=0.\n\ndp[3}=1.\n\ndp[4}=1+0=1? Wait, no, wait earlier calculation says dp[4}=2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing something up.\n\nWait, let's re-examine.\n\nEarlier, for i=4, the sum is dp[3} + dp[1} =1+1=2.\n\nBut according to the new hypothesis, dp[4}= dp[3} + dp[2} =1+0=1, which contradicts.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct recurrence is:\n\nFor i >=3, dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-3}.\n\nBecause for i=4: dp[4}= dp[3} + dp[1} =1+1=2: yes.\n\ni=5: dp[4} + dp[2}=2+0=2: but earlier dp[5}=3.\n\nNo, that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recurrence is dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} + dp[i-3}.\n\nBut that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's time to think about the generating function.\n\nLet me denote G(x) = sum_{i=0}^\\infty dp[i} x^i.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\ndp[i} = sum_{k=0}^{m} dp[i - (2k +1)}, for i >=1.\n\nBut for i >=1, this can be written as:\n\ndp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-3} + dp[i-5} + ... \n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\ndp[i} = sum_{k=0}^{floor((i-1)/2)} dp[i-1-2k}.\n\nThis is similar to a generating function where G(x) satisfies:\n\nG(x) - dp[0} = x G(x) + x^3 G(x) + x^5 G(x) + ... \n\nSo,\n\nG(x) -1 = x (G(x)) + x^3 (G(x)) + x^5 (G(x)) + ... \n\nWhich is:\n\nG(x) -1 = x (G(x) + x^2 G(x) + x^4 G(x) + ... )\n\nLet me compute the sum inside the parentheses.\n\nSum_{k=0}^\\infty x^{2k} G(x) = G(x) * Sum_{k=0}^\\infty x^{2k} } = G(x) * (1/(1 -x^2)).\n\nSo,\n\nG(x) -1 = x * (G(x)/(1 -x^2)) ).\n\nThus,\n\nG(x) -1 = x G(x) / (1 -x^2).\n\nRearranging:\n\nG(x) - x G(x)/(1 -x^2) =1.\n\nFactor out G(x):\n\nG(x) [ 1 - x/(1 -x^2) ] =1.\n\nSimplify the term in brackets:\n\n1 - x/(1 -x^2) = (1 -x^2 -x )/(1 -x^2) = (1 -x -x^2)/(1 -x^2).\n\nSo,\n\nG(x) * (1 -x -x^2)/(1 -x^2) ) =1.\n\nThus,\n\nG(x) = (1 -x^2) / (1 -x -x^2).\n\nHmm, interesting. So the generating function G(x) is (1 -x",
