You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vitaly and Cycle.\" Hmm, I need to find the minimum number of edges to add to a graph to form an odd-length cycle (that's more than one vertex) and also count the number of ways to do that.\n\nAlright, let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nThe input is an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges. No loops or parallel edges. The task is to compute two values: t, the minimal number of edges needed to form such a cycle, and w, the number of ways to achieve this.\n\nWait, the cycle has to be simple, meaning no repeated vertices except for the start and end. And it must be of odd length, longer than one vertex. So a triangle (3 nodes) is allowed, but not a two-node cycle (which isn't possible anyway since it's a single edge).\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nLet me think about the components of the graph. Because if the graph is already connected and has a cycle, then maybe we don't need to add any edges. But wait, the existing cycles may not be of odd length. So perhaps we need to look for certain structures.\n\nFirst, let's consider the cases where adding 0 edges is possible. That would mean that the graph already has at least one odd-length cycle. So in that case, t=0, w=1.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal way to create such a cycle by adding edges.\n\nSo step one: Check if the graph already has an odd cycle. If yes, output t=0, w=1.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal t.\n\nBut wait, how can we have a graph without any odd cycles? For example, a bipartite graph. Because bipartite graphs can't have any cycles of odd length.\n\nAh, right! So if the graph is bipartite, then any cycle in it must be even-length. So adding edges to form an odd cycle would require creating a situation where the graph is no longer bipartite.\n\nSo perhaps the first thing to do is to check if the graph is bipartite. If it is, then the minimal edges needed could be 1 or 2, depending on certain conditions.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet's think. Suppose the graph is bipartitioned into two sets A and B. To form an odd cycle, we need to have a situation where a node in A connects to a node in B via some path, but there's a way to make a cycle that's odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal number of edges to add is 1 if there exists a bridge between the two partitions, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no. Let's think differently. Since the graph is bipartite, adding an edge within the same partition will create an odd cycle. Because in a bipartite graph, all cycles are even. Adding an edge that connects two nodes in the same partition will create an odd cycle.\n\nSo, in a bipartite graph, the minimal number of edges to add is 1, provided that there exists at least two nodes in each partition. Because if you can't add an edge within a partition, like if both partitions have only one node, then you can't create an odd cycle.\n\nWait, no. If the graph is bipartitioned into A and B, and if A has at least two nodes, then adding an edge between any two in A will create a triangle if they are connected via some path. Wait, no. Not necessarily. It depends on whether those two nodes are in the same partition.\n\nWait, in a bipartition, any edge added within A or within B will connect two nodes of the same color, thus creating an odd-length cycle.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a bipartition A = {a}, B = {b}. Then adding an edge between a and b is allowed, but that's a single edge which doesn't form a cycle. So in that case, adding another edge might help.\n\nWait, maybe the initial approach is wrong. Let's try to model this.\n\nCase 1: The graph already contains an odd cycle. Then t=0, w=1.\n\nCase 2: The graph is bipartite, but not connected. So, perhaps the graph is made up of multiple bipartite components. Then adding one edge within a partition of any component can create an odd cycle.\n\nWait, but each component is bipartite. So, for each component, if it's bipartite, adding an edge within its partition will create an odd cycle. So the minimal t is 1.\n\nBut wait, what if a component is just a single edge? Like a tree with two nodes connected by an edge. Then adding another edge within their partition will create a cycle of length 2, which is even. So that's not helpful.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the problem differently.\n\nLet me restate the problem: find the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd-length cycle, and count the number of ways to do so.\n\nSo, the steps I can take:\n\n1. Find all the existing cycles in the graph. Check if any of them is of odd length. If yes, then t=0, w=1.\n\n2. If not, then the graph is bipartite (since any non-bipartite graph has an odd cycle). So the graph is bipartite, but needs to be modified to create an odd cycle.\n\nIn this case, the minimal number of edges to add is either 1 or 2, depending on the structure of the graph.\n\nWait, why 1 or 2? Because adding one edge within a partition creates a cycle of length 2, which is even. Or wait, no. Wait, in a bipartite graph, any cycle is even. So adding an edge within a partition creates a new cycle that includes this edge. What's the parity of this new cycle?\n\nWell, in a bipartite graph, any path from a node u to v in the same partition must have an even number of edges. Because u and v are in the same partition, any path between them must consist of an even number of steps. So when you add an edge u-v within the same partition, the cycle formed is of length (the existing path length) + 1, which would be odd.\n\nSo adding one edge within a partition can create an odd cycle.\n\nSo in this scenario, the minimal t is 1.\n\nBut wait, sometimes adding one edge isn't sufficient. For example, if the graph is disconnected into multiple components, each being bipartite. So in each component, adding an edge within a partition would create an odd cycle in that component.\n\nSo the minimal t is 1.\n\nBut wait, perhaps some components cannot form an odd cycle even after adding one edge.\n\nWait, no. Because in a bipartite component, adding an edge within the same partition creates an odd-length cycle.\n\nSo in that case, the minimal t is 1.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the graph is a tree. For example, a tree is bipartite. Adding one edge between two nodes in the same partition creates exactly one cycle, which is of odd length.\n\nSo the minimal t is 1.\n\nBut wait, in some cases, maybe adding one edge is not enough. Like, if the graph is a collection of trees, but each tree is a single edge, then adding one edge can create a cycle of length 2, which is even. So that wouldn't help.\n\nWait, no. Because if the graph is two separate edges (like two disconnected edges), then adding an edge between the two nodes of the first edge would create a cycle of length 3, which is odd.\n\nWait, for example: nodes 1-2 and 3-4. If I add an edge between 2 and 3, then the cycle is 1-2-3-4-3, but wait, that's not correct because 4 is connected to 3. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. Let's say I have two separate edges: 1-2 and 3-4. Now, adding 2-3. So the path 1-2-3-4 is a path, but 2-3 is the new edge. So the cycle would be 1-2-3-4-3? No, because 4 is connected to 3, but 3 is connected to 2, which is connected to 1. So the cycle would be 1-2-3-4-3-2, which is a cycle of length 4 (even). Oh wait, that's even. So adding 2-3 doesn't create an odd cycle.\n\nHmm, so in that case, adding one edge isn't sufficient. So what do we do then?\n\nWe need to add two edges.\n\nFor example, add 1-3 and 2-4. Then the cycle is 1-3-4-2-1, which is a cycle of length 4, still even.\n\nWait, that's not working.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to add two edges in a way that creates an odd cycle.\n\nLike, add 1-3 and 1-4. Then, the cycle is 1-3-4-1, which is a triangle, length 3, which is odd. So that's good.\n\nBut wait, in that case, adding two edges: 1-3 and 1-4. So that's two edges added.\n\nSo the minimal t is 2 in that case.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that when the graph is bipartite, the minimal t is 1 if there exists at least one pair of nodes in the same partition that are connected via some path (i.e., the graph is connected in such a way). Otherwise, perhaps t is 2.\n\nWait, but how can the graph be bipartite and not have any such pairs? Because if the graph is connected, then any two nodes in the same partition are connected by a path, so adding an edge between them would create an odd cycle.\n\nSo perhaps the condition is: if the graph is connected and bipartite, then t=1.\n\nBut if the graph is disconnected into multiple bipartite components, each component may contribute to the possibility of adding an edge.\n\nWait, but when the graph is a forest (collection of trees), each tree is bipartite. So adding an edge within any tree's partition would create an odd cycle in that tree.\n\nSo in that case, t=1.\n\nBut wait, earlier example contradicts this. Like the two separate edges: adding one edge didn't create an odd cycle.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine that.\n\nOriginal graph: 1-2 and 3-4.\n\nAdd edge 2-3.\n\nNow, the cycle is 1-2-3-4-3-2, which is even. So adding one edge isn't sufficient.\n\nHmm, so in that case, t is 2.\n\nSo why does adding one edge not suffice in that case? Because the two trees are disconnected, and the added edge is between two different trees.\n\nWait, but in that case, the graph becomes connected, but the new edge is between nodes from different trees.\n\nSo perhaps the way to form an odd cycle is to connect the two trees in a way that allows for a cycle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal t is 1 when the graph is connected and bipartite, and t=2 when it's disconnected and bipartite.\n\nSo, the key factors are:\n\n- Whether the graph is bipartite.\n- Whether the graph is connected.\n\nSo, let's formalize:\n\nIf the graph is not bipartite: Then it already has an odd cycle. So t=0, w=1.\n\nElse (graph is bipartite):\n\n- If the graph is connected: then adding one edge within the same partition creates an odd cycle. So t=1.\n\n- Else (graph is disconnected): Then, for each connected component, adding an edge within the same partition of that component creates an odd cycle in that component. So the minimal t is 1.\n\nWait, but the earlier example contradicts this. So what's wrong with my reasoning.\n\nWait, in the example with two edges (1-2 and 3-4), adding one edge between 2 and 3 creates a cycle of length 4, which is even. So no, adding one edge isn't sufficient.\n\nSo in that case, the graph is disconnected, bipartite, and adding one edge doesn't create an odd cycle. So the minimal t must be higher.\n\nWait, but how? Because each component is bipartite.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that the added edge connects two different components, but that doesn't directly create an odd cycle. It might create a longer path, but the cycle requires returning to the start, which may involve multiple components.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal t is 1 if the graph is connected, but for disconnected graphs, it's 2.\n\nSo, in the case of two disconnected edges, adding two edges would allow forming an odd cycle.\n\nFor example, add edges 1-3 and 2-4. Now, the path is 1-3-4-2-1, which is a cycle of length 4 (even). Hmm, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps adding edges 1-3 and 1-4 would create a cycle of length 3. Because 1 is connected to 3 and 4, making a triangle.\n\nYes, in that case, the cycle is 1-3-1, but that's a single edge. Wait, no, wait. 1 is connected to 3 and 4. So the cycle is 1-3-1, which is not a valid cycle as it's just two edges, but that's a loop, which isn't allowed.\n\nWait, no. Wait, adding edges 1-3 and 1-4 would create a cycle 1-3-1-4-1? No, that's a cycle of length 3 (edges 1-3, 1-4, 3-4? No, 3 and 4 are not connected unless we add another edge.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to find all possible ways to add edges to form an odd cycle, and find the minimal t.\n\nBut that seems computationally heavy for a programming competition problem, especially considering the constraints on n and m.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the minimal t, regardless of the number of ways.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is as follows:\n\n1. Check if the graph is bipartite.\n\n   a. If not, output t=0, w=1.\n\n   b. If yes, proceed.\n\n2. For the bipartite case:\n\n   a. Check if the graph is connected.\n\n      i. If connected, then t=1, w is the number of pairs of nodes in the same partition that are connected via some path (so that adding an edge between them would form an odd cycle).\n\n      ii. If not connected, then we need to see if adding two edges can form an odd cycle.\n\n          - For example, when the graph is a forest with multiple trees.\n\nSo, in the case where the graph is disconnected and bipartite, t is 2, because you have to connect two components in a way that forms an odd cycle.\n\nWait, but how to compute that.\n\nWait, let's think about the disconnected case.\n\nSuppose the graph is bipartite and disconnected. So it's made up of k connected components, each of which is bipartite.\n\nEach component is a tree or a collection of trees.\n\nNow, adding an edge between any two nodes in the same partition of any component will create an odd cycle in that component.\n\nSo, in that case, t=1.\n\nBut wait, earlier example contradicts this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, the example I had was two separate edges: 1-2 and 3-4.\n\nThis is a bipartite graph with two components.\n\nAdding edge 2-3: Now, the cycle is 1-2-3-4-3-2, which is even.\n\nNo, that's not an odd cycle.\n\nHmm, so adding one edge within a component's partition may not create an odd cycle.\n\nWait, because the existing paths in the component may form an even-length path plus the new edge, leading to an even cycle.\n\nSo, perhaps adding one edge within the same component's partition is not sufficient.\n\nWait, but in a tree, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition should create an odd cycle.\n\nBecause in a tree, the path between two nodes is unique. So adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition would create a cycle whose length is the path length plus one.\n\nSince the path length is even (because the nodes are in the same partition), the cycle length is odd.\n\nYes! Because in a bipartite graph, any path between two nodes in the same partition has an even number of edges. Adding an edge between them creates a cycle of length (even) + 1 → odd.\n\nSo, in the case of a single tree, adding an edge between two same-partition nodes creates an odd cycle.\n\nBut in the case of two separate edges, adding an edge between 2 and 3 (same partition) creates a cycle of length 3: 1-2-3-1. That's a triangle, which is odd.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation said that adding 2-3 in the two-edge case creates a cycle of length 4.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake.\n\nLet me draw it out.\n\nOriginal graph: 1-2 and 3-4.\n\nAfter adding 2-3.\n\nWhat's the cycle?\n\nFrom 1 to 2: edge 1-2.\n\nFrom 2 to 3: new edge.\n\nFrom 3 to 4: edge 3-4.\n\nFrom 4 to 3: same edge.\n\nSo, to form a cycle, you can go 1-2-3-4-3-2. That's a cycle of length 5, which is odd. Wait, no: 1-2 is edge 1, 2-3 edge 2, 3-4 edge 3, 4-3 edge 4, 3-2 edge 5. So total of 5 edges, which is an odd cycle.\n\nWait, but that's a cycle of length 5, which is odd. So adding one edge in this case is sufficient.\n\nSo earlier reasoning was wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps in the case of a disconnected bipartite graph, adding one edge within a component's partition is sufficient to create an odd cycle.\n\nSo, in that case, the minimal t is 1.\n\nBut then why in the earlier example, adding 2-3 creates a cycle of length 5, which is odd.\n\nSo, why did I think it created a cycle of length 4?\n\nAh, because I thought the cycle was 1-2-3-4-3-2, which is 5 edges. So it's indeed an odd cycle.\n\nSo, in that case, adding one edge is sufficient.\n\nSo, in the case of a disconnected bipartite graph, adding one edge is sufficient.\n\nSo, the minimal t is 1, regardless of whether the graph is connected or not.\n\nBut wait, in that case, the two separate edges can be connected by adding one edge, which creates an odd cycle.\n\nSo, the initial assumption was correct.\n\nThen, perhaps the earlier confusion was due to incorrect cycle calculations.\n\nSo, in all cases where the graph is bipartite, the minimal t is 1.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the graph is a single node? Well, the problem says n is the number of vertices, but in the problem statement, the cycle must consist of more than one vertex. So, n=1 is not considered, as you can't form a cycle.\n\nSo, for n >= 2.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n- If the graph is not bipartite: t=0, w=1.\n\n- Else:\n\n   - t=1, and w is the number of pairs of nodes in the same partition that are connected via some path (i.e., in the same connected component) multiplied by the number of possible edges in each component.\n\nWait, no. Because for each connected component, we can add an edge between any two nodes in the same partition.\n\nEach such addition creates an odd cycle in that component.\n\nSo, the number of ways is the sum over all connected components of (number of possible edges within a partition in that component).\n\nWait, but in each component, the bipartition is fixed. So for each component, if it's bipartite, the number of possible edges within each partition is C(a,2) + C(b,2), where a and b are the sizes of the two partitions in that component.\n\nWait, no. Because for a component, adding any edge within the same partition will create an odd cycle. So for each component, the number of ways to choose such an edge is (a choose 2) + (b choose 2), where a and b are the sizes of the two partitions.\n\nWait, but wait, each component is a tree (since it's bipartite and connected). So the number of possible edges that can be added within a component is (a choose 2) + (b choose 2).\n\nSo, for all connected components, the total number of ways is the product of (number of choices per component), but no, because each component is independent in the choice of which edge to add.\n\nWait, no. Because each component can contribute its own edges. So the total number of ways is the sum of the products across all possible choices of edges in each component.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because each way corresponds to choosing an edge in exactly one component. Because adding an edge in one component doesn't affect the others.\n\nSo, the total number of ways is the sum, for each component, of the number of possible edges that can be added within that component to form an odd cycle.\n\nBecause for each component, you can choose to add one edge in it, and each such choice is a distinct way.\n\nSo, the total number of ways is the sum over all connected components of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2), where a_i and b_i are the sizes of the two partitions in component i.\n\nWait, but each component contributes (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2) possible edges that can be added within it.\n\nBut wait, adding any of these edges in any component will create an odd cycle. So the total number of ways is the sum of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2) for each component.\n\nWait, no. Because in each component, you can choose any one of these edges. So the total number of ways is the sum over each component of the number of possible edges in that component.\n\nBut wait, no, because each way is a selection of one edge per component. Or is it that each way is selecting one edge in any component.\n\nNo, because adding one edge in one component is sufficient to create an odd cycle. So each way is determined by the edge added in any component.\n\nSo the total number of ways is the sum of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2) for each component i.\n\nWait, no. Because for each component, you can choose any edge within its partitions. So for each component, the number of possible edges that can be added is (a_i * (a_i - 1))/2 + (b_i * (b_i - 1))/2.\n\nSo the total number of ways is the sum of this across all components.\n\nBut wait, in the case where the graph is connected, then it's just the number of possible edges within the two partitions.\n\nFor example, a bipartitioned graph with a=2, b=2. The number of ways is 1 (from a) + 1 (from b) = 2.\n\nWait, no: (2 choose 2) is 1 for each partition. So total ways is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample input.\n\nLooking back at the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 4\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n4 2\n\n4 3\n\nThe graph is a square, which is bipartite. The bipartition is {1,4} and {2,3}.\n\nNumber of ways: (2 choose 2) + (2 choose 2) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nSo the output is t=1, w=2.\n\nSample Output 1: 1 2.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3 3\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 1\n\nThis is a triangle, which is an odd cycle. So t=0, w=1.\n\nSample Output 2: 0 1.\n\nThird test case:\n\n3 0\n\nNo edges. So the graph is three isolated nodes.\n\nEach component is a single node. So each component can't contribute any edges. Because a_i is 1, b_i is 0. So (1 choose 2) + (0 choose 2) = 0.\n\nSo total ways is 0. So t=2, but wait, no.\n\nWait, in this case, the graph is three isolated nodes. Each node is in its own component. So for each component, a_i is 1, b_i is 0. So each component contributes 0 ways.\n\nSo total ways is 0. So t must be 2.\n\nWait, but according to our previous reasoning, the minimal t is 1 for a bipartite graph. So why in this case, adding one edge isn't sufficient.\n\nBecause each component is a single node, adding an edge between any two nodes would require connecting two components. But in that case, adding one edge won't form a cycle, because you have three nodes, each in their own component.\n\nWait, no. Because adding an edge between two nodes would create a connected component of size two, but to form a cycle, you need at least three edges. So for n=3, m=0, the graph is three isolated nodes.\n\nTo form a cycle, you need to connect at least three nodes in a way that forms a cycle.\n\nSo, the minimal t is 2: add two edges to form a triangle.\n\nSo in this case, the graph is bipartite, but each component is a single node. So each component's a_i is 1, b_i is 0. So each component contributes zero ways.\n\nSo the total ways is zero. Thus, t must be 2, but how?\n\nWait, this suggests that when the graph is a forest of single nodes, t=2.\n\nSo, the earlier reasoning that t=1 for bipartite graphs is incorrect.\n\nSo, what's the correct approach?\n\nI think I need to re-express the problem.\n\nThe key points:\n\n- If the graph is non-bipartite: t=0, w=1.\n\n- Else (graph is bipartite):\n\n   - If the graph is connected: t=1, w is the number of possible edges that can be added within the same partition.\n\n   - Else (graph is disconnected):\n\n      - For each connected component, determine whether adding an edge within its partition can form an odd cycle.\n\n      - If any component has a size >= 2 (i.e., has at least two nodes), then adding one edge in that component is sufficient. So t=1.\n\n      - Else (all components are single nodes): then, to form a cycle, we need to add at least two edges. So t=2.\n\nSo, the minimal t is 1 if the graph is bipartite and has at least one component with at least two nodes. Otherwise, if all components are single nodes, t=2.\n\nWait, but in the case where the graph is bipartite and consists of one component with two nodes, then adding one edge within the same partition forms a cycle of length 2, which is even. Wait, no, because in a bipartition of two nodes, adding an edge between them creates a cycle of length 2, which is even. So that's not an odd cycle.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, let's say the graph is two nodes connected by an edge. So the bipartition is {A, B}.\n\nAdding an edge between A and B creates a cycle of length 2, which is even. So that's not an odd cycle.\n\nSo, in this case, adding one edge is insufficient. We need to add two edges.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, no. Because the original graph has two nodes connected by an edge. Adding another edge between them creates a multiple edge, which is prohibited. So we can't add another edge between them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of adding edges between other nodes.\n\nBut in this case, there are only two nodes. So no other options.\n\nSo, in this case, the graph is bipartite and connected, but adding one edge creates an even cycle. So the minimal t is 2.\n\nWait, but that's a problem because the initial reasoning said that in a connected bipartite graph, adding one edge in the same partition creates an odd cycle.\n\nBut in this case, adding an edge between the two nodes creates a cycle of length 2, which is even.\n\nSo, this suggests that the initial reasoning is incorrect.\n\nThus, the problem is more complex than I thought.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nWhen the graph is bipartite:\n\n   If the graph is connected:\n\n      If the graph has an odd-length path (i.e., the distance between two nodes in the same partition is odd?), but I'm not sure.\n\n      Alternatively, perhaps the graph can be checked for certain properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the problem based on the following:\n\nAn odd cycle can be formed if and only if the graph is not bipartite OR there exists a pair of nodes u, v in the same partition such that the path between u and v in the current graph has an odd length.\n\nBut that seems complicated.\n\nWait, but for a bipartite graph, all cycles are even. So to form an odd cycle, we need to add an edge that creates a new cycle which is odd.\n\nSo, adding an edge between two nodes u and v in the same partition will create a new cycle consisting of the path from u to v plus the new edge. Since the path is even (because u and v are in the same partition), the new cycle is even + 1, which is odd.\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nSo, in the case of two nodes connected by an edge: u and v. They are in the same partition.\n\nAdding an edge u-v again (but it's not allowed) or adding an edge to another node is not possible.\n\nWait, but in this case, adding any edge between u and another node is not in the same partition. Wait, no—u and v are in the same partition.\n\nWait, in a bipartition, the nodes are divided into two sets, say A and B. So, in the case of two nodes, u and v are in the same set.\n\nWait, no, in a bipartition, the two sets are disjoint and every edge connects A to B.\n\nSo, in a two-node graph, u and v are in the same set? No, because the graph is bipartite, so u and v must be in different sets.\n\nWait, no. In a bipartition, each edge connects a node in A to a node in B.\n\nSo, for two nodes, they must be in different partitions.\n\nSo, adding an edge between them is not allowed, because it's already present.\n\nWait, but in the two-node case, the graph is a single edge, which is bipartite.\n\nSo, the bipartition is {u}, {v}.\n\nWait, no, no. Because in bipartition, each node is in exactly one of the two sets.\n\nSo, for two nodes connected by an edge, the bipartition is {u}, {v}.\n\nSo, adding an edge between u and v is not allowed (since it's already present), but adding another edge is prohibited.\n\nWait, but the problem states that we cannot add parallel edges. So, in the two-node case, adding another edge is impossible.\n\nSo, in that case, it's impossible to create an odd cycle, because any added edge would create a cycle of length 2 (even), which is not allowed.\n\nSo, the minimal t is 2, because we need to add two edges to form a triangle.\n\nWait, but in the two-node case, you can't form a triangle because there are only two nodes.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is that when the graph is bipartite and connected, but has no way to add an edge within the same partition to create an odd cycle, then t is 2.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\nIf the graph is bipartite:\n\n   Compute for each connected component:\n\n      Let the component be bipartitioned into A and B.\n\n      Let the component be a tree (since the graph is bipartite and connected, it's a tree if it's acyclic).\n\n      Then, the number of possible edges that can be added within A is |A| choose 2.\n\n      Similarly for B.\n\n      So, for the component, the number of ways is (|A| choose 2) + (|B| choose 2).\n\n   Sum these across all components.\n\n   Additionally, if any component has a bipartition where |A| >= 2 or |B| >= 2, then t=1.\n\n   Else, if all components have |A| =1 and |B|=1 (i.e., each component is a single node), then t=2.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Check if the graph is bipartite.\n\n   a. If not, output t=0, w=1.\n\n2. Else:\n\n   a. For each connected component:\n\n      i. Determine its bipartition into A and B.\n\n      ii. Compute the number of possible edges in A and B.\n\n      iii. Sum this across all components to get the total ways.\n\n   b. Check if any component has |A| >=2 or |B| >=2.\n\n      i. If yes: t=1.\n\n      ii. Else: t=2.\n\nSo, in the two-node case:\n\nComponent is one component with A={u}, B={v}.\n\nEach has size 1.\n\nSo, t=2.\n\nIn the three-node case where all are isolated:\n\nEach component is a single node. So t=2.\n\nIn the case where the graph is a single edge (two nodes), t=2.\n\nIn the case where the graph is connected and has a component with |A| >=2, t=1.\n\nSo, this seems to handle the various cases.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nCheck if the graph is bipartite.\n\nIf not, output t=0, w=1.\n\nElse:\n\n   Compute for each connected component:\n\n      The size of the two partitions (A and B).\n\n      Compute s = (a choose 2) + (b choose 2).\n\n      sum_w += s.\n\n   Check if any component has a >=2 or b >=2.\n\n   If yes: t=1, w=sum_w.\n\n   Else: t=2, w=0.\n\nWait, but in the case where the graph is bipartite and has a component with a=2 and b=2, sum_w is 1+1=2. So, t=1, w=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nIn the case where the graph is bipartite and has multiple components, each with a=1, b=1: sum_w is 0, and t=2, w=0.\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\n- Perform a bipartition check using BFS.\n\n- For each connected component, compute a and b.\n\n- Check if any component has a>=2 or b>=2.\n\n- Sum the possible edges per component.\n\nSo, now, the plan is to implement this.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nImplementing Bipartition Check:\n\nWe can perform BFS for each connected component, assigning colors to nodes. If during BFS we find a node that is adjacent to a node with the same color, the graph is not bipartite.\n\nOnce we have all the connected components, for each component, we have the counts a and b.\n\nCompute for each component, (a*(a-1)//2) + (b*(b-1)//2), and sum these to get sum_w.\n\nAlso, for each component, check if a >=2 or b >=2.\n\nIf any component satisfies this, then t=1.\n\nElse, t=2.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nBuild adjacency list.\n\nCheck if the graph is bipartite.\n\nIf not: print 0 1.\n\nElse:\n\n   For each connected component:\n\n      perform BFS to assign colors.\n\n      collect a and b.\n\n      compute s += (a choose 2) + (b choose 2).\n\n      if a >=2 or b >=2:\n\n          flag = True\n\n   if flag is True:\n\n      t = 1\n\n      w = sum_w\n\n   else:\n\n      t = 2\n\n      w = 0\n\n   print t and w.\n\nWait, but wait: in the case where all components have a=1 and b=1, t is 2 and w=0.\n\nBut in the case where one component has a=2 and b=1, then t=1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\n- For each connected component, track a and b.\n\nNow, implementing Bipartition Check:\n\nWe'll need to process each connected component, and for each, determine if it's bipartite, and record a and b.\n\nWait, but during the Bipartition Check, we can also collect the counts of a and b for each component.\n\nSo, during BFS:\n\nFor each node not yet visited, assign color 0. Then, for each neighbor, if unvisited, assign opposite color. If already visited, check if color is opposite; else, not bipartite.\n\nSo, during BFS, for each component, we can count the number of nodes in each color.\n\nOnce the BFS is done, for each component, we have a and b.\n\nSo, code-wise, in Python:\n\nImplement BFS:\n\nvisited = [False] * (n+1)\n\ncolor = [-1] * (n+1)\n\nis_b",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges to add to an undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length and count the number of ways to achieve this.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check if the Graph is Bipartite**: A bipartite graph cannot contain any odd-length cycles. If the graph is not bipartite, it already contains an odd-length cycle, so the answer is `t=0` and `w=1`.\n\n2. **Bipartite Check Using BFS**: For each connected component of the graph, use BFS to check if it is bipartite. During BFS, assign colors to nodes to ensure no two adjacent nodes have the same color. If any conflict is found, the graph is not bipartite.\n\n3. **Component Analysis**: For each bipartite connected component, count the number of nodes in each partition (set A and set B). Calculate the number of possible edges that can be added within each partition to form an odd-length cycle.\n\n4. **Determine Minimum Edges and Ways**:\n   - If any component has at least two nodes in one partition, adding one edge within that partition will form an odd cycle. Thus, `t=1` and the number of ways is the sum of possible edges across all components.\n   - If all components are single nodes, forming an odd cycle requires adding two edges, so `t=2` and `w=0`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for _ in range(m):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        adj[a].append(b)\n        adj[b].append(a)\n\n    # Check if graph is bipartite\n    is_bipartite = True\n    color = [-1] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if color[i] == -1:\n            queue = deque()\n            queue.append(i)\n            color[i] = 0\n            while queue:\n                u = queue.popleft()\n                for v in adj[u]:\n                    if color[v] == -1:\n                        color[v] = color[u] ^ 1\n                        queue.append(v)\n                    elif color[v] == color[u]:\n                        is_bipartite = False\n                        break\n                if not is_bipartite:\n                    break\n        if not is_bipartite:\n            break\n\n    if not is_bipartite:\n        print(\"0 1\")\n        return\n\n    # Now process each component\n    sum_w = 0\n    has_large_component = False\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if color[i] == -1:\n            # BFS to find component's color counts\n            queue = deque()\n            queue.append(i)\n            color[i] = 0\n            cnt_a = 0\n            cnt_b = 0\n            while queue:\n                u = queue.popleft()\n                if color[u] == 0:\n                    cnt_a += 1\n                else:\n                    cnt_b += 1\n                for v in adj[u]:\n                    if color[v] == -1:\n                        color[v] = color[u] ^ 1\n                        queue.append(v)\n                    elif color[v] == color[u]:\n                        # Shouldn't happen as we already checked bipartition\n                        pass\n            # Compute possible edges in each partition\n            ways = (cnt_a * (cnt_a - 1) // 2) + (cnt_b * (cnt_b - 1) // 2)\n            sum_w += ways\n            if cnt_a >= 2 or cnt_b >= 2:\n                has_large_component = True\n\n    if has_large_component:\n        print(f\"1 {sum_w}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"2 0\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Bipartite Check**: The code first checks if the graph is bipartite using BFS. If it is not bipartite, it immediately returns `t=0` and `w=1`.\n- **Component Analysis**: For each bipartite component, the number of nodes in each partition is counted. The number of ways to add edges within each partition is calculated and summed.\n- **Result Determination**: If any component allows forming an odd cycle with one additional edge, `t=1`. Otherwise, if all components are single nodes, `t=2`.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum edges and ways to form an odd-length cycle, handling both connected and disconnected graphs appropriately.",
