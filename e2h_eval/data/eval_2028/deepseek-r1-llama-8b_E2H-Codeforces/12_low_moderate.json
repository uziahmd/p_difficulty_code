The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, Xenia is in a city with houses arranged in a ring, right? She needs to do some tasks, and each task requires her to be at a specific house. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again. Oh right, the traffic is one-way, clockwise. So she can't go against the flow; she can only move to the next house in the clockwise direction each step. Each move takes one unit of time.\n\nSo, how do we model this? Well, the initial position is house 1. For each task ai, she needs to reach it after completing all previous tasks. Wait, no, wait: the i-th task is to be done when she's at ai, but she has to do all tasks numbered less than i before that. Oh, no, wait: the note says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So for each task, she must be present at ai, and all tasks with numbers less than i must have been done before. So the order of the tasks matters in the sense that she can process them in any order as long as for each task i, she's at ai after handling all j < i.\n\nWait, no. The problem says she has m tasks. Each task i is to be done at ai, and she must have completed all tasks with numbers less than i before that. So the sequence of tasks must be processed in the order of their indices. So task 1 is first, then task 2, up to task m. But each task can be done in any order as long as the dependencies are satisfied. Or perhaps not—no, because the tasks are given in a list, and for each i, she must have completed all j < i before i. So the tasks are processed in the order 1, 2, ..., m. So for each i from 1 to m, she must be at ai, and all the previous tasks (j < i) must have been done before that.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. The problem says she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. So maybe the tasks can be arranged in any order, but for each task i, all tasks j where j < i must have been completed before i. So the earliest possible way is to process the tasks in the order of their indices. Because if you process i before j where j < i, that might not be allowed. So the optimal way is to process the tasks in the order of increasing index, because each task depends on all the previous ones being done.\n\nSo, the approach is to process the tasks in the order a1, a2, ..., am. Because for each step i, she must be at ai, and all prior tasks have already been handled.\n\nSo, now, the problem reduces to finding the minimal path that starts at 1, and then visits a1, a2, ..., am in order, possibly with repeated visits as needed, and the total time is the sum of the steps taken.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nHmm. Let's think about the positions. Since the houses are arranged in a ring, moving from any house to the next takes +1 time. So the distance between two houses in the clockwise direction is (b - a) mod n, but since the ring is circular, sometimes it's shorter the other way. Wait, no. Because the traffic is one way, clockwise. So, if you're at a, moving to the next house is a+1, wrapping around if necessary. So, the distance from a to b is (b - a) % n. But since moving is only allowed in one direction, the shortest path is always the one that goes the minimal steps in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, no. Because if the houses are arranged in a circle, moving clockwise is the only option. So, the minimal time to get from a to b is (b - a) mod n. Because if a is 4 and n is 4, moving from 4 to 1 is 1 step.\n\nWait, but let's say a is 4, n is 5. Then moving to 1 is one step. So yes, (1-4) mod 5 is 2, but that's the counter-clockwise way. Oh wait, no! Because the movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction. So to get from 4 to 1, you have to go through 5, which is one step. So (1 -4) mod 5 is 2, but that's not the correct distance. So, the correct way is (b - a) mod n, but if a > b, that's not correct.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: if a=4, b=1,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks given that she can only move in a clockwise direction around a ring of houses. Each task must be completed in the order they are given, and each move between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to visit several houses in a specific order. The challenge is to find the shortest path that allows her to visit each required house in the given order, considering the circular nature of the ring road.\n2. **Intuition**: Since movement is restricted to a single direction (clockwise), the distance between two houses `a` and `b` is calculated as `(b - a) % n`. This formula accounts for the circular arrangement and ensures we always move in the correct direction.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Start from house 1.\n   - For each task in the given order, compute the minimal distance from the current position to the next required house.\n   - Sum these distances to get the total time required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor ai in tasks:\n    # Calculate the distance from current to ai in clockwise direction\n    distance = (ai - current) % n\n    total_time += distance\n    current = ai\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Reading**: Read the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`, followed by the list of tasks.\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with a total time of 0.\n- **Task Processing**: For each task, compute the clockwise distance from the current house to the task's house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular arrangement.\n- **Update Position**: Move to the task's house and add the computed distance to the total time.\n- **Output**: Print the total time after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time required by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ring road.",
