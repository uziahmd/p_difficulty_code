Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Lanterns.\" Hmm.\n\nSo, the setup is that Vanya is walking along a straight street of length l. There are n lanterns placed along this street. Each lantern can light all points within a distance d from it. The goal is to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nWait, right. So, the street goes from 0 to l on a number line. Each lantern is at some position ai, and when they light up with radius d, their coverage is [ai - d, ai + d]. But since the street is bounded by 0 and l, any part beyond those points doesn't count. So for each lantern, the effective coverage is the intersection of [ai -d, ai +d] with [0, l].\n\nWe need to choose d such that the union of all these intervals covers the entire [0, l]. And we want the smallest possible d.\n\nHmm, how to approach this?\n\nFirst thought: the minimal d must ensure that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's coverage. So for each point x in [0, l], there exists a lantern ai such that |x - ai| <= d.\n\nBut checking every point isn't feasible because l can be up to 1e9. So we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach: the problem reduces to finding the maximum distance between two adjacent lanterns after sorting them, but also considering the ends of the street (0 and l). Because the minimal d must cover the gaps between consecutive lanterns, as well as the ends.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if you have two lanterns next to each other, the required d is half the distance between them. Also, if a lantern is at position 0, then the distance to the start is 0, so it contributes nothing. Similarly for l.\n\nSo the steps I think are:\n\n1. Sort the list of lantern positions.\n2. Consider the street as starting at 0 and ending at l. So, add 0 and l to the sorted list as virtual lanterns? Or maybe not, but think about the edges.\n3. For each pair of consecutive lanterns (including 0 and the first lantern, and the last lantern and l), compute the required d to cover the gap between them.\n4. The maximum of these required ds will be the minimal d needed.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose the lanterns are at positions a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Sorted in increasing order. Then, the initial segment from 0 to a_1 must be covered. So the first lantern must have d >= a_1 (since 0 is the start, so the first lantern covers from a_1 -d to a_1 +d. But to cover 0, d must be at least a_1. Because 0 is only covered if a_1 -d <= 0, which requires d >= a_1. Wait, no: a_1 could be at 0, then d can be zero. Hmm, perhaps I should model the initial gap as the distance from 0 to the first lantern, but that's only necessary if the first lantern is not at 0.\n\nSimilarly, the end of the street is l. So the last lantern must cover from its position plus d to l. So the last lantern's position plus d must be >= l. So d >= l - a_n, but only if a_n is less than l.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: consider all the gaps between consecutive points, including the start and end.\n\nThe gaps are:\n\n- From 0 to a_1\n- Between a_i and a_{i+1} for i=1..n-1\n- From a_n to l\n\nEach of these gaps must be covered by the lanterns.\n\nFor each gap, the required d is determined by the furthest apart the two points in the gap are, considering whether a lantern can cover both ends.\n\nWait, for example, if a gap is between x and y, where x < y. To cover this gap, at least one lantern must be placed somewhere such that its coverage includes both x and y. So the minimal d for this gap is max(y - x, ...) Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, no. The minimal d for a single gap is the minimal d such that some lantern covers both x and y. That would require that the lantern's position is somewhere that x and y are within d of it. So the optimal is to place the lantern exactly in the middle of x and y. Then, the required d is (y - x)/2. Because then, the lantern covers from (mid - (y-x)/2) to (mid + (y-x)/2), which is exactly x and y.\n\nWait, but wait: if the lantern is in the middle, then the distance to x is (y-x)/2 and same for y. So d must be at least (y-x)/2.\n\nAlternatively, if the lantern is placed at x, then it covers up to x +d. So to cover y, we need d >= y -x. But that's larger than placing it in the middle.\n\nSo for each gap between two points, the minimal d required for that gap is (gap_length) / 2. Because that's the minimal d that allows a single lantern to cover both ends.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Sort all lantern positions, including 0 and l as virtual points.\n- Compute the differences between consecutive points.\n- For each difference, compute the required d as (difference) / 2.\n- The maximum of these d's is the minimal d needed.\n\nAh, that makes sense. Because for each gap, the minimal required d is half the gap's length, and the overall d must be at least as large as the maximum of all these. Otherwise, there exists a gap that cannot be covered.\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n7 15\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting, the lanterns are at 0, 3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nCompute the gaps:\n0 to 3: gap is 3 → d is 1.5\n3 to 5: 2 → d is 1\n5 to7: 2 → d=1\n7 to9: 2 →d=1\n9 to14:5 →d=2.5\n14 to15:1 →d=0.5\nAlso, the ends: 0 is already covered by the first lantern, and 15 is covered by the last.\n\nSo the maximum d is 2.5. Which matches the sample output of 2.5000000000.\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 5\n2 5\n\nSorted: 2,5.\n\nAdd 0 and 5? Wait, no. Wait, the initial list is [2,5]. So the gaps are:\n\n0 to 2: gap is 2 →d=1\n2 to5:3 →d=1.5\n5 to5:0 (no gap).\n\nWait, but the last lantern is at 5, which is the end, so the last gap is 5 to l=5, which is zero. So the maximum is 1.5, but the sample output is 2.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Wait, what's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me re-examine the second sample.\n\nIn the second sample, the input is 2 5, and the lanterns are at 2 and 5.\n\nWhat is the correct minimal d?\n\nThe sample output is 2. So why is that?\n\nWait, according to the note, when d=2, the first lantern covers [0,4], and the second covers [3,5]. So together, they cover the entire street.\n\nBut according to my previous approach, the gaps are 0-2 (distance 2, d=1), 2-5 (distance 3, d=1.5). So the maximum is 1.5. So why is the correct answer 2?\n\nHmm, that suggests that my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is wrong because the first and last points are not considered as part of the lanterns. So for the sample input 2, the initial list is [2,5], but the street starts at 0 and ends at 5.\n\nSo the gaps are:\n\n0 to 2 → gap is 2 → required d is 1 (as before)\n2 to 5 → gap is 3 → required d is 1.5.\n\nBut in reality, with d=1.5, the first lantern (at 2) covers 0.5 to 3.5. The second lantern (at 5) covers 3.5 to 6.5. So combined, 0 is covered (by first), 5 is covered (by second). The entire street is [0,5], so 0 to 5.5 is covered, but the street is only up to 5. So does the second lantern at 5 with d=1.5 cover up to 5 +1.5=6.5, but our street is only up to 5. So yes, the entire street is covered.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the output is 2. So why is that?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.\n\nWait, the sample says that with d=2, the first lantern covers [0,4], and the second [3,5]. So together, they cover 0-4 and 3-5. So the union is 0-5.\n\nWait, but with d=1.5, the first lantern covers [0.5, 3.5], and the second covers [3.5, 6.5]. So the union is 0.5-6.5, which covers the entire street (0-5). So why is the sample output 2 instead of 1.5?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the sample.\n\nWait, looking back: the sample input is '2 5\\n2 5'—so two lanterns at 2 and 5. So the street is 0 to 5.\n\nWait, when d is 2, the first lantern at 2 covers from 0 to 4, and the second at 5 covers from 3 to 7. So the street is fully covered.\n\nIf d is 1.5, the first lantern covers from 0.5 to 3.5, the second from 3.5 to 6.5. So the street is covered.\n\nBut according to the sample, the output is 2. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the lanterns don't include 0 and l. So perhaps the initial and final gaps are also considered.\n\nWait, the problem says, the street is from 0 to l. So the first gap is from 0 to the first lantern, and the last gap is from the last lantern to l.\n\nAh! Oh right! So in the second sample, the first lantern is at 2, so the initial gap is 0 to 2 (length 2). The last lantern is at 5, which is equal to l, so the last gap is 5 to 5 (zero). But the initial gap is 2 units. So the required d is 1 for that initial gap. But the second lantern is at 5, which is the end. So the lanterns are covering up to 5, but the initial lantern is at 2, which with d=1.5 covers up to 3.5. But 0 to 2 is covered by the first lantern, which has d=1.5. So why does the sample require d=2?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the initial and final gaps. So in the second sample, the initial gap is from 0 to 2, which is 2 units. So the required d is 1.0 (because 2/2=1). The middle gap is 3 units (2 to 5), so required d is 1.5. So the maximum is 1.5. So why is the sample output 2.0?\n\nHmm, that's a contradiction. So perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I need to include 0 and l as lantern positions. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but in the second sample, the code would compute the required d as the maximum between (2/2)=1 and (3/2)=1.5, which is 1.5. But the sample expects 2.\n\nSo perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: the i-th lantern is at ai. It lights all points within distance d. So, for the entire street to be lit, every point must be within d of at least one lantern.\n\nIn the second sample, the lanterns are at 2 and 5. With d=1.5, does that cover the entire street?\n\nLet's check:\n\nPoint 0: distance to 2 is 2 > 1.5 → not covered. So 0 is not covered.\n\nWait, that's the issue. So with d=1.5, the first lantern covers up to 3.5, but 0 is not covered. So the initial approach was wrong.\n\nAh! Oh right! Because the initial approach considered the initial gap from 0 to the first lantern, but in reality, the first lantern must cover from 0 if d is large enough. Or, more accurately, the first lantern's coverage must reach 0, which requires that d >= a_1.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the first lantern is at a_1. Its coverage is [a_1 -d, a_1 +d]. The street starts at 0. So 0 must be within a_1 -d ≤ 0 ≤ a_1 +d. So 0 is covered if a_1 -d ≤ 0 ≤ a_1 +d.\n\nWhich simplifies to d ≥ a_1 (since a_1 -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a_1).\n\nSimilarly, the last lantern must have a_n +d ≥ l.\n\nSo the initial approach is incorrect because it only considers the gaps between lanterns but neglects the requirement that the first lantern must cover the start, and the last must cover the end.\n\nAh! So that's why the second sample's correct d is 2.\n\nBecause the first lantern is at 2, so d must be at least 2 to cover 0. Because 2 -d ≤0 → d≥2. Similarly, the last lantern is at 5, which is equal to l=5. So 5 +d must be ≥5, which is always true. So the required d is max(2, (5-2)/2) = max(2, 1.5) = 2.\n\nThat's why in the sample, d is 2.\n\nSo my initial approach missed the initial and end constraints. So the correct approach is:\n\nCompute the maximum of:\n\n- The first lantern's position (since 0 must be covered)\n- The last lantern's position subtracted from l (since l must be covered)\n- For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the midpoint distance (gap/2)\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions.\n2. Add 0 and l to the sorted list, but only for the purpose of computing the initial and final gaps.\n   Alternatively, compute the initial gap as 0 to first lantern, and the final gap as last lantern to l.\n3. For each consecutive pair in the sorted list (including 0 and l), compute the required d as (current - previous) / 2.\n4. Also, compute the initial required d as the first lantern's position (since 0 must be covered by it).\n5. Compute the final required d as l minus the last lantern's position (since last lantern must cover l).\n6. The maximum of all these required d's is the minimal d needed.\n\nSo, for the second sample:\n\nLanterns at 2 and 5.\n\nInitial required d is 2 (since first lantern is at 2, and 0 must be covered by it).\n\nBetween 2 and5, the gap is 3, so required d is 1.5.\n\nFinal required d is 5 -5 = 0.\n\nSo the maximum is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: the first sample.\n\nInitial required d is 0 (first lantern is at 0), so that's 0.\n\nThen, between 0 and3: 3, so 1.5.\n\n3 and5: 2 →1.\n\n5 and7:2→1.\n\n7 and9:2→1.\n\n9 and14:5→2.5.\n\n14 and15:1→0.5.\n\nFinal required d is 15-15=0.\n\nSo the maximum is 2.5, which is correct.\n\nSo now, the plan is clear.\n\nNow, let's think about the algorithm.\n\nAlgorithm Steps:\n\n1. Read n, l.\n\n2. Read the list of a_i.\n\n3. Sort the a_i in non-decreasing order.\n\n4. Compute the required d as follows:\n\n   a. If n is 0: but n >=1 according to the input constraints? Wait, input says 1<=n<=1000, so no need to handle n=0.\n\n   b. Compute the initial required d: a[0]. Because 0 must be covered by a[0], so a[0] -d <=0 →d >=a[0].\n\n   c. Compute the final required d: l - a[-1]. Because a[-1] +d >=l →d >= l -a[-1].\n\n   d. For each consecutive pair in the sorted a (from index 0 to 1, 1 to 2, ..., n-2 to n-1), compute the gap (current - previous). Divide by 2. Keep track of the maximum.\n\n   e. The overall required d is the maximum of initial, final, and all mid gaps.\n\n5. Output d with sufficient precision.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list as integers.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial_d = a[0]\n\nCompute final_d = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_d = max(initial_d, final_d)\n\nfor i in range(1, len(a)):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    mid_d = gap / 2\n\n    if mid_d > max_d:\n\n        max_d = mid_d\n\nreturn max_d\n\nYes, that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's test this logic with the samples.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, l=5\n\na = [2,5]\n\ninitial_d =2\n\nfinal_d=5-5=0\n\nmid_gaps: 5-2=3 →1.5\n\nmax_d = max(2, 0, 1.5) →2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1.\n\nSay, n=1, l=10, a=[3].\n\nThen initial_d=3, final_d=10-3=7.\n\nMid gap: none.\n\nmax_d is max(3,7) →7.\n\nSo the lantern at 3 must cover up to 3+d >=10 →d>=7. So that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a = [0, 5,10], l=10.\n\ninitial_d=0.\n\nfinal_d=0.\n\nmid gaps:\n\n0 to5: 5 →2.5\n\n5 to10:5→2.5\n\nmax_d is max(0,0, 2.5, 2.5) →2.5.\n\nSo the minimal d is 2.5.\n\nWhich makes sense: the middle lantern at 5 covers 2.5 on either side, so 5-2.5=2.5 and 5+2.5=7.5. The first lantern covers 0 to 2.5, the third covers 7.5 to 12.5. So the entire street is covered.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: a[0]=0, a[-1]=l.\n\nThen initial_d=0, final_d=0. Mid gaps determine the d.\n\nSo, for a = [0, l], mid gap is l, d is l/2.\n\nSo, for l=5, d=2.5.\n\nWhich would cover 0 to 2.5 and 3.5 to 7.5. Wait, but the street is 0-5. So 2.5 is covered by the first lantern, 3.5 is covered by the second. So the street is fully covered.\n\nWait, but what about point 2.5? It's covered by the first lantern, which has d=2.5. So 2.5 is within 0+2.5, yes.\n\nSo, in this case, the required d is 2.5.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nWe'll read the input, sort the list, compute initial, final, mid gaps, take the maximum, and print it with 10 decimal places.\n\nIn Python, we can read the input as follows.\n\nWait, the input is given as two lines. The first line is n and l, the second line is n integers.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the first line is given as ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5'].\n\nWait, but in the actual input, it's two lines: first line is n l, second is n a_i.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\ninitial_d = a[0]\n\nfinal_d = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_d = max(initial_d, final_d)\n\nfor i in range(1, len(a)):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    mid_d = gap / 2.0\n\n    if mid_d > max_d:\n\n        max_d = mid_d\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but wait: in the second sample, the initial_d is 2, which is correct, and the mid_d is 1.5, which is less than 2. So the maximum is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when the initial_d is larger than the mid gaps?\n\nLike when a[0] is 5, l=10, a[-1]=7.\n\nInitial_d=5, final_d=10-7=3.\n\nMid gaps: 7-5=2 →1.\n\nSo maximum is 5. So the minimal d is 5.\n\nWhich would require that the first lantern covers 0, which is 5 units away, so d=5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code correctly captures that.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, a = [0], l=5.\n\ninitial_d=0, final_d=5.\n\nmid gaps: none.\n\nmax_d=5.\n\nSo the lantern is at 0, d=5. It covers up to 5. So yes.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nI think this should handle all cases, including when a[0] is 0 or a[-1] is l, or neither.\n\nAnother test case: a = [0, 4], l=5.\n\ninitial_d=0.\n\nfinal_d=5-4=1.\n\nmid gap:4, mid_d=2.\n\nmax_d=2.\n\nSo the minimal d is 2.\n\nWhich would make the first lantern cover 0 to 2, the second 4 to 6. So the entire street is 0-5: 0-2 is covered, 2-4 is not covered by the first, but the second starts at 4, which is within 2 of 2? No, wait: 4 is 2 units away from 2, so with d=2, the first lantern covers 0 to 2, the second covers 4 to 6. The street is 0-5. So points between 2 and4 are not covered.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So the code's logic may be incorrect in this case.\n\nWait, what's the correct minimal d here?\n\nIf a = [0,4], l=5.\n\nWe need to cover 0-5.\n\nWith d=2:\n\n- 0 is covered (0-2)\n- 4 is covered (4+2=6>5, but 4 is covered as 4 is within 4+2)\n- The mid gap is 4-0=4, so mid_d=2.\n\nBut the street is 0-5. So the first lantern covers 0-2, the second covers 4-6. So the region 2-4 is not covered.\n\nThus, the code's approach is incorrect in this case.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that the initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, so what's the correct d in this case?\n\nWe need to cover the entire 0-5.\n\nWhat is the minimal d?\n\nThe first lantern is at 0, the second at4.\n\nTo cover 0-5, the second lantern must cover up to5. So 4 +d >=5 →d >=1.\n\nThe first lantern can cover up to 0 +d. But the first gap is 0-4, which is 4 units. So the mid_d for this gap is 2.\n\nBut the second gap is 4-5, which is 1 unit. So mid_d is 0.5.\n\nSo according to the code, the maximum is max(0, 1, 2, 0.5) →2.\n\nBut with d=2, the street is not fully covered.\n\nSo where is the error?\n\nWait, perhaps the code's logic is incorrect because it's not considering that the second lantern can cover the area beyond the mid gap.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is missing that the second lantern can cover some of the earlier regions.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is incorrect because the mid gaps are computed between all consecutive points, but the initial and final requirements are just two of the possible constraints.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the maximum of:\n\n- The initial_d (a[0])\n- The final_d (l - a[-1])\n- All mid gaps (each gap /2 )\n\nBut in this case, the mid gaps are 4 and 1.\n\n4/2=2, 1/2=0.5.\n\nThe initial_d is 0.\n\nThe final_d is 1.\n\nSo the maximum is 2.\n\nBut with d=2, the first lantern covers 0-2, the second 4-6. So 2-4 is uncovered.\n\nHence, the code's logic is incorrect.\n\nSo what's the correct approach?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is not sufficient, because sometimes the mid gaps are not the only ones determining the required d.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the maximum of the following four values:\n\n1. a[0]\n2. l - a[-1]\n3. (a[i] - a[i-1])/2 for each i from 1 to n-1\n4. Also, the maximum of (a[i] + d) for all i must be >= l.\n\nWait, no, that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d must satisfy:\n\nd >= max( a[0], l - a[-1], max( (a[i] - a[i-1])/2 for i in 1..n-1 ) )\n\nBut in the test case above, this gives d=2, but that's insufficient.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to compute the maximum of:\n\n- a[0]\n- l - a[-1]\n- (a[i] - a[i-1])/2 for all i.\n\nBut in the test case above, that gives d=2, but it's not sufficient.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is incorrect.\n\nWhat is the minimal d in that case?\n\nLet me compute.\n\nThe street is 0-5.\n\nLanterns at 0 and4.\n\nWe need to choose d such that every point in 0-5 is covered by at least one lantern.\n\nConstraints:\n\n- 0 must be covered by the first lantern: 0 is within 0 ±d →d >=0.\n\n- 5 must be covered by the second lantern: 4 +d >=5 →d >=1.\n\n- The area between 0 and4 must be covered.\n\nThe second lantern can cover up to 4 +d.\n\nThe first lantern can cover up to 0 +d.\n\nTo cover the entire street, the maximum of (0 +d, 4 +d) must be >=5.\n\nBut 4 +d >=5 →d>=1.\n\nBut the area between 0 and4 is 4 units. So the first lantern can cover up to d, and the second can cover from 4 -d to 4 +d.\n\nSo, to cover 0-4, the second lantern's left coverage is 4 -d. We need 4 -d <=0 +d?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think differently.\n\nThe first lantern covers [0, d].\n\nThe second covers [4-d, 4 +d].\n\nSo, for the entire 0-5 to be covered:\n\nThe first interval [0, d] must cover 0 to d.\n\nThe second interval must cover from 4-d to 4+d.\n\nSo, the overlapping between the two is important.\n\nWe need the entire [0,5] to be covered.\n\nSo, 4 -d <= d →4 <= 2d →d >=2.\n\nBecause:\n\nThe first lantern covers up to d.\n\nThe second covers down to 4 -d.\n\nTo cover 0 to 4, the two intervals must overlap, ensuring that the first's end is at least the second's start.\n\nSo, d >=4 -d →d >=2.\n\nAnd for the end, 4 +d >=5 →d >=1.\n\nSo, combining, d must be >=2.\n\nSo in this case, the required d is 2.\n\nWhich is what the code's approach suggested.\n\nBut earlier, when d=2, the first lantern covers 0-2, the second covers 2-6.\n\nSo 0-2 is covered by the first, 2-6 is covered by the second. So the entire 0-5 is covered.\n\nAh! So I was wrong earlier. When d=2, the two intervals do cover the entire street.\n\nSo the code's approach is correct.\n\nSo in the test case, the required d is indeed 2.\n\nSo why did I think that with d=2, the street wasn't covered? Because I didn't account for the fact that the second lantern's coverage starts at 4-2=2.\n\nSo 0-2 is covered by the first, 2-6 is covered by the second. So the entire street is covered.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo perhaps my initial confusion was due to miscalculating the coverage.\n\nSo the code works correctly.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, a = [0,3,6], l=6.\n\nInitial_d=0.\n\nFinal_d=0.\n\nMid gaps: 3,3 →1.5 each.\n\nMax_d is 1.5.\n\nSo with d=1.5, each lantern covers 1.5 units around them.\n\nThe first covers 0-3.\n\nSecond covers 3-6.\n\nThird covers 6-7.5 (but l is 6, so up to 6).\n\nWait, but the third lantern is at 6, which is l=6.\n\nSo the coverage of the third is 6 -1.5 to 6 +1.5 →4.5 to7.5. So the street is covered.\n\nSo the code's approach is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, a=[1,3,5], l=5.\n\nInitial_d=1.\n\nFinal_d=5-5=0.\n\nMid gaps: 2 and 2 →1 each.\n\nSo the maximum is 1.\n\nCheck coverage with d=1:\n\nFirst lantern covers 0 to2.\n\nSecond covers 2 to4.\n\nThird covers4 to6.\n\nSo the entire street is covered: 0-5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code's logic holds.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nSo now, the final code is as written earlier.\n\nNow, handling edge cases.\n\nWhat if a[0] is 0 and a[-1] is l?\n\nThen initial_d=0, final_d=0.\n\nMid gaps determine the maximum.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: a = [0, l].\n\nAs discussed, d is l/2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: a = [0,0, l]. Then initial_d=0, final_d= l -l=0. Mid gaps: 0 and l →0 and l/2. So maximum is l/2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns on a street can light the entire street from 0 to \\( l \\). Each lantern lights all points within a distance \\( d \\) from it.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns in ascending order.\n2. **Initial and Final Constraints**: The first lantern must cover the start of the street (0), so the required radius \\( d \\) must be at least the position of the first lantern. Similarly, the last lantern must cover the end of the street (\\( l \\)), so \\( d \\) must be at least \\( l \\) minus the position of the last lantern.\n3. **Mid Gaps Calculation**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the midpoint distance between them. The required radius \\( d \\) must be sufficient to cover this midpoint, which means \\( d \\) must be at least half of this midpoint distance.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The minimum \\( d \\) required will be the maximum value among the initial, final constraints, and the mid gaps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\na.sort()\n\ninitial_d = a[0]\nfinal_d = l - a[-1]\nmax_d = max(initial_d, final_d)\n\nfor i in range(1, len(a)):\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n    mid_d = gap / 2.0\n    if mid_d > max_d:\n        max_d = mid_d\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers \\( n \\) (number of lanterns) and \\( l \\) (length of the street), followed by \\( n \\) integers representing the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to facilitate the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Initial and Final Constraints**: The initial constraint is the position of the first lantern, ensuring it covers the start of the street. The final constraint ensures the last lantern covers the end of the street.\n4. **Mid Gaps**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, compute the midpoint distance and determine the required radius to cover this gap.\n5. **Result**: The maximum value from the initial, final constraints, and mid gaps gives the minimum radius \\( d \\) needed to light the entire street.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum radius \\( d \\) by considering both the coverage of the street's ends and the gaps between lanterns, ensuring the solution is both optimal and correct.",
