A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Soft Drinking,\" and from the description, I need to calculate how many toasts each friend can make given certain resources.\n\nHmm. Let me try to break down the problem step by step.\n\nThe input consists of several integers. Let's list them out:\n\nn: number of friends.\nk: number of bottles.\nl: milliliters per bottle.\nc: number of limes.\nd: slices per lime.\np: grams of salt.\nnl: milliliters needed per toast per friend.\nnp: grams of salt needed per toast per friend.\n\nSo the goal is to find the maximum number of toasts each friend can make such that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet me think about each resource:\n\n1. Drink:\nEach toast requires nl milliliters per friend, and there are n friends. So per toast, total drink needed is n * nl. We have k * l milliliters in total. So the maximum possible toasts based on drink is (k*l) / (n * nl). But we have to take the floor here because we can't have a fraction of a toast.\n\n2. Lime slices:\nEach lime gives d slices. We have c limes, so total slices are c*d. Each toast requires 1 slice per friend, so total per toast is n slices. So maximum toasts based on lime is (c*d) / n. Again, floor it.\n\n3. Salt:\nEach toast needs np grams per friend, so per toast it's n * np grams. We have p grams. So maximum toasts from salt is p / (n * np), floored.\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three values because all resources must be sufficient for the same number of toasts.\n\nWait, but wait—no, no. Because each toast requires one slice per person, right? So for each toast, every friend gets a slice. So for t toasts, you need t * n slices. And since each lime gives d slices, total required is t * n ≤ c * d → t ≤ (c*d)/n.\n\nSimilarly for salt, t * n * np ≤ p → t ≤ p/(n * np).\n\nAnd for drink, t * n * nl ≤ k*l → t ≤ (k*l)/(n*nl).\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of these three computed values.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute the drink limit: (k * l) // (n * nl)\n- Compute the lime limit: (c * d) // (n)\n- Compute the salt limit: p // (n * np)\n- The result is the minimum of these three.\n\nWait, but let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5 → drink is 20ml.\n\nCompute drink limit: 20 / (3 * 3) = 20/9 → 2 (since integer division).\nLime: c=10, d=8 → 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices. 80/3=26 toasts. So 26.\nSalt: p=100, np=1. Per toast, 3 * 1 =3g. So 100/3=33 toasts. So min(2,26,33) → 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n['5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3']\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → drink is 1000ml.\n\nDrink limit: 1000 / (5 *4) → 1000/20=50.\nLime: c=1, d=19 → 19 slices. Each toast needs 5 slices. 19/5=3. So 3.\nSalt: p=90, np=3. Each toast needs 5*3=15g. 90/15=6. So the min is 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample output of '3'.\n\nThird sample:\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → drink is 1e6ml. per toast, n*nl =10 *1=10. So 1e6 /10=100000 toasts.\n\nLime: c=25, d=23 → 575 slices. Each toast needs 10 slices → 575/10=57.\n\nSalt: p=1, np=1 → 1/(10*1)=0 toasts.\n\nSo min is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nSo now, the plan is to read the input line, parse all the numbers, compute each of the three limits, then take the minimum.\n\nBut wait,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Resources**: We have three main resources: drink, lime slices, and salt.\n2. **Calculate Resource Limits**:\n   - **Drink Limit**: Each toast requires `nl` milliliters per friend, so for `n` friends, each toast needs `n * nl` milliliters. The total drink available is `k * l` milliliters. Thus, the maximum number of toasts based on drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Slices Limit**: Each lime provides `d` slices, and with `c` limes, the total slices are `c * d`. Each toast requires one slice per friend, so the maximum number of toasts based on lime slices is `(c * d) // n`.\n   - **Salt Limit**: Each toast requires `np` grams of salt per friend, so for `n` friends, each toast needs `n * np` grams. The total salt available is `p` grams. Thus, the maximum number of toasts based on salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n3. **Determine the Minimum Toasts**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the smallest of the three calculated values from the above steps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input as a single line and split into integers\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n    n = data[0]\n    k = data[1]\n    l = data[2]\n    c = data[3]\n    d = data[4]\n    p = data[5]\n    nl = data[6]\n    np = data[7]\n    \n    # Calculate each constraint\n    drinks = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n    limes = (c * d) // n\n    salt = p // (n * np)\n    \n    # The minimum of these three determines the answer\n    result = min(drinks, limes, salt)\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe code reads the input values and calculates the maximum possible number of toasts each friend can make based on the available resources. It then determines the minimum value among the three resource constraints, which gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can enjoy without running out of any resource. This approach ensures that all constraints are respected and efficiently computes the solution using integer division to handle resource limits appropriately.",
