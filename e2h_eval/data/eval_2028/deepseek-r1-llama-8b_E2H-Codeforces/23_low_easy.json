In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles, and I have to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form at least one mentsu. Mentsu can be either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nHmm, let's think about how to approach this. The input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s' is one tile. My goal is to determine for each of these three inputs what's the minimal number of additional tiles needed.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the output is three lines, right? Like in the example, the input is three strings, and the output is three integers, each indicating the minimal for each possible hand. Or wait, maybe not. Oh no, the problem says that the output should print a single integer—the minimal number of tiles needed to win. But looking back at the sample input, it's a list of three strings, and the output is a list of three integers, like ['0', '0', '1']. So perhaps the output is three separate answers, each corresponding to each of the three initial hands?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample input shows three separate hands, each needing 0, 0, and 1 extra tiles. So the output is three integers, each for each of the three initial hands. So the problem is, for each of the three given hands, compute the minimal number of tiles to add so that that particular hand can form a mentsu.\n\nSo for each of the three input hands, I need to calculate the minimal number of tiles required to create at least one mentsu.\n\nThat makes sense because the sample input has three different hands, each with their own output.\n\nSo the plan is: for each of the three hands, check all possible ways to form a mentsu by adding some tiles, and find the minimal count.\n\nFirst, I'll process each of the three hands separately.\n\nLet me think about how to represent each hand. Each hand is a list of three tiles. For example, the first sample's first hand is ['1s', '2s', '3s'], which is a shuntsu, so requires 0.\n\nThe second hand is ['9m','9m','9m'], which is a koutsu, so 0 needed.\n\nThe third hand is ['3p','9m','2p'], which is two p's but not a triplet. So adding one tile could make a triplet if there's another 2p or 3p or something else. Alternatively, maybe a sequence.\n\nWait, the third hand is 3p, 9m, 2p. Wait, that's 2p and 3p, so maybe adding 1p would allow a sequence 2p,3p,4p? Or wait, 2p and 3p are consecutive, but they need a third. Alternatively, adding 1p or 4p could help form a sequence.\n\nWait, the third hand is 3p, 9m, 2p. So current counts: 2p x1, 3p x1. So maybe if we add a 1p, then the sequence would be 1p, 2p, 3p—so that's a shuntsu. So that's adding one tile.\n\nAlternatively, adding a 4p would make 2p,3p,4p—a shuntsu. So either way, one tile is enough.\n\nSo for each hand, I need to consider all possible mentsu options and find the minimal tiles needed.\n\nSo the steps for each hand are:\n\n1. Check all possible triplets (koutsu) that can be formed by adding tiles. Find the minimal tiles needed.\n\n2. Check all possible sequences (shuntsu) that can be formed by adding tiles. Find the minimal tiles needed.\n\n3. Take the minimal between the two possibilities.\n\nBut wait, sometimes a hand can have both a possible triplet and a sequence, but the minimal is whichever requires fewer tiles.\n\nSo for each hand, I need to generate all possible koutsu and shuntsu that can be formed, considering the existing tiles and the added ones, and find the minimal number of tiles needed to complete any of them.\n\nSo, for each hand, here's what I can do:\n\n- For the triplet case:\n   - For each possible suit, see if we can form a triplet.\n   - For each suit, look at the current tiles in that suit. For each tile value, see how many more we need to reach three.\n   - For example, if the current hand has two 5m tiles, then adding one more 5m will form a triplet. That's one tile.\n   - If the current hand has one 7p and none others, then adding two 7p tiles will form a triplet",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) from her hand of three tiles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Mentsu Types**: A mentsu can be either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n2. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, check if the current hand already forms a mentsu.\n3. **Evaluate Possible Mentsu**:\n   - **Triplet Check**: For each suit, count the occurrences of each tile value. Determine the minimal number of tiles needed to form a triplet.\n   - **Sequence Check**: For each suit, sort the tile values and check for consecutive sequences. Determine the minimal number of tiles needed to complete any such sequence.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Tiles**: For each hand, compute the minimal number of tiles needed to form either a triplet or a sequence and choose the smaller value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_extra_tiles(hand):\n    # Process each hand\n    suits = {'m', 'p', 's'}\n    counts = {}\n    tiles = [t[0] + t[1] for t in hand]\n    \n    # Check for existing shuntsu or koutsu\n    for t in tiles:\n        suit = t[1]\n        num = int(t[0])\n        counts.setdefault(suit, {})(num) = counts[suit].get(num, 0) + 1\n    \n    # Function to check possible shuntsu\n    def find_shuntsu():\n        for suit in suits:\n            sorted_nums = sorted(counts.get(suit, {}))\n            n = len(sorted_nums)\n            for i in range(n - 2):\n                a, b, c = sorted_nums[i], sorted_nums[i+1], sorted_nums[i+2]\n                if b == a + 1 and c == b + 1:\n                    continue\n                else:\n                    needed = 3 - n\n                    if needed <= 0:\n                        return 0\n                    else:\n                        # Find missing numbers\n                        required = set(range(a, a+3))\n                        have = set(sorted_nums)\n                        missing = required - have\n                        return len(missing)\n        return float('inf')\n    \n    # Function to check possible koutsu\n    def find_koutsu():\n        min_add = float('inf')\n        for suit in suits:\n            cnt = counts.get(suit, {})\n            for num in cnt:\n                current = cnt[num]\n                needed = 3 - current\n                if needed < 0:\n                    continue\n                if needed == 0:\n                    return 0\n                if needed < min_add:\n                    min_add = needed\n        return min_add if min_add != float('inf') else float('inf')\n    \n    # Check all possibilities\n    shuntsu_min = find_shuntsu()\n    koutsu_min = find_koutsu()\n    return min(shuntsu_min, koutsu_min)\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput_lines = sys.stdin.read().split()\nhand1 = input_lines[:3]\nhand2 = input_lines[3:6]\nhand3 = input_lines[6:9]\n\n# Compute for each hand\nres1 = min_extra_tiles(hand1)\nres2 = min_extra_tiles(hand2)\nres3 = min_extra_tiles(hand3)\n\n# Output results\nprint(res1)\nprint(res2)\nprint(res3)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as three separate hands, each consisting of three tiles.\n2. **Processing Each Hand**: For each hand, we count the occurrences of each tile value per suit.\n3. **Checking for Triplet**: For each suit, we determine how many more tiles are needed to form a triplet.\n4. **Checking for Sequence**: For each suit, we check for sequences of three consecutive numbers and determine how many tiles are needed to complete any such sequence.\n5. **Finding Minimum Tiles**: We compute the minimum number of tiles needed to form either a triplet or a sequence and return the smallest value.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal number of tiles needed for each hand to form a mentsu, considering both possible types of mentsu.",
