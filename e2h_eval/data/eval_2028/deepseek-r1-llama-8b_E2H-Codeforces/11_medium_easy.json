A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Soft Drinking,\" and from the description, I need to calculate how many toasts each friend can make given certain resources.\n\nHmm. Let me try to break down the problem step by step.\n\nThe input consists of several integers. Let's list them out:\n\nn: number of friends.\nk: number of bottles.\nl: milliliters per bottle.\nc: number of limes.\nd: slices per lime.\np: grams of salt.\nnl: milliliters needed per toast per friend.\nnp: grams of salt needed per toast per friend.\n\nSo the goal is to find the maximum number of toasts each friend can make such that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet me think about each resource:\n\n1. Drink:\nEach toast requires nl milliliters per friend, and there are n friends. So per toast, total drink needed is n * nl. We have k * l milliliters in total. So the maximum possible toasts based on drink is (k*l) / (n * nl). But we have to take the floor here because we can't have a fraction of a toast.\n\n2. Lime slices:\nEach lime gives d slices, and each toast requires one slice per friend. So total slices needed per toast is n. The total available slices are c * d. So the maximum toasts here is (c*d) // n.\n\n3. Salt:\nEach toast needs np grams per friend, so total per toast is n * np. Total salt is p. So the maximum toasts based on salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three values because all resources must be sufficient for the same number of toasts.\n\nWait, no. Wait. Let me re-calculate:\n\nWait, for the drink, each toast requires nl ml per friend. So for one toast, total drink used is n * nl. Because each of the n friends takes a slice. So yes, total drink is k*l, so max toasts from drink is (k*l) / (n * nl), but integer division.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices: each toast requires 1 slice per friend, so n slices per toast. So total is c*d slices. So the max is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor salt: each toast requires np grams per friend, so n * np per toast. So the max is p // (n * np).\n\nSo the maximum number of toasts T is the minimum of those three values.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me see the example given.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5 → total drink is 20ml.\n\nEach toast needs 3*3=9ml? Or wait, no. Wait, nl is 3, which is per friend. So each toast, all 3 friends take 3ml each, so 3*3=9ml per toast. So 20 /9 is 2.222..., so 2 toasts.\n\nLime: c=10, d=8 → 80 slices. Each toast uses 3 slices. 80/3 is 26.666, so 26. But wait, the note says they have enough for 80 toasts. Wait, no, in the note, it's said that limes are enough for 10*8=80 toasts. Oh, right, each lime gives 8 slices, and each toast requires 3 slices. Wait, no. Each toast requires one slice per friend, so for each toast, you need n slices. So for each toast, you use 3 slices. So the total number of toasts possible from limes is (c*d) // (n). Because each toast uses n slices.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. For each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for n friends, each toast needs n slices. So with c*d slices, you can make (c*d) / n toasts. So in the first example, c*d = 10*8=80, n=3. 80/3 is 26.666, so 26 toasts. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the note says: limes are enough for 10*8=80 toasts. Oh! Oh, wait, perhaps I was wrong. Let's read the note again.\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4×5=20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20/3=6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10×8=80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100/1=100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6,80,100)/3=2.\"\n\nWait, so according to the note, the limes can support 80 toasts. That's without considering the friends. So how?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's reevaluate.\n\nEach lime has d slices. So total slices are c * d.\n\nEach toast requires 1 slice per friend. So for one toast, you need n slices.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of toasts possible from limes is (c * d) // (n). Because each toast uses n slices.\n\nSo in the first example, 10*8=80 slices. Divided by 3 friends (each toast uses 3 slices) gives 26.666, so 26 toasts. But the note says 80 toasts. That doesn't add up.\n\nWait, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So where am I going wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem statement. Let me check.\n\nProblem statement:\n\nEach lime is cut into d slices. So total slices are c*d.\n\nEach friend needs a slice of lime per toast. So per toast, all friends need one slice each, so n slices per toast.\n\nThus, the maximum number of toasts possible from limes is (c*d) / (n * 1). Because each toast uses n slices.\n\nWait, no. Because for each toast, each friend takes one slice. So for T toasts, each friend will have T slices. So the total slices required is T * n.\n\nSo the maximum T is (c*d) // (n).\n\nIn the first example, c=10, d=8 → 80 slices. n=3 → 80 /3 = 26.666 → 26. So why does the note say 80 toasts?\n\nWait, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So that suggests that the calculation is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\n\"Each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt per toast.\"\n\nWait, per toast, each friend needs one slice. So for each toast, you need n slices.\n\nSo the maximum number of toasts T is limited by:\n\nT <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n\nT <= (c * d) / n\n\nT <= p / (n * np)\n\nSo the minimum of those three.\n\nWait, let's compute for the first sample:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo:\n\nDrink: (4*5) =20ml. Each toast needs 3*3=9ml. 20/9 =2.222→2.\n\nLimes: 10*8=80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices. So 80/3=26.666→26.\n\nSalt: 100 grams. Each toast needs 3*1=3 grams. 100/3=33.333→33.\n\nSo the minimum is 2. So the output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nBut the note says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. Hmm, that doesn't add up. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that for each lime, you get d slices, and each toast requires exactly one slice per friend, but perhaps per lime, you can only contribute to a certain number of toasts. Or maybe it's the other way around.\n\nWait, perhaps the limes are not per toast but per person. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, the note says: the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So perhaps the calculation is (c*d) / (n * 1). Because each toast requires one slice per friend, which is n slices per toast. So for the limes, the total is c*d, and the number of toasts is (c*d) / (n * 1) → 80/3=26.666, but the note says 80.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps I should read the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the problem says: after cutting, they have c limes cut into d slices. So total slices is c*d.\n\nEach friend needs a slice per toast. So for each toast, n slices are used.\n\nThus, the maximum number of toasts possible from limes is (c*d) / n.\n\nIn the first sample, that's 80/3=26.666, so 26.\n\nBut the note says the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So that suggests that the calculation is (c*d) / (something else). Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that for each toast, you can only use one slice per lime. Or perhaps the way the limes are sliced is different.\n\nWait, perhaps each lime is cut into d slices, but for each toast, you can only use one slice per lime. But that doesn't make sense because each friend needs a slice, and there are multiple limes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each toast requires one slice per lime, but that also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that each lime contributes one slice to each friend, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.\n\nIn the note, for the first sample, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So according to the note, 80 toasts. So what's 80? 10 limes * 8 slices each is 80. So how is that 80 toasts? Because each toast needs 3 slices.\n\nWait, 80 divided by 3 is 26.666, which is about 26 toasts. So the note is saying that limes can support 80 toasts, which is higher than the drink allows.\n\nSo perhaps the note is correct, but my calculation is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that each lime can be used for any number of toasts as long as it's cut into slices. So perhaps each lime can be used for multiple toasts, but each time a slice is taken from it.\n\nWait, that's possible. So if you have a lime with 8 slices, each slice can be used in a separate toast. So the total number of toasts possible from limes is c*d, but each toast requires n slices (one per friend). So the maximum toasts is (c*d) / n.\n\nBut in the sample, that would be 80 /3=26, which is less than 80. So why does the note say limes are enough for 80 toasts?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused between per toast and per person. Let me think again.\n\nEach toast requires n slices: one for each friend.\n\nSo for T toasts, you need T * n slices.\n\nTotal slices available is c*d.\n\nThus, T_max_lime = (c*d) // (n)\n\nIn the first sample, 10*8=80 slices. 80 /3 is 26. So why does the note say limes are enough for 80 toasts?\n\nWait, that's a contradiction. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem statement is different. Let me read it carefully.\n\n\"After that they found p grams of salt.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that each lime is cut into d slices, and each slice can only be used once. So each slice can be part of a single toast.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before. So for each toast, you need n slices.\n\nSo in the first sample, 80 slices allow for 80/3 = 26 toasts.\n\nBut the note says limes are enough for 80 toasts. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that each friend can only have one slice per lime. No, that's not making sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each lime is used per toast, but each lime provides d slices for that toast. So for each toast, you can use up to d limes. But that's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that each lime is cut into d slices, and each slice can be assigned to a specific friend. But that's not how the problem is described.\n\nHmm, perhaps the note is incorrect or perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is that each lime is cut into d slices, and each friend can use any of the slices, but each lime contributes to one slice per friend. But that's not clear.\n\nWait, perhaps the note is just an example, and the actual calculation is different.\n\nIn any case, perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach and see if it works with the sample.\n\nWait, according to the sample, the output is 2.\n\nThe drink allows 20ml → 20/(3*3)=2.222 → 2.\n\nLime allows 80/(3) = 26.666 → 26.\n\nSalt allows 100/(3*1)=33.333 →33.\n\nSo the minimum is 2. So the output is 2.\n\nWhich aligns with the sample.\n\nSo perhaps the note's explanation is misleading, but the actual calculation is as I thought.\n\nSo perhaps the note is saying that each resource is enough for some number of toasts, but when considering the friends, it's divided by the number of friends.\n\nSo in the note, the drink is enough for 6 toasts (since 20 /3 =6.666, 6), limes enough for 80 toasts (80), salt enough for 100 toasts. Then the overall is the min(6,80,100) →6, but then divided by the number of friends (3), giving 2.\n\nSo perhaps the note is showing the individual capacities, but then the final capacity is the minimum divided by the number of friends.\n\nSo perhaps the process is:\n\n1. Compute the maximum possible toasts based on drink: (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\n2. Compute based on limes: (c * d) // (n * 1), since each toast requires one slice per friend, n in total.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So per toast, n slices are needed. So the maximum is (c*d) // n.\n\nSimilarly, for salt: each toast requires n * np grams, so maximum is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the overall maximum is the minimum of these three values.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Calculate drink_toasts = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n- Calculate lime_toasts = (c * d) // n\n- Calculate salt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n- The answer is min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nNow, let's test this with the first sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → drink_toasts = (4*5)/(3*3) =20/9=2.222→2.\n\nc=10, d=8 → 10*8=80. 80//3=26. So lime_toasts=26.\n\np=100, np=1 → 3*1=3. 100//3=33.\n\nSo min(2,26,33) is 2. Output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → drink_toasts = (100*10) / (5*4) = 1000 /20 =50.\n\nc=1, d=19 → 1*19=19. 19//5=3. So lime_toasts=3.\n\np=90, np=3 → 5*3=15. 90//15=6.\n\nSo min(50,3,6)=3. So output is 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThird sample:\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → drink_toasts= (1000*1000)/(10*50) = 1,000,000 /500 =2000.\n\nc=25, d=23 → 25*23=575. 575//10=57.\n\np=1, np=1 → 10*1=10. 1//10=0.\n\nSo min(2000,57,0) is 0. Output is 0.\n\nWhich matches the third sample.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\nRead the input as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the three values as above.\n\nTake the minimum of them.\n\nOutput that as an integer.\n\nNow, in Python, how to read the input?\n\nThe input is a single line with 8 space-separated integers.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead the line as a string, split into parts, convert each part to integer.\n\nSo variables:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute drink_toasts = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nlime_toasts = (c * d) // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nanswer = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nPrint answer as a string.\n\nTesting with the samples.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat if any of the denominators are zero? But according to the problem statement, all inputs are positive integers, so no division by zero.\n\nAnother case: when n=1.\n\nLike, n=1, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=1, np=1.\n\nThen drink_toasts=1//1=1.\n\nlime_toasts=1//1=1.\n\nsalt_toasts=1//1=1.\n\nAnswer is 1.\n\nAnother case: when one of the resources is insufficient.\n\nE.g., n=2, k=2, l=5 → drink=10. Each toast needs 2*2=4ml. 10//4=2.\n\nc=1, d=1 → 1 slice. Each toast needs 2 slices. So 0.\n\nSo answer is 0.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nAnother case: when all resources allow for the same number, but then divided by n.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime = (c * d) // n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(drink, lime, salt))\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, lime slices, and salt per friend. The solution involves calculating the maximum number of toasts possible based on each resource and then taking the minimum of these values to ensure all friends can toast equally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the maximum number of toasts based on the drink:**\n   - Each toast requires `nl` milliliters of drink per friend, so for `n` friends, each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters.\n   - The total drink available is `k * l` milliliters.\n   - The maximum number of toasts possible from the drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n\n2. **Calculate the maximum number of toasts based on lime slices:**\n   - Each lime is cut into `d` slices, so the total number of slices available is `c * d`.\n   - Each toast requires one slice per friend, so for `n` friends, each toast requires `n` slices.\n   - The maximum number of toasts possible from lime slices is `(c * d) // n`.\n\n3. **Calculate the maximum number of toasts based on salt:**\n   - Each toast requires `np` grams of salt per friend, so for `n` friends, each toast requires `n * np` grams.\n   - The total salt available is `p` grams.\n   - The maximum number of toasts possible from salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n\n4. **Determine the minimum number of toasts:**\n   - The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the smallest value obtained from the three calculations above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime = (c * d) // n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(drink, lime, salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Drink Calculation:** We determine how many times we can fill the required drink for all friends based on the available bottles.\n- **Lime Slices Calculation:** We determine how many times we can provide a slice for each friend based on the available slices.\n- **Salt Calculation:** We determine how many times we can provide the required salt for all friends based on the available salt.\n- The final result is the minimum of these three values, ensuring that no resource is exhausted before the others, thus allowing the maximum number of toasts for each friend.",
