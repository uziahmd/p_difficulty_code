For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem defines a major triad as one where the notes can be ordered such that the distance between the first and second is 4 semitones, and between the second and third is 3 semitones. Similarly, a minor triad has a distance of 3 between the first and second, and 4 between the second and third.\n\nBut wait, the chord is unordered, so I need to consider all possible orderings of the three notes. For each possible ordering (there are 6 permutations since it's three distinct elements), I need to calculate the distances between consecutive notes and see if they fit either the major or minor pattern.\n\nHmm, but what about the cyclic nature of the notes? Since the notes repeat every octave, I should probably represent them in a circular manner. So, when calculating the distance between two notes, it's the minimal number of semitones in the forward direction. Or wait, no—the problem says the distance is taken from the lower note to the higher one, meaning that for any two notes, the distance is the number of semitones moving upwards. But since the notes are cyclic, the actual distance might wrap around.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one.\" So, for example, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones because you go E-F-F#-G-G#-A-A#-B-C, which is 8 semitones. Oh right, so when you have two notes, you calculate the distance by moving upwards from the lower note to the higher one, considering the scale as a circle.\n\nSo, the first step is to assign each note a numerical value so that we can compute the distances correctly. Let's create a list of the notes in order, then each note can be represented by its index.\n\nThe note order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, let me count:\n\nC is 0,\nC# is 1,\nD is 2,\nD# is 3,\nE is 4,\nF is 5,\nF# is 6,\nG is 7,\nG# is 8,\nA is 9,\nB is 10,\nH is 11.\n\nWait, but H comes after B, right? Because the problem says after H comes C again. So the order is correct as above.\n\nSo, for any two notes, say X and Y, to find the distance from X to Y, we need to see how many steps it takes to go from X to Y in the upward direction.\n\nFor example, the distance from C to E is 4 semitones. Because C (0) to D (1), D to D# (2), D# to E (3)—wait, no, that's only 3 steps. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's recount.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone. So from C to C# is 1 semitone, then C# to D is another, etc.\n\nSo the list is in order, each consecutive pair is a semitone apart. So the indexes are:\n\n0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nThen, back to 0: C.\n\nSo the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12. Because each step is +1. So, for example, the distance from C (0) to E (4) is 4 semitones. The distance from E (4) to C (0) would be (0 -4) mod 12 = 8 semitones, but according to the problem, the distance is always from the lower to the higher, so E to C is 8 semitones.\n\nWait, but in our code, when computing the distance between two notes, we can calculate it as (y - x) % 12. Because if x < y, then y-x is the distance. If x > y, then (y -x + 12) % 12 gives the correct number of steps when wrapping around.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Create a dictionary mapping each note to its index in the list. Like {'C':0, 'C#':1, ..., 'H':11}.\n\n2. Read the three input notes.\n\n3. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes. Because the order matters for checking the distances.\n\n4",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of the notes to see if they fit the criteria for either a major or minor triad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Representation**: Represent each note as an index in a predefined list of notes. This helps in calculating the distances between notes.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: Since the order of notes matters for determining the triad type, generate all permutations of the three input notes.\n3. **Calculate Distances**: For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes in a cyclic manner (modulo 12).\n4. **Check Triad Types**: Check if the distances match the criteria for a major or minor triad. A major triad has distances of 4 and 3 semitones, while a minor triad has distances of 3 and 4 semitones.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the note order\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\n# Read the input\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\n# Generate all permutations of the three notes\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(input_notes):\n    # Assign each note to its index\n    indices = [note_to_index[note] for note in perm]\n    \n    # Check all possible pairs to compute distances\n    possible_distances = []\n    for i in range(2):\n        distance = (indices[i+1] - indices[i]) % 12\n        possible_distances.append(distance)\n    \n    # Now check if the distances match major or minor\n    # Major: 4, 3\n    # Minor: 3, 4\n    sorted_distances = sorted(possible_distances)\n    if sorted_distances == [3,4]:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        break\n    elif sorted_distances == [4,3]:\n        print(\"major\")\n        break\nelse:\n    # If none of the above, it's strange\n    print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Representation**: Each note is mapped to an index from 0 to 11, representing their position in the musical scale.\n2. **Permutations**: We generate all possible orderings of the three notes to consider every potential arrangement.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, we calculate the distances between consecutive notes using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n4. **Triad Check**: After sorting the distances, we check if they match the required patterns for major or minor triads. If neither pattern is found, the chord is classified as strange.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly identify the type of triad or determine that it is neither, efficiently covering all possible cases.",
