Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Lanterns.\" Hmm.\n\nSo, the setup is that Vanya is walking along a straight street of length l. There are n lanterns placed along this street. Each lantern can light all points within a distance d from it. The goal is to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nWait, right. So, the street goes from 0 to l on a number line. Each lantern is at some position ai, and when they light up with radius d, their coverage is [ai - d, ai + d]. But since the street is from 0 to l, any part beyond 0 or l isn't part of the street. So, for each lantern, the effective coverage is the intersection of [ai -d, ai +d] with [0, l].\n\nThe task is to find the smallest possible d such that the union of all these covered intervals covers the entire [0, l] interval.\n\nHmm. How do I model this? Well, the minimal d would be determined by the gaps between the covered areas of the lanterns. So, perhaps we can think of the street as being divided into segments covered by each lantern, and the minimal d is determined by the maximum distance needed to cover the gaps between these segments.\n\nWait, but how exactly?\n\nLet me think. Maybe the first step is to sort the lantern positions. Because if the lanterns are not sorted, figuring out the coverage might be tricky. So, sorting them will help in processing them in order.\n\nOnce sorted, the idea is to look at the coverage of each lantern and see where there are gaps. The minimal d must ensure that all these gaps are filled by the overlapping of adjacent lanterns' coverage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is determined by the furthest point from the nearest lantern. For each point x in [0, l], the distance to the nearest lantern is found, and the maximum of these distances across all x is the minimal d required.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because to cover the entire street, every point must be within d of at least one lantern. So, the minimal d is the maximum of the minimal distances from each point x to the nearest lantern.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the approach could be:\n\n1. Sort the list of lantern positions.\n2. For each point x in [0, l], find the nearest lantern position a_i.\n3. Compute the minimal d as the maximum of (x - a_i) if x >= a_i, else (a_i - x), but wait, no—actually, the distance is min(|x - a_i| for all i). Then, the maximum of these minima is the required d.\n\nBut wait, that's correct. Because each point x must be within d of some lantern, and the minimal d that works for all x is the maximum of all such minimal distances.\n\nBut calculating this for every x in [0, l] is computationally intensive, especially since l can be up to 1e9. So, we need an efficient way to compute the maximum of the minimal distances without iterating through every single point.\n\nHmm, right. So, perhaps we can model the problem as finding intervals where the coverage changes and compute the maximum distance in those intervals.\n\nLet me think about how the coverage changes. After sorting the lanterns, the minimal distance from a point x to the nearest lantern is determined by the closest lantern on the left and the closest on the right.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to consider the points where the minimal distance changes. These points are either the lantern positions or the midpoints between consecutive lanterns.\n\nSo, between two consecutive lanterns, say a_j and a_{j+1}, the minimal distance for a point in between depends on whether the point is closer to a_j or a_{j+1}. The midpoint between them is m = (a_j + a_{j+1}) / 2. For points before m, the closest is a_j; for points after, the closest is a_{j+1}.\n\nBut also, we have to consider the start (0) and end (l) of the street. For example, if the first lantern is at a_1, then for points before a_1, the closest is a_1. Similarly for the last lantern and l.\n\nSo, the minimal distance function is piecewise, and the maximum of this function occurs either at a lantern's position or at the midpoint between two consecutive lanterns.\n\nWait, no. Because the minimal distance could have peaks somewhere else, but probably the maximum occurs at the midpoints or at the ends.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Sort the lantern positions.\n- Consider all intervals between consecutive lanterns, including the start (before the first lantern) and the end (after the last lantern).\n- For each interval, find the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns on a street of length \\( l \\) cover the entire street. Each lantern lights up a segment of the street centered at its position with radius \\( d \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: The first step is to sort the positions of the lanterns. This helps in efficiently determining the coverage intervals.\n2. **Identify Key Points**: The key points where the coverage might change are the positions of the lanterns themselves and the midpoints between consecutive lanterns. These points help in identifying the gaps where the coverage might be insufficient.\n3. **Compute Coverage Gaps**: For each interval between two consecutive lanterns, calculate the midpoint. The distance from this midpoint to either lantern determines the required radius to cover this gap.\n4. **Determine Maximum Distance**: The maximum of these distances across all intervals gives the minimum radius \\( d \\) needed to cover the entire street.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n\n    # Read input\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = int(data[1])\n    ai = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n\n    # Sort the lantern positions\n    ai.sort()\n\n    # Include 0 and l as sentinel values for easier processing\n    sentinel = [0] + ai + [l]\n    m = [0] * (len(sentinel))\n\n    for i in range(1, len(sentinel)):\n        a_prev = sentinel[i-1]\n        a_curr = sentinel[i]\n        if a_prev >= l or a_curr <= 0:\n            continue\n        # Midpoint between a_prev and a_curr\n        mid = (a_prev + a_curr) / 2.0\n        # The minimal distance from a point in [a_prev, mid] to a_prev is mid - a_prev\n        # The minimal distance from a point in [mid, a_curr] to a_curr is a_curr - mid\n        # So the maximum in this interval is max(mid - a_prev, a_curr - mid)\n        max_dist = max(mid - a_prev, a_curr - mid)\n        m[i] = max_dist\n\n    # Also consider the ends: from 0 to first lantern and from last lantern to l\n    for i in range(len(ai)+1):\n        if i == 0:\n            # From 0 to ai[0]\n            dist = ai[0] - 0\n            m[i] = dist\n        elif i == len(ai):\n            # From ai[-1] to l\n            dist = l - ai[-1]\n            m[i] = dist\n\n    # Find the maximum value in m\n    d = max(m)\n\n    # Output with 10 decimal places\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of lanterns, the length of the street, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting Lanterns**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate easier interval calculations.\n3. **Midpoint Calculation**: For each interval between consecutive lanterns, the midpoint is calculated. The maximum distance from this midpoint to either end of the interval determines the required radius for that segment.\n4. **Edge Cases Handling**: Special handling is done for the segments before the first lantern and after the last lantern to ensure they are included in the coverage calculations.\n5. **Finding Maximum Distance**: The maximum distance across all intervals is found, which gives the minimum radius \\( d \\) needed to cover the entire street.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal radius required by considering all critical points where the coverage might be insufficient.",
