Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Mister B and Angle in Polygon.\" Hmm, the task is to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 of a regular convex n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. And if there are multiple options with the same minimal difference, any of them is acceptable.\n\nAlright, first, I need to understand how the angle is formed in a regular polygon. So, let's think about a regular polygon. All sides are equal, all angles are equal. The internal angle of a regular n-gon is known; the formula for that is ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But wait, the angle we're considering here isn't necessarily the internal angle of the polygon. Because the angle is formed by two points on the sides of a vertex, not necessarily the adjacent vertices.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the polygon is regular, so each side has the same length, and each central angle is 360/n degrees. So, when you pick a vertex as the angle point, the lines from that vertex to the other two points will form certain angles based on how many steps apart they are around the polygon.\n\nSo, for example, in a regular triangle (n=3), any two other vertices are adjacent, so the angle formed would be 60 degrees. Because the internal angle is 60, but wait, that's the angle of the polygon itself. But when you choose three vertices, say 1, 2, 3, the angle at 2 is the internal angle of the triangle, which is 60 degrees.\n\nBut in a square (n=4), the internal angle is 90 degrees. But when you pick non-adjacent points, like 1 and 3, the angle can be different. For example, if v2 is 2, and v1 is 1, v3 is 3: then the angle at 2 is 90 degrees, but if v1 is 1 and v3 is 4, then the angle might be 45 degrees because those are across the square.\n\nWait, no. Maybe I'm thinking about the angle formed by three points on the circle. Because a regular polygon is inscribed in a circle. So, the points are on a circle, equally spaced. So, the angle at v2 depends on the arcs between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3.\n\nYes! So, for a regular polygon, the angle at a vertex v2 formed by points v1 and v3 is determined by the number of edges between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3 along the perimeter.\n\nSo, the central angle between two consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees. So, for any two vertices, the number of steps between them is k, which can be from 1 to floor(n/2). Because beyond that, it's the same as going the other way.\n\nWait, right. Because in a circle, the arc can be measured in two directions. So, the minimal step count is min(k, n -k). So, for two points, the minimal step difference is k, where k ranges from 1 to floor(n/2).\n\nSo, when choosing v1 and v3 relative to v2, the angle at v2 depends on the step counts between v2 and v1, and between v2 and v3.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let's denote the positions of the polygon's vertices as arranged in a circle, numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. Let's fix v2 as some vertex. Then, v1 is k steps before v2, and v3 is m steps after v2, or something like that.\n\nWait, more accurately: for each pair of points v1 and v3, the angle at v2 is determined by the arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. The measure of the angle is half the sum of those arcs? Or perhaps the difference?\n\nNo, wait, I remember that the inscribed angle theorem says that an angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended at any point on the circumference. But in this case, the angle is at v2, which is on the circumference, and the angle is formed by two chords: v2-v1 and v2-v3.\n\nSo, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Alternatively, it's also equal to half the measure of the arc that is opposite to the angle.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the arcs. The angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc from v1 to v3 that doesn't pass through v2. Because the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices of a regular convex polygon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given angle. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and leveraging the inscribed angle theorem.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Polygon Structure**: A regular convex polygon with `n` sides can be inscribed in a circle where each vertex is equally spaced around the circumference.\n2. **Inscribed Angle Theorem**: The angle at a vertex `v2` formed by two other vertices `v1` and `v3` depends on the arcs subtended by these points at the center of the circle. The angle at `v2` is half the measure of the arc opposite to it.\n3. **Finding Optimal Angles**: For each vertex `v2`, consider all possible pairs of vertices `v1` and `v3` such that the angle at `v2` is minimized. This involves checking the minimal step differences between vertices to form the smallest possible angles.\n4. **Iterate Over Vertices**: For each vertex, calculate the angle for all feasible pairs of other vertices and track the closest angle to the target value `a`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\ndef compute_angle(v2, v1, v3):\n    steps1 = abs((v2 - v1) % n)\n    steps2 = abs((v3 - v2) % n)\n    # The angle is (steps1 + steps2) * (180 / n) / 2\n    return (steps1 + steps2) * (180.0 / n) / 2\n\nmin_diff = float('inf')\nbest = []\n\nfor v2 in range(1, n+1):\n    for k in range(1, n//2 + 1):\n        v1 = (v2 - k) % n\n        for m in range(k+1, n//2 + 1):\n            v3 = (v2 + m) % n\n            current = compute_angle(v2, v1, v3)\n            diff = abs(current - a)\n            if diff < min_diff:\n                min_diff = diff\n                best = [v2, v1, v3]\n            elif diff == min_diff:\n                # We can choose any, so keep the first occurrence\n                pass\n\nprint(f\"{best[0]} {best[1]} {best[2]}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of vertices `n` and the target angle `a`.\n2. **Compute Angle Function**: This function calculates the angle at vertex `v2` formed by vertices `v1` and `v3` using their step differences from `v2`.\n3. **Iterate Over Vertices**: For each vertex `v2`, the code checks all possible pairs of vertices `v1` and `v3` to compute the angle and track the closest one to `a`.\n4. **Track Minimum Difference**: The code keeps track of the minimum difference between the computed angle and `a`, updating the best solution whenever a closer angle is found.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible angles and find the optimal solution by leveraging the geometric properties of regular polygons.",
