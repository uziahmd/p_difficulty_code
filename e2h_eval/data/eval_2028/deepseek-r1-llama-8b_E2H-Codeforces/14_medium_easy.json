    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about finding the number of positive integers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeros. And then I have to output all those n's in increasing order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n, because there are usually more 2s than 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is sum of n divided by 5, plus n divided by 25, and so on until n divided by 5^k is zero.\n\nSo, for example, for n=5: 5/5 =1, 5/25=0. So total 1 zero. For n=6, same as 5, since 6 doesn't add any more 5s. But when n=10, 10/5=2, 10/25=0, so 2 zeros.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find all n where n! has exactly m trailing zeros. So I need to find all possible n's that give exactly m zeros.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is that for each m, there can be either zero, one, or multiple n's that satisfy this condition. But wait, no, actually, from what I recall, for each m, there is a range of n's that produce that exact m. So for example, looking at the sample input where m=5:\n\nThe output is 5,6,7,8,9. Each of these numbers' factorials have exactly 5 trailing zeros.\n\nSo the approach is to find all n such that the number of trailing zeros equals m.\n\nHow do I find these n's efficiently?\n\nI think the way to go is to perform a binary search to find the lower bound and upper bound of n where the count of trailing zeros equals m. Because the function that gives the number of trailing zeros is monotonic—once you pass a certain n, the count increases by one each time you add a multiple of 5, and sometimes more.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the function isn't strictly increasing by one each step. For example, 24! adds two 5s (since 25 is divisible by 5^2). So when n reaches 24, the trailing zeros increase by two compared to 23. So the function is non-decreasing, but sometimes jumps by more than one.\n\nSo for a given m, there might be a range of n's that all have exactly m trailing zeros. The length of this range depends on how many multiples of higher powers of 5 are present.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the smallest n such that the trailing zeros are >= m.\n2. Then find the largest n such that trailing zeros are <= m.\n3. Wait, maybe that's not correct. Maybe I should find the minimal n where the count equals m, and then find the maximal n where the count is still m. Because once you reach a multiple of 5, the count can jump.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use binary search to find the first occurrence where the count is m, and then find the last occurrence where the count is m.\n\nBut how? Let's think about the function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nf(n) is a non-decreasing function. So for m, we can find the minimal n where f(n) == m, and the maximal n where f(n) == m.\n\nWait, no. Because f(n) could be equal to m for several consecutive n's. So for example, when m=5, the n's are 5,6,7,8,9. Because 5! has 1 zero, but wait no, wait the sample says m=1, output is 5. Wait, no, the sample input given was '1' and '5', and the output for m=1 is 5, which is just one number. Hmm, I think I'm getting confused with the sample.\n\nWait, let me check the sample again. The input is ['1','5'], which I think represents two test cases: m=1 and m=5.\n\nFor m=1, the output is 5, meaning only n=5 has exactly 1 trailing zero. Because 5! is 120, which has one zero. 6! is 720, which has one zero. Wait, no, wait 6! is 720, which ends with one zero? No, 720 has one zero. Oh, wait, wait, 5! is 120 (one zero), 6! is 720 (one zero), 7! is 5040 (one zero), 8! is 40320 (one zero), 9! is 362880 (one zero). Wait, no, wait 10! is 3628800, which has two trailing zeros. So for m=1, n can be 5,6,7,8,9. Wait, that would mean that for m=1, the count is 5 numbers. But according to the sample, when m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'? Or wait, no, the sample shows for m=1, the output is '5' followed by '0' for another case.\n\nWait, the sample input is ['1','5']—wait, the way it's written, perhaps the input is a list of two strings, each representing a test case. So the first test case is m=1, and the second is m=5.\n\nThe output for m=1 is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', meaning that there are five numbers. Wait, no, the output is the first line is '5', which is k, the count, and then the next line is the numbers. So for m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'—so k is 5, and the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWait, but according to my previous calculation, 5! has one zero, 6! also has one, 7!, 8!, 9!—all have one zero. 10! has two zeros. So for m=1, there are 5 values of n. So the sample makes sense.\n\nThen for m=5, the output is '0', meaning no numbers satisfy the condition.\n\nSo the task is: for each given m, find all n where f(n) = m, and output the count and the numbers.\n\nSo how to find these n's?\n\nApproach:\n\nWe can model f(n) as the number of trailing zeros, which is computed as the sum of floor(n/(5^i)) for i from 1 until 5^i >n.\n\nWe need to find the minimal and maximal n such that f(n) = m.\n\nWait, but f(n) can have a plateau: for some m, there exists a range of n where f(n) = m, and beyond that, f(n) becomes m+1.\n\nSo for example, for m=5, the n's are 5,6,7,8,9, but wait no: 5! has 1 zero, 6! also 1, 7!, 8!, 9! have 1, but 10! has 2. Wait, no, 10/5=2, 10/25=0. So f(10)=2. So for m=1, the n's are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, for m=1, the output is 5 6 7 8 9. So that's 5 numbers. So the minimal n is 5, maximal is 9.\n\nSo for a given m, the minimal n is the first n where f(n) =m, and the maximal is the last n where f(n)=m.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For a given m, find the lower bound (the smallest n where f(n) =m) and the upper bound (the largest n where f(n)=m).\n\n- Then collect all the numbers between lower and upper, inclusive.\n\nBut how to find these bounds efficiently?\n\nAn approach is to perform a binary search to find the minimal n where f(n) >=m, but then check if it's exactly m.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is:\n\n- Find the minimal n where f(n) =m. If such an n exists, then find the maximal n where f(n) =m. The count is (max_n - min_n +1).\n\nBut how to find min_n and max_n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the minimal n where f(n) =m, and then find the minimal n where f(n) =m+1, and then the max_n is one less than that.\n\nBecause for some m, the next value is m+1, and the n's for m+1 start at some point. So the last n for m is the first n for m+1 minus 1.\n\nWait, for example, in the sample where m=1:\n\nThe first n where f(n) >=1 is 5. But f(5)=1, so min_n is 5.\n\nThe first n where f(n)>=2 is 10. So the max_n is 10-1=9.\n\nSo for m=1, the count is 9-5+1=5.\n\nSimilarly, for m=5, the first n where f(n)>=5 is ... let's compute f(n):\n\nCompute f(20): 20/5=4, 20/25=0, total 4.\n\nf(24): 24/5=4, 24/25=0, total 4.\n\nf(25): 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6.\n\nWait, so for m=5, is there any n where f(n)=5? Let's see.\n\nWhat about n=20: f(n)=4.\n\nn=21: 4.\n\nn=22:4.\n\nn=23:4.\n\nn=24:4.\n\nn=25:6.\n\nSo for m=5, there's no n where f(n)=5. Hence, the output is 0.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\n1. Compute the minimal n where f(n) >=m.\n\n   a. If f(n) !=m, then no solution.\n\n   b. Else, proceed.\n\n2. Compute the minimal n where f(n)>=m+1.\n\n   a. Let's call this next_n.\n\n3. The max_n is next_n -1.\n\n4. So the count is max_n - min_n +1.\n\nBut wait, what if m=0? Well, the problem states m>=1.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor a given m:\n\n- Find the smallest n_low where f(n_low) >=m.\n\n- Check if f(n_low) ==m. If not, output 0.\n\n- Else, find the smallest n_high where f(n_high) >=m+1.\n\n- Then, the max_n is n_high-1.\n\n- The count is (max_n -n_low +1).\n\nBut wait, what if m=0? Well, the problem doesn't consider it, since m starts from 1.\n\nNow, the question is, how to compute n_low and n_high efficiently.\n\nWe can use binary search for this.\n\nImplementing binary search for n_low:\n\nWe can set low=0, high=5*m (since for m trailing zeros, n can't be larger than 5*m, but this is an overestimation. Alternatively, we can set high to 5*(m+1) to be safe.)\n\nWait, for m=1, 5*1=5 is correct. For m=5, 5*5=25. Which is correct.\n\nSo for a given m, the maximum possible n is 5*m. Because each multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero. So 5*m is an upper bound for n.\n\nSo the binary search for n_low is between 0 and 5*m.\n\nSimilarly, for n_high, it's the minimal n where f(n)>=m+1. So we can set the initial high to 5*(m+1), and find the minimal n where f(n)>=m+1.\n\nOnce we have n_low and n_high, the process is as above.\n\nBut wait, perhaps n_low could be 0, but since n must be positive, we have to ensure that n_low >=1.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\nImplement a function to calculate f(n), the number of trailing zeros.\n\nImplement a binary search to find the minimal n where f(n) >=m.\n\nIf during this process, the found n is such that f(n) !=m, output 0.\n\nElse, find the minimal n where f(n)>=m+1.\n\nThen the max_n is n_high-1.\n\nThe count is max_n -n_low +1.\n\nBut wait, what if m+1's minimal n is larger than 5*(m+1)? No, because 5*(m+1) will definitely have enough factors of 5.\n\nWait, for example, m=100000. The code should handle that.\n\nNow, let's think about the binary search function.\n\nThe function f(n) can be computed as follows:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count =0\n    while n>0:\n        n = n//5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo for a given m, we can perform binary search to find the minimal n_low where f(n_low)>=m.\n\nBut wait, in the binary search, the condition is whether f(mid) >= target.\n\nOnce we find the minimal n where f(n)>=m, we then check if f(n_low) ==m.\n\nIf it's not equal, then no solution exists.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nSimilarly, for the upper bound, find the minimal n where f(n)>=m+1.\n\nSo, putting this together.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: m=1.\n\nn_low is 5.\n\nf(5) =1.\n\nn_high is the minimal n where f(n)>=2.\n\nWhich is 10.\n\nSo max_n=9.\n\nCount is 5,6,7,8,9: 5 numbers.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nCase 2: m=5.\n\nn_low is found via binary search.\n\nLet's compute f(20)=4, f(21)=4, f(22)=4, f(23)=4, f(24)=4, f(25)=6.\n\nSo for m=5, the minimal n where f(n)>=5 is 25, but f(25)=6>5. So no n exists with f(n)=5. So output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nn_low is 10, f(10)=2.\n\nn_high is the first n where f(n)>=3, which is 15 (since f(15)=3).\n\nSo max_n=14.\n\nSo the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14. Count is 5.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nn_low is 25 (f(25)=6).\n\nn_high is the first n where f(n)>=7.\n\nCompute f(30): 30/5=6, 30/25=1, 30/125=0. Total 7.\n\nSo n_high is 30.\n\nmax_n=29.\n\nSo the count is 29-25+1=5.\n\nNumbers are 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nWait, what about 25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1 → 6.\n\n26: same as 25? No, wait 26//5=5, 26//25=1. So same as 25.\n\nSame for 27,28,29.\n\nAt 30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1 → 7.\n\nSo yes, the count is 5.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nAnother edge case: m=0, but the problem says m>=1, so no need to handle.\n\nAnother case: m=4.\n\nn_low is 20, f(20)=4.\n\nn_high is 25, which is the first n where f(n)=6.\n\nWait, no, n_high is the first n where f(n)>=5.\n\nWait, f(20)=4, f(21)=4, f(22)=4, f(23)=4, f(24)=4, f(25)=6.\n\nSo for m=4, the first n where f(n)>=5 is 25.\n\nThus, max_n=24.\n\nSo the count is 24-20+1=5.\n\nNumbers 20,21,22,23,24.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute n_low using binary search for the minimal n where f(n)>=m.\n\nCheck if f(n_low) !=m: output 0.\n\nElse, compute n_high as the minimal n where f(n)>=m+1.\n\nmax_n =n_high -1.\n\ncount =max_n -n_low +1.\n\nIf count<=0, output 0.\n\nElse, print count, followed by the numbers from n_low to max_n, inclusive.\n\nWait, but what if m=0? Not applicable here.\n\nNow, implementing the binary search.\n\nImplement a function to compute f(n).\n\nImplement a function to find the minimal n where f(n)>=target.\n\nIn Python:\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low =0\n    high=5*target  # since 5*target is an upper bound\n    ans = None\n    while low <=high:\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n        cnt = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt >= target:\n            ans = mid\n            high=mid-1\n        else:\n            low=mid+1\n    return ans\n\nWait, but wait: for m=1, 5*1=5. f(5)=1 >=1 → yes.\n\nBut let's test for m=5.\n\nfind_min_n(5) would have high=25. Let's see:\n\nLoop:\n\nlow=0, high=25.\n\nmid=12. f(12)=12//5=2 → 2 <5. So low=13.\n\nmid=(13+25)//2=19. f(19)=3 <5 → low=20.\n\nmid= (20+25)/2=22. f(22)=4 <5 → low=23.\n\nmid=24. f(24)=4 <5 → low=25.\n\nmid=25. f(25)=6 >=5 → ans=25, high=24.\n\nLoop ends. So ans=25.\n\nBut f(25)=6>5, so in this case, the function returns 25, but for m=5, there is no n with f(n)=5.\n\nSo in this case, after finding n_low=25, we have to check if f(n_low) ==m. If not, output 0.\n\nSo in code:\n\nAfter computing n_low, if f(n_low)!=m → output 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif f(n_low)!=m → print 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   compute n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n   max_n =n_high -1\n\n   if max_n <n_low → output 0.\n\n   else:\n\n      count =max_n -n_low +1\n\n      print(count)\n\n      print the numbers from n_low to max_n, space-separated.\n\nBut wait, what about when m=0? Well, the problem says m >=1.\n\nTesting the code for m=1:\n\nn_low=5, f(5)=1 ==1 → proceed.\n\nn_high = find_min_n(2).\n\nFor m=2, 5*2=10.\n\nfind_min_n(2):\n\nlow=0, high=10.\n\nmid=5: f(5)=1 <2 → low=6.\n\nmid=(6+10)/2=8: f(8)=1 <2 → low=9.\n\nmid=9.5→9: f(9)=1<2 → low=10.\n\nmid=10: f(10)=2 >=2 → ans=10, high=9.\n\nLoop ends. So n_high=10.\n\nmax_n=10-1=9.\n\ncount=9-5+1=5.\n\nSo numbers 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nn_low=10, f(10)=2.\n\nn_high=15.\n\nmax_n=14.\n\ncount=14-10+1=5.\n\nNumbers 10,11,12,13,14.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nn_low=25, f(25)=6.\n\nn_high= find_min_n(7).\n\nWhat is f(30)?\n\n30//5=6, 30//25=1 → total 7.\n\nSo n_high=30.\n\nmax_n=29.\n\ncount=5.\n\nSo numbers 25-29.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, the issue is to implement this in Python.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling very large m, like 1e5. But since the binary search is O(log(5e5))= around 20 steps, it's manageable.\n\n- Computing f(n) efficiently. The function count_zeros is O(log n), as each division by 5 reduces n by a factor of 5.\n\nSo, the code structure:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_low.\n\nIf f(n_low)!=m → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute n_high.\n\nmax_n =n_high -1.\n\nif max_n <n_low → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\ncount =max_n -n_low +1.\n\nprint(count)\n\nprint the numbers separated by spaces.\n\nImplementing the functions:\n\nImplement count_zeros as a helper function.\n\nImplement find_min_n as a helper function.\n\nBut in Python, since recursion depth is limited, we'll have to implement the binary search iteratively.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a string in the sample. So perhaps the code reads from stdin, perhaps as a single line, split into parts.\n\nWait, the input is a single integer m.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count =0\n    while n>0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low=0\n    high=5*target\n    ans = None\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        cnt = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt >= target:\n            ans = mid\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return ans\n\nm = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n    max_n =n_high -1\n    if max_n <n_low:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        count = max_n -n_low +1\n        print(count)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, max_n+1))))\n\nWait, but wait: in the sample, for m=5, the output is 0. So let's see:\n\nn_low = find_min_n(5) → 25.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 25//5=5, 25//25=1 → 5+1=6≠5.\n\nSo, in code, it will print 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test: m=0 (but m starts from 1).\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nWait, but what about when m=0? According to the problem statement, m is at least 1, so no need to handle.\n\nAnother test: m=3.\n\nn_low is the first n where f(n)>=3.\n\nCompute f(15): 3.\n\nSo n_low=15.\n\nn_high is the first n where f(n)>=4 →16?\n\nWait, f(15)=3, f(16)=3, f(20)=4.\n\nSo find_min_n(4) returns 20.\n\nmax_n=19.\n\nSo the count is 19-15+1=5.\n\nNumbers 15,16,17,18,19.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nI think that's the correct approach.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros.

If no such \\( n \\) exists, output 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target  # Upper bound estimate\n    ans = None\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt >= target:\n            ans = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return ans\n\nm = int(input())\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    max_n = n_high - 1\n    if max_n < n_low:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        count = max_n - n_low + 1\n        print(count)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, max_n + 1))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer \\( m \\), which represents the required number of trailing zeros.\n2. **Finding Lower Bound (n_low)**: Using binary search, we find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\).\n3. **Validation Check**: If the number of trailing zeros at \\( n_{\\text{low}} \\) is not exactly \\( m \\), output 0.\n4. **Finding Upper Bound (n_high)**: We find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeros is at least \\( m+1 \\).\n5. **Calculating Valid Range**: The valid range of \\( n \\) values is from \\( n_{\\text{low}} \\) to \\( n_{\\text{high}} - 1 \\). If this range is invalid (i.e., \\( n_{\\text{high}} \\leq n_{\\text{low}} \\)), output 0.\n6. **Output Results**: Print the count of valid \\( n \\) values and the values themselves if they exist.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of \\( m \\).",
