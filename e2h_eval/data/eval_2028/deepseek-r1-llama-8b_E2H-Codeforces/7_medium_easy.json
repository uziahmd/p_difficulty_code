He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Rudolf and Snowflakes, hard version. Hmm. From the description, it says that a snowflake is an undirected graph constructed in a specific way. \n\nLet me try to understand the structure of a snowflake. The initial step is one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to it, where k must be greater than 1. So after this first step, we have 1 + k vertices. Then, for each vertex that has only one edge (so these are the leaves from the initial step), we connect them to k new vertices. And importantly, this second step must be done at least once.\n\nWait, so the process is: start with 1 node. Add k children, making it 1 + k. Then, for each of those k nodes, add k children each. But wait, no—because in the next step, each node that has only one edge (i.e., the leaves) must add k new children. So the second step is applied to all the leaves from the first step. So the third step would apply to the leaves added in the second step, but only if the second step was done once. Or maybe the steps can be repeated multiple times?\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem statement. Oh right, the step where you add k children to each leaf is done at least once. So the minimal snowflake has two layers beyond the root: the root has k children, and each of those has k children, making the total 1 + k + k*k = 1 +k(k+1). Wait, no: 1 (root) + k (first layer) + k*k (second layer) gives total n = 1 +k +k^2.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the process can continue beyond the second step. For example, after adding the second layer, each of those leaves will also add their own k children. So each step adds another layer.\n\nSo the structure is a tree where each non-leaf node has exactly k children. It's a perfect k-ary tree of some depth.\n\nWait, but the initial step is adding k children to the root. Then each of those must add k children. But then, according to the problem statement, each step must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when after the root, each of its k children adds k children. So the total nodes would be 1 +k +k^2.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again: the first step is adding k nodes. Then, each of those k nodes must add k children. So the second step is done once. So the total is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nAlternatively, if the process continues, like after the second step, each of those leaves adds k children, leading to a third layer. So the number of nodes becomes 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. And so on. So the snowflake can have varying depths, depending on how many steps are taken beyond the initial.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: given n, does there exist integers k>1 and m≥1 such that n equals 1 +k*(1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m}) )? Because each step adds a layer, which contributes k^d nodes at depth d.\n\nWait, let's model it. Let's say the snowflake is built by having the root, then one layer, then another, etc., up to m layers. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k*(1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{m-1} ). Wait, because each of the k nodes in the first layer adds k children, which is the second layer, contributing k^2 nodes. Then each of those adds k children, adding k^3, and so on, until the m-th layer.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first step after the root is adding k children. Then, each of those adds k children, which is the second layer, adding k^2 nodes. Then, each of those adds k children, adding k^3, etc. So the total is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... +k^m, where m is the depth beyond the root.\n\nBut the problem states that the second step (adding children to the initial leaves) must be done at least once. So m must be at least 2. Because the initial step is adding the first layer (m=1), then the second step is adding the second layer (m=2), and so on. Or wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, the initial step is the first addition: root has k children. That's step 1. Then step 2 is adding k children to each of those. So after step 2, the tree has depth 2. So the minimal case is when m=2, leading to 1 +k +k^2 nodes. So the minimal n is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nSo for a given n, we need to check whether n can be expressed as 1 +k*(s), where s is a sum of a geometric series of k^i terms, starting from i=0 to i=d, and d >=1. Because each layer adds more.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the total number of nodes as follows. The root is 1. Then, each step adds a layer. The first layer (after root) has k nodes. Each subsequent layer l (l >=1) has k^{l+1} nodes? No, wait: the first layer is the children of the root, that's k nodes. The second layer is each of those k nodes adding k children, so k^2 nodes. Third layer is each of the k^2 nodes adding k children, so k^3 nodes. So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 + ... +k^m, where m is the number of layers beyond the root.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the second step must be done at least once. So the minimal m is 2. So the minimal n is 1 +k +k^2. Then, m can be larger.\n\nSo for a given n, we need to check whether n can be written as 1 +k*(1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1}), where k>1 and m>=2.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a way to model it. Let me think about the formula. Suppose that after the root, there are m layers. Then the total nodes are:\n\nn = 1 + k * (1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{m-1} )\n\nBecause each of the k nodes in the first layer has their own k children, forming the next layer, and so on.\n\nWait, no: 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m is the sum of a geometric series. So the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nWait, but the problem is that the initial step is adding k children, so the first layer is k. Then each of those adds k children, which is k^2. Then each of those adds k, etc. So the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. So for m >=1, but the problem requires that at least one step beyond the initial step is performed, which implies that m >=2.\n\nSo for n to be valid, n must be equal to 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m >=2 and k>1.\n\nSo the task is: for each test case n, determine if there exists integers k>1 and m>=2 such that n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nHmm, okay. So the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written in this form.\n\nSo the approach is: for each n, iterate over possible m values and see if (n-1) can be written as the sum of a geometric series plus 1.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 1e18, we need an efficient way.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that for each possible m, we can compute k. Since m starts from 2 upwards, but m can't be too large because even for m=60, k^m would be huge.\n\nSo for each n, we can loop over possible m values, starting from 2 up to log_2(n), and for each m, check if (n-1) can be written as S = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m.\n\nWait, but wait: the sum S is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So n-1 = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for each possible m, we can see if (n-1)*(k-1) +1 =k^{m+1} for some k>1.\n\nSo for each m, we can compute (n-1) as the sum of a geometric series of length m+1 (since m is the exponent) with ratio k.\n\nSo, for each m starting from 2 up to log2(n) (since for m=60, k would be at least 2, so 2^60 is about 1e18), we can compute possible k.\n\nWait, but how do we find k for each m? We can model it as for each m, compute the equation (n-1) = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for fixed m, we can perform binary search for k.\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n1. If n < 3: since the minimal is 1 +2 +4=7 (wait no, wait for k=2, m=2: 1+2+4=7). So for n less than 7, the answer is NO.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: the minimal n is when k=2 and m=2: 1+2+4=7. So any n less than 7 will be NO.\n\nWait, but wait: what about k=2 and m=1: 1+2=3. But according to the problem statement, the step of adding children must be done at least once. So m must be >=2. So for n=3, the sum is 1+2=3, but m=1, which is invalid. So n=3 is NO.\n\nSimilarly, n=6: 1+2+3=6. But that's a linear sum, but for k=2, m=1: 1+2=3, which is less than 6. So 6 can't be written as 1 +k +k^2 for any k>1.\n\nSo for n=6, it's NO.\n\nSo for each n, we need to check for m starting from 2 up to the maximum possible, which is log_2(n). Because for m+1 being up to 60, k could be up to 1e9 or so.\n\nSo for each n:\n\nLoop m from 2 to 60:\n\n   Compute target = (n-1) * (k-1) + 1 = k^{m+1}\n\n   So for a given m, we need to find a k>1 such that (n-1) = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1)\n\nWe can rewrite this as (n-1)(k-1) = k^{m+1} -1\n\nSo for each m, we can perform a binary search for k in [2, something].\n\nWhat's the upper bound for k for a given m and n?\n\nWell, for each m, the minimal k is 2. The maximal possible k is when k^{m+1} is about (n-1)(k-1)+1. So for a given m, the maximum k is when the left side is as big as possible.\n\nAlternatively, since for a given m, the function f(k) = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) is increasing in k, because higher k increases the sum.\n\nSo for each m, we can binary search k in [2, n^(1/(m+1)))].\n\nWait, but for a given m, the minimal value is k=2, and the maximum possible k is such that (k^{m+1}) <= (n-1)(k-1) +1.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to set the high as n, because for k> n, the sum would be larger than n.\n\nWait, for example, m=2: the sum is 1 +k +k^2. So for a given n, 1 +k +k^2 = n. So k^2 +k +1 =n. So k can't be larger than sqrt(n-1), because k^2 is part of the sum.\n\nSo for each m, the high can be set to n^(1/(m+1)) ), but perhaps just setting it to n is acceptable, since binary search is logarithmic.\n\nSo the algorithm for each n is:\n\nFor m from 2 to 60:\n\n   low = 2\n\n   high = n-1 (since k must be at least 2, and for m>=2, k^3 can't exceed n)\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid = (low + high)//2\n\n       compute s = (mid^{m+1} -1)/(mid-1)\n\n       if s == n-1:\n\n           return YES\n\n       elif s < n-1:\n\n           low = mid +1\n\n       else:\n\n           high = mid -1\n\nIf any m in 2..60 yields a solution, output YES. Else, NO.\n\nWait, but computing mid^{m+1} could be problematic for very large exponents, leading to integer overflows. So we need a way to compute s without actually calculating mid^{m+1}, because for large m and mid, mid^{m+1} can be way larger than 1e18, causing overflows.\n\nHmm, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's not a problem. However, the computation of mid^{m+1} could be time-consuming for large m and mid. But since m is up to 60, it's manageable.\n\nWait, for m up to 60, each binary search for k is about 30 steps (log2(1e18) is around 60), and for each step, computing mid^{m+1} is O(1) because exponentiation is fast in Python. So for t=1e4 and m up to 60, it's 1e4 * 60 * 30 = 1.8e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n   if n < 7: output NO (since the minimal n is 7, for k=2 and m=2)\n\n   else:\n\n       for m in 2 to 60:\n\n           compute target = n-1\n\n           low = 2\n\n           high = target (since (k^{m+1} ) / (k-1) <= k^{m+1}/(2-1) =k^{m+1} <= target*(k-1) +1. Wait, no. Wait, for a given m, the maximum possible k is when k^{m+1} is as large as possible.\n\nWait, maybe setting high as the target, but that might be too big. Alternatively, we can compute the maximum possible k for each m.\n\nWait, for a given m, the maximum possible k is when the sum is as small as possible but still equals target.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to set high as n, since for m=2, the maximum k is sqrt(target), which is about 1e9, but for higher m, it's much smaller.\n\nBut in Python, even 1e18 is manageable as high.\n\nSo the code would look something like this:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\n   if n < 7:\n\n       print(\"NO\")\n\n       continue\n\n   found = False\n\n   for m in range(2, 61):\n\n       target = n -1\n\n       low = 2\n\n       high = target\n\n       while low <= high:\n\n           mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n           # compute sum = 1 + mid + mid^2 + ... + mid^m\n\n           # which is (mid^{m+1} -1) // (mid -1)\n\n           # but computing mid^{m+1} could be expensive for large m and mid.\n\n           # However, in Python, it's manageable.\n\n           numerator = mid ** (m +1) - 1\n\n           denominator = mid -1\n\n           if denominator ==0:\n\n               # mid is 1, but k>1, so skip.\n\n               continue\n\n           sum_val = numerator // denominator\n\n           if sum_val == target:\n\n               found = True\n\n               break\n\n           elif sum_val < target:\n\n               low = mid +1\n\n           else:\n\n               high = mid -1\n\n       if found:\n\n           break\n\n   print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n\nWait, but wait: sum_val is (mid^{m+1}-1)/(mid-1). But for large mid and m, this can be a very big number, potentially larger than 1e18, but in Python, it can handle that.\n\nWait, but for m=60 and mid=2, 2^61 is about 2e18, which is within 1e18. So it's manageable.\n\nTesting this logic against the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\nSample Output:\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nLet's take n=13.\n\nCheck for m=2: target=12.\n\nLooking for k where (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 12.\n\nCompute for k=3: (27-1)/(2)=26/2=13. Which is 13, not 12. So no.\n\nWait, wait, wait: (k^3 -1)/(k-1) is 1 +k +k^2. So for k=3, it's 1+3+9=13. So for m=2, target is 12, so no. So m=2 is not a solution.\n\nBut for m=3: target=12.\n\nWe need (k^4-1)/(k-1) =12.\n\nWhich is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 =12.\n\nTry k=2: 1+2+4+8=15>12. So no.\n\nk=3: 1+3+9+27=40>12.\n\nk=1: not allowed.\n\nNo solution for m=3.\n\nWait, but for m=4: target=12.\n\nEquation: (k^5-1)/(k-1) =12.\n\nSo 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 +k^4 =12.\n\nk=2: 1+2+4+8+16=31>12.\n\nSo no.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps n=13 can be achieved with a higher m. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, 13 can be written as 1 + 2 + 10? No, that doesn't fit. Or wait, perhaps for m=2, but a different k.\n\nWait, for m=2, target=12: (k^3 -1)/(k-1) =12.\n\nWhich simplifies to k^2 +k +1=12.\n\nSo k^2 +k -11=0.\n\nDiscriminant: 1 +44=45. Square root is ~6.708. So k=( -1 + sqrt(45))/2 ~ (5.708)/2 ~2.85. Not an integer.\n\nSo no solution for m=2.\n\nHmm, so how does the sample output have 'YES' for n=13?\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe for m=3, but a different k.\n\nWait, for m=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 =n.\n\nn=13: 1 +k +k^2 +k^3=13.\n\nTry k=2: 1+2+4+8=15>13. So no.\n\nk=3: 1+3+9+27=40>13.\n\nk=1: invalid.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps for m=4, but same issue.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-express the sum.\n\nThe sum for m layers beyond the root is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m.\n\nWait, no, wait: the root is 1 node. Then, each of the k nodes in the first layer adds k children, which is the second layer, adding k^2 nodes. Then each of those adds k children, which is the third layer, adding k^3 nodes. So for m layers beyond the root, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m.\n\nWait, but wait: the initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes), then the second step adds the second layer (k^2 nodes), and so on. So for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nSo for n=13, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 =13 → k^2 +k +1=13 →k^2 +k-12=0 → solutions are k=( -1 ± sqrt(1 +48 )) /2 → sqrt(49)=7 → (6)/2=3. So k=3.\n\nSo n=13 is 1+3+9=13. So yes, it's a valid case. So why in the sample input, n=13 is 'YES'.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier approach, for m=2, target=12, and k=3 gives sum_val= (3^3 -1)/(3-1)=26/2=13. So target is 12, but sum_val is 13. So it's not equal.\n\nWait, wait, this suggests that my formula is incorrect.\n\nOh! Oh right! I think I messed up the formula. Because the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, which is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So target is n-1 = 12.\n\nSo when k=3, sum is (27-1)/(2)=13, which is not equal to 12. So that's why n=13 isn't considered for m=2.\n\nBut wait, wait. n=13 is 1+3+9=13. So m=2, sum is 13, which makes n=13. But according to the problem statement, the step of adding children must be done at least once. So the initial step is adding the first layer, and the second step is adding the second layer. So the snowflake must have at least two layers beyond the root.\n\nWait, no. The initial step is adding the first layer (root has k children). Then, each of those must add their own k children. So that's the second step, which must be done at least once. So the minimal sum is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nWait, so for n=13, it's 1+3+9=13. So it fits for m=2, k=3. So why in the code above, when m=2, target=12, and k=3, sum_val=13, which is 13 !=12. So that would imply that it's not a solution.\n\nBut that's conflicting with the sample input, which expects YES for n=13.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, the sum for m=2 is 1 +k +k^2. So for k=3, it's 1+3+9=13, which is the n. So target is 13-1=12.\n\nSo the equation is (k^3-1)/(k-1)=12.\n\nSo for k=3: (27-1)/2=26/2=13 ≠12.\n\nSo it's not equal. So why is n=13 a valid case?\n\nWait, that suggests that perhaps the formula is incorrect. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way the snowflake is built.\n\nWait, perhaps the snowflake can have multiple layers beyond the second. Like, perhaps the minimal is m=2, but the snowflake can have more steps. So for example, n=13 could be 1+3+9=13, which is m=2. So why is it a YES?\n\nBut according to the code, for m=2, the sum is 13, which is n. So target is 12, which is n-1. So the code is looking for sum_val=12. But the sum is 13, so it's not found.\n\nThis suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let's re-express the sum.\n\nWait, for the snowflake, the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m >=2.\n\nWait, for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. So n=13=1+3+9=13.\n\nBut according to the code, for m=2, target is 12. So 1+3+9=13, which is n, but target is 12. So the code doesn't find it.\n\nWait, so perhaps the code is wrong. Because n=13 is a valid case, but the code isn't finding it.\n\nSo I think I messed up the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), but for m being the number of layers beyond the root, including the initial step.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is the first layer, and each subsequent step adds another layer. So the number of layers is m, and the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m.\n\nBut in that case, for n=13, m=2, k=3: 1+3+9=13. So n-1=12. So (3^3-1)/(3-1)=26/2=13. So 13≠12.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the formula is correct, but the code is not capturing the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial step is the root, and the first step adds the first layer (k nodes), and the second step adds the second layer (k^2 nodes), so the sum is 1 +k +k^2. So for m=2 steps, sum is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nBut according to the formula, that sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) where m=2. So for k=3, m=2: (3^3-1)/2=26/2=13.\n\nBut n=13, so n-1=12. So 13≠12. So why is n=13 a valid case?\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the steps. Because according to the problem statement, the second step must be done at least once. So after the initial step (adding the first layer), the second step is adding the second layer. So the snowflake must have at least two layers beyond the root.\n\nBut in the case of n=13, the sum is 1+3+9=13, which is 3 layers beyond the root: root, first layer, second layer.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the root is layer 0. Layer 1 is the first layer. Layer 2 is the second layer. So the sum is 1 (layer 0) +k (layer 1) +k^2 (layer 2). So for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nSo for n=13, that's correct.\n\nBut according to the code, the sum is 13, which is n, but the code is checking for sum_val=12. So it's not finding it.\n\nSo the code is incorrect.\n\nWait, so perhaps the formula is wrong. Maybe the sum is 1 +k*(sum of 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1} ), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is n = 1 +k*(1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1} ), which would make the sum 1 +k*( (k^m -1)/(k-1) ).\n\nIn that case, for m=1, the sum is 1 +k*(1) =1+k. But the second step must be done at least once, so m must be >=1.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the correct formula.\n\nLet me think: the initial step is adding k children to the root. So that's the first step. Then, the second step is adding k children to each of those. So each of the k children adds k children. So the second step contributes k^2 nodes. Then, the third step adds k^3 nodes, etc.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 + ... +k^m, where m >=2.\n\nSo the formula is correct as before.\n\nBut then why is n=13 a YES?\n\nBecause 1+3+9=13. So for m=2, the sum is 13. So n=13. So according to the code, for m=2, target is 12. So the code is not finding it.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Because the formula for the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for m=2, k=3: (3^3 -1)/(3-1) =26/2=13. So the sum is 13, which is n. So the code should find this case.\n\nBut in the code, target is n-1=12. So the code is checking whether (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) == target.\n\nWhich is 13 ==12? No. So the code isn't finding it.\n\nAh! So here's the mistake. The formula for the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for the sum to be equal to n, we have:\n\nsum = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nSo for the code, target is n. But in the code, I set target =n-1. That's incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Because the code is trying to compute sum_val = (mid^{m+1} -1)/(mid-1) and compare it to target =n-1.\n\nWait, but the sum is (mid^{m+1} -1)/(mid-1) =n.\n\nSo the code is incorrect because it sets target as n-1, but it should set target as n.\n\nWait, that's the bug.\n\nYes! So the code was incorrect. So the correct approach is:\n\nFor each m, compute (mid^{m+1} -1)/(mid-1) and check if it's equal to n.\n\nNot n-1.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nfor each m in 2 to 60:\n\n   compute target =n\n\n   ...\n\nSo that's the correction.\n\nSo in the sample case n=13, for m=2, the code would compute:\n\ntarget =13\n\nmid=3:\n\nsum_val=(3^3-1)/(3-1) =26/2=13, which equals target. So found=True.\n\nThus, the code would output YES.\n\nThat explains why the sample input has n=13 as YES.\n\nSo the correction is to set target =n, not n-1.\n\nSo the code should be adjusted accordingly.\n\nLet me adjust the code:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n   if n < 3: NO.\n\n   else:\n\n       for m in 2 to 60:\n\n           target =n\n\n           low=2\n\n           high= ... ?\n\n           while low<=high:\n\n               mid = (low+high)//2\n\n               numerator = mid**(m+1) -1\n\n               denominator = mid -1\n\n               if denominator ==0: continue\n\n               sum_val = numerator // denominator\n\n               if sum_val == target:\n\n                   found =True\n\n                   break\n\n               elif sum_val < target:\n\n                   low=mid+1\n\n               else:\n\n                   high=mid-1\n\n       if found: YES else NO.\n\nYes, that should fix it.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input:\n\nn=13: for m=2, mid=3, sum_val=13. So found.\n\nn=15: for m=2, let's see:\n\nsum=1 +k +k^2 =15.\n\nk^2 +k +1 =15 →k^2 +k -14=0.\n\nDiscriminant: 1+56=57 →k= (-1±sqrt(57))/2 → sqrt(57)=~7.55 →k=(6.55)/2=~3.27. Not integer.\n\nSo try m=3:\n\nsum=1 +k +k^2 +k^3 =15.\n\nk=2: 1+2+4+8=15. So yes.\n\nThus, for m=3, k=2: sum_val=15.\n\nSo code would find it.\n\nThus, the sample outputs make sense now.\n\nSo the code needs to be corrected to set target =n.\n\nSo the final code is as described.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with exactly `n` vertices can exist. A snowflake graph is defined as an undirected graph constructed by repeatedly adding layers of vertices such that each vertex in the current layer connects to `k` new vertices in the next layer, starting from a single root vertex. The process must be done at least twice.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph is a perfect k-ary tree where each non-leaf node has exactly `k` children. The total number of vertices in such a tree after `m` layers (including the root) can be expressed as the sum of a geometric series.\n2. **Geometric Series Sum**: For a given `k` and `m`, the total number of vertices is given by the sum of the series `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m`. This sum can be written using the formula for the sum of a geometric series: `(k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`.\n3. **Iterative Check**: For each test case, check if `n` can be expressed in the form `(k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)` for some integers `k > 1` and `m >= 2`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n    for m in range(2, 61):\n        target = n\n        low = 2\n        high = target\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            try:\n                power = mid ** (m + 1)\n            except OverflowError:\n                high = mid - 1\n                continue\n            numerator = power - 1\n            denominator = mid - 1\n            if denominator == 0:\n                continue\n            sum_val = numerator // denominator\n            if sum_val == target:\n                return True\n            elif sum_val < target:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    for i in range(1, t + 1):\n        n = int(input[i])\n        if is_snowflake(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Check for Small Values**: If `n` is less than 7, it immediately returns \"NO\" since the smallest valid snowflake has 7 vertices.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Layers**: For each possible number of layers `m` from 2 to 60, the code checks if `n` can be formed by the sum of a geometric series.\n4. **Binary Search for k**: For each `m`, use binary search to find a suitable `k` such that the sum of the series equals `n`.\n5. **Output Result**: Based on the check, output \"YES\" or \"NO\" for each test case.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations to determine if a valid snowflake graph can be formed with `n` vertices.",
