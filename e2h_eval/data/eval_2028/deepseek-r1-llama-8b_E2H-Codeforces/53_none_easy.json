Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

It iterates over all possible substring lengths, extracts each substring, and checks if it appears at least twice in the string. If it does, it updates the maximum length if necessary. Finally, it prints the maximum length found.\n\nTo run this script, save it to a file (e.g., `longest_substring.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python longest_substring.py`). Then, provide the input string as a command-line argument or paste it into the script when prompted.",
