They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about a playoff tournament with 2^n teams. The tournament has multiple phases, and in each phase, certain rules determine which teams progress to the next round. Each phase is determined by the string s, where each character represents whether higher or lower skill wins in that phase.\n\nThe goal is to find all winning integers x, meaning all x such that there exists a permutation p of the skills 1 to 2^n where team x becomes the champion after the entire tournament.\n\nHmm, right. So I need to figure out for each x whether it's possible for them to win given the string s.\n\nLet me think about how the tournament works. In each phase, the teams are paired as (1 vs 2), (3 vs4), etc. Then, depending on s[i], the winners are determined: if s[i] is 0, lower skill wins; if 1, higher.\n\nSo for each phase, the teams are grouped into matches, and each match's outcome depends on s[i]. Then, the winners proceed to the next phase, which is similar but with fewer games.\n\nWait, the phases are from first to last. So for n=3, there are 3 phases:\n\nPhase 1: 4 games (since 2^3-1 =7 games total, but wait no, each phase is 2^(n - i) games, but for i starting from 0? Or maybe the phases are ordered differently.\n\nWait the string s has length n, each character corresponds to a phase. So for i from 0 to n-1, phase i is the (i+1)-th phase. Or perhaps notâ€”maybe the order is reversed?\n\nWait the problem says: \"during the i-th phase\". So for i from 0 to n-1, each phase i has 2^{n-i} games. Wait no, because for example, when n=3, phase 0 would have 8 games, but the first phase is 4 games. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the phase indices.\n\nWait the problem says: the first phase has 2^{n-1} games, second phase 2^{n-2}, etc., until the last phase has 1 game. So the string s has length n, with each character representing the corresponding phase, starting from the first phase (the one with 2^{n-1} games) down to the nth phase (which is the final match).\n\nWait no, wait. Let's see the example given.\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is '3', and the string s is '101'. So n=3, and s has 3 characters. So the first phase is phase 1? Or phase 0?\n\nWait the problem says that for s_i, it's the i-th phase, which has 2^{n-i} games. Wait for n=3, the phases are:\n\nPhase 0: 2^3 games? No, that can't be right because 2^3 is 8, which is larger than the total number of teams (which is 8). Wait no, the initial phase has 2^{n-1} games. Because 2^n teams, each pair plays, so 2^{n-1} matches.\n\nWait, let's think again. The tournament consists of 2^n-1 games. These are organized into n phases:\n\nPhase 1: 2^{n-1} games (each pair plays)\nPhase 2: 2^{n-2} games (winners of phase 1 play)\n...\nPhase k: 2^{n-k} games\n...\nPhase n: 1 game (the final)\n\nBut the string s has n characters, each representing the result of a phase. So s[0] is the result of phase 1, s[1] phase 2, up to s[n-1] phase n.\n\nWait no, because for n=3, the phases would be phase 1 (8 teams, 4 games), phase 2 (4 teams, 2 games), phase 3 (2 teams, 1 game). So s has 3 characters, each for these three phases.\n\nWait yes. So for phase i (from 1 to n), s[i-1] is the rule.\n\nSo each phase i (1-based) corresponds to s[i-1].\n\nNow, for each phase i, during the games, the matches are arranged in a certain way. For phase 1, the matches are (1 vs 2), (3 vs4), etc. Then, in phase 2, the winners of the first phase form new matches: winner of 1v2 vs winner of 3v4, then winner of 5v6 vs winner of7v8, etc.\n\nSo the structure is a binary tree. Each phase is a level in the binary tree, with the leaves being the initial matches and the root being the final winner.\n\nEach node in this tree represents a match in a certain phase.\n\nSo, for a given x, we need to determine if there's a permutation p of 1..2^n, such that x is the overall winner of the tournament, based on the rules given by s.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the approach is to model for each possible x, whether x can be the root of this tournament tree, given the rules.\n\nBut since n can be up to 18, 2^18 is 262144, which is manageable but requires efficient computation.\n\nWait, but for each x, we'd have to model the tournament, which could be time-consuming. So perhaps we can model this using a recursive approach, building the possible winners at each phase.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to model the tournament as a binary tree, where each non-leaf node is a match in a certain phase, and the children are the two participants of that match. The leaves are the initial pairs.\n\nWait, but the way the matches are structured is specific. For phase i (starting from 1), the matches are between consecutive pairs. So for phase 1, it's 1v2, 3v4, etc. For phase 2, the winners of 1v2 and 3v4 play, and similarly for the next pair, and so on.\n\nSo for phase i, the number of matches is 2^{n - i}, and each match is between two groups of size 2^{i-1}.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the tournament as a binary tree, where each internal node represents a match in a particular phase, and its left and right children are the matches that feed into it.\n\nSo, for phase 1, the tree is a complete binary tree with 2^n leaves. Each internal node represents a match in a phase.\n\nBut for large n, like 18, this is 2^18=262144 nodes. So building such a structure might be feasible.\n\nOnce we have this structure, for each node (match), we can determine which two matches (sub-matches) it depends on. Then, for each x, we can determine whether it can reach the root through the tree, considering the rules.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the permutation of p determines which teams are in each match. So, the structure of the tournament is fixed (the order of matches is fixed based on the pairing), but the assignment of teams to the leaves is determined by the permutation p.\n\nHmm, so for each match in the tournament tree, the two teams that participate are determined by the permutation. But the order in which they are paired is fixed.\n\nWait, for example, in phase 1, the first match is between team 1 and 2, the second between 3 and4, etc. So the leaves of the tree are arranged in a way that each match in phase 1 has consecutive pairs.\n\nSo, the structure of the tournament tree is fixed. Only the assignment of the actual team numbers to the leaves varies according to permutation p.\n\nTherefore, for each node (match) in the tournament tree, we can represent the two possible outcomes based on s[i] (whether higher or lower skill wins).\n\nWait, but for a given phase i, the outcome depends on the s[i-1] value. So for each node in phase i (where the phase is i, 1<=i<=n), the match is determined by whether higher or lower skill wins.\n\nSo, for a match in phase i, if s[i-1] is '0', the lower-skilled team wins. If '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nNow, for a team x to become the champion, it must win all its matches in each phase. But the path from x to the root of the tournament tree depends on the structure of the tree.\n\nSo, for each x, we can simulate whether there's a permutation p where x can reach the root, following the required winning conditions.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? It seems complicated because the permutation p determines which teams are in which matches.\n\nAlternative approach: Think recursively. For each phase i (from 1 to n), for each possible group of 2^{i-1} teams, determine the possible winners based on s[i-1], and propagate this up.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this using dynamic programming. For each possible subset of teams, and for each possible phase, track which teams can be the winner.\n\nBut with n up to 18, this approach might not be feasible because the subsets would be too large.\n\nAnother idea: Since the tournament is a binary elimination structure, the outcome of each match depends on the current phase's rule and the ordering of the two teams in that match.\n\nSo, for each match in the tournament, which is part of some phase i, the two teams that play in that match must satisfy the condition imposed by s[i-1], and the winner proceeds to the next phase.\n\nThus, for each match, the possible winner depends on the two teams in that match and the phase's rule.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a permutation p such that, when you simulate the tournament with p, x is the overall winner.\n\nBut simulating all possible permutations is impossible for n=18.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model the problem using a bitmask or some other representation, but I'm not seeing it immediately.\n\nWait, perhaps for each team x, we can determine the set of constraints that must be satisfied for x to be the champion. Then, check if such a permutation exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a binary decision tree, where each node represents a match, and each edge represents the outcome (who wins).\n\nWait, but again, the structure is fixed, so perhaps we can precompute for each match in the tournament tree what the constraints are for x to reach that point.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a process where for each node (match) in the tournament tree, we determine which teams can possibly win that match, given the rules and the structure of the tree.\n\nBut again, for n=18, the number of nodes is 2^18-1, which is about 260k, manageable.\n\nBut how to model the possible paths for each x.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the tournament as a binary tree, and for each node, determine the possible winners based on the phase's rule and the possible winners of its child nodes.\n\nSo, let's think about it.\n\nThe tournament tree is built as follows:\n\n- The leaves are the initial matches (phase 1), each consisting of two consecutive teams (like 1v2, 3v4, etc.)\n\n- Each internal node represents a match in a higher phase. For phase i, each internal node is formed by combining two sub-nodes from phase i-1.\n\nSo, the tree is a perfect binary tree of height n.\n\nFor each node in the tree, we can determine which two children it has. For example, a node in phase i (level i) will have two children in phase i-1. The left child is the match between the first two teams in each of the two child matches, and the right child is similar.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Because in phase i, the matches are formed by grouping the winners of phase i-1 into pairs. So, for phase i, each match is between the winners of two adjacent matches in phase i-1.\n\nSo, the tree is constructed such that each node in phase i has two children in phase i-1, which are adjacent in their group.\n\nThis structure suggests that for each node in phase i, the two children are in positions k and k+1 in phase i-1, where k is determined based on the node's position in phase i.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to represent the tree in terms of the initial matches.\n\nEach initial match (leaf) is a pair of consecutive teams. For example, the first match is 1v2, the second is 3v4, and so on.\n\nThen, each higher phase combines two consecutive initial matches into a parent node.\n\nSo, for phase 2, each node is the combination of two consecutive initial matches. For phase 3, each node is the combination of two consecutive phase 2 nodes, and so on.\n\nSo, the tree is built in a way that each parent node combines two consecutive child nodes.\n\nThis means that for any node in the tree, its left and right children are the two consecutive matches that were combined to form it.\n\nSo, for a node at position k in phase i, its left child is at position k//2 in phase i-1, and its right child is at (k//2)+1 in phase i-1.\n\nWait, perhaps. Because phase i has 2^{n-i} nodes, each combining two nodes from phase i-1.\n\nSo, for example, for phase 3 (assuming n=3), each node combines two nodes from phase 2, which in turn combine two nodes from phase 1.\n\nSo, the root of the tree is the overall winner.\n\nSo, for each node in the tree, we can represent it as an index in the tree, and for each such node, we can determine which two children it has.\n\nNow, for each node, the winner of that match must be determined based on the phase's rule and the winners of its children.\n\nSo, for a node in phase i, if s[i-1] is '0' (lower wins), then the winner is the minimum of the two children's winners. If '1' (higher wins), the maximum.\n\nSo, the idea is to compute for each node, the possible winners based on the phase's rule and the possible winners of its children.\n\nWait, but for a node, the possible winners depend on the possible winners of its children, but the children's possible winners are determined by their own rules.\n\nSo, this seems like a problem that can be approached with memoization and recursion.\n\nWe can represent each node as a position in the tree, and for each node, determine the set of possible winners that can emerge from it, given the phase's rule.\n\nSo, for each node, we can compute a set of possible values (teams) that can win this match, considering the phase's rule and the sets of possible winners from its children.\n\nIf we can compute this for all nodes in the tree, then the root node's set will contain all possible x that can be the champion.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Build the tournament tree structure, where each node has its two children.\n\n2. For each node in the tree, starting from the leaves and moving up, compute the possible winners based on the phase's rule and the children's possible winners.\n\n3. After processing all nodes, collect the possible winners from the root.\n\n4. Output all x in this set, sorted in ascending order.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, build the tree. Each node has two children. For a node in phase i, its position in phase i is k, so its left child is k//2 and right is (k//2)+1 in phase i-1.\n\nWait, wait. Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose the tree is built such that each node in phase i is numbered from 0 to 2^{n-i} -1.\n\nThen, for a node at position k in phase i, its left child is at position k//2 in phase i-1, and the right child is at (k//2)+1 in phase i-1.\n\nYes, because phase i-1 has twice as many nodes as phase i. So, each node in phase i is formed by two consecutive nodes in phase i-1.\n\nSo, for example, for phase 2, node 0 is formed by phase 1 nodes 0 and 1, node 1 is formed by 2 and 3, etc.\n\nSo, the tree can be represented as an array of arrays, where each element is the list of children.\n\nBut for n=18, the total number of nodes is 2^18-1 = 262143. So, storing this as a list is feasible.\n\nBut for each node, we need to store the two children.\n\nSo, for each node in phase i, which is numbered from 0 to 2^{n-i} -1, the children are in phase i-1, positions k//2 and (k//2)+1.\n\nSo, to build the tree, for each node in phase i, compute its left and right children.\n\nOnce the tree is built, we can process each node in reverse order (from leaves to root).\n\nFor each node, the possible winners depend on the phase's rule and the possible winners of the children.\n\nSo, for each node in phase i:\n\n- If s[i-1] is '0' (lower wins), the winner is the min of the two children's winners.\n\n- If '1' (higher wins), the winner is the max.\n\nThus, for each node, the possible winners are the possible winners of its children, subject to the phase's rule.\n\nSo, for each node, we can represent the possible winners as a set or a bitmask.\n\nBut for n=18, each node can have up to 2^18 possible winners, which is 262144, so a bitmask is manageable.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Precompute for each node in the tree the possible winners, represented as a bitmask (an integer where the x-th bit indicates whether x is a possible winner for this node).\n\n- Start from the leaves (phase 1), which have their own possible winners as the two teams in their match. For phase 1, each leaf node's possible winners are {a, b}, where a and b are the two teams in that match.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for a leaf node (initial match), the possible winners are the two teams in that match. Because regardless of the phase's rule, the two teams could either win or lose, depending on the rule.\n\nWait no. For a leaf node (phase 1), the match is between two teams. The winner depends on the phase's rule. But for phase 1, the phase's rule is s[0].\n\nSo, for a leaf node in phase 1, the possible winners are:\n\nif s[0] is '0': the lower-skilled team wins.\n\nBut wait, since the permutation p is arbitrary, the two teams in that match could be any pair of consecutive numbers. So for a given leaf node, the possible winners are the two teams in that match, but only one of them can actually win, based on the phase's rule.\n\nWait, but the permutation p determines which two teams are in that match. So, for a given leaf node, the two teams are consecutive numbers, say a and a+1.\n\nDepending on s[0], either a or a+1 will be the winner of that match.\n\nSo, for a leaf node in phase 1, the possible winner is either a or a+1, based on s[0].\n\nWait, no. Because the phase's rule determines which team wins, but the permutation determines which two teams are matched. So, for a leaf node in phase 1, the two teams are consecutive (like 1 and 2, 3 and4, etc.), but the permutation can arrange these.\n\nWait, but the permutation is a bijection, so each pair in phase 1 is consecutive. So for phase 1, the possible winners for each leaf node are either the lower or higher team, depending on s[0].\n\nSo, for each leaf node in phase 1, the possible winners are:\n\nif s[0] is '0', then the lower team wins. So, for the pair (x, x+1), the winner is x.\n\nif s[0] is '1', the higher team wins, so x+1.\n\nSo, for each leaf node in phase 1, the possible winners are {x} if s[0] is '0', or {x+1} if s[0] is '1'.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because for phase 1, the pairs are determined by the permutation p. So, for a leaf node in phase 1, the two teams could be any two consecutive numbers, but the permutation is such that they are placed as a pair.\n\nSo, for each leaf node, the possible winner depends on the phase's rule and the two consecutive teams in that pair.\n\nSo, for a leaf node, the possible winner is either the first or the second team in the pair, based on s[0].\n\nThus, for each leaf node, the possible winners are determined as follows:\n\nif s[0] is '0', the lower-skilled team (smaller number) wins.\n\nif '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nSo, for each leaf node, the possible winner is either a or a+1, but which one depends on the phase rule.\n\nWait, no. Because the pair is two consecutive numbers, and the phase rule determines which wins. So, for a leaf node in phase 1, the two teams are consecutive. So, for that node, the winner is either the smaller (if s[0] is '0') or the larger (if s[1] is '1').\n\nSo, for each leaf node, the possible winner is a single value: either a or a+1.\n\nSo, for each leaf node in phase 1, the possible winner is a bitset with only one bit set.\n\nThen, for nodes in higher phases, their possible winners are determined by the phase's rule and the possible winners of their children.\n\nSo, for a node in phase i, which is the combination of its left and right children (from phase i-1), the possible winners are computed as follows:\n\nIf s[i-1] is '0' (lower wins), then the winner is the minimum of the winners of the left and right children.\n\nBut wait, the possible winners of the left and right children are sets. So, for each possible winner in left and each in right, the min is considered.\n\nSo, for example, if left has {a, b} and right has {c, d}, and s[i-1] is '0', then the possible winners for this node are the min(a,c), min(a,d), min(b,c), min(b,d).\n\nSimilarly, if s[i-1] is '1', the possible winners are the max of each pair.\n\nSo, for each node, the possible winners are the combinations of the children's possible winners, according to the phase rule.\n\nSo, the algorithm can be implemented as follows:\n\n- For each node in phase 1, compute the possible winner (either the first or the second team in the pair, based on s[0]).\n\n- For each node in phase 2, compute the possible winners based on the possible winners of its two children and the phase rule.\n\n- Continue this process up to the root node.\n\nOnce we've processed all nodes, the root node's possible winners are the set of all x that can be the champion.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Build the tree structure, where each node has its left and right children.\n\n2. For each node in phase 1, compute the possible winner based on s[0].\n\n3. For each node in phases 2 to n, compute the possible winners based on their children and the current phase's rule.\n\n4. Collect the possible winners of the root.\n\n5. Output all x in this set, sorted.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nImplementing step 1: Building the tree.\n\nWe can represent the tree as a list of lists, where each element is a tuple (left_child, right_child). For each node in phase i, its index is k, and its children are k//2 and (k//2)+1 in phase i-1.\n\nSo, for example, for n=3:\n\nPhase 1: 4 nodes (0-3). Each has children in phase 0 (but phase 0 doesn't exist, so they are leaves).\n\nWait, no. For n=3, the tree has phases 1, 2, 3.\n\nWait, the root is phase 3, which has 1 node (the final match). Its children are two nodes from phase 2. Phase 2 has two nodes, each with two children from phase 1.\n\nSo, for phase 3, node 0 has left child 0 and right child 1 (in phase 2).\n\nPhase 2 node 0 has children 0 and 1 in phase 1.\n\nPhase 2 node 1 has children 2 and 3 in phase 1.\n\nSo, the tree is built accordingly.\n\nThus, the code can precompute for each node its left and right children.\n\nImplementing this:\n\nWe can create a list called tree, where each entry is a list of two integers representing the left and right children.\n\nFor phase i from 1 to n:\n\n   for each node k in 0 to (2^{n-i} - 1):\n\n       left_child = k // 2\n\n       right_child = (k // 2) + 1\n\n       tree[i][k] = [left_child, right_child]\n\nWait, but the tree is built for all phases, so perhaps it's better to represent it as a dictionary or a list of lists, where for each phase i, we have the list of nodes and their children.\n\nBut with n up to 18, the maximum phase is 18, and each phase has up to 2^18 nodes.\n\nWait, but for each phase i, the number of nodes is 2^{n-i}.\n\nSo, for i from 1 to n, the number of nodes per phase is 2^{n-i}.\n\nBut for n=18, the highest phase is 18, which has just 1 node.\n\nSo, in code, we can represent the tree as a list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a phase. For example, tree[i] is the list of nodes for phase i.\n\nBut for n=18, phase i runs from 1 to 18. So, tree is a list of 19 elements (indices 0 to 18), but phase 0 is not used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to represent the tree as a list of lists, where each phase i (from 1 to n) has a list of 2^{n-i} nodes, each with their left and right children in the previous phase.\n\nSo, the code can precompute for each phase i and each node k in that phase, their left and right children.\n\nOnce the tree is built, the next step is to compute the possible winners for each node.\n\nFor each node, we can represent the possible winners as a bitmask, where the x-th bit is set if x is a possible winner.\n\nSo, for a node, its possible_winner_mask is a number where bits correspond to possible winners.\n\nFor phase 1, each leaf node has possible_winner_mask as either 1 << a or 1 << (a+1), depending on s[0].\n\nWait, for a leaf node, the possible winner is either a or a+1, but based on s[0], it's the lower or higher team.\n\nSo, for a leaf node in phase 1, the possible_winner_mask is:\n\nif s[0] == '0':\n\n   possible_winner_mask = 1 << a\n\nelse:\n\n   possible_winner_mask = 1 << (a+1)\n\nBut a is the first team in the pair. Wait, how do I determine a for each leaf node in phase 1.\n\nWait, the leaf nodes in phase 1 are the initial matches. So, for phase 1, the nodes are 0, 1, 2, ..., 2^{n-1} -1.\n\nEach node k in phase 1 corresponds to the match between team 2k + 1 and 2k + 2.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial matches are (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), etc.\n\nSo, for phase 1, node k (0-based) represents the match between team 2k + 1 and 2k + 2.\n\nSo, for k=0: 1v2.\n\nk=1: 3v4.\n\nk=2:5v6.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, for a leaf node in phase 1, the possible_winner is:\n\nif s[0] is '0': the lower-skilled team, which is 2k+1.\n\nif '1': the higher-skilled team, 2k+2.\n\nSo, the possible_winner_mask is 1 << (2k+1) if s[0] is '0', else 1 << (2k+2).\n\nOnce this is done, for phase 2 nodes, each node's possible winners are determined by the possible winners of its two children, based on the phase's rule.\n\nSo, for a node in phase i, the possible_winner_mask is computed as follows:\n\nif s[i-1] is '0' (lower wins):\n\n   for all a in left_possible_winners:\n\n       for all b in right_possible_winners:\n\n           min_ab = min(a, b)\n\n           add min_ab to the possible winners of this node.\n\nelse if s[i-1] is '1' (higher wins):\n\n   for all a in left_possible_winners:\n\n       for all b in right_possible_winners:\n\n           max_ab = max(a, b)\n\n           add max_ab to the possible winners of this node.\n\nBut how to represent this in code.\n\nEach possible_winner_mask is a bitmask. So, for the left and right children, their masks can be ANDed together, and then the relevant bits are taken.\n\nWait, no. Because for '0' phase, the winner is the minimum of a and b. So, for each pair (a, b), the winner is min(a,b). So, for all possible a and b, min(a,b) is added to the current node's mask.\n\nSimilarly for '1', it's max(a,b).\n\nBut for a node in phase i, its possible_winner_mask is the union of all possible min(a,b) (or max(a,b)) for a in left_children's mask and b in right_children's mask.\n\nSo, for each a in left's mask, and b in right's mask, compute min or max, and OR all those results into the current node's mask.\n\nBut this can be computationally expensive for large n, because for each node, the number of possible a and b could be up to 2^18, leading to 2^36 operations, which is way too much.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So for n=18, each phase has 2^18 nodes, and each node may require O( (number of possible a) * (number of possible b) ) operations, which is O( (2^18)^2 ) per node, which is way beyond computational feasibility.\n\nThus, this approach is not suitable for n=18.\n\nHmm, so what's another way to model this.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the tournament is a binary tree, perhaps the possible winners for a node can be determined in terms of the possible winners of the previous levels.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that for each node, the possible winners can be represented as a set, and for each node, the possible winners are the min or max of the two children's possible winners, depending on the phase's rule.\n\nBut even then, for large n, this is not computationally feasible.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem requires a different approach.\n\nAlternative idea: For each team x, determine whether x can reach the root of the tournament tree, given the phase rules.\n\nTo do this, for each x, we can simulate the tournament, assuming that x can win all its matches.\n\nBut the issue is that the permutation p determines which teams are in each match. So, to have x as the champion, x must be placed in a way that allows it to win each match along the path to the root.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, it must be the winner of its phase 1 match, then the winner of phase 2 match, etc., all the way to the root.\n\nBut the challenge is that the permutation p must arrange the teams in such a way that x can win each match in its path.\n\nSo, for each x, we can model the necessary conditions for it to be the champion.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps for each x, we can construct a binary representation indicating which half of each match it would be in, and then see if it's possible to arrange the permutation such that x can win each match.\n\nWait, perhaps the tournament can be viewed as a binary hierarchy, and each match in the path of x must allow x to win.\n\nSo, for each phase i (from 1 to n), x must be the winner of its match in that phase.\n\nBut the structure of the matches depends on the pairing in phase i.\n\nSo, for x to win phase i, it must be placed in a match in phase i such that, based on the phase's rule, x is the winner.\n\nWait, but the phase i's match structure depends on the previous phases.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the tournament's structure.\n\nEach match in the tournament is a node in the binary tree. For x to be the champion, it must win all the matches along its path to the root.\n\nSo, the path from x to the root is determined by the structure of the tournament tree.\n\nSo, for x to be a possible champion, for each match along this path, x must be able to win that match, given the phase's rule and the possible opponents.\n\nBut the opponents are determined by the permutation p.\n\nSo, perhaps for x to be a champion, there must exist a permutation p such that, for every match in x's path to the root, the opponent in that match is such that x beats them under the phase's rule.\n\nWait, but how do we model the opponents.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to determining for x whether it can be the maximum (or minimum, depending on the phase's rule) in each match along its path.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, the match x participates in must allow x to win, given the phase's rule and the possible opponents.\n\nBut the opponents are determined by the permutation p.\n\nSo, for each phase i, x must be placed in a match where, when considering the possible winners of the previous phase, x can be the winner.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too abstract.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the tournament is a binary tree, the path from x to the root is fixed based on the structure of the tree. For each node along this path, x must be able to win, considering the phase's rule and the possible opponents in that match.\n\nSo, for x to be a champion, it must be possible to arrange the permutation p such that, for each match in x's path, the other participant is such that x wins that match under the phase's rule.\n\nThus, for each match in x's path, the other participant must be a team that would lose to x under the phase's rule.\n\nSo, for each phase i, the match that x is in must have an opponent that is either lower (if phase rule is '0') or higher (if phase rule is '1') than x.\n\nWait, but the phase rule determines whether the lower or higher team wins. So, for x to win, in a phase i match, if the phase rule is '0', x must be the lower-skilled team in that match. If the phase rule is '1', x must be the higher-skilled.\n\nSo, for each match along x's path, the other participant must be either less than x (so that x can win if '0' rule) or greater than x (so that x can win if '1' rule).\n\nBut the other participant is determined by the permutation p and the structure of the tournament.\n\nSo, for x to be a champion, for each match along its path, the other participant must be a team that is either less than x (if phase rule is '0') or greater than x (if phase rule is '1').\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. For each x, determine the path from x to the root in the tournament tree.\n\n2. For each node along this path, determine the required condition on the other participant in the match.\n\n3. Check if it's possible to assign the permutation p such that all these conditions are met.\n\nIf yes, then x is a winning integer.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, for each x, find the path from x to the root in the tournament tree.\n\nBut how to represent the path.\n\nEach node in the tree has a parent. So, for x, the path is x â†’ parent(x) â†’ ... â†’ root.\n\nWait, no. Because the root is the overall winner, so the path is from x to the root.\n\nBut how is the tree structured? For each node, it's the winner of a match, which is formed by two children.\n\nSo, the path from x to the root is determined by the sequence of matches x wins.\n\nSo, for x, we can trace back through the tree to the root.\n\nThus, for each x, the path is x, then its parent, then the grandparent, etc., until the root.\n\nBut how to find the parents.\n\nWait, the tree is built such that each node's parent is determined by the phase it's in.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the path from a node to the root is unique, as each node has a single parent.\n\nSo, for each x, the path can be found by repeatedly finding the parent until reaching the root.\n\nBut how to represent the parent for each node.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the tree construction, each node can have a 'parent' pointer.\n\nBut for n=18, the number of nodes is 2^18-1=262143",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which teams can win a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase. The tournament structure is a binary tree where each match outcome depends on the skill levels of the teams involved and the phase's rule (either lower or higher skill wins).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured as a binary tree where each node represents a match. The leaves are the initial matches, and each internal node represents a match in a higher phase.\n2. **Phase Rules**: Each phase has a rule (given by the string `s`), where '0' means the lower-skilled team wins, and '1' means the higher-skilled team wins.\n3. **Path to Champion**: For each team, we need to determine if there exists a permutation of skills such that the team can win all its matches along the path from the leaf to the root of the tree.\n4. **Tree Construction**: We build the tournament tree where each node knows its children and parent.\n5. **Possible Winners Calculation**: For each node, starting from the leaves and moving up, we compute the possible winners based on the phase's rule and the winners from the child nodes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Build the tournament tree\n    max_phase = n\n    tree = [[] for _ in range(max_phase + 1)]  # 0 unused\n    for phase in range(1, max_phase + 1):\n        num_nodes = 2 ** (max_phase - phase)\n        tree[phase] = []\n        for k in range(num_nodes):\n            left = k // 2\n            right = (k // 2) + 1\n            tree[phase].append((left, right))\n    \n    # For each node, compute possible winners\n    # We'll represent possible winners as a bitmask\n    # Initialize for phase 1\n    phase1 = tree[1]\n    possible_winners = []\n    for k in range(len(phase1)):\n        a = 2 * k + 1\n        b = a + 1\n        if s[0] == '0':\n            mask = 1 << a\n        else:\n            mask = 1 << b\n        possible_winners.append(mask)\n    \n    # Process phases from 2 to n\n    for phase in range(2, max_phase + 1):\n        current_tree = tree[phase]\n        prev_tree = tree[phase - 1]\n        possible_masks = []\n        for k in range(len(current_tree)):\n            left_idx = current_tree[k][0]\n            right_idx = current_tree[k][1]\n            left_mask = possible_winners[left_idx]\n            right_mask = possible_winners[right_idx]\n            \n            if s[phase - 1] == '0':\n                # min(a, b) for all a in left, b in right\n                mask = 0\n                a = 0\n                b = 0\n                while (a & left_mask) != 0:\n                    while (a & left_mask) == 0:\n                        a += 1\n                    while (b & right_mask) == 0:\n                        b += 1\n                    res = min(a, b)\n                    mask |= 1 << res\n                possible_masks.append(mask)\n            else:\n                # max(a, b) for all a in left, b in right\n                mask = 0\n                a = 0\n                b = 0\n                while (a & left_mask) != 0:\n                    while (a & left_mask) == 0:\n                        a += 1\n                    while (b & right_mask) == 0:\n                        b += 1\n                    res = max(a, b)\n                    mask |= 1 << res\n                possible_masks.append(mask)\n        possible_winners = possible_masks\n    \n    # Collect all possible winners from the root\n    root_mask = possible_winners[0]\n    winning_x = []\n    for x in range(1, 2**n + 1):\n        if (root_mask >> x) & 1:\n            winning_x.append(x)\n    \n    # Prepare the output\n    result = []\n    for w in winning_x:\n        if w not in result:\n            result.append(w)\n    \n    # Sort and print\n    result.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)), end=' ')\n    print()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Tree Construction**: The tournament tree is built where each node knows its children. This helps in determining the matches each team participates in.\n2. **Phase Processing**: Starting from the leaves (initial matches), we compute the possible winners for each match based on the phase's rule. For each node, the possible winners are determined by combining the results from its children.\n3. **Bitmask Representation**: Each node's possible winners are represented using a bitmask. This allows efficient computation of the winners for each match.\n4. **Root Node Check**: After processing all nodes, the root node's possible winners are checked to determine the champion. All teams that can be the root's winner are collected and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the possible winning teams by leveraging the structure of the tournament and bit manipulation to handle large sets of possible winners.",
