    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about finding the number of positive integers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeros. And then I have to output all those n's in increasing order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n, because there are usually more 2s than 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is sum of n divided by 5, plus n divided by 25, and so on until n divided by 5^k is zero.\n\nSo, for example, for n=5: 5//5 =1, 5//25=0. So total 1 zero. For n=6, same as 5, since 6//5 is 1, 6//25 is 0. So 1 zero. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 5! is 120, which has one zero. 6! is 720, which also has one zero. Oh right, because 6 divided by 5 is 1, but 7,8,9 also divide by 5 once. So when m is 1, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9— five numbers. That's why in the sample input, when m is 1, the output is 5 followed by 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWait, but how do I find all the n's that produce exactly m trailing zeros? So I need to find the smallest n where the trailing zeros are at least m, and then see how many n's give exactly m.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to find the lower and upper bounds where the trailing zeros equal m. Then, count how many numbers are in that range.\n\nBut how do I find these bounds efficiently?\n\nI think I can perform a binary search to find the minimal n where the number of trailing zeros is equal to m. But wait, because for a given m, there might be a range of n's that all have exactly m trailing zeros. For example, m=5, the numbers 20,21,22,23,24,25? Or maybe not. Let me think: 20! has 4 + 0 =4 zeros from 20//5=4, 20//25=0. Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, 20/5 is 4, 20/25 is 0. So 4 zeros. Wait, but 25//5 is 5, 25//25 is 1, so total 5+1=6 zeros. Hmm, so for m=5, the numbers would start after 20 and before 25.\n\nWait, let's compute for n=20: 20//5=4, 20//25=0 → 4 zeros. n=21: same as 20. n=22: same. n=23: same. n=24: same. n=25: 5 + 1 =6 zeros. So for m=5, there's no n such that n! has exactly 5 zeros. So the output would be 0.\n\nWait, but the first sample input is '1' and the output is '5 5 6 7 8 9'. So for m=1, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. So each of these n's has exactly 1 trailing zero.\n\nSo the idea is that for a given m, there may be a range of n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. We need to find all such n's.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Find the smallest n such that the number of trailing zeros is >=m.\n\n2. Then find the largest n such that the number of trailing zeros is <=m.\n\nWait, no. Because if the trailing zeros increase by 1 at some point, like between 24 and 25, then all the n's between the first n where trailing zeros becomes m and the next n where it increases beyond m will have exactly m zeros.\n\nWait, yes. So, for example, for m=5, the n's would be between 25 (which gives 6 zeros) and 24 (which gives 4 zeros). So no n has exactly 5 zeros. So the output is 0.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Find the minimal n where the number of trailing zeros is >=m.\n\n- Then, check if the minimal n actually gives m zeros. If not, then there are no solutions.\n\n- Otherwise, find the maximal n where the number of trailing zeros is m. The difference between these two (max_n - min_n +1) gives the count of n's.\n\nWait, but how do I find the minimal and maximal n's?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the minimal n that gives exactly m zeros, and then find how far that range extends.\n\nLet me think: the function f(n) which counts the trailing zeros is non-decreasing. Because as n increases, the count can't decrease.\n\nSo, for a given m, there could be a range [a, b] where f(n) = m for all n in [a, b]. Then, the answer is (b -a +1), followed by a list of a, a+1,...,b.\n\nSo, the task reduces to finding a and b.\n\nHow can I find a? It's the smallest n such that f(n) = m.\n\nSimilarly, b is the largest n such that f(n) = m.\n\nWait, but how? Because for some m, there may be no n's where f(n)=m. Like m=5, as above.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Find the smallest n where f(n) >=m. Let's call this low.\n\n2. Then, check if f(low) is equal to m. If not, then there are no n's, output 0.\n\n3. Else, find the smallest high where f(high) > m. Then, the numbers from low to high-1 are the ones where f(n)=m.\n\nSo the count is high - low.\n\nFor example, in the first sample where m=1:\n\n- Find low: the smallest n where f(n)>=1 is 5, since f(5)=1.\n\n- Check f(5)=1 ==1: yes.\n\n- Find high: the smallest n where f(n)>1 is 10, since f(10)= 10//5=2. So high=10.\n\nSo the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9 → 5 numbers.\n\nSo the count is 10-5=5.\n\nAnother example: m=5.\n\n- Find low: the smallest n where f(n)>=5. Let's compute f(20)=4, f(21)=4, f(22)=4, f(23)=4, f(24)=4, f(25)=6. So low=25, but f(25)=6>5. So, step 2: check if f(25) ==5? No. So output 0.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCompute low as the smallest n where f(n)>=m.\n\nIf f(low)!=m → output 0.\n\nElse, compute high as the smallest n where f(n)>m.\n\nThe numbers from low to high-1 are the valid n's.\n\nSo, now the question is, how to compute f(n) quickly, and how to find low and high.\n\nImplementing f(n) is straightforward, but for large n, it's O(log_5 n). So for binary search, that's acceptable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nImplement a helper function count_zeros(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nImplement binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\nOnce found, if count_zeros(n) !=m → no solution.\n\nElse, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >m.\n\nThe high is that n.\n\nThen, the count is high - low.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute low using binary search.\n\nIf count_zeros(low) !=m → print 0.\n\nElse, compute high via binary search.\n\nCollect all n from low to high-1.\n\nPrint the count and the list.\n\nNow, the binary search for low can be done as follows:\n\nInitialize low=0, high=some upper bound. But what's a good upper bound?\n\nWell, for m=1e5, the maximum n can be up to 5*m, but perhaps 5e5 is sufficient.\n\nWait, for example, the maximum possible n for m=1e5 is 5*1e5=5e5? Or perhaps higher. Alternatively, perhaps setting high initially to 5e5 is enough, but perhaps better to find an upper limit based on m.\n\nAlternatively, for binary search, set high to 5e5 or even higher, since for m up to 1e5, n can be up to 5e5, but perhaps for m=1e5, n is around 5e5, but let's see.\n\nWait, for example, m=1e5.\n\nWhat is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=1e5.\n\nEach multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero.\n\nBut 25 contributes an extra, etc.\n\nSo the count is roughly n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... < n/4.\n\nSo for m=1e5, n is approximately 4e5, but perhaps a bit higher.\n\nSo, setting high to 5e5 is more than enough.\n\nSo, the binary search for low starts with low=0, high=5e5.\n\nOnce we find the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=m, proceed.\n\nSimilarly, for high, we can set initial high to 5e5, and binary search for the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >m.\n\nBut wait, for the case when m=0, but in the problem statement, m>=1.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, m is given as >=1, so we don't have to handle m=0.\n\nSo, the code outline:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count =0\n    while n>0:\n        n = n//5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nm = int(input())\n\n# Find the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=m.\nlow = 0\nhigh = 5 * 10**5  # Adjust this if necessary.\n\nwhile low < high:\n    mid = (low + high)//2\n    cz = count_zeros(mid)\n    if cz >= m:\n        high = mid\n    else:\n        low = mid +1\n\n# Now, low is the minimal n where count >=m.\nif count_zeros(low) !=m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Find the minimal high where count_zeros(high) >m.\n    high = low  # Reset high for this binary search.\n    low = 0\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n        cz = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cz > m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n\n    # Now, the valid n's are from low to high-1 inclusive.\n    count = high - low\n    print(count)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(low, high))))\n\nWait, but what if the high found is 0? Or, in the second binary search, what's the initial high?\n\nIn the second binary search, the initial high is set to low, which is the current minimal n where count >=m. So in the worst case, the high can be up to 5e5 again.\n\nWait, but perhaps setting the initial high for the second binary search to 5e5 is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the second binary search, the initial high can be set to 5e5.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut let's test the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nFirst binary search finds low=5, since count_zeros(5)=1.\n\nThen, check count_zeros(5)=1 ==m → proceed.\n\nSecond binary search: find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >1.\n\nWhat is count_zeros(5)=1, count_zeros(6)=1, ..., count_zeros(9)=1, count_zeros(10)=2.\n\nSo during the second binary search, looking for the first n where count>1 is 10.\n\nSo high is 10.\n\nSo the numbers are from 5 to 9 inclusive: 5 numbers.\n\nSample Output is '5 5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nFirst binary search finds the minimal n where count>=5.\n\nCompute for n=20: count is 4.\n\nn=21:4, n=22:4, n=23:4, n=24:4, n=25:6.\n\nSo low would be 25, but count_zeros(25)=6>5. So in the first step, after binary search, low=25.\n\nCheck if count_zeros(25) ==5 → no. So output is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\ncount_zeros(25)=6.\n\nSo low=25.\n\nCheck if count is 6 → yes.\n\nThen find high: find the minimal n where count>6.\n\nLooking for n where count is 7.\n\nWe can compute:\n\nn=30: count is 30/5=6, 30/25=1, 30/125=0 → total 7.\n\nSo during binary search, high will be 30.\n\nSo the numbers are 25,26,...,29.\n\nThat's 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code should output 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about m=2.\n\nWhat's the count?\n\nn=6: count is 1.\n\nn=7:1, n=8:1, n=9:1, n=10:2.\n\nSo the minimal n where count >=2 is 10.\n\ncount_zeros(10)=2.\n\nSo high is the first n where count>2, which is 15.\n\nBecause count_zeros(15) =3.\n\nSo the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14 →5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- What if m is very large, say 1e5. How efficient is the binary search?\n\nThe binary search is O(log n), which for n up to 5e5 is manageable.\n\nBut for m=1e5, the n could be around 5e5, so the binary search is feasible.\n\nAnother thing: the initial high for the first binary search is 5e5. But for larger m, perhaps the high needs to be larger.\n\nWait, for m=1e5, the minimal n where count >=1e5 is:\n\nLet me calculate count_zeros(n) for some n.\n\nEach step adds n//5, n//25, etc.\n\nWe can model n as approximately 5*m, but with some adjustments.\n\nWait, for m=1e5, n is approximately 5e5, but perhaps a bit higher.\n\nBut the code sets high as 5e5, which may be sufficient.\n\nBut perhaps, for the first binary search, the high should be set to something like 5*(m+1) or 5e5, whichever is larger.\n\nWait, let me think: what is the maximum possible n for a given m?\n\nSince count_zeros(n) is roughly n/5 + n/25 + n/125... which is less than n/4.\n\nSo for m=1e5, n is about 4e5.\n\nBut 5e5 is 5*1e5, which is more than sufficient.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nAnother edge case: m=0. But according to the problem statement, m starts from 1, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nWhat about m=3?\n\nn=15: count is 3.\n\nSo the code would find low=15.\n\nThen, find the high as the first n where count>3, which is 20.\n\nSo numbers are 15,16,17,18,19 →5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother edge case: m=7.\n\nn=35: 35//5=7, 35//25=1 → total 8.\n\nSo the minimal n where count >=7 is 30.\n\nBecause 30//5=6, 30//25=1 → total 7.\n\nSo low is 30.\n\nCheck count_zeros(30)=7.\n\nThen, find high where count>7.\n\nn=35: count is 8.\n\nSo high is 35.\n\nNumbers from 30 to 34 →5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle this correctly.\n\nNow, potential optimizations.\n\nThe count_zeros function is O(log n) time because it keeps dividing by 5. So for each binary search step, it's O(log n).\n\nEach binary search runs in O(log n) steps, so overall it's O((log n)^2) per test case, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the initial high for the second binary search.\n\nIn the code, after the first binary search, we reset high to low, but in the code, the second binary search starts with low=0 and high=5e5.\n\nWait, no. Looking back:\n\nAfter the first binary search, the code does:\n\nif count_zeros(low)!=m → print 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   # Find the minimal high where count> m.\n\n   high = low  # Reset high for this binary search.\n\n   low=0\n\n   while low < high:\n\n      mid= (low + high)//2\n\n      ...\n\nBut initially, high is 5e5.\n\nWait, no, in the code I wrote earlier, in the second binary search, I had:\n\nhigh = low\n\nlow =0\n\nBut that doesn't seem right. Because, for example, if m=1, the low is 5, so high is 5, and low is 0.\n\nThen, in the binary search, mid starts at (0+5)/2=2, which is too low. Then, it adjusts.\n\nWait, perhaps in the code, the second binary search's high is set to 5e5, not low.\n\nBecause, in the code, after the first binary search, the high is set to 5e5.\n\nWait, no. In the code, after the first binary search, high is set to 5e5, and then in the second binary search, the code resets high to low.\n\nWait, no. Looking back, the code after the first binary search is:\n\nif count_zeros(low)!=m → print 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   # find high...\n\n   high = low  # Reset high for this binary search.\n\n   low=0\n\n   while low<high:\n\n      ...\n\nBut this seems wrong. Because for the second binary search, the initial high should be higher than any possible n where count_zeros(n) >m.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial high for the second binary search should be higher than low, but perhaps starting with 5e5 is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second binary search can have high=5e5.\n\nSo perhaps in the code, the second binary search's high is set to 5e5, not low.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the code.\n\nBecause in the second binary search, the initial high is low (from the first binary search), which could be as high as 5e5, but perhaps the correct high is higher than that.\n\nWait, no. Because for the second binary search, we're looking for the first n where count_zeros(n) > m.\n\nWhich could be higher than the initial high.\n\nWait, for example, suppose m=1.\n\nIn the first binary search, low is 5.\n\nIn the second binary search, we are looking for the first n where count>1.\n\nWhich is 10.\n\nSo the initial high for the second binary search should be higher than 10.\n\nBut in the code, the second binary search is initialized with high=5e5, which is way higher.\n\nSo, perhaps in the code, the second binary search's high is set to 5e5, not to low.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should be modified as follows:\n\nAfter the first binary search:\n\nif count_zeros(low)!=m → print 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   # Now, find the smallest high where count_zeros(high) >m.\n\n   # So, set high to 5e5.\n\n   low_second = low\n\n   high_second = 5e5\n\n   while low_second < high_second:\n\n       mid = (low_second + high_second)//2\n\n       cz = count_zeros(mid)\n\n       if cz >m:\n\n           high_second = mid\n\n       else:\n\n           low_second = mid +1\n\n   high = high_second\n\nSo the valid numbers are from low to high_second-1.\n\nThus, the code for the second binary search is independent of the first.\n\nSo, the corrected code outline is:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute low and check if count is m.\n\nIf not, print 0.\n\nElse, perform second binary search with high=5e5.\n\nSet low_second=low, high_second=5e5.\n\nBinary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >m.\n\nThen, the count is high_second - low.\n\nSo, the code should be adjusted accordingly.\n\nIn the initial code I wrote, the second binary search was incorrectly initializing high to low, which could cause the high to be too small, leading to incorrect results.\n\nFor example, in the sample input where m=1, the second binary search's high is 5, which is wrong because the correct high is 10.\n\nAh, that's a bug.\n\nSo the correction is needed.\n\nThus, the code needs to be adjusted.\n\nSo, in the code, the second binary search's high is set to 5e5, not low.\n\nSo, the code should be:\n\nm = int(input())\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count =0\n    while n>0:\n        n = n//5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\n# Find the minimal n where count >=m.\nlow = 0\nhigh = 5 * 10**5\nwhile low < high:\n    mid = (low + high)//2\n    cz = count_zeros(mid)\n    if cz >= m:\n        high = mid\n    else:\n        low = mid +1\n\nif count_zeros(low)!=m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Find the minimal high where count >m.\n    low_high = low\n    high_high = 5 * 10**5\n    while low_high < high_high:\n        mid = (low_high + high_high)//2\n        cz = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cz > m:\n            high_high = mid\n        else:\n            low_high = mid +1\n    count = high_high - low\n    print(count)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(low, high_high))))\n\nWait, but in the second binary search, what is the initial high? 5e5, which is sufficient.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nm=1.\n\nFirst binary search finds low=5.\n\nSecond binary search: looking for the first n where count>1.\n\nInitial low=5, high=5e5.\n\nmid = (5+500000)//2, which is a big number. But since count_zeros for such a mid is definitely >1, high_high will move left.\n\nWait, but perhaps the binary search will correctly find 10 as the first n where count>1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code now correctly finds the high.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nAfter first binary search, low is 25, but count is 6, which is not equal to 5. So output 0.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nFirst binary search finds low=25.\n\ncount_zeros(25)=6 ==6.\n\nSecond binary search: find the first n where count>6.\n\nWhich is 30, as count_zeros(30)=7.\n\nSo high_high is 30.\n\nSo the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29 →5 numbers.\n\nSo code works.\n\nSo, the main bug was in the second binary search's initial high, which was incorrectly set to low. Now, it's correctly set to 5e5, ensuring that the correct high is found.\n\nAnother consideration: what if m is very large, like 1e5. How efficient is the code?\n\nThe binary searches are O(log(5e5)) which is about 19 steps each, and each step involves O(log n) time for count_zeros.\n\nEach count_zeros is O(log5 n), which is manageable.\n\nThus, the code should handle all test cases efficiently.\n\nNow, considering the output format.\n\nIn the sample input, for m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nSo the first line is the count, then the next line is the space-separated list of n's.\n\nSo, in code, after computing the count and the list, we need to print the count as the first line, then print the list as space-separated on the next line.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would be:\n\nprint(count)\nprint(' '.join(map(str, range(low, high_high))))\n\nWait, but for m=1, the list is 5,6,7,8,9 → 5 elements.\n\nSo, in code, when the count is 5, the range is from 5 to 9 (inclusive), which is 5 elements.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, another test case: m=2.\n\nThe code would find low=10, count_zeros(10)=2.\n\nThen, find high where count>2. Which is 15, as count_zeros(15)=3.\n\nSo the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14 →5 numbers.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=3.\n\nlow is 15, count is 3.\n\nhigh is 20, count is 4.\n\nnumbers 15-19:5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe final code will read m, perform the binary searches as described, and output the required information.\n\nI think this should solve the problem.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list all such integers \\( n \\) in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5^i} \\right\\rfloor\n   \\]\n   This sum continues until \\( 5^i \\) exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: We use binary search to efficiently find the smallest \\( n \\) (let's call it `low`) such that the number of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\). If the count of trailing zeros at `low` is not exactly \\( m \\), then there are no valid \\( n \\) values, and we output 0.\n\n3. **Finding the Upper Bound**: If `low` gives exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros, we then find the smallest \\( n \\) (call it `high`) where the count of trailing zeros exceeds \\( m \\). The valid \\( n \\) values are those between `low` and `high - 1`.\n\n4. **Efficiency Considerations**: The helper function `count_zeros(n)` efficiently computes the number of trailing zeros using a loop that repeatedly divides \\( n \\) by 5 and sums the results. Binary search ensures that we efficiently find the bounds, making the solution feasible even for large values of \\( m \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nm = int(input())\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\n# Find the minimal n where count >= m\nlow = 0\nhigh = 5 * 10**5  # Initial upper bound\nwhile low < high:\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n    cz = count_zeros(mid)\n    if cz >= m:\n        high = mid\n    else:\n        low = mid + 1\n\nif count_zeros(low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Find the minimal high where count > m\n    low_high = low\n    high_high = 5 * 10**5\n    while low_high < high_high:\n        mid = (low_high + high_high) // 2\n        cz = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cz > m:\n            high_high = mid\n        else:\n            low_high = mid + 1\n    count = high_high - low\n    print(count)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(low, high_high))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input value \\( m \\) is read from standard input.\n2. **Helper Function**: `count_zeros(n)` calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by summing the contributions from each power of 5.\n3. **First Binary Search**: This finds the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\).\n4. **Check Validity**: If the count of trailing zeros at this smallest \\( n \\) is not exactly \\( m \\), output 0.\n5. **Second Binary Search**: This finds the smallest \\( n \\) where the count of trailing zeros exceeds \\( m \\).\n6. **Output Results**: The number of valid \\( n \\) values and the values themselves are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the range of valid \\( n \\) values using binary search, ensuring the solution is both correct and efficient.",
