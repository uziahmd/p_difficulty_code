He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is called Polycarp's Practice. The goal is to maximize the total profit from solving problems over k days.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, Polycarp has a list of n problems with difficulties a_1 to a_n. He needs to solve all of them in exactly k days. Each day he must solve at least one problem, and he can't skip any. So each day's problems are a contiguous sequence starting from some point. For example, on day 1, he might solve the first m problems, then on day 2, the next p, and so on until all are done.\n\nThe profit for each day is the maximum difficulty in that day's problems. The total profit is the sum of these maxima across all days. We need to distribute the problems into k contiguous groups (days) such that the sum is as large as possible.\n\nOur task is to find this maximum sum and output the way to split the list.\n\nHmm, how to approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about what contributes to the maximum profit. Each day's profit is the maximum in its segment. So, to maximize the total, we want as many high values as possible to be the maximums of their respective segments.\n\nBut since the segments are contiguous and cover the entire array without skipping, we need to arrange the splits in such a way that the highest elements are each in their own segment if possible.\n\nWait, but sometimes that's not possible because k is less than n. So, perhaps, the optimal approach is to select the top k-1 or so highest elements as the maximums for each segment, and then include the rest in those segments.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this with dynamic programming. Because for each position i and each day j, we can track the best possible maximum up to i using j days.\n\nYes, that seems promising.\n\nLet me think about a DP state. Let's define dp[i][j] as the maximum total profit achievable by considering the first i problems in j days. Then, for each i and j, we can consider where the last split was made.\n\nWait, but j can't be more than k, and i has to be >= j because each day must have at least one problem.\n\nSo, the recurrence would be something like:\n\ndp[i][j] = max( dp[l][j-1] + max(a[l+1..i]) ) for l in 0 to i-1.\n\nBut wait, calculating max(a[l+1..i]) for every possible l each time might be computationally expensive, especially since n can be up to 2000 and k up to 2000. That would make the time complexity O(n^3 *k), which for 2000 is 8e9 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo, that approach won't work. We need a way to compute the max quickly.\n\nAn alternative idea: precompute for each possible segment [l, r], the maximum value in that segment. But even that is O(n^2), which for 2000 is 4e6—manageable, but when multiplied by k=2000, it's 8e9 again. So that's not feasible.\n\nHmm. Wait, another observation: since the segments are contiguous and ordered, each segment starts where the previous one ended. So, the segments are non-overlapping and cover the entire array in order.\n\nAnother thought: the maximum in each day's segment can only be one of the a_i's in that segment. So, for the current segment ending at i, the maximum could be either the previous maximum or a new one.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the DP state as dp[j][i], the maximum total profit for the first j days and i problems. Or maybe not. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps the state should be dp[j][i], representing the maximum total profit when considering the first i problems divided into j days. Then, for each j, we can look back to see where to split.\n\nFor example, to compute dp[j][i], we can try all possible positions l where the j-th day starts at l+1 and ends at i. Then, dp[j][i] = max( dp[j-1][l] + max(a[l+1..i]) ), for all l < i.\n\nBut again, computing max(a[l+1..i]) for each l and i is O(n^2), which is too slow for 2000.\n\nWait, but maybe we can optimize the max query. Let's think about maintaining for each j, the current maximum as we extend the segment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each position i, the previous positions where a certain element is the maximum. Not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: realize that the maximum in a segment is the maximum of the elements",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to distribute a list of problems into k contiguous segments such that the sum of the maximum difficulties in each segment is maximized. Each day, Polycarp must solve at least one problem, and he cannot skip any problems from his list.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to use dynamic programming (DP) to efficiently compute the maximum total profit. The DP state `dp[j][i]` represents the maximum total profit achievable by considering the first `i` problems in `j` days. \n\n1. **State Transition**: For each position `i` and each day `j`, we consider all possible previous positions `l` where the last segment could end. The transition is given by:\n   \\[\n   dp[j][i] = \\max_{0 \\leq l < i} (dp[j-1][l] + \\max(a[l+1..i]))\n   \\]\n   This means that for each possible end of the previous segment, we add the maximum value of the current segment starting from `l+1` to `i`.\n\n2. **Maximization Optimization**: To avoid recalculating the maximum for every possible segment, we precompute the maximum values for all possible subarrays using a 2D array `max_val`, where `max_val[i][j]` stores the maximum value in the subarray from index `i` to `j`.\n\n3. **Filling the DP Table**: We initialize the DP table with base cases where either the number of days or the number of problems is zero. Then, we iteratively fill the table by considering all possible splits of the problem list into segments.\n\n4. **Reconstructing the Solution**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from `dp[k][n]` to determine the optimal way to split the problems into segments to maximize the total profit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    k = int(input[1])\n    a = list(map(int, input[2:2+n]))\n    \n    # Precompute max_val[i][j] = max(a[i..j])\n    max_val = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        max_val[i][i] = a[i]\n        if i < n-1:\n            max_val[i][i+1] = max(a[i], max_val[i+1][i+1])\n        for j in range(i+2, n):\n            max_val[i][j] = max(a[i], max_val[i+1][j])\n    \n    # Initialize DP\n    dp = [[-1]*(n+1) for _ in range(k+1)]\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        dp[1][i] = max_val[0][i-1]\n    \n    for j in range(2, k+1):\n        for i in range(j, n+1):\n            max_profit = 0\n            for l in range(i-1, max(j-1, 0), -1):\n                current_max = max_val[l][i-1]\n                if dp[j-1][l] + current_max > max_profit:\n                    max_profit = dp[j-1][l] + current_max\n            dp[j][i] = max_profit\n    \n    # Reconstruct the solution\n    t = [0]*k\n    current = n\n    for j in range(k, 0, -1):\n        for l in range(current-1, 0, -1):\n            if dp[j-1][l] + max_val[l][current-1] == dp[j][current]:\n                t[j-1] = current - l\n                current = l\n                break\n    \n    print(dp[k][n])\n    print(' '.join(map(str, t)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precomputation**: We precompute the maximum values for all subarrays to quickly access the maximum value of any segment during the DP transitions.\n2. **DP Initialization**: We initialize the DP table with the base case where only one day is used to cover all problems.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each possible number of days and each possible end of the problem list, we compute the maximum profit by considering all possible previous splits.\n4. **Reconstruction**: After computing the maximum profit, we backtrack through the DP table to determine the optimal way to split the problems into segments.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum total profit while adhering to the constraints, providing an optimal solution in O(n^2 * k) time complexity.",
