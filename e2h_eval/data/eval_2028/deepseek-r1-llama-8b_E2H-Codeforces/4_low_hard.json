The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is a variation of Rock-Paper-Scissors between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They play n rounds, and in each round, the winner gives the loser a pinch, which leaves a red spot. We need to calculate how many red spots each has after all the rounds.\n\nHmm. So the key here is that both players have their own sequences for choosing their moves. For each round, they each pick the next move in their respective sequences, cycling through them. And based on the outcome of each round, one gets a point (a red spot), the other doesn't.\n\nWait, but how do we model this efficiently? Because for each round, we have to determine who wins, and then add a count accordingly.\n\nFirst, let's think about the steps needed:\n\n1. Read the input: n, the sequences A and B.\n2. For each of the n rounds:\n   a. Determine what each player plays.\n   b. Determine who wins this round.\n   c. Increment the loser's red spot count.\n3. After processing all rounds, output the counts for both players.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2*10^9, which is way too big to loop through each round directly. So we can't simulate each round step by step; that would be too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the main challenge is to find out, for each possible pair of (i,j) in the cycles of A and B, how often each combination occurs, and how it contributes to the red spots.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as finding, for each possible pair of choices, how many times each such pair occurs across all n rounds. Then, for each such pair, determine who loses, and accumulate the counts.\n\nBut even that could be computationally intensive if not handled properly, because m and k can be up to 1000, leading to 1e6 possible (i,j) pairs. But maybe that's manageable, especially since n is up to 2e9.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find the total number of times each (a, b) pair occurs over the entire sequence of rounds. Then, for each such pair, we can compute whether a beats b, b beats a, or it's a draw.\n\nSo the first step is to find the frequency of each possible (a, b) pair in the infinite cycle of A and B.\n\nHow can we compute the frequency of each (a, b) pair?\n\nWell, for each position i in A, it repeats every len(A) steps. Similarly for B. So for each i in 0..m-1 and j in 0..k-1, the pair (A[i], B[j]) will appear exactly t times in n rounds, where t is the number of times (i mod m, j mod k) appears in the sequence of rounds.\n\nWait, no. Because the rounds are processed in order, and for each round, we take the next character in A and B. So for each round s (starting from 0 to n-1), the choice for A is A[s % m], and for B is B[s % k].\n\nSo the pair (A[i], B[j]) occurs exactly g times, where g is the greatest common divisor of m and k multiplied by some factors, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the number of times (i,j) appears is equal to the number of times s satisfies s ≡ i mod m and s ≡ j mod k, for s in 0..n-1.\n\nWait, but m and k might not be coprime. So the number of solutions s in [0, n) to the congruences s ≡ i mod m and s ≡ j mod k is either zero or equal to d, where d is the gcd(m, k). Wait, no, that's not quite right. The number of solutions depends on whether i ≡ j mod d, where d is the gcd of m and k.\n\nSo, for each i in 0..m-1, j in 0..k-1, we can compute whether there exists a solution s to s ≡ i mod m and s ≡ j mod k. If such s exists, then the number of times the pair (A[i], B[j]) occurs is equal to floor((n + LCM(m,k)) / (LCM(m,k))) * d, where d is 1 if i ≡ j mod d, else 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as the number of times each (i,j) pair is hit is equal to the number of times s in [0, n) such that s mod m = i and s mod k = j.\n\nThis is a standard problem in modular arithmetic.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they play `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each player follows a cyclic sequence of moves, and the winner of each round gives the loser a pinch, resulting in a red spot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. For each round, we need to determine who wins based on their current moves and increment the loser's red spot count.\n2. **Efficient Calculation**: Given the constraints, simulating each round directly is infeasible. Instead, we calculate the frequency of each possible pair of moves from both players' sequences using modular arithmetic.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: For each pair of moves (i, j) from sequences A and B, determine how many times they occur over `n` rounds. This is done by solving congruences to find common cycles.\n4. **Determine Winners**: For each pair, determine if it results in a win for one player or a draw. Accumulate the red spots based on these outcomes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom math import gcd\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    total_rounds = n\n    \n    # Precompute all possible (i, j) pairs and their counts\n    count = {}\n    lcm = 0\n    d = gcd(m, k)\n    period = m * k // d\n    for i in range(m):\n        for j in range(k):\n            if (i - j) % d != 0:\n                continue\n            cnt = n // period\n            rem = n % period\n            if rem > 0:\n                pos = i + (j - i) % k\n                cnt += 1\n            cnt_i = cnt * d\n            cnt_j = cnt * k // m\n            cnt_total = cnt * period\n            count[(i,j)] = cnt\n            count[(j,i)] = cnt\n            count[(i,i)] = cnt\n    \n    # Now, process each possible (a, b) and determine the outcome\n    a_counts = {}\n    b_counts = {}\n    for (i, j), cnt in count.items():\n        a_char = A[i]\n        b_char = B[j]\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            pass  # Draw, no points\n        elif (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R'):\n            # a beats b, so b gets a point\n            b_counts[(i,j)] = cnt\n        else:\n            # b beats a, so a gets a point\n            a_counts[(i,j)] = cnt\n    \n    # Sum all the points\n    a_points = sum(a_counts.get((i,j), 0) for i, j in a_counts)\n    b_points = sum(b_counts.get((i,j), 0) for i, j in b_counts)\n    \n    print(f\"{a_points} {b_points}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B`.\n2. **Precompute Pair Frequencies**: Using modular arithmetic, we determine how often each pair of moves (i, j) occurs over `n` rounds. This is done by checking if the indices satisfy the necessary congruences.\n3. **Determine Outcomes**: For each pair, we check if it results in a win for one player or a draw. We then accumulate the red spots based on these outcomes.\n4. **Output Results**: Finally, we print the total number of red spots for each player.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging modular arithmetic and precomputing move pair frequencies, ensuring the solution is both optimal and scalable.",
