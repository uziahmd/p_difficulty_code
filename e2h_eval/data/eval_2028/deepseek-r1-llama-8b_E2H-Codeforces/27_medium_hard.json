On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"A Twisty Movement\" and involves sequences of numbers. Hmm.\n\nSo, the problem statement says that Tommy wants to choose an interval [l, r] in the sequence and reverse the subarray from l to r. After doing this, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the new sequence.\n\nWait, right. The original sequence consists of 1s and 2s because each ai is either 1 or 2. That's helpful because the possible values are limited, which might make some optimizations feasible.\n\nLet me think about the approach. For each possible interval [l, r], we reverse a[l..r], then compute the LNDS of the modified array. We need to find the maximum such LNDS across all possible intervals.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2000. So if we try every possible [l, r], that's O(n^2) possibilities. For each possibility, reversing is O(1) since it's just a swap of elements. Then, computing the LNDS after reversal could take O(n^2) time using a dynamic programming approach. But 2000^4 is way too big—like 16e12 operations, which is impossible.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nHmm, but wait, the LNDS for a sequence of 1s and 2s can be computed efficiently. Since the values are only 1 and 2, perhaps there's a pattern or a way to model this without full DP.\n\nWait, let's think about the structure of the LNDS. For a sequence of 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be thought of as the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s, or a mix where 1s come before 2s in a non-decreasing manner.\n\nWait, no. Because a non-decreasing sequence can have any order as long as each element is >= the previous. So for 1s and 2s, the LNDS is determined by how many 1s we have before any 2s. But when you reverse a subarray, you might change the arrangement of 1s and 2s in a way that increases this count.\n\nSo maybe for each possible interval [l, r], reversing it can potentially increase the number of 1s before 2s, thus increasing the LNDS.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal LNDS is either the original sequence's LNDS or something achievable by reversing some interval.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the properties of the LNDS for 1s and 2s. The LNDS is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of inversions, but that might not be directly applicable here.\n\nWait, another approach: For each position i, determine how many 1s are to the left of i, and how many 2s are to the right. The LNDS would be the sum of these, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS can be computed as the maximum between:\n\n- the number of 1s up to position i, plus the number of 2s from position j onwards, for some j > i.\n\nBut I'm not exactly sure.\n\nWait, maybe for a given reversed interval [l, r], the LNDS can be calculated quickly by considering how the reversal affects the distribution of 1s and 2s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each possible [l, r], the number of 1s in the reversed segment and how they contribute to the overall LNDS.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the problem differently. Since the elements are 1 and 2, the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s that can appear before 2s. So, the more 1s are on the left and 2s on the right, the higher the LNDS.\n\nReversing a segment can help in placing 1s earlier and 2s later. So, for each possible [l, r], reversing it could potentially create a longer run of 1s followed by 2s.\n\nBut how do we find the best [l, r] to reverse?\n\nAnother idea: For each possible l and r, compute the effect of reversing the subarray a[l..r] on the entire array's LNDS. Then take the maximum over all possible l and r.\n\nBut with n=2000, trying all l and r would be O(n^2) = 4e6, which is manageable if each iteration is O(n) time.\n\nWait, but for each [l, r], how do we compute the LNDS quickly?\n\nWait, perhaps the key insight is that after reversing a segment, the LNDS can be determined by the number of 1s in certain regions.\n\nLet me think about the original array. Let me denote that the LNDS is the maximum k where there exists some k such that the first k elements consist of m 1s followed by (k - m) 2s, but arranged in a non-decreasing way.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Maybe the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before 2s in a certain way.\n\nWait, actually, for a sequence of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is equal to the maximum number of 1s that can be taken from the beginning, or the maximum number of 2s that can be taken from the end, but perhaps it's not that straightforward.\n\nWait, for example, consider the sequence 1, 2, 1, 2. The LNDS is 2: either [1,2] or [2,2]. Alternatively, perhaps the LNDS is 3, like 1,2,2. Oh right, because 1 ≤ 2 ≤ 2 is a non-decreasing subsequence of length 3.\n\nHmm, maybe I should think about how the LNDS is affected by reversing any interval.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal way is to reverse a segment that allows as many 1s as possible to come before 2s.\n\nWait, another approach: the LNDS for the original array can be computed, and then for each possible interval [l, r], we can compute the maximum possible LNDS after reversing that interval, and keep track of the maximum.\n\nBut again, the problem is how to compute the LNDS quickly after each reversal.\n\nWait, but n is 2000, and for each [l, r], the reversal is O(1), but computing the LNDS for the entire array after each reversal is O(n), which would lead to 4e6 * 2e3 = 8e9 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo that approach isn't feasible.\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nWait, let's think about what changes when we reverse a segment [l, r]. The elements in [l, r] are reversed. So, within this segment, all the 1s and 2s are now in the reverse order.\n\nSo, for the rest of the array, the 1s and 2s outside [l, r] remain the same. Only inside the segment, their positions are swapped.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to compute how the reversal affects the count of 1s and 2s in certain regions, which can then be used to calculate the LNDS.\n\nBecause the LNDS depends on how many 1s are before 2s.\n\nLet me think: suppose the original array has some number of 1s and 2s. When we reverse a segment, we can change the distribution of 1s and 2s in that segment.\n\nFor example, if the segment had x 1s and y 2s, then after reversal, it still has x 1s and y 2s, but their positions are swapped.\n\nSo, the total number of 1s and 2s in the entire array remains the same. Therefore, the maximum possible LNDS is bounded by the minimum between the total number of 1s and the total number of 2s plus 1 (if there's a mix).\n\nWait, no. Because in the best case, the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s that can be followed by 2s. So, the maximum possible LNDS is min(total_ones, total_twos) + 1 if there's at least one transition from 1 to 2.\n\nWait, for example, if there are 5 ones and 3 twos, the maximum LNDS is 3+1=4? Or wait, maybe it's 3+1=4? Or perhaps it's 5 if all are 1s, but that's only if all are 1s.\n\nWait, no. For example, in the array [1,1,1,2,2,2], the LNDS is 6, which is min(3,3)+3=6? Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is the minimum between the count of 1s and 2s, plus 1 if there's a 1 followed by a 2 somewhere.\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated. Maybe it's better to model the problem differently.\n\nAlternative idea: The LNDS can be computed as the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before 2s, possibly after some reversal.\n\nSo, for each possible reversal of [l, r], what is the maximum number of 1s in the prefix, and 2s in the suffix, such that the 1s are all before the 2s.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS after reversing [l, r] is equal to the maximum of:\n\nthe number of 1s in the entire array, plus the number of 2s in the reversed segment that are to the right of the last 1 in the original array.\n\nNo, that seems vague.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to precompute for each possible l and r, the number of 1s in the reversed segment, and see how it contributes to the global 1s and 2s counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal LNDS is achieved when the reversed segment has as many 1s as possible on the left side of the segment and 2s on the right side.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible [l, r], the number of 1s in [l, r] is cnt1, and the number of 2s is cnt2. After reversing, the segment will have its 1s and 2s swapped in positions.\n\nSo, the 1s in the segment will now be positioned in [r, l], and 2s in [l, r].\n\nWait, maybe not. Reversing [l, r] swaps the order, so all the 1s that were in positions l to r will now be in positions r to l.\n\nBut for the purpose of the LNDS, the important thing is how many 1s are before a 2.\n\nSo, perhaps for each [l, r], the maximum possible contribution to the LNDS is the number of 1s in the entire array before position l plus the number of 1s in the reversed segment, plus the number of 2s in the reversed segment that come after the 1s in the segment.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe another approach is needed. Let's think about what the LNDS can be after reversing [l, r].\n\nThe LNDS is determined by the maximum number of 1s that can come before 2s. So, perhaps the best scenario is when all 1s are on the left side of all 2s.\n\nIn that case, the LNDS would be the total number of 1s plus the total number of 2s, but that's only possible if all 1s are before all 2s.\n\nBut in reality, that's not always possible. So the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between:\n\nmin(total_ones, total_twos) + 1 if there's at least one 1 followed by a 2.\n\nOr, if all 1s are before all 2s, then the LNDS is n.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible number of 1s that can be placed before all 2s, possibly by reversing some interval.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible [l, r], we can compute how many 1s are in [l, r], and how many 2s are in [l, r]. Then, the idea is that by reversing [l, r], we can bring all the 1s in [l, r] to the left of the segment, and the 2s to the right.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you reverse [l, r], the 1s in that segment will now be at the end of the segment, and the 2s at the beginning. So, for the entire array, the 1s outside the segment remain in their positions, and the 1s inside the segment are now at the end of the segment. Similarly for the 2s.\n\nSo, for the entire array, the number of 1s before the segment is A = the number of 1s in the prefix [1..l-1]. The number of 1s in the segment is C = cnt1. The number of 2s in the segment is D = cnt2 (since the segment has C 1s and D 2s, C + D = r - l + 1).\n\nAfter reversal, the 1s in the segment are now at positions r down to l, and the 2s are at l down to r.\n\nSo, the total number of 1s before the segment is A, and the 1s in the segment are now in positions r to l. Wait, no—reversal changes their order, so the 1s in the segment are now in the positions that were previously occupied by 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the effect of reversing [l, r] on the 1s and 2s in the entire array.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- Before reversal: the array is a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.\n\n- After reversal of [l, r]: the array becomes a_1, a_2, ..., a_{l-1}, a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l, a_{r+1}, ..., a_n.\n\nSo, in the reversed segment, all 1s are now at the end of the segment, and 2s are at the beginning.\n\nSo, for the entire array, the 1s outside [l, r] are in their original positions. The 1s inside [l, r] are now at the end of the segment.\n\nSimilarly, the 2s inside [l, r] are now at the beginning of the segment.\n\nSo, the question is: How does this affect the total number of 1s that can be placed before 2s.\n\nLet me think about the regions:\n\n1. Prefix [1..l-1]: All 1s here are counted towards the prefix 1s.\n\n2. Segment [l..r]: After reversal, the 2s are at the start of the segment, followed by 1s.\n\n3. Suffix [r+1..n]: All 2s here are part of the suffix 2s.\n\nNow, the idea is to find the maximum number of 1s in the prefix [1..l-1] plus the 1s in the segment that come after the 2s in the segment, plus the 2s in the suffix that come after the 1s in the segment.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before the 2s is the sum of:\n\n- The number of 1s in the prefix [1..l-1] (which is fixed)\n\nPlus\n\n- The number of 1s in the segment [l..r] that come after the 2s in the segment.\n\nPlus\n\n- The number of 2s in the suffix [r+1..n] that come after the 1s in the segment.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the case. So, for the segment [l..r], after reversal, the 2s are at the beginning of the segment, and the 1s are at the end. So, the 1s in the segment are all after the 2s in the segment.\n\nThen, the 2s in the suffix are after the 1s in the segment.\n\nSo, the total number of 1s before the 2s is:\n\nprefix_1 + (segment_2) + (suffix_2) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the prefix_1 is the number of 1s in [1..l-1].\n\nIn the segment [l..r], after reversal, the 2s are first, then the 1s. So, in the segment, the 2s are before the 1s.\n\nThus, the 1s in the segment are after the 2s in the segment.\n\nThen, the suffix starts at r+1, which may contain 2s or 1s.\n\nWait, but the suffix's 2s are after the 1s in the segment.\n\nSo, the 1s in the segment are before the suffix 2s.\n\nThus, the total 1s before the suffix 2s is:\n\nprefix_1 + (number of 1s in the segment) + (number of 2s in the suffix).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum of:\n\nmax_ones_before_twos = max(prefix_1 + (segment_1_in_reversed) + (suffix_2)).\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me try to model it step by step.\n\nAfter reversing [l, r], the array is divided into three parts:\n\n1. Left part: [1..l-1], all 1s are as is.\n\n2. Middle part: [l..r], which is reversed. So, the 2s in the original segment are now at positions l to ... and the 1s are at positions ... to r.\n\n3. Right part: [r+1..n], 2s and 1s as in the original array.\n\nIn the middle part, the 2s are before the 1s.\n\nSo, the 1s in the middle part are after the 2s in the middle part.\n\nThe right part's 2s are after the middle's 1s.\n\nThus, the 1s in the middle can be considered as being before the right's 2s.\n\nSo, the total number of 1s before any 2s is:\n\nprefix_1 (left part's 1s) + (number of 1s in the middle) + (number of 2s in the right part).\n\nWait, that's the idea. Because all the 1s in the middle are after the 2s in the middle, and all the 2s in the right are after the 1s in the middle.\n\nSo, the sum is prefix_1 + (middle_1) + (right_2).\n\nBut wait, what about the 2s in the middle? They are before the 1s in the middle. So the 1s in the middle are after the 2s in the middle, but the 2s in the right are after the 1s in the middle. So, any 1s in the middle are before the 2s in the right.\n\nSimilarly, the 2s in the middle are before the 1s in the middle.\n\nSo, the total number of 1s that can be placed before 2s is:\n\nprefix_1 (all 1s before the middle) + (middle_1) (the 1s in the middle) + (right_2) (the 2s in the right).\n\nBecause the 1s in the middle are after the 2s in the middle, and the right's 2s are after the middle's 1s. So, all of them are 1s before 2s.\n\nAdditionally, the 2s in the middle are before the 1s in the middle. So, the 1s in the middle are after the 2s in the middle, but the 2s in the middle are before the 1s in the middle, which are before the right's 2s.\n\nSo, the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum of all possible prefix_1 + middle_1 + right_2, across all possible [l, r].\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for each [l, r], the maximum LNDS after reversal is prefix_1 + middle_1 + right_2.\n\nWait, but is that always the case? Let me test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n4\n1 2 1 2\n\nOriginal LNDS is 3: for example, 1,2,2.\n\nWhen we reverse [2,3], the array becomes [1,1,2,2]. The LNDS is 4.\n\nCompute for [l=2, r=3]:\n\nprefix_1 is the number of 1s before l=2: a[1] is 1, so prefix_1 = 1.\n\nmiddle_1 is the number of 1s in [2..3] before reversal. Original [2,1], so cnt1 =1.\n\nright_2 is the number of 2s in [4], which is 1.\n\nSo, sum is 1+1+1=3. But the actual LNDS is 4.\n\nHmm, that suggests my model is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, in the sample, after reversal, the array is [1,1,2,2]. The LNDS is 4, which is the entire array.\n\nSo, according to my model, prefix_1 is 1 (before l=2), middle_1 is 1 (the 1 in positions 2 and 3 after reversal?), right_2 is 1.\n\nSo sum is 3, but actual is 4. So my model is wrong.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the model needs to be adjusted.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that the right part's 2s are also included in the LNDS.\n\nWait, perhaps the model is:\n\nThe maximum LNDS is the maximum of (prefix_1 + middle_1 + middle_2 + right_2).\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the model is not capturing all the 1s and 2s properly.\n\nWait, another approach: the maximum LNDS after reversing [l, r] is the maximum of:\n\nthe number of 1s in the entire array up to some point, plus the number of 2s beyond that point.\n\nBut how does the reversal affect this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum LNDS is the maximum number of 1s in the array before the first 2 in some suffix.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the original array and how reversing a segment can maximize the number of 1s before 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find, for each possible [l, r], the number of 1s in the prefix before l, plus the number of 1s in the reversed segment, plus the number of 2s in the suffix after r.\n\nBut that's similar to what I thought before.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\nOriginal array: [1,2,1,2]\n\nReversing [2,3] gives [1,1,2,2].\n\nSo, the prefix_1 is 1 (before l=2), the middle_1 is 1 (positions 2 and 3 after reversal: 1 and 2, so 1 is present). The right_2 is 1 (position 4).\n\nSo, 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, but the LNDS is 4.\n\nSo, where is the mistake?\n\nAh, because the middle_1 includes the 1s in the reversed segment, but after the 2s in the middle. So, in the reversed segment, the 1s are after the 2s. So, the 1s in the middle can be added to the prefix_1, and the 2s in the right can be added to that sum.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the prefix_1 is 1, the middle has 1, and the right has 2, but the total is 4.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is prefix_1 + (middle_1) + (right_2) + (middle_2).\n\nNo, that can't be, because adding middle_2 would add 2s after the 1s in the middle.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should include the 2s in the middle as well, but that doesn't make sense because 2s are before the 1s in the middle.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is (prefix_1 + middle_1) + (right_2) + (middle_2's 2s before the 1s in the middle).\n\nNo, I'm getting stuck.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think about the LNDS after reversing [l, r]. The LNDS is the maximum possible number of 1s that can be placed before 2s.\n\nTo maximize this, the optimal scenario is that all 1s in the array are before all 2s. But that's not always possible.\n\nIf we reverse [l, r], the 1s in [l, r] will be after the 2s in [l, r]. So, the 1s in [l, r] are after the 2s in [l, r], and the 2s in [r+1..n] are after the 1s in [l..r].\n\nThus, the total number of 1s before any 2s is the number of 1s in [1..l-1] plus the number of 1s in [l..r] plus the number of 2s in [r+1..n].\n\nWait, that makes sense because:\n\n- The 1s in [1..l-1] are before the reversed segment.\n\n- In the reversed segment, the 2s are before the 1s.\n\n- The 2s in [r+1..n] are after the 1s in the reversed segment.\n\nSo, all 1s in [1..l-1] and [l..r] are before the 2s in [r+1..n].\n\nBut wait, the 2s in [l..r] are before the 1s in [l..r], but those 1s are before the 2s in [r+1..n].\n\nSo, the 2s in [l..r] are before the 1s in [l..r], but those 1s are before the 2s in [r+1..n]. So, the 2s in [l..r] are before the 1s in [l..r], which are before the 2s in [r+1..n]. So, the 2s in [l..r] are before the 2s in [r+1..n], but the 1s in [l..r] are before the 2s in [r+1..n].\n\nSo, the 2s in [l..r] and [r+1..n] are both before the 1s in [l..r]. No, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps the 2s in [l..r] are before the 1s in [l..r], but the 1s in [l..r] are before the 2s in [r+1..n]. So, the 2s in [l..r] are before the 1s in [l..r], which are before the 2s in [r+1..n]. So, all 2s in [l..r] and [r+1..n] are before any 1s in [l..r], but the 1s in [l..r] are before the 2s in [r+1..n].\n\nWait, perhaps the 2s in [l..r] are before the 1s in [l..r], which are before the 2s in [r+1..n]. So, the 2s in [l..r] are before the 2s in [r+1..n], but the 1s in [l..r] are before the 2s in [r+1..n].\n\nSo, the 2s in [l..r] and [r+1..n] are both before the 1s in [l..r], but the 1s in [l..r] are before the 2s in [r+1..n].\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should model it with the sample.\n\nSample 1: After reversing [2,3], the array is [1,1,2,2].\n\nSo, the 1s are in positions 1, 2, and the 2s are in 3,4.\n\nSo, the 1s in [1..1] (prefix_1) are 1.\n\nThe 1s in [2..3] after reversal: 1 is at position 2, 2 is at 3.\n\nWait, no, after reversal, [2,3] becomes [1,2], so the array becomes [1,1,2,2].\n\nSo, the 1s in [2..3] are 1 and 2 (but 2 is a 2, so perhaps the count is 1.\n\nSo, prefix_1 = 1 (from [1]), middle_1 = 1 (from [2]), and right_2 is 2 (from [3,4]).\n\nWait, that's 1 +1 +2=4, which matches the sample.\n\nAh, I see! So, the formula should be prefix_1 (number of 1s before l) + middle_1 (number of 1s in [l..r]) + right_2 (number of 2s in [r+1..n]).\n\nYes! So, in this case, the sum is 1+1+2=4, which is correct.\n\nSo, the model is:\n\nFor each possible [l, r], the maximum possible LNDS after reversing [l, r] is:\n\nprefix_1 + middle_1 + right_2.\n\nWhere:\n\n- prefix_1 is the number of 1s in [1..l-1].\n\n- middle_1 is the number of 1s in the original [l..r].\n\n- right_2 is the number of 2s in the original [r+1..n].\n\nBecause after reversing [l..r], the 1s in [l..r] are at the end of the segment, and the 2s in [l..r] are at the beginning. So, all the 1s in [l..r] are after the 2s in [l..r], and the 2s in [r+1..n] are after the 1s in [l..r].\n\nThus, the sum is the 1s in prefix + 1s in [l..r] + 2s in [r+1..n].\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute prefix_1 for all l: for each l, prefix_1[l] is the number of 1s in [1..l-1].\n\n2. Precompute for each r, the number of 2s in [r+1..n]: right_2[r].\n\n3. For each possible [l, r], compute middle_1 = the number of 1s in [l..r] in the original array.\n\n4. Compute the sum s = prefix_1[l] + middle_1 + right_2[r].\n\n5. Keep track of the maximum s over all [l, r].\n\n6. Also, compute the original LNDS and compare it with the maximum s found.\n\nWait, why? Because sometimes reversing a segment might not improve the LNDS. So, the original LNDS could be the maximum.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Compute the original LNDS.\n\n- For each [l, r], compute s = prefix_1[l] + (number of 1s in [l..r]) + (number of 2s in [r+1..n]).\n\n- Take the maximum of the original LNDS and the maximum s over all [l, r].\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Precompute prefix_1 and right_2.\n\n- Precompute for each l, the number of 1s in [l..r] for all r >= l.\n\nBut wait, how to compute for each [l, r], the number of 1s in [l..r]?\n\nWe can precompute a 2D array cnt_ones[l][r], where cnt_ones[l][r] is the number of 1s in [l..r].\n\nSimilarly, cnt_twos[l][r] can be precomputed.\n\nBut with n=2000, this is manageable, as it's O(n^2) space.\n\nSo, steps to implement:\n\n1. Read the input array.\n\n2. Compute the original LNDS. How?\n\nSince the array consists of 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be computed as follows:\n\n- The LNDS is the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before 2s.\n\nWhich can be found by counting the number of 1s up to each position i, and the number of 2s from position j onward. The maximum of (i's 1s + j's 2s) for all i < j.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Another approach is to realize that the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s that can be taken from the array, possibly followed by 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps for the original array, the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LNDS can be computed by iterating through the array and keeping track of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nBut for n=2000, an O(n) approach is needed.\n\nWait, for a sequence of 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be found by:\n\nInitialize two variables: count_ones and max_length.\n\nIterate through the array:\n\n- For each element:\n\n   if it's 1, increment count_ones.\n\n   else:\n\n      max_length = max(max_length, count_ones + 1)  // because this 2 can be appended after the current 1s.\n\n      // Or wait, perhaps max_length is the maximum of current max_length and (count_ones + 1).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach is to note that the LNDS is the maximum between:\n\na) The number of 1s before the first 2.\n\nb) The number of 1s before the second 2, etc., plus the number of 2s after that.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s that can be taken from the array, possibly followed by 2s.\n\nSo, the LNDS is the maximum value of (k + m), where k is the number of 1s in the array up to some index i, and m is the number of 2s from index i+1 to the end.\n\nSo, to compute the original LNDS:\n\nCompute for each i (0 <= i < n):\n\n   current_ones = number of 1s up to i.\n\n   remaining_twos = number of 2s from i+1 to n-1.\n\n   max_val = max(max_val, current_ones + remaining_twos)\n\nSo, the original LNDS is the maximum of these values.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for the original array, we can compute this.\n\nOnce we have that, for each [l, r], we compute s = prefix_1[l] + cnt_ones[l..r] + right_2[r].\n\nThen, the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum s over all [l, r] is the answer.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute prefix_ones: prefix_ones[i] = number of 1s in a[0..i-1].\n\n2. Precompute right_twos: right_twos[i] = number of 2s in a[i..n-1].\n\n3. Precompute cnt_ones: a 2D array where cnt_ones[l][r] is the number of 1s in a[l..r].\n\n4. Iterate l from 0 to n-1:\n\n   for each l, iterate r from l to n-1:\n\n      compute cnt_1 = cnt_ones[l][r]\n\n      compute s = prefix_ones[l] + cnt_1 + (right_twos[r+1])\n\n      keep track of the maximum s.\n\n5. The result is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum s found.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this.\n\nBut how to precompute cnt_ones and right_twos?\n\nFor cnt_ones, we can compute a 2D prefix sum.\n\nSimilarly for right_twos.\n\nSo:\n\nCompute prefix_ones:\n\nprefix_ones[0] = 0\n\nprefix_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i-1] + (a[i-1] == 1 ? 1 : 0)\n\nSimilarly, for right_twos:\n\nright_twos[n] = 0\n\nright_twos[i] = right_twos[i+1] + (a[i] == 2 ? 1 : 0)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to index from 0.\n\nLet me adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nFor a 0-based array a of size n:\n\nCompute prefix_ones[i] = number of 1s in a[0..i-1].\n\nSo, prefix_ones[0] = 0,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in the given sequence of 1s and 2s.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding LNDS**: The LNDS in a sequence of 1s and 2s can be maximized by arranging all 1s before all 2s. This means that the optimal LNDS is determined by the number of 1s that can be placed before the 2s.\n\n2. **Reversing Subarrays**: Reversing a subarray can potentially increase the number of 1s before 2s.
