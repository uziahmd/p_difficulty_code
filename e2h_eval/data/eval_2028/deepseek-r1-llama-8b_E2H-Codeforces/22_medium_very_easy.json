After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the question carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining how many students are considered \"successful\" based on their marks in various subjects. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher mark for that subject.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. We have n students and m subjects. For each subject, we need to find out which student has the highest mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the top in at least one subject.\n\nSo, the steps I think are:\n\n1. Read the input correctly.\n2. For each subject, determine which student has the maximum mark.\n3. For each student, count how many subjects they are the top in. If at least one, increment the successful count.\n\nWait, but for each subject, only one student can be the best, right? Because if multiple students have the same max, then no one is the best in that case? Or wait, no, the problem says a student is the best if there's no student with a higher mark. So if two students have the same max, then neither is the best because both have the same, not higher. So for a subject, the best is the unique maximum, or there might be none if all have the same.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-read the note in the problem statement.\n\n\"In the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.\"\n\nLooking at the first sample input: 3 students, 3 subjects.\n\nStudent 1: 223 → subject 1 is '2', subject 2 is '2', subject 3 is '3'.\nWait, no, wait the input is given as strings like '223' which represents each student's marks in the m subjects. So for the first example, each line is a row of m characters, each representing the mark in each subject.\n\nWait, the first sample input is:\n\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112']\n\nSo, n=3, m=3.\n\nThen, the three lines are:\n\"223\"\n\"232\"\n\"112\"\n\nSo for subject 1: the marks are 2, 3, 1. So the maximum is 3, which is from student 2.\n\nSubject 2: marks are 2,3,1. Max is 3, student 2.\n\nSubject 3: marks are 3,2,2. Max is 3, student 1.\n\nSo, for each subject, the best is the student with the highest mark. If multiple students have the same highest mark, no one is the best for that subject. Wait, no—because the problem says \"if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\" So, if a student has the highest, others can't surpass. So even if others have same, the ones with the same are not better than that student.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the definition again.\n\n\"A student is the best at a subject if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\"\n\nSo, suppose two students have the same highest mark in a subject. Then, neither is the best for that subject because there's no one with a higher mark. So in that case, no one is the best in that subject.\n\nWait, no. Let's see. Suppose for a subject, student A has 5, student B has 5. Then, neither is the best because neither has a higher mark than the other. So for that subject, no student is the best.\n\nSo, for each subject, the best is the student(s) with the maximum mark. But only if they are strictly higher than others.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as follows: for each subject, collect all the marks of the students. Find the maximum mark. Then, among all students, check if any student has exactly that maximum mark. If yes, then those students are the best for that subject. Otherwise, if all marks are same, no best.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if all students have the same mark in a subject, then no one is the best, because no one has a higher mark than another.\n\nSo, for each subject, the set of best students is the set of students who have the maximum mark for that subject, provided that the maximum is strictly greater than at least one other student's mark.\n\nWait, no. Because if the maximum is equal for all, then no one is the best.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to compute for each subject is:\n\n- For each subject, find the maximum value among all students.\n- Then, for each student, check if their mark in that subject equals the maximum. If yes, then they are the best for that subject.\n- However, if more than one student has the maximum, then none are the best because there's no student with a higher mark.\n\nWait, no. Because if two students have the same maximum, then each of them would have someone else (another student) who also has the same maximum. So, for each such student, there exists another student with the same mark, so they are not the sole maximum.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently: For a subject, the best student is the one with the highest mark. If multiple students have the same highest mark, then no one is the best in that subject.\n\nBecause according to the definition, a student is the best only if no one has a higher mark. So if two students have the same highest, then each of them doesn't satisfy the condition because the other has the same mark.\n\nSo, for a subject, if the maximum mark is achieved by exactly one student, then that student is the best in that subject. Otherwise, no student is the best in that subject.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each subject:\n\n- Find the maximum mark across all students for that subject.\n- Check if exactly one student has that mark.\n   - If yes, that student is the best for that subject.\n   - If no, no one is the best for that subject.\n\nThen, for each student, we need to track whether they are the best in any subject.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. For each student, read their m-character string, convert into a list of integers. Maybe store each student's marks as a list.\n\n3. For each of the m subjects (each position in the student's marks), determine the maximum mark across all students. Then, check if exactly one student has that maximum. If so, that student is marked as best for that subject.\n\n4. For each student, if they are the best in any subject, count them as successful.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nLet's think about data structures.\n\nWe can represent each student's marks as a list of integers. So for each student, we have a list where each element is their mark for subject 1, subject 2, etc.\n\nThen, for each subject j (from 0 to m-1):\n\n- Collect all the marks in subject j across all students.\n- Find the maximum mark in this collection.\n- Count how many students have this maximum mark.\n   - If count == 1, then that student is the best for subject j.\n   - Else, no best for subject j.\n\nSo, for each subject j, we can find the best student (if any). Then, for each student, if they are the best in any j, they are successful.\n\nBut how to track this?\n\nPerhaps, for each subject j, we can keep a dictionary mapping from student index to a boolean indicating if they are the best in j.\n\nAlternatively, for each subject j, determine the best student, and for each student, if they are the best in j, mark them as such.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to, for each subject j, find the best student (if any), and then for that student, add j to their list of best subjects.\n\nWait, but j can be up to 100, so for each student, a list of booleans indicating if they are the best in each subject.\n\nSo, for each student, we can have a variable (like a set or a list) that tells us in which subjects they are the best.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n- Read all the students' marks into a list of lists (students_marks).\n- For each subject j in 0..m-1:\n   - Collect the marks of all students in j.\n   - Find the maximum mark in this collection.\n   - Check how many students have this maximum mark.\n      - If count == 1:\n          - Find the index of the student who has this maximum.\n          - Mark that student as best in j.\n      - Else:\n          - No student is best in j.\n- After processing all subjects, for each student, check if they have any marks in their best set. If yes, count them as successful.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nNow, how to implement this in code.\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, for each of n lines, read the string and split into individual characters, then convert each to integer.\n\nstudents_marks = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students_marks.append(marks)\n\nNow, for each subject j, process:\n\nbest_in = [set() for _ in range(n)]  # Each student's set of subjects where they are best.\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    # Get all marks in j-th subject\n    marks = [students_marks[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n    max_mark = max(marks)\n    # Count how many students have max_mark\n    count = 0\n    best_student = -1\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students_marks[i][j] == max_mark:\n            count += 1\n            if count == 1:\n                best_student = i\n    if count == 1:\n        best_in[best_student].add(j)\n\nWait, no. Because for each subject j, after finding that the max is present in exactly one student, that student is added to their best_in set.\n\nBut in the code above, for j in 0 to m-1, for each j, for each i, if the mark is equal to the max, we count. Once count hits 1, we record best_student as i.\n\nBut this logic may not work if the max occurs multiple times.\n\nWait, let's think: for each j, we loop through all students, checking if their mark is equal to the current max. For each such occurrence, we increment the count. Once count exceeds 1, we can break and know that no single best student exists for j.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is:\n\nmax_mark = max(marks)\ncount = 0\nbest_student = -1\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if students_marks[i][j] == max_mark:\n        count += 1\n        if count == 1:\n            best_student = i\n        else:\n            # More than one student has max_mark, so no best\n            count = 0\n            break\n\nAfter this, if count == 1 and best_student != -1, then that student is the best in j.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nmax_mark = max(marks)\ncount = 0\nbest_student = -1\nfor i in range(n):\n    if students_marks[i][j] == max_mark:\n        count += 1\n        if count > 1:\n            count = 0\n            break\n        best_student = i\n\nif count == 1:\n    best_in[best_student].add(j)\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    marks = [students_marks[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n    max_mark = max(marks)\n    count = 0\n    best_student = -1\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students_marks[i][j] == max_mark:\n            count += 1\n            if count > 1:\n                # Multiple students have max, no best\n                count = 0\n                break\n            best_student = i\n    if count == 1 and best_student != -1:\n        best_in[best_student].add(j)\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nOnce we have this, for each student, we check if their best_in set is non-empty.\n\nsuccessful = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    if len(best_in[i]) > 0:\n        successful += 1\n\nPrint(successful)\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nWait, let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nSo, students_marks are:\n\nStudent 0: [2,2,3]\n\nStudent 1: [3,3,2]\n\nStudent 2: [1,1,2]\n\nProcessing each subject j from 0 to 2.\n\nj=0:\n\nmarks are [2,3,1]. max is 3.\n\nCheck each student:\n\ni=0: 2 !=3 → no.\n\ni=1: 3 ==3 → count becomes 1, best_student=1.\n\ni=2:1→ no.\n\ncount is 1, so best_in[1].add(0).\n\nj=1:\n\nmarks are [2,3,1]. max is 3.\n\nSame as j=0. best_student is 1.\n\nSo best_in[1].add(1).\n\nj=2:\n\nmarks are [3,2,2]. max is 3.\n\nOnly i=0 has 3. count is 1, best_student=0.\n\nSo best_in[0].add(2).\n\nNow, for each student:\n\nstudent 0: has {2} → yes.\n\nstudent 1: has {0,1} → yes.\n\nstudent 2: empty → no.\n\nSo total 2 successful.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample in the note:\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nSo, students_marks are:\n\nStudent 0: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nStudent 1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nStudent 2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nProcessing each j:\n\nj=0: all have 9, 1, 1. So max is 9. Only student 0 has it. So best_in[0].add(0).\n\nj=1: all have 1,1,1 → count is 3. So no best.\n\nj=2: student 0 has 7, student 1 has 8, others have 1. So max is 8.\n\nCheck counts: student1 has 8. Any others? No. So count is 1. So best_in[1].add(2).\n\nj=3: all have 2, 2, 1. So student 0 and 1 have 2. So count becomes 2, so no best.\n\nj=4: student0 has 8, student1 has 8. So count is 2. No best.\n\nSo for each student:\n\nstudent 0: has j=0 → yes.\n\nstudent1: has j=2 → yes.\n\nstudent2: no.\n\nSo total 2? Wait, but the note says the output is ['3', '3'].\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the second sample.\n\nWait the input is:\n\n3 5\n\n91728 → 9,1,7,2,8\n\n11828 → 1,1,8,2,8\n\n11111 → 1,1,1,1,1\n\nSo for each subject:\n\nj=0: marks are 9,1,1. Max is 9, only student 0. So best_in[0] adds j=0.\n\nj=1: all 1s. So no best.\n\nj=2: student0 has 7, student1 has 8. So max is 8, only student1. So best_in[1] adds j=2.\n\nj=3: all 2s except student2. So student0 and 1 have 2. So count is 2. So no best.\n\nj=4: student0 has 8, student1 has 8. So count is 2. No best.\n\nSo, for each student:\n\nstudent0: best in j=0 → yes.\n\nstudent1: best in j=2 → yes.\n\nstudent2: nothing → no.\n\nSo total is 2. But the sample output says 3.\n\nWait, this is conflicting. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample input.\n\nWait, the sample output is:\n\n['2', '3']\n\nWait, but according to my analysis, the output should be 2.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the sample input.\n\nWait, looking back: the sample input is written as:\n\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\nWait, wait, the first part is for the first test case, and the second part is for the second test case.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the test cases.\n\nIn the second sample, the input is:\n\n3 5\n\n91728 → '91728' is 5 characters.\n\nEach line is a string of m digits.\n\nSo, for j=0: all students' j=0 marks are 9,1,1. So best is student0.\n\nj=1: all 1s. No best.\n\nj=2: student0 has 7, student1 has 8, student2 has 1. So max is 8, only student1.\n\nj=3: student0 has 2, student1 has 2, student2 has 1. So count is 2. So no best.\n\nj=4: student0 has 8, student1 has 8. So count is 2. No best.\n\nSo, for each student:\n\nstudent0 is best in j=0.\n\nstudent1 is best in j=2.\n\nstudent2 is best nowhere.\n\nThus, total 2.\n\nBut the note says that in the second sample, each student is the best in at least one subject.\n\nHmm, this suggests that perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem statement.\n\nWait, the note says: \"In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\"\n\nBut according to my analysis, only the first two students are best in some subjects. The third is not.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in reading the input.\n\nWait, perhaps the second test case's input is different.\n\nWait, the second input is written as '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111'.\n\nSo, the three lines are:\n\n91728 → length 5: 9,1,7,2,8.\n\n11828 → 1,1,8,2,8.\n\n11111 → 1,1,1,1,1.\n\nSo, for j=0: 9,1,1 → student0 is best.\n\nj=1: 1,1,1 → no best.\n\nj=2: 7,8,1 → student1 has 8.\n\nj=3: 2,2,1 → student0 and 1 have 2. So no best.\n\nj=4: 8,8,1 → student0 and 1 have 8. So no best.\n\nSo, for each student:\n\nstudent0: best in j=0.\n\nstudent1: best in j=2.\n\nstudent2: no.\n\nSo, why does the note say each student is the best in at least one subject?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering j=3 and j=4.\n\nWait, in j=3, all students have 2 except student2. So, the max is 2. How many students have 2? Students0, 1, and 2? No, student2 has 1 in j=3.\n\nWait, for j=3:\n\nstudents_marks[i][3] for i=0: 2, i=1: 2, i=2: 1.\n\nMax is 2.\n\nHow many students have 2? Two students (0 and 1). So count is 2, so no best.\n\nSimilarly for j=4:\n\nstudents_marks[i][4]: 8,8,1.\n\nMax is 8, count is 2. So no best.\n\nSo, what about the third student? Does he have any best subject?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in j=3 and j=4.\n\nWait, in j=3, the max is 2, achieved by two students.\n\nSo, no best.\n\nSame for j=4.\n\nThus, in that case, the second sample's output is 2.\n\nBut according to the note, it's 3. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the sample input.\n\nWait, the sample input is written as:\n\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\nSo, the first test case is n=3, m=3.\n\nThe second test case is n=3, m=5, and the next three lines are:\n\n91728 → length 5.\n\n11828 → length 5.\n\n11111 → length 5.\n\nSo, perhaps for j=4, the third student has 1, others have 8 and 8.\n\nSo, the max is 8, but only student0 and 1 have it. So, count is 2. Thus, no best.\n\nSo, the third student is not the best in any subject.\n\nBut according to the note, each student is the best in at least one subject.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers a student as best in a subject if he is the best in that subject, regardless of whether others have the same maximum.\n\nNo, the problem says, a student is the best if no other student has a higher mark.\n\nSo, perhaps, if a student has the same mark as others, he is not the best in that subject.\n\nThus, the second sample's output should be 2, but according to the note, it's 3. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's note.\n\nWait, the note says: \"In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the students.\n\nWait, perhaps the second test case's input is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the second test case's students are:\n\nStudent 0: 9 1 7 2 8.\n\nStudent 1: 1 1 8 2 8.\n\nStudent 2: 1 1 1 1 1.\n\nSo, for each subject:\n\nj=0: max is 9, only student0.\n\nj=1: max is 1, but all have it. So no best.\n\nj=2: max is 8, only student1.\n\nj=3: max is 2, student0 and 1 have it. So no best.\n\nj=4: max is 8, student0 and 1 have it. So no best.\n\nThus, student2 is not the best in any subject. So the output should be 2.\n\nBut the note says 3.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps I have a bug in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem defines the best as the maximum, even if others have the same. That is, a student is the best if their mark is the highest, even if others tie.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, that's not the case.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"a student is the best at some subject if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\"\n\nSo, if a student has a mark equal to others, but no one has higher, then he is the best.\n\nWait, that's a different interpretation.\n\nAh! Oh, now I see.\n\nWait, the condition is: \"there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\"\n\nSo, if a student has the maximum mark, but others also have the same, then that student is still the best, because no one has a higher mark.\n\nWait, no, the condition is, the student is the best if no one has a higher mark.\n\nSo, for example, if two students have the same maximum, then each of them is the best in that subject, because neither has anyone with a higher mark.\n\nWait, that changes everything.\n\nOh, I see. So the initial understanding was incorrect.\n\nSo, for a subject, if the maximum mark is M, and any student has M, then each of those students is the best in that subject.\n\nBecause, for any of them, there's no student with a higher mark.\n\nSo, for example, if two students have M, then both are best in that subject.\n\nThus, for the problem, in such a case, each of these students is considered best in that subject.\n\nThis completely changes the approach.\n\nSo, in the second sample, for j=0, student0 has 9, others have 1. So student0 is the best.\n\nj=1: all have 1. So all three students are best.\n\nj=2: student0 has 7, student1 has 8. So only student1 is best.\n\nj=3: student0 and 1 have 2, student2 has 1. So both student0 and 1 are best.\n\nj=4: student0 and 1 have 8, student2 has 1. So both are best.\n\nSo, for each subject, the best students are those who have the maximum mark, regardless of whether others have the same.\n\nSo, for each subject, any student with the maximum is considered the best.\n\nThus, the initial approach was wrong.\n\nSo, how to adjust the algorithm.\n\nThe revised plan:\n\nFor each subject j:\n\n- Find the maximum mark M.\n\n- For each student, if their mark in j is equal to M, then they are the best in j.\n\nThus, for each subject j, all students with mark M are considered best.\n\nSo, for each subject j, we can collect all students who have the maximum mark, and for each such student, add j to their best_in set.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\nFor each j:\n\n   M = max of all marks in j.\n\n   for each student i:\n\n       if students_marks[i][j] == M:\n\n           add j to best_in[i]\n\nThen, for each student, if best_in[i] is non-empty, count as successful.\n\nSo, in the second sample:\n\nFor j=0:\n\nM=9. Only student0 has it. So best_in[0] = {0}.\n\nj=1:\n\nM=1. All students have it. So best_in[0], best_in[1], best_in[2] all add j=1.\n\nj=2:\n\nM=8. Only student1 has it. So best_in[1] adds j=2.\n\nj=3:\n\nM=2. Students0 and 1 have it. So best_in[0] and best_in[1] add j=3.\n\nj=4:\n\nM=8. Students0 and 1 have it. So best_in[0] and best_in[1] add j=4.\n\nSo, for each student:\n\nstudent0: j=0, j=1, j=3, j=4 → has 4, so yes.\n\nstudent1: j=1, j=2, j=3, j=4 → has 4, yes.\n\nstudent2: j=1 → has 1, yes.\n\nSo all three students are successful.\n\nWhich aligns with the note.\n\nSo, the initial approach was incorrect because it considered that only the unique maximum is the best, but according to the problem statement, all students with maximum mark in a subject are considered best.\n\nSo, the corrected approach is to, for each subject j, collect all students whose mark is the maximum in j.\n\nThus, the code needs to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nSo, the revised steps are:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Read each student's marks as a list of integers.\n\n3. For each subject j (0 to m-1):\n\n   a. Find the maximum mark M across all students for j.\n\n   b. For each student, if their j-th mark is M, add j to their best_in set.\n\n4. For each student, if their best_in set is not empty, count as successful.\n\nSo, the code will change.\n\nImplementing this:\n\nRead students_marks as before.\n\nbest_in = [set() for _ in range(n)]\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_mark = max(students_marks[i][j] for i in range(n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students_marks[i][j] == max_mark:\n            best_in[i].add(j)\n\nThen, count how many students have non-empty best_in.\n\nsuccessful = sum(1 for s in best_in if s)\n\nSo, in code:\n\nprint(successful)\n\nTesting this with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nStudents:\n\nStudent0: [2,2,3]\n\nStudent1: [3,3,2]\n\nStudent2: [1,1,2]\n\nj=0:\n\nmax is 3. Only student1 has it. So best_in[1] adds 0.\n\nj=1:\n\nmax is 3. Only student1 has it. So best_in[1] adds 1.\n\nj=2:\n\nmax is 3. Only student0 has it. So best_in[0] adds 2.\n\nSo, best_in[0] has {2}, student1 has {0,1}, student2 has empty.\n\nTotal 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nStudents:\n\nstudent0: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nstudent1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nstudent2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nFor j=0:\n\nmax is 9. Only student0. best_in[0] adds 0.\n\nj=1:\n\nmax is 1. All students have it. So best_in[0], 1, 2 add 1.\n\nj=2:\n\nmax is 8. Only student1. So best_in[1] adds 2.\n\nj=3:\n\nmax is 2. Students0 and 1 have it. So best_in[0] and 1 add 3.\n\nj=4:\n\nmax is 8. Students0 and 1 have it. So best_in[0] and 1 add 4.\n\nThus, best_in:\n\nstudent0: {0,1,3,4} → yes.\n\nstudent1: {1,2,3,4} → yes.\n\nstudent2: {1} → yes.\n\nSo all 3 are successful.\n\nThus, the output is 3 for the second sample.\n\nSo the code needs to be adjusted to this approach.\n\nTherefore, the correct code is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead each line, convert into a list of integers.\n\nInitialize best_in as a list of sets.\n\nFor each subject j:\n\n   Find the maximum mark.\n\n   For each student i:\n\n       if their mark in j is equal to max, add j to their set.\n\nCount the number of students whose set is non-empty.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents_marks = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students_marks.append(marks)\n\nbest_in = [set() for _ in range(n)]\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_mark = max(students_marks[i][j] for i in range(n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students_marks[i][j] == max_mark:\n            best_in[i].add(j)\n\nsuccessful = sum(1 for s in best_in if s)\nprint(successful)\n\nThis should handle all cases correctly.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nSample 1: returns 2.\n\nSample 2: returns 3.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nIf all students have the same marks in all subjects.\n\nE.g., n=2, m=2, both students have '22'.\n\nThen, for each subject, max is 2.\n\nBoth students are best in each subject.\n\nThus, both students are successful. So output is 2.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1. Student has mark 5.\n\nHe is best in subject 0 → output 1.\n\nAnother case: n=3, m=2.\n\nMarks:\n\n51\n\n52\n\n53\n\nj=0: max is 5. All have 5. So all students are best.\n\nj=1: max is 3. Only student2 has 3.\n\nThus, student0 and 1 are best in j=0, student2 is best in j=1.\n\nThus, all 3 are successful.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks across multiple subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best student in a subject is defined as the one who has the highest mark, and if there are multiple students with the same highest mark, each of them is considered the best.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the number of students `n` and the number of subjects `m`.\n2. **Store Marks:** For each student, read their marks for each subject and store them as a list of integers.\n3. **Determine Best Students per Subject:** For each subject, find the maximum mark. Then, identify all students who have this maximum mark for that subject. Each of these students is marked as the best in that subject.\n4. **Count Successful Students:** After processing all subjects, count how many students have at least one subject where they are the best.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents_marks = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students_marks.append(marks)\n\nbest_in = [set() for _ in range(n)]\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_mark = max(students_marks[i][j] for i in range(n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students_marks[i][j] == max_mark:\n            best_in[i].add(j)\n\nsuccessful = sum(1 for s in best_in if s)\nprint(successful)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The input is read and parsed into the number of students and subjects. Each student's marks are stored as a list of integers for easier manipulation.\n- **Finding Best Students:** For each subject, we determine the highest mark. Any student who achieves this mark is added to the set of best students for that subject.\n- **Counting Success:** After processing all subjects, each student is checked to see if they are the best in at least one subject. If so, they are counted as successful.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the number of successful students by leveraging sets to track which subjects each student excels in, providing an optimal solution to the problem.",
