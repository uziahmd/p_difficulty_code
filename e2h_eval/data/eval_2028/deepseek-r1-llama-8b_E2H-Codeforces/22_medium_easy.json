After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the question carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining how many students are considered \"successful\" based on their marks in various subjects. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher mark for that subject.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. We have n students and m subjects. For each subject, we need to find out which student has the highest mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the top in at least one subject.\n\nSo, the steps I think are:\n\n1. Read the input correctly. The first line gives n and m. Then, there are n lines, each representing a student's marks for m subjects. Each row is a string of m characters, each being 1-9.\n\n2. For each subject, determine the maximum mark across all students. Then, for each student, if in any subject their mark equals the maximum, then they are successful.\n\nWait, but for each subject, only the student(s) with the highest mark are the best. So for each subject, we can find the maximum, and then see which student(s) have that max. Then, for each student, if they are in any of these sets (for any subject), they are successful.\n\nSo, perhaps, the approach is:\n\n- For each of the m subjects, find the maximum mark.\n- For each subject, note which students have that maximum mark.\n- For each student, count how many subjects they are the best in (i.e., how many times their name appears in any of the subject's best lists).\n\nIf a student has at least one such occurrence, they are successful.\n\nBut wait, more efficiently, maybe for each subject, we can just track the maximum and which students have it. Then, for each student, check if they are the best in at least one subject.\n\nHow to structure this?\n\nLet me think in terms of data structures.\n\nWe can represent each student's marks as a list of integers or strings. But since the input is a string per student, perhaps easier to process as a list of strings, then for each character in the string, convert to int.\n\nThen, for each subject index j (from 0 to m-1), we can iterate through all students, find the maximum mark in that column, and collect all students who have that mark.\n\nAlternatively, for each subject j:\n\n- Iterate through all students' j-th mark.\n- Find the maximum value among them.\n- Then, for each student, if their j-th mark equals the maximum, add them to a set for subject j.\n\nOnce all subjects are processed, for each student, check if they are present in any of the subject sets. If yes, count them as successful.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Read the next n lines, each line is a string of length m. Convert each character to an integer, and store each student's marks as a list of integers. Maybe store them as a list of lists: students = [[mark1, mark2, ...], [mark1, mark2, ...], ...]\n\n3. For each subject j (from 0 to m-1):\n   a. Collect all the j-th marks from each student.\n   b. Find the maximum mark in this collection.\n   c. Create a set of student indices (or student objects) who have this maximum in subject j.\n\n4. For each student, check if they are present in any of the subject sets. If yes, increment the count.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nLet's think about the data structures.\n\nWe'll have a list called students, where each element is a list of integers representing the marks for each subject.\n\nFor each subject j:\n   - create a list of tuples (student_index, mark) for that subject.\n   - find the maximum mark.\n   - collect all student indices where their mark == max_mark.\n   - store this as a set in a dictionary, where the key is j, and the value is the set of student indices.\n\nAlternatively, for each j, store a set of student indices that are the best in subject j.\n\nOnce all subjects are processed, for each student, check if they are in any of the sets for any j.\n\nYes, that's manageable.\n\nSo, step by step code outline:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen, read n lines. For each line, process each character into an integer list.\n\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nThen, for each subject j in 0..m-1:\n\nmax_marks = [0]*m\nbest_students = [[] for _ in range(m)]\n\nWait, perhaps better to precompute for each j:\n\nbest_in_subj = [set() for _ in range(m)]\nfor j in range(m):\n    current_max = -1\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > current_max:\n            current_max = students[i][j]\n    # Now, find all students with current_max in subject j\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] == current_max:\n            best_in_subj[j].add(i)\n\nWait, but in Python, for each j, we can loop through all students, find the max, then collect all students with that mark.\n\nOnce all j are processed, then for each student i, check if i is in any of best_in_subj[j].\n\nSo, the number of successful students is the count of students i where len([j for j in range(m) if i in best_in_subj[j]]) >= 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nbest_in_subj = [set() for _ in range(m)]\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_mark = -1\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > max_mark:\n            max_mark = students[i][j]\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] == max_mark:\n            best_in_subj[j].add(i)\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    if i in best_in_subj[0]:\n        count +=1\n    # Alternatively, check all subjects\n    found = False\n    for j in range(m):\n        if i in best_in_subj[j]:\n            found = True\n            break\n    if found:\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but this might be inefficient. Because for each i, checking all j to see if i is in best_in_subj[j]. But n is up to 100, m up to 100, so 100*100=10^4 operations—manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, create a flag whether any of the j have i in their set.\n\nBut the code above should work.\n\nWait, let's test it against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nSo, students are:\n\nStudent 0: [2,2,3]\n\nStudent 1: [3,2,3]\n\nStudent 2: [1,1,2]\n\nProcessing each subject:\n\nSubject 0 (index 0):\n\nmarks are 2,3,1. Max is 3. So only student 1 is in best_in_subj[0].\n\nSubject 1 (index 1):\n\nmarks are 2,2,1. Max is 2. So students 0 and 1 are in best_in_subj[1].\n\nSubject 2 (index 2):\n\nmarks are 3,3,2. Max is 3. So students 0 and 1 are in best_in_subj[2].\n\nSo, for each student:\n\nStudent 0: in subject 0 and 2 → yes.\n\nStudent 1: in subject 0, 1, 2 → yes.\n\nStudent 2: not in any → no.\n\nSo total 2, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nSecond input:\n\n3 5\n\n91728 → student 0: 9,1,7,2,8\n\n11828 → student 1: 1,1,8,2,8\n\n11111 → student 2: 1,1,1,1,1\n\nFor each subject:\n\nSubject 0: 9,1,1 → max 9. Only student 0.\n\nSubject 1: 1,1,1 → max 1. All three.\n\nSubject 2: 7,8,1 → max 8. Student 1.\n\nSubject 3: 2,2,1 → max 2. Students 0 and 1.\n\nSubject 4: 8,8,1 → max 8. Students 0 and 1.\n\nSo for each subject:\n\nsubject 0: {0}\n\nsubject 1: {0,1,2}\n\nsubject 2: {1}\n\nsubject3: {0,1}\n\nsubject4: {0,1}\n\nSo for each student:\n\nStudent 0: in subjects 0,1,3,4 → yes.\n\nStudent1: in subjects 0? No, wait no, in subject0 he has 1, which is less than 9. Wait no, subject0 has student0 as 9, which is max. So student1 is not in subject0.\n\nWait, wait, in the second sample input, the output is 3, meaning each student is successful.\n\nWait, let me re-examine.\n\nWait, what's the sample input:\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nSo, student0 has 9,1,7,2,8.\n\nStudent1 has 1,1,8,2,8.\n\nStudent2 has 1,1,1,1,1.\n\nNow, for each subject:\n\nSubject0: j=0, all marks are 9,1,1. Max is 9, so only student0.\n\nSubject1: j=1, all marks are 1,1,1. So all three are in the set.\n\nSubject2: j=2, marks are 7,8,1. Max is 8, so only student1.\n\nSubject3: j=3, marks are 2,2,1. Max is 2, so students0 and 1.\n\nSubject4: j=4, marks are 8,8,1. Max is 8, so students0 and 1.\n\nSo, for each student:\n\nStudent0: in subject0, subject3, subject4 → yes.\n\nStudent1: in subject1, subject2, subject3, subject4 → yes.\n\nStudent2: in subject1 → yes.\n\nSo all three are successful. Hence output is 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nWhat if m=1, n=1. Then, the student is the best in that subject, so output is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1.\n\nMarks: '9' and '9'. Then both are best in subject 0. So both are successful. Output 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2.\n\nMarks:\n\n99\n\n11\n\nThen, for subject0: max is 9, only student0.\n\nSubject1: max is 1, both have 1. So both are in subject1.\n\nThus, student0 is best in subject0, student1 is best in subject1 → both are successful. Output 2.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=5. Then, the student is best in all 5 subjects. So output is 1.\n\nAnother case: when no student is the best in any subject. Wait, but that's impossible because for each subject, someone is the best. So each subject will have at least one student. So in that case, all students may not be in any best sets, but that's not possible. Wait, no. Because for each subject, someone is the best, but a particular student may not be the best in any subject.\n\nLike, n=2, m=2.\n\nMarks:\n\n22\n\n11\n\nThen, subject0: 2,1 → student0 is best.\n\nSubject1: 2,1 → student0 is best.\n\nSo student0 is best in both, so output is 1.\n\nBut what if all students have same marks in all subjects? Like, n=3, m=2.\n\nAll marks are 55, 55, 55.\n\nThen, for each subject, all students are best. So each student is best in both subjects, so all 3 are successful.\n\nSo the code needs to handle all these cases.\n\nIn the code, for each subject j, the set best_in_subj[j] contains all students who have the maximum mark for that j.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nSo, now, implementing the code.\n\nNow, the code must read the input correctly. The first line is two integers, n and m. Then, n lines follow, each is a string of m characters, each character is 1-9.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the first input line is ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111'], but in reality, in code submission, the input is read via stdin, so perhaps the code is given as a list of strings. But in actual code, it's read as follows:\n\nWait, no, in the problem statement, the input is given as a single block, but the user input is via standard input. So, for example, in Python, the code would read the first line as n and m, then read n lines, each of which is a string.\n\nBut in the sample input, the way it's presented is as a list of two elements: the first is the entire input for the first test case, and the second is the entire input for the second test case.\n\nWait, but in practice, when you run the program, the input is read as:\n\nFirst line: '3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112'\n\nSecond line: '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111'\n\nBut in the code, the first line is read as n and m, then the next n lines are read as the students' marks.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nstudents = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    line = input().strip()\n\n    # each line is a string of m characters, e.g., '223' is 3 characters.\n\n    marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n\n    students.append(marks)\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n\nTesting the code with the samples should give the right outputs.\n\nNow, write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks across multiple subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject is defined as having the highest mark for that subject compared to all other students.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m). Then, read the marks for each student across the m subjects.\n2. **Identify Best Students per Subject**: For each subject, determine the maximum mark achieved by any student. Collect all students who achieved this maximum mark in that subject.\n3. **Count Successful Students**: For each student, check if they are among the best students for any subject. If they are, count them as successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nbest_in_subj = [set() for _ in range(m)]\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_mark = -1\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > max_mark:\n            max_mark = students[i][j]\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] == max_mark:\n            best_in_subj[j].add(i)\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if i in best_in_subj[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line contains n and m. The subsequent lines contain the marks for each student across m subjects.\n2. **Processing Each Subject**: For each subject, we determine the highest mark achieved by any student. We then identify all students who achieved this highest mark for that subject.\n3. **Checking Success**: For each student, we check if they are among the best students for any subject. If they are, they are counted as successful.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine which students are successful by leveraging sets to track top performers in each subject, making the solution both clear and efficient.",
