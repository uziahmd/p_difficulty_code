For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of ways to choose c_s for each binary string s of length from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. Hmm, that's a bit abstract. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a beautiful multiset is. For every binary string s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. So, for example, if s is \"0\", any string in the multiset that starts with \"0\" (like \"00\", \"01\", etc.) contributes to this count.\n\nOur goal is to count all possible assignments of c_s values such that the largest possible beautiful multiset has size exactly f. So, for each assignment, we compute the maximum size achievable and check if it's equal to f.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? It seems like a dynamic programming problem where we track certain constraints based on the c_s choices.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. Each string s has a constraint: the number of its extensions in the multiset (including itself) can't exceed c_s. But since the multiset includes all possible extensions, maybe we can model the problem by considering the counts of certain prefixes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem in terms of the number of times each prefix appears. Because for each s, the count of strings that have s as a prefix is equal to the sum of the counts of all its suffixes. Or wait, no—wait, no, for a given s, the count is the number of strings t in the multiset such that s is a prefix of t. So for s, the count is the sum of the counts of all t where s is a prefix of t.\n\nWait, but the count for s is the number of t in the multiset where s is a prefix of t. So for s, the number of such t is the sum over all t' that are extensions of s, including s itself.\n\nHmm, but perhaps we can model this using a trie-like structure, where each node represents a prefix, and the value at each node is the count of strings that have that prefix.\n\nBut how does this relate to the c_s constraints? For each s, the sum of the counts of all its descendants (including itself) must be <= c_s. Wait, no: because each t that is an extension of s contributes to the count for s. So for s, the total number of t's that have s as a prefix is the sum of the counts of all t's that are s followed by any possible suffix.\n\nSo, the problem can be seen as building a trie where each node (representing a prefix) has a count, and for each node, the sum of the counts of all its children (including itself) must be <= c_s.\n\nBut how do we model the maximum possible size of the multiset? The maximum size is determined by choosing the c_s's such that the constraints are satisfied, and then the sum of all the counts is as large as possible.\n\nWait, no. The maximum size is the sum of all the counts in the trie, which is the total number of strings in the multiset. So, for each assignment of c_s's, the maximum size is the sum of all counts, subject to the constraints that for each s, the sum of the counts of all its descendants (including itself) is <= c_s.\n\nSo, our problem reduces to finding the number of c_s assignments such that the maximum possible sum is exactly f.\n\nHmm, but how?\n\nMaybe we can model this as a problem where each c_s must be at least the sum of the counts of all its immediate children. Because the sum of the counts of s's descendants (children and their children, etc.) is the same as the sum of all the counts of the nodes that are in the subtree rooted at s.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it in terms of the Möbius function or inclusion-exclusion. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a way to represent the constraints in a way that allows us to compute the required sum.\n\nLet me think differently. The maximum possible size is the sum of all counts, which is the total number of strings in the multiset. Let's denote this sum as S. We need to find the number of c assignments where S = f.\n\nEach c_s must be >= the number of descendants of s (including s itself). So, for each s, c_s >= the number of its extensions in the multiset. But how does this affect the maximum possible S?\n\nWait, the maximum possible S is the sum of all c_s, but each c_s must be at least the number of its descendants. Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe it's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum S is determined",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to assign values to each binary string such that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly `f`.
