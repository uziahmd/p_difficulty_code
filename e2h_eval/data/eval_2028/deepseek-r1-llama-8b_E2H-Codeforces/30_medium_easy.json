    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"TV Game,\" and from the description, I need to find a sequence of moves for Homer and Marge that maximizes their total prize. \n\nHmm, the game works like this: both players take turns taking the leftmost digit of a number A, which has 2n digits. Each player makes exactly n moves. So, for each move, the current player takes the first digit and appends it to their number. Then that digit is removed from A. The goal is to determine the order of moves (Homer as 'H' or 'M') such that when all moves are done, the sum of S1 and S2 is as large as possible.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no—what's the goal? Oh, right, each player gets S1 and S2 respectively, which are their numbers built from the digits they collect. The prize is their respective numbers, but the problem statement says the output is the sequence of moves, not the actual numbers. But our objective is to maximize the sum of S1 and S2, which is equivalent to maximizing each player's own value because adding them together would require both to be as large as possible.\n\nSo, how do we approach this? Let me think.\n\nThe key here is to decide at each step whether the current digit should be taken by H or M in such a way that the overall sum is maximized. Since each digit contributes to either H or M's number, and the order of taking affects the positions (like being higher digits or lower), we need to assign each digit to the best possible player.\n\nBut wait, the order in which they pick also affects the available digits later. So, it's a dynamic decision-making process where each choice affects future options.\n\nI remember that for problems where you have to split a string into two parts to maximize some function, a greedy approach might work if you can find a way to make optimal choices step by step.\n\nIn this case, each digit's contribution to the total is the digit itself multiplied by 10 raised to the position it's placed in their respective numbers. For example, if a digit is added as the third move to H's number, it's worth 100 * digit. Similarly for M.\n\nSo, the problem is similar to partitioning the digits into two sequences, each of length n, such that the sum of all digits multiplied by their respective place values is maximized.\n\nWait, but each digit is part of one of the sequences, so we need to assign each digit to either H or M in such a way that the total is maximized.\n\nLet me think about the place value. Suppose the first digit taken is assigned to H. That digit will be the first digit of H's number, contributing 10^(n-1) * digit. If instead, it's assigned to M, then it's the first digit of M's number, contributing 10^(n-1) * digit. So, for the first move, it doesn't matter which player takes it because both will have the same multiplier.\n\nBut for the next digit, the multiplier depends on whether it's the second move (so for H, it's 10^(n-2), and for M, it's also 10^(n-2)). Wait, no—because the order of taking affects the position in their respective numbers. So, the earlier a digit is taken, the higher its place value.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model each digit's contribution based on when it's taken. Like, the first digit taken by any player is the highest place in their number. So, the first move (whether H or M) adds a digit to their number as the first digit, then the next move adds as the second, etc., until the nth move, which is the last digit.\n\nSo, each digit's place value is determined by the turn it's taken in. For example, the first digit taken by any player is multiplied by 10^(n-1), the second by 10^(n-2), down to 10^0.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to selecting for each digit whether it should be taken on an even or odd turn (since H and M alternate). Wait, no. Because the order in which the digits are taken matters in terms of their place in the respective numbers.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because the digits are processed in the order they appear in A. So, the first digit is the leftmost of A. Then the second is the new leftmost after removing the first, and so on.\n\nSo, each time a player takes a digit, it's the next available leftmost digit of A. So, the sequence of digits is fixed, but the assignment of which player takes which digit determines their place in their respective numbers.\n\nSo, the problem is to assign each digit to a player, ensuring that each player takes exactly n digits, and that the assignment is done in the order of the digits as they appear in A.\n\nThus, the challenge is to choose for each digit (in the order they come) whether to assign it to the current player (which alternates) or swap the assignment if it leads to a higher total.\n\nWait, but the players take turns. So, the first digit must be taken by the first player (say, H), then the second by M, the third by H, and so on. Or maybe not—maybe the initial assignment can be either H or M. No, because the problem says before each turn, they determine who makes the next move. So, perhaps the initial decision is made on who starts, but in the problem statement, it's implied that both players make exactly n moves. So, the order of taking is determined by the initial decision of who starts.\n\nWait, no. The problem says each player makes exactly n moves. So, the total number of moves is 2n, with each player making n. So, the initial player is either H or M, and they alternate. So, the order is H, M, H, M, etc., if H starts, or M, H, M, H, etc., if M starts.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the output is 'HHMM' and 'HMHM'. Let's see:\n\nSample Input:\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\nSample Output:\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nWait, the output is a string of H's and M's, indicating the sequence of moves. So, for the first example, the sequence is H, H, M, M. So, the first two moves are H, third is M, fourth is M. Wait, but that's four moves for n=2.\n\nWait, n is 2, so each player has two moves. So, in the first example, the first four digits are 1, 2, 3, 4. The sequence is H, H, M, M. So, the first two digits go to H, the third and fourth to M.\n\nSo, H takes 1 and 2, M takes 3 and 4. H's number is 12, M's is 34, sum is 46.\n\nAlternatively, if H started first, then the sequence would have to be H, M, H, M. So, in that case, H takes 1 and 3, M takes 2 and 4. H's number is 13, M's is 24. Sum is 37, which is worse.\n\nSo, in the sample, assigning the first two digits to H gives a better sum than switching.\n\nSo, the idea is that for each digit, depending on whether it's taken by H or M, it contributes more to the total. So, perhaps for each digit, we want to assign it to the player whose turn it is, but sometimes swapping may be beneficial.\n\nWait, but how? Because each player takes exactly n digits, and the order is fixed. So, perhaps we can model this as a dynamic programming problem, where for each position in the digit string and for each possible state of how many digits each player has taken, we track the maximum possible sum.\n\nThat sounds plausible. Let's think about the state variables.\n\nThe state could be represented by the current index in the digit string, and the count of digits taken by H and M. For example, dp[i][h][m] represents the maximum sum achievable after processing the first i digits, with h digits taken by H and m by M.\n\nWait, but since each player must take exactly n digits, the transitions would need to ensure that h <=n and m <=n, and that h + m = i (since each step takes one digit).\n\nWait, but the number of digits is 2n, so i can range from 0 to 2n-1. For each i, h ranges from 0 to min(n, i+1), and similarly for m.\n\nWait, but m is equal to i - h, because each step adds one digit. So, perhaps we can simplify the state to dp[i][h], representing the maximum sum up to the i-th digit, with h digits taken by H.\n\nBecause m would be i - h.\n\nBut let's formalize this.\n\nAt each step, when processing the (i+1)-th digit, we have two choices: assign it to H or M, provided that H hasn't taken n digits yet, or M hasn't taken n.\n\nWait, but the assignment is constrained by the turn order. So, the first digit can only be assigned to H if H is the first player, but wait—the problem says that the players can choose who goes first. Oh wait, no! The problem says that before each turn, the players determine who will make the next move. So, perhaps the initial choice is up to us—whether H or M starts.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says each player makes exactly n moves, so the order must be such that each gets n moves. So, if the total number of digits is 2n, then the order must be like H, M, H, M, ..., for 2n steps, but the starting player can be either H or M.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the output is HHMM, meaning H starts and then H again? That can't be, because each player must make exactly n moves. Wait, wait, no. Wait, in the sample output, the first four characters are H, H, M, M. So, the first two moves are H, then M, then H, then M. Wait, but that's four moves, n=2. So, each player has two moves.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the output is 'HHMM' which is four characters, implying four moves. So, the first two moves are H, the next two are M. So, H has two moves, M has two. So, H starts, then M, then H, then M? No, wait, that's four moves, but the order would be H, M, H, M for four moves. But the output is HHMM, which is H, H, M, M. So, that suggests that the first two moves are by H, but that's not possible because each player can only make n moves. So, perhaps the initial choice is not fixed. Maybe the first player can be H or M, depending on what's optimal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem Statement:\n\nEach player should make exactly n moves. Before each turn, players determine who will make the next move. So, the sequence of turns is determined by the players themselves. So, the initial player can be either H or M. But each must make exactly n moves. So, the total number of moves is 2n, each player makes n.\n\nSo, for example, if H starts, the order is H, M, H, M, ... until 2n moves. But if M starts, the order is M, H, M, H, etc.\n\nAh, that's a crucial point. So, the initial choice is ours: whether H or M starts. So, for each scenario (H starts or M starts), we compute the maximum sum and choose the one that's better.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. For each possible starting player (H or M), simulate the selection of digits and calculate the total sum.\n2. Choose the starting option (H or M) that gives the higher sum.\n3. Among all possible options, if multiple starting players lead to the same maximum sum, choose either.\n\nSo, the plan is to try both possibilities (H starts and M starts) and select the best.\n\nNow, the next question is: given the starting player, how do we decide for each digit whether to assign it to the current player or switch, to maximize the sum.\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem.\n\nLet me think about the state representation.\n\nSuppose we have a function f(pos, h, m), where pos is the current position in the digit string (0-based), h is the number of digits taken by H, and m is the number taken by M. The function returns the maximum sum achievable from this state.\n\nBut since m = pos - h (since each step takes one digit), we can represent the state as f(pos, h), where m = pos - h.\n\nThe transition would be:\n\nFor the current digit, which is s[pos], we can assign it to H or to M, but only if the assignments are allowed (h < n for H, m < n for M).\n\nIf we assign it to H:\n\nnew_h = h + 1\nsum += s[pos] * 10^{n - new_h} \n\nThen, proceed to pos+1.\n\nSimilarly for M.\n\nBut wait, the multiplier for the digit depends on the position it's assigned to in the player's number.\n\nWait, no. Because the digit is being taken in the order of the string, and each player's number is built by appending the digits in the order they are taken. So, for H, the first digit he takes is the first digit of his number, which is the most significant. The second digit he takes becomes the second digit, less significant, etc.\n\nSo, the multiplier for a digit taken as the k-th digit by H is 10^{n -k}, because H's number has n digits.\n\nWait, let's say n is 2. Then:\n\n- First digit taken by H: 10^1 place.\n- Second digit taken by H: 10^0 place.\n\nSimilarly for M.\n\nSo, the multiplier depends on the order in which each player takes their digits. The earlier a digit is taken, the higher the multiplier.\n\nBut since the digits are processed in the order they appear in A, the first digit is taken by the first player, the second by the second player, etc.\n\nWait, no. Because the players can choose who goes next. So, the order of taking the digits isn't strictly the order of the string. It's determined by the players' decisions.\n\nWait, no. Because the string is processed in the order of the digits as they are in A. So, the first digit is always the first character of A, the second is the second character, etc., regardless of which player takes which.\n\nSo, the sequence of digits to assign is fixed as the order of the string. But the assignment to H or M depends on the turn order, which is determined by the initial choice of who starts.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Starting player (H or M) is chosen.\n- The first digit is taken by the starting player.\n- The next digit is taken by the other player.\n- This alternates until all digits are assigned.\n\nSo, the order in which digits are assigned is determined by the initial starting player.\n\nOnce the starting player is chosen, the assignment of each digit is fixed: the first digit to start player, second to the other, third to start, and so on.\n\nSo, for each starting player, the assignment of digits is fixed. Therefore, for each starting player, the order of assignment is determined.\n\nSo, for each starting player, the digits are assigned in a specific order, and each player takes n digits.\n\nSo, for each starting player, we can simulate the assignment and compute the sum.\n\nBut how do we decide which starting player is better?\n\nWell, perhaps trying both and choosing the better sum is the way to go.\n\nBut the problem is that for each starting player, the assignment is fixed. So, the sum can be computed directly once the assignment is known.\n\nWait, but the problem allows the players to choose the order of moves, but according to the rules, the order of moves is determined by the starting player and the alternation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"Before each turn players determine who will make the next move.\"\n\nSo, the players can choose who goes next. So, the initial choice is up to them, but each must make exactly n moves.\n\nSo, the order of moves can be anything as long as each player makes exactly n moves. For example, H, M, H, M, ... is one possibility, but M, H, M, H, ... is another, and perhaps other orders like H, H, M, M, etc., but that would require that the players change their turn order, which may not be allowed if the players can only choose the next player each time.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that before each turn, the players determine who will make the next move. So, in theory, the order can vary as long as each makes exactly n moves. For example, H, H, M, M, but that would require that the first player makes two moves in a row. Is that allowed?\n\nYes, because the problem doesn't specify that the players must alternate turns. They can choose who goes next each time, as long as each ends up with n moves.\n\nSo, this complicates things because the assignment of digits isn't just a fixed order determined by the starting player. Instead, the players can arrange the order of moves in any way, as long as each makes exactly n moves.\n\nSo, the problem is to choose a sequence of 2n moves, consisting of H and M, each appearing exactly n times, such that the sum of S1 and S2 is maximized.\n\nNow, that's a different problem. So, the initial approach of trying both starting players is insufficient because the order can be arbitrary, as long as each player has n moves.\n\nThis changes everything. Now, the problem is to find a permutation of the 2n digits, split into two groups of n digits each, such that the sum of their values (each digit multiplied by 10^position_in_group) is maximized.\n\nWait, but the order of the digits in A is fixed. So, the digits are taken in the order they appear in A, but the assignment to H and M is flexible, as long as each gets n digits.\n\nNo, wait. Because the digits are taken from the front of A each time. So, the first digit is the first character of A, the second digit is the second character, etc. So, the order of taking is fixed as per the original string. The only thing that varies is which player takes which digit.\n\nAh, yes! Because each time a player takes a digit, it's the leftmost remaining digit of A. So, the order of taking is the same as the order of the string. The only decision is which player takes which digit.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to assigning each digit to either H or M, such that exactly n digits are assigned to each, and the sum of the values is maximized.\n\nEach digit's contribution depends on when it's assigned to a player and where in their number it appears.\n\nSo, the first digit can be assigned to H or M. The second digit can be assigned to the other player, or perhaps the same if the starting player is the same.\n\nWait, no. Because the players can choose who goes next. So, the first digit is taken by the starting player. The second digit is taken by whoever is chosen next. And so on.\n\nBut the assignment of each digit to a player is in the order of the string. So, the first digit is taken by the starting player, the second by whoever is next, etc.\n\nBut the problem allows the players to choose the next player each time, so the order in which the digits are assigned can be arbitrary as long as each player ends up with exactly n digits.\n\nWait, no. Because the order of taking the digits is fixed as per A's string. For example, the first digit is the first character of A, the second is the second character, and so on.\n\nSo, the assignment of which player takes which digit must be such that for each digit in A, it is assigned to exactly one player, and the players can choose the order of taking the digits, but the digits are processed in the order of A.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nThe players take turns taking the leftmost digit of A. So, the order in which the digits are taken is fixed: the first digit is taken first, then the second, then third, etc. Each time a digit is taken, it's removed from A, leaving the remaining digits in order.\n\nSo, the order of taking is fixed as the order of the string. The only decision is which player takes which digit. So, for each digit in the string, it's assigned to either H or M, and each player must end up with exactly n digits.\n\nSo, the problem is to partition the string into two subsets of size n each, such that the sum of the two numbers formed by these subsets is maximized.\n\nEach subset forms a number, where the order of digits is the same as their order in the original string. So, the first digit in H's subset is the first digit assigned to H, and so on.\n\nSo, the problem now is to find a partition of the digits into two groups, each of size n, such that the sum of the two numbers is as large as possible.\n\nEach digit's contribution is determined by its position in the group. For example, the first digit in H's group contributes 10^(n-1) * d, the second contributes 10^(n-2)*d, and so on.\n\nSo, the task is to choose which n digits (from the 2n) to assign to H and M, such that the sum of their contributions is maximized.\n\nBut how to model this? It's a partition problem with the constraint that each group has exactly n elements.\n\nThis seems similar to the knapsack problem. But the twist here is that each item (digit) has a weight (its position in the group) that depends on where it's placed in the group.\n\nSo, for each digit, the contribution depends on whether it's placed in the first position of H's group, second, etc.\n\nBut considering all possible permutations is computationally infeasible for n=18, as 2n=36, and the number of ways to partition is (36 choose 18), which is about 9e10, way too big.\n\nWe need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the optimal solution.\n\nEach digit contributes more if it is placed in a higher position (earlier in the group). So, for each digit, we want to assign it to a position in H or M's group where it can have the highest possible multiplier.\n\nBut since the group sizes are fixed (n for each), the problem is to arrange the digits in such a way that the higher digits are placed as early as possible in their respective groups.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that each digit can be assigned to either H or M, but the order in which they are taken from A is fixed.\n\nWait, no. The order in which the digits are taken is fixed as per the string. So, the first digit is taken first, then the second, etc. So, the assignment of which player takes which digit must be done in the order of the string.\n\nWait, but the players can choose which player takes which digit. So, the assignment is not necessarily in the order of the string. For example, the first digit is taken by H, the second by M, the third by H, and so on. Or perhaps, the first digit is taken by M, then H, etc.\n\nWait, no. Because the order of taking the digits is determined by the string. So, the first digit is the first character of A, the second is the second character, etc. The players can choose who takes which digit, but the digits are processed in the order of the string. So, the first digit is considered for assignment, then the second, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach was correct. Let's model this as a dynamic programming problem where, for each digit, we decide whether to assign it to H or M, keeping track of how many digits each has taken so far.\n\nBut for n=18, 2n=36, the DP state needs to handle up to h=18 and m=18.\n\nSo, the DP state can be represented as dp[i][h][m], where i is the current digit being processed, h is the number of digits assigned to H, and m is the number assigned to M. The value is the maximum sum achievable up to this point.\n\nBut since for each step, m = i - h, because each digit is assigned to either H or M, and each step processes one digit. So, m = i - h.\n\nSo, the state can be simplified to dp[i][h], where m = i - h.\n\nThe base case is dp[0][0] = 0.\n\nFor each state (i, h), we can consider assigning the current digit to H or to M, provided that h+1 <=n and m+1 = (i+1)-(h+1) = (i -h) +1 <=n.\n\nWait, because after assigning to H, h becomes h+1, and m becomes (i+1) - (h+1) = (i -h) +1 -1 = i -h. So, m remains i -h.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nWhen i increases by 1, for each possible h, we can assign the new digit to H or M.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to process each digit in order, and for each possible h (number of digits assigned to H so far), and track the maximum sum.\n\nSo, for each digit s[i], and for each possible h (number of H's digits taken so far, up to i), and m = i -h, we can compute the maximum sum.\n\nAt each step, the current digit can be assigned to H or M, provided that h < n and m < n.\n\nWait, no. Because for each digit, assigning to H would increase h by 1, but m would remain the same. But m is equal to the number of digits assigned to M, which is i -h after the assignment.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model it as:\n\nFor each digit s[i], and for each possible h (number of H's digits taken so far, from 0 to min(i, n)), we can decide to assign s[i] to H or M.\n\nIf we assign to H, then h_new = h + 1, and m_new = (i+1) - h_new. We need m_new <=n.\n\nSimilarly for M.\n\nSo, the recurrence would be:\n\ndp[i+1][h+1] = max(dp[i+1][h+1], dp[i][h] + (s[i] * 10^(n - (h+1))) )\n\nand\n\ndp[i+1][h] = max(dp[i+1][h], dp[i][h] + (s[i] * 10^(n - (m+1)) ), where m = i -h )\n\nWait, because when we assign to M, the digit is added to M's number, which has m+1 digits so far. Wait, no. Because m is the number of digits M has taken so far. So, when we assign the current digit to M, m becomes m+1, and the position in M's number is m+1. So, the multiplier is 10^(n - (m+1)).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWhen we assign the current digit to H, H has h+1 digits so far. So, the digit is the (h+1)-th digit in H's number, which contributes 10^(n - (h+1)) * digit.\n\nSimilarly, if we assign to M, M has m+1 digits (since m = i - h before assignment, and m+1 = (i -h) + 1 = (i+1 - (h+1)) ), so the digit is the (m+1)-th digit in M's number, contributing 10^(n - (m+1)) * digit.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as follows:\n\nFor each position i in the string, and for each possible h (number of H's digits taken up to i), the current digit can be assigned to H or M.\n\nIf assigned to H:\n\n- h increases by 1 → new_h = h +1\n- The position in H's number is new_h, so the multiplier is 10^(n - new_h)\n- So, the contribution is s[i] * 10^{n - (h+1)}}\n\nIf assigned to M:\n\n- m is i - h → new_m = m +1 = (i -h) +1\n- The position in M's number is new_m → multiplier is 10^{n - new_m}\n- Contribution is s[i] * 10^{n - (new_m)} }\n\nBut wait, new_m = (i -h) +1 = i -h +1 = (i+1) - (h+1) = (i+1) - new_h.\n\nSo, the multipliers are 10^{n - new_h} for H and 10^{n - new_m} for M, which is the same as 10^{n - ((i+1) - new_h)}.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to compute the multiplier for each case.\n\nSo, for each step, when processing the i-th digit (0-based?), the current state is (i, h), and the next state is (i+1, new_h) if assigned to H, or (i+1, h) if assigned to M.\n\nWait, no. Because when assigned to M, the number of H's digits remains h, and the number of M's digits increases by 1.\n\nSo, the DP transition would be:\n\nFor each state (i, h):\n\nOption 1: Assign to H.\n\nnew_h = h +1\nif new_h > n → invalid\nmultiplier = 10 ** (n - new_h)\nsum += s[i] * multiplier\ndp[i+1][new_h] = max( dp[i+1][new_h], current_sum + multiplier )\n\nOption 2: Assign to M.\n\nnew_m = m = (i - h) +1\nif new_m > n → invalid\nmultiplier = 10 ** (n - new_m)\nsum += s[i] * multiplier\ndp[i+1][h] = max( dp[i+1][h], current_sum + multiplier )\n\nWait, but i is 0-based. So, when i=0, it's the first digit. So, when assigning to H, new_h=1, and the multiplier is 10^{n-1}.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the initial state is dp[0][0] = 0.\n\nAfter processing all 2n digits, the maximum sum is the maximum between dp[2n][n][n], but since m = 2n - h, and m must be n, so h must be n as well.\n\nSo, the final state is h =n, m =n.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute this DP.\n\nBut for n=18, 2n=36, so the DP table has 36+1=37 positions, and h can be up to 18.\n\nSo, the DP has 37 x 19 = 703 states. For each state, there are up to 2 transitions (assign to H or M, if possible).\n\nThis is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the exponents 10^k for k from 0 to n.\n\n2. Initialize a 2D array dp where dp[i][h] represents the maximum sum up to the i-th digit, with h digits assigned to H.\n\n3. For each digit s[i], iterate through all possible h in 0..min(i, n).\n\n4. For each h, compute the two possible transitions: assign to H or M.\n\n5. Update the dp table accordingly.\n\n6. After processing all digits, find the maximum sum and determine the path (assignment sequence) that led to it.\n\nWait, but we also need to track the assignment sequence, not just the sum.\n\nSo, the DP needs to track not only the maximum sum but also the sequence of assignments that achieved it.\n\nSo, for each state, we'll store the best sum and the corresponding assignment path.\n\nThis complicates things, but it's necessary to reconstruct the sequence.\n\nSo, the state will include the maximum sum and the path (a list of 'H' or 'M' indicating which player took which digit).\n\nBut for n=18, 2n=36, and each state can have a path of up to 36 steps, storing all possible paths is memory-intensive.\n\nAlternative approach: for each state, store the maximum sum and the best path. When multiple paths yield the same sum, choose the lexicographically smallest or any.\n\nSo, during the DP, for each state, we keep track of the maximum sum and the corresponding assignment sequence.\n\nThis way, when we reach the final state, we can output the sequence.\n\nBut implementing this requires careful handling of the DP transitions.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Convert the input string A into a list of integers, each representing a digit.\n\n- Precompute 10^k for k from 0 to n.\n\n- Initialize a DP table where each entry is a tuple (max_sum, path), where path is a list of 'H' or 'M'.\n\n- Start with dp[0][0] = (0, []).\n\n- For each i from 0 to len(A)-1:\n\n   For each h in 0 to min(i, n):\n\n      current_sum, current_path = dp[i][h]\n\n      if current_sum is None:\n          continue\n\n      // Option 1: assign to H\n      new_h = h + 1\n      if new_h > n:\n          continue\n      multiplier = 10 ** (n - new_h)\n      new_digit = A[i]\n      new_sum = current_sum + new_digit * multiplier\n      new_path = current_path.copy()\n      new_path.append('H')\n      // Update dp[i+1][new_h]\n      if new_sum > dp[i+1][new_h][0]:\n          dp[i+1][new_h] = (new_sum, new_path)\n      elif new_sum == dp[i+1][new_h][0]:\n          // Choose lex smaller path if needed, but any is fine.\n          // For simplicity, keep the first occurrence.\n          pass\n\n      // Option 2: assign to M\n      new_m = (i - h) + 1\n      if new_m > n:\n          continue\n      multiplier = 10 ** (n - new_m)\n      new_sum = current_sum + new_digit * multiplier\n      new_path = current_path.copy()\n      new_path.append('M')\n      // Update dp[i+1][h]\n      if new_sum > dp[i+1][h][0]:\n          dp[i+1][h] = (new_sum, new_path)\n      elif new_sum == dp[i+1][h][0]:\n          // Keep the first occurrence.\n          pass\n\n- After processing all digits, the final state is dp[2n][n], and the path is the sequence of 'H' and 'M's.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is dp[0][0]. Then, for each i from 0 to 2n-1, we process the i-th digit, leading to i+1.\n\nWait, perhaps the loop runs for i from 0 to len(A)-1, inclusive, and for each i, we process the i-th digit.\n\nSo, len(A) is 2n.\n\nOnce all digits are processed, the final state is i=2n, h=n.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead n and A.\n\nCompute the exponents.\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D array of (2n+1) x (n+1), each element is a tuple (max_sum, path).\n\nSet dp[0][0] = (0, []).\n\nFor i in 0 to 2n-1:\n\n   for h in 0 to min(i, n):\n\n      if dp[i][h] is None:\n          continue\n\n      current_sum, current_path = dp[i][h]\n\n      // Assign to H\n      new_h = h +1\n      if new_h >n:\n          continue\n      digit = int(A[i])\n      multiplier = 10 ** (n - new_h)\n      new_sum = current_sum + digit * multiplier\n      new_path = current_path.copy()\n      new_path.append('H')\n      if new_sum > dp[i+1][new_h][0]:\n          dp[i+1][new_h] = (new_sum, new_path)\n      else if new_sum == dp[i+1][new_h][0]:\n          // Keep the first one.\n          pass\n\n      // Assign to M\n      m = i - h\n      new_m = m +1\n      if new_m >n:\n          continue\n      multiplier = 10 ** (n - new_m)\n      new_sum = current_sum + digit * multiplier\n      new_path = current_path.copy()\n      new_path.append('M')\n      if new_sum > dp[i+1][h][0]:\n          dp[i+1][h] = (new_sum, new_path)\n      else if new_sum == dp[i+1][h][0]:\n          // Keep the first one.\n          pass\n\nOnce all transitions are done, check dp[2n][n]. Its path is the desired sequence.\n\nBut wait, how is the path stored? For each step, the path is appended with 'H' or 'M' based on the assignment.\n\nSo, the final path is the sequence of assignments, which is exactly the required output.\n\nBut what about the initial choice of starting player? Because in the DP, the first digit can be assigned to H or M, depending",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for two players, Homer and Marge, in a TV game where they take turns picking digits from a given number to form their respective numbers. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each player must make exactly `n` moves, taking turns to pick the leftmost digit of the given number.

The contribution of each digit depends on its position in the respective player's number.\n4. **Path Tracking**: Alongside the sum, we track the path (sequence of moves) that leads to the maximum sum to reconstruct the final result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    digits = [int(c) for c in A]\n    len_A = len(digits)\n    \n    # Precompute 10^k for k from 0 to n\n    max_power = n\n    power = [1] * (max_power + 1)\n    for i in range(1, max_power + 1):\n        power[i] = power[i-1] * 10\n    \n    dp = [[(0, []) for _ in range(n+1)] for __ in range(len_A + 1)]\n    dp[0][0] = (0, [])\n    \n    for i in range(len_A):\n        current_digit = digits[i]\n        for h in range(min(i, n) + 1):\n            if not dp[i][h]:\n                continue\n            current_sum, current_path = dp[i][h]\n            \n            # Assign to H\n            new_h = h + 1\n            if new_h > n:\n                continue\n            multiplier = power[n - new_h]\n            new_sum = current_sum + current_digit * multiplier\n            new_path = current_path.copy()\n            new_path.append('H')\n            if new_sum > dp[i+1][new_h][0]:\n                dp[i+1][new_h] = (new_sum, new_path)\n            \n            # Assign to M\n            m = i - h\n            new_m = m + 1\n            if new_m > n:\n                continue\n            multiplier = power[n - new_m]\n            new_sum = current_sum + current_digit * multiplier\n            new_path = current_path.copy()\n            new_path.append('M')\n            if new_sum > dp[i+1][h][0]:\n                dp[i+1][h] = (new_sum, new_path)\n    \n    final_sum, final_path = dp[len_A][n]\n    print(''.join(final_path))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Read input values and precompute powers of 10 up to `n`.\n2. **DP Table Setup**: Initialize a DP table where each entry stores the maximum sum and the corresponding move sequence.\n3. **Digit Processing**: For each digit, consider both possible assignments (to Homer or Marge), updating the DP table with the resulting sums and paths.\n4. **Result Extraction**: After processing all digits, the final state gives the maximum sum and the optimal move sequence, which is then printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal sequence using dynamic programming, ensuring that each player makes exactly `n` moves and maximizes their total prize.",
