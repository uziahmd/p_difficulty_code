The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Neko Finds Grapes.\" Hmm, sounds interesting. So, Neko found some treasure chests and keys. The goal is to open as many chests as possible using the keys.\n\nLet me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, each chest has a number a_i and each key has b_j. A key can unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd. That means either one is even and the other is odd because even + odd = odd. Oh right, but wait, no: wait, 1+2=3 which is odd. Yes, that's right.\n\nEach key can be used once on one chest, and each chest can be opened at most once. So, we need to assign keys to chests such that as many chests as possible are unlocked.\n\nThe input gives n chests and m keys. We have to find the maximum number of chests we can open.\n\nHmm, okay. So, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I think we should categorize the chests and the keys based on whether their numbers are even or odd. Because for a key to unlock a chest, their parities must be different.\n\nWait, let me think. For a_i + b_j to be odd, exactly one of them must be even, right? Because even + odd is odd, and odd + even is also odd. But even + even is even, and odd + odd is even.\n\nSo, for a key to unlock a chest, the key's parity must be different from the chest's.\n\nTherefore, the approach is to count how many chests are even and how many are odd, and similarly for keys. Then, match the two in a way that maximizes the usage.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nLet’s denote:\n- E_a: number of chests with a_i even.\n- O_a: number of chests with a_i odd.\nSimilarly, E_b: number of keys with b_j even.\nO_b: number of keys with b_j odd.\n\nNow, the maximum number of chests we can open is the sum of the minimum between E_b and O_a (since each even key can only unlock an odd chest) plus the minimum between O_b and E_a (each odd key can unlock an even chest). Wait, wait. Or is it the other way around? Let me think again.\n\nNo, wait: each even key can be paired with an odd chest. So, the number of such pairings is min(E_b, O_a).\n\nSimilarly, each odd key can be paired with an even chest, so the number of pairings here is min(O_b, E_a).\n\nSo the total maximum is the sum of these two minima.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me take an example. Suppose there are 3 even keys and 5 odd chests. Then, the even keys can't all be used, since there are only 5 odd chests. So the even keys can only contribute 5, but wait, 3 is less than 5. So min(3,5)=3. So the even keys can unlock 3 chests.\n\nSimilarly, if there are 4 odd keys and 2 even chests, then min(4,2)=2. So the odd keys can unlock 2 chests.\n\nSo adding those two gives 3+2=5 chests unlocked.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests (E_a, O_a).\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys (E_b, O_b).\n3. Compute the possible pairs:\n   a. Even keys can be matched to odd chests: add min(E_b, O_a).\n   b. Odd keys can be matched to even chests: add min(O_b, E_a).\n4. The sum is the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\nWait, but could there be a case where it's better to not use all possible even keys on odd chests, to save some for another purpose? Like, perhaps using some even keys on even chests if that allows more overall.\n\nNo, because the condition is that a_i + b_j is odd. So an even key can't unlock an even chest, as even + even is even. Similarly, an odd key can't unlock an odd chest.\n\nSo, the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, the steps for the code would be:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the a array, count how many are even and odd.\n- Read the b array, count how many are even and odd.\n- Compute the sum of min(E_b, O_a) + min(O_b, E_a).\n- Output that sum.\n\nWait, but wait! What about when the sum exceeds n? Because sometimes, even after matching all possible, the total might be more than n.\n\nWait, no. Because each chest is used at most once. So the sum can",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the given keys. Each key can unlock a chest if their numbers have different parities (i.e., one is even and the other is odd).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Categorize Chests and Keys by Parity**: First, we categorize the chests and keys into two groups based on whether their numbers are even or odd. This helps us efficiently determine which keys can unlock which chests.\n2. **Count Even and Odd Numbers**: For both chests and keys, count how many have even numbers and how many have odd numbers.\n3. **Match Keys to Chests**: Calculate the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked by matching even keys with odd chests and odd keys with even chests. This is done by taking the minimum of the counts of even keys and odd chests, and the minimum of the counts of odd keys and even chests, then summing these two values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    m = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx +=2\n    \n    a_list = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx +=n\n    \n    b_list = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+m]))\n    \n    # Count even and odd in a\n    even_a = 0\n    odd_a = 0\n    for num in a_list:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_a +=1\n        else:\n            odd_a +=1\n    \n    # Count even and odd in b\n    even_b = 0\n    odd_b = 0\n    for num in b_list:\n        if num % 2 ==0:\n            even_b +=1\n        else:\n            odd_b +=1\n    \n    # Compute the maximum\n    max_chests = min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a)\n    print(max_chests)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of chests, keys, and their respective values.\n- **Categorization**: We count how many chests have even and odd numbers. Similarly, we count how many keys have even and odd numbers.\n- **Matching Process**: We determine the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked by considering the possible pairs where keys and chests have different parities. Specifically, even keys can unlock odd chests and odd keys can unlock even chests. The total number of unlocked chests is the sum of these possible pairs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the given keys, leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.",
