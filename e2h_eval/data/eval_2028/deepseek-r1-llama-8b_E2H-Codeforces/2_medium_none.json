Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X'. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe grid is n x n, where n is odd. The conditions for it being an 'X' are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I'll need to check the two main diagonals. Then, check that all non-diagonal elements are the same and not equal to the diagonal character.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input. The input consists of an integer n followed by n lines, each containing n characters.\n\nWait, but in Python, reading the input as a list of strings, each string representing a row. So for each row, I can process it into a list of characters.\n\nSo step by step:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Read the next n lines, each line being a string of length n. So the grid is a list of lists or just a list of strings, each string representing a row.\n\nOnce I have the grid, I need to:\n\n- Check the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right). All characters in this diagonal should be the same.\n- Check the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). All characters in this diagonal should be the same.\n- Then, check that all the other cells (non-diagonal) have the same character, which is different from both diagonals.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that both diagonals must have the same letter. So first, the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal must consist of the same character.\n\nAnd all the other cells must be the same, which is different from the diagonal characters.\n\nSo steps:\n\na. Check if the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal have the same character. If not, it's not an X.\n\nb. Once we know they have the same character, let's call this 'd_char'.\n\nc. Then, check all the other cells: for each cell that's not on either diagonal, it must be the same character, say 'o_char', which is not equal to 'd_char'.\n\nIf all these conditions are satisfied, output YES; else, NO.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read the grid. Let's say grid is a list where grid[i] is the ith row, each row is a string.\n\nThen, for the main diagonal: positions (0,0), (1,1), ..., (n-1, n-1). For each i, grid[i][i] should be the same.\n\nSimilarly, the anti-diagonal: positions (0, n-1), (1, n-2), ..., (n-1, 0). Each of these should be the same as each other and as the main diagonal.\n\nWait, no. Both diagonals must be the same. So the main diagonal's characters must all be equal to each other, and the anti-diagonal's characters must also be equal to each other, and equal to the main diagonal's character.\n\nSo:\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    if grid[i][i] != d_char:\n        return NO\nSimilarly for the anti-diagonal:\na_char = grid[0][n-1]\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    if grid[i][n-1 -i] != a_char:\n        return NO\nThen, check if d_char == a_char. If not, return NO.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nNext, for all the non-diagonal cells, they must all be the same and not equal to d_char.\n\nSo, collect all the cells that are not on either diagonal. For each such cell, check if it's equal to o_char (which is the same for all).\n\nBut wait, what if there are zero such cells? No, because n is at least 3, but for n=3, the center is on both diagonals. So, for n=3, the four corner cells are on diagonals. The other cells are the middle cell, which is on both diagonals. Wait, no: for n=3, the center is (1,1), which is on both diagonals. So for n=3, the only non-diagonal cells are none? Because all cells are on one of the diagonals?\n\nWait, no: for n=3, the grid is 3x3. The main diagonal has 3 cells, the anti-diagonal has 3 cells. But they intersect at (1,1), which is counted in both. So total unique cells in diagonals: 3 + 3 -1 =5. So the number of non-diagonal cells is 3x3 -5=4. But wait, no, for n=3, 9 cells. 5 in diagonals, 4 off. So yes, for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nWait, no, for n=3:\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2)\nAnti-diagonal: (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)\nSo overlapping at (1,1). So total cells covered by diagonals: 3+3-1=5.\n\nSo non-diagonal cells: 9-5=4 cells. These are the four corners except the center.\n\nSo in this case, those four must all be the same and not equal to d_char.\n\nSo, for n >=3, including n=3, the code needs to handle that.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Check if all main diagonal and anti-diagonal are same and equal.\n- Then, check that all non-diagonal cells are same and not equal to d_char.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j), if it's not on either diagonal, then it must be equal to o_char, which is the same for all such cells.\n\nSo how to find o_char:\n\nCollect all the non-diagonal cells, extract their values, and check if they are all the same and not equal to d_char.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLoop through all i and j:\n\nif (i == j) or (i + j == n-1):\n    continue\nelse:\n    collect grid[i][j]\n\nSo, for each cell not on either diagonal.\n\nNow, if this collection is empty, then it's okay? Because for n=1, but n is at least 3. Wait, no, n is >=3.\n\nWait, for n=3, the collection is 4 cells, which are the four corners.\n\nWait, (0,1): is it on the main or anti-diagonal? (0,1) is not on main (since i !=j), and i +j =1 !=2 (n-1 is 2). So yes, it's non-diagonal.\n\nWait, for (0,1): i=0, j=1. i != j, and i +j =1 != 2. So it's part of the non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 4 cells.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nAfter checking that d_char is same for both diagonals, collect all non-diagonal cells.\n\nIf any of them is not equal to the same character, then it's invalid.\n\nElse, if the non-diagonal cells are all the same and different from d_char, then output YES.\n\nElse, NO.\n\nBut wait, what about when all non-diagonal cells are the same as each other but not the same as d_char? That's acceptable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nRead grid.\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\nfor i in range(n):\n    if grid[i][i] != d_char:\n        print('NO')\n        exit()\n\nCheck anti-diagonal:\n\na_char = grid[0][n-1]\nfor i in range(n):\n    j = n - 1 - i\n    if grid[i][j] != a_char:\n        print('NO')\n        exit()\n\nIf d_char != a_char:\n    print('NO')\n    exit()\n\nNow, collect all non-diagonal cells:\n\nnon_diag_chars = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n            continue\n        non_diag_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(non_diag_chars) == 0:\n    # Wait, when can this happen? For n=1, but n is at least 3. So no.\n    # So no need to handle this case.\n    pass\n\n# Now check if all non_diag_chars are same and not equal to d_char.\n\no_char = non_diag_chars[0]\nfor c in non_diag_chars:\n    if c != o_char:\n        print('NO')\n        exit()\nif o_char == d_char:\n    print('NO')\n    exit()\n\nElse, print 'YES'\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, test cases.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nIn this case:\n\nMain diagonal: w, s, w → not all same. So condition fails → output NO.\n\nWait, but according to the sample output, the second input gives YES.\n\nWait, sample input is three test cases.\n\nWait, the first test case in the sample is 5x5 grid. Second test case is 3x3. Third is 3x3.\n\nWait, the sample outputs are ['NO', 'YES', 'NO'].\n\nLet me look at the second test case:\n\nInput:\n3\nxpx\np xp\nxpe\n\nWait, perhaps I made a typo. Let's see the actual input.\n\nWait, looking back, the user provided:\n\nThe second input is:\n['3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nWait, no, the input is:\n\nThe first line is 3, then three lines:\n\nxpx → [x, p, x]\npxp → [p, x, p]\nxpe → [x, p, e]\n\nSo main diagonal: grid[0][0] = x, grid[1][1] = x, grid[2][2] = e.\n\nWait, x and e are different. So main diagonal is not all same. So output is NO.\n\nWait, but according to the sample output, the second case is 'YES'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample input.\n\nWait, the sample input is given as:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nWhich is three test cases.\n\nFirst case: 5x5.\n\nSecond case: 3x3 with rows:\n\nwsw → 'w','s','w'\n\nsws → 's','w','s'\n\nwsw → 'w','s','w'\n\nSo main diagonal is grid[0][0]=w, grid[1][1]=w, grid[2][2]=w. So same.\n\nAnti-diagonal: grid[0][2]=w, grid[1][1]=w, grid[2][0]=w. So same.\n\nd_char is w, a_char is w.\n\nNow, non-diagonal cells are the rest. For 3x3, the non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (0,2?), wait no, (0,2) is on the anti-diagonal. Wait, no.\n\nWait, for (i,j):\n\nIf i == j → on main diagonal.\n\nOr i + j == 2 → on anti-diagonal.\n\nSo for 3x3:\n\nCells not on either diagonal are:\n\n(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)\n\nSo their values are:\n\ngrid[0][1] = 's'\n\ngrid[1][0] = 's'\n\ngrid[1][2] = 's'\n\ngrid[2][1] = 's'\n\nSo all 's's, which is different from 'w's.\n\nSo this should be a YES.\n\nBut according to the sample, the second test case is 'YES', third is 'NO'.\n\nSo the code should correctly identify this.\n\nWait, in the third test case:\n\n3x3 grid:\n\nxpx → x p x\n\npxp → p x p\n\nxpe → x p e\n\nMain diagonal: x, x, e → not same. So it's NO.\n\nSo code will print NO, which matches the sample.\n\nNow, what about another test case.\n\nTest case where main diagonal and anti-diagonal are same, but non-diagonal cells are not all same.\n\nE.g., n=3:\n\nx x x\n\nx x y\n\nx y x\n\nMain diagonal: x, x, x → same.\n\nAnti-diagonal: x, x, x → same.\n\nNon-diagonal cells: (0,1)=x, (1,0)=x, (1,2)=y, (2,1)=y.\n\nSo the non-diagonal cells are x, x, y, y → not all same. So should output NO.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3:\n\na a b\n\na b a\n\nb a a\n\nMain diagonal: a, b, a → not same. So output NO.\n\nAnother case:\n\nn=3:\n\na a a\n\na a a\n\na a a\n\nDiagonals are all a's, and non-diagonal cells are a's. So non-diag chars are a's, same as diag. So condition fails, output NO.\n\nSo code correctly returns NO.\n\nAnother case:\n\nn=3:\n\na a a\n\nb b b\n\na a a\n\nMain diagonal: a, b, a → not same. Output NO.\n\nAnother case:\n\nn=5.\n\nAssume main and anti-diagonal are 'x's.\n\nOther cells are all 'o's.\n\nThen output YES.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen read n lines, stripping any newlines.\n\nWait, the input is given as a list of strings, each being the grid. So for each line, it's a string.\n\nSo grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, check main diagonal:\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if grid[i][i] != d_char:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\nThen, check anti-diagonal:\n\na_char = grid[0][n-1]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    j = n - 1 - i\n    if grid[i][j] != a_char:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\nIf d_char != a_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nThen, collect non-diagonal cells:\n\nnon_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n            continue\n        non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif not non_diag:\n    # This can't happen since n>=3, so non_diag has at least 4 elements.\n    # So no need to handle.\n\no_char = non_diag[0]\nfor c in non_diag:\n    if c != o_char:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\nif o_char == d_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nTesting against sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nMain diagonal: w, w, w → same.\n\nAnti-diagonal: w, w, w → same.\n\nd_char == a_char.\n\nnon_diag: cells (0,1) 's', (1,0)'s', (1,2)'s', (2,1)'s'.\n\nAll 's's, o_char is 's', which is different from 'w'.\n\nSo output YES.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nMain diagonal: x, x, e → not same. So output NO.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase where n=1: but n is >=3, so not considered.\n\nCase where n=3, all non-diagonal are same, but same as d_char. So non_diag_o_char = d_char → condition fails.\n\nAnother case: n=5, non-diagonal are all 'o's, but some are 'o's and others 'x's. So code correctly detects.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n\nSo now, write the code accordingly.\n\nWait, but wait: in the code, after checking the main and anti diagonals, we need to make sure that they are the same.\n\nBecause in the problem statement, both diagonals must have the same letter.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif d_char != a_char:\n\n    print(NO)\n\n    exit()\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter \"X\".
