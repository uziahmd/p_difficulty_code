In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about determining the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu in her hand. Mentsu can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). \n\nHmm. So the input is three tiles, each represented by a string like '1m', '2p', etc. The output is three integers, each representing the minimal draws needed for each of the three cases. Oh wait, no—wait, the output is the minimal number of draws needed overall, but looking back, the sample shows three outputs. Wait, no, the sample input gives three lines, and the output has three numbers. Wait, perhaps each line is a separate test case. Because the sample input is three separate cases, each with their own output. So for each of the three given hands, compute the minimal draws required.\n\nSo the first step is to process each of the three inputs as separate test cases and for each, compute the minimal number of tiles needed to complete a mentsu.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for each test case (each set of three tiles), we need to consider all possible ways to add tiles to form a mentsu. Then find the minimal number of tiles required.\n\nWait, but considering that she can draw any tiles, including duplicates. So the problem is to find, for each of the three initial hands, the smallest number of tiles to add so that in the combined set, there's at least one mentsu.\n\nSo the plan is: for each hand, generate all possible ways to add tiles, compute the minimal count where a mentsu exists, and then choose the smallest such count.\n\nBut considering that the number of possibilities is huge, we need an efficient way to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each possible mentsu (all possible triplets and sequences), determine how many tiles are missing from the current hand, and then find the minimal number of tiles to add to cover those missing ones.\n\nBut the mentsu can be any triplet or sequence. So for each possible mentsu, calculate how many of its required tiles are already present in the current hand. The number of tiles needed to complete this mentsu is 3 minus the count of existing tiles in the mentsu.\n\nThen, among all possible mentsus, find the one that requires the fewest additional tiles. That would be our answer.\n\nBut wait, the current hand has three tiles. So for each possible mentsu, we can see if any of the four possible mentsus can be formed by adding some tiles.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the current hand has three tiles. So adding zero tiles could mean that the hand already contains a mentsu. Otherwise, for each possible mentsu, see how many tiles are missing, and compute the minimal required.\n\nSo let's break it down.\n\nFirst, for each test case, process the three tiles:\n\nEach tile is a string like '1m', '9s', etc.\n\nWe can represent each tile as a tuple, say (number, suit), where number is integer, suit is 'm', 'p', or 's'.\n\nSo for the current hand, we have a list of three such tuples.\n\nNow, for all possible mentsus (triplets and sequences), check for each if the current hand has some subset that can form part of the mentsu. For each mentsu, compute how many tiles are already present in the hand. The minimal required is 3 - count_present.\n\nWe need to find the minimal value across all possible mentsus, and then subtract that from 3? No, wait. The minimal required is the minimal number of tiles to add so that the union of the current hand and the added tiles forms a mentsu.\n\nWait, but a mentsu is exactly three tiles. So for each possible mentsu M, compute how many tiles in M are already present in the current hand. The number of tiles needed to add is 3 minus that count. But since the current hand may have more than three tiles after adding, but the mentsu only requires three, but any subset can be used.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the player must have at least one mentsu. So the entire collection of tiles (after adding) must contain at least one mentsu. It's not sufficient to just have a subset of three tiles forming a mentsu; the entire collection must include at least one mentsu.\n\nWait, but the player's hand is the three initial tiles plus any number of drawn tiles. So when she adds tiles, the total number can be more than three. But she needs to have at least one triplet or sequence in her entire collection.\n\nBut since adding tiles can include any, including duplicates, the minimal number of tiles to add is",
