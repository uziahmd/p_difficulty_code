            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about determining the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu in her hand. Mentsu can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). \n\nHmm. So the input is three strings representing the current tiles she has. Each string has a digit and a suit (m, p, s). For example, '1s' is 1 of suit s. My goal is to find, for each of these three initial hands, the minimal number of additional tiles needed so that the combined set contains at least one mentsu.\n\nWait, wait. Oh right, the output is three integers: each corresponding to the minimal draws needed for each of the three initial hands. Or wait, no—wait, the input is three strings, but the output is three numbers? Or is it a single output line with three numbers separated by spaces? Let me check the sample input and output.\n\nIn the sample input, the three lines are ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']. The output is ['0', '0', '1'], which suggests that for each of the three initial sets, we compute the minimal draws needed. So the output is three numbers, each representing the minimal draws for each of the three initial hands.\n\nSo my plan is to process each of the three initial hands separately, compute the minimal draws needed for each, then output those three numbers as space-separated strings.\n\nAlright, so for each hand, I need to determine the minimal number of tiles to add such that the entire collection (original + added) contains at least one mentsu.\n\nHow do I approach this?\n\nFirst, for each hand, I can generate all possible ways to complete a mentsu, considering adding 0, 1, 2, or 3 tiles, and find the smallest number required.\n\nWait, but since the tiles are added infinitely, perhaps we can model this by looking for all possible mentsu that could be formed, and for each, calculate how many tiles are missing in the current hand, then choose the mentsu that requires the fewest additions.\n\nYes, that makes sense. For example, if the current hand already has a mentsu, then the answer is 0. Otherwise, find the mentsu that can be formed with the least number of tiles not present in the hand.\n\nSo the steps for each hand would be:\n\n1. Generate all possible koutsu and shuntsu that can be formed, regardless of the current hand.\n2. For each such mentsu, count how many tiles are missing in the current hand.\n3. The minimal number of additional tiles needed is the minimal count among all possible mentsu.\n\nBut wait, what's the total number of possible mentsu? Let's think.\n\nFor koutsu, there are 3 suits (m, p, s), and for each suit, 9 possible numbers (1-9). So total 27 koutsu.\n\nFor shuntsu, each suit has 7 possible sequences (since 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9). So 3 *7 =21 shuntsu.\n\nSo overall, there are 27 + 21=48 possible mentsu.\n\nThat's manageable. For each hand, iterate through all 48 possible mentsu, calculate the minimal required draws for that mentsu, then take the minimal across all.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each of the three initial hands:\n\n   For each possible mentsu (all 48):\n\n      Calculate how many tiles are already present in the hand.\n\n      The number of tiles needed is 3 minus the count.\n\n      Keep track of the minimal such value across all mentsu.\n\nThe minimal value across all mentsu is the answer for that hand.\n\nWait, but some mentsu might require more than 3 tiles because they have overlapping tiles. Wait, no—mentsu is exactly three tiles, so each mentsu is a set of three tiles. So for each mentsu, the current hand may have some of them, and the minimal tiles to add is 3 - the count in the hand.\n\nBut wait, no. Because when you add tiles, you can add any tiles, including those outside the current hand. So for example, if the hand has two tiles of a certain mentsu, then adding one tile from that mentsu would complete it.\n\nSo yes, for each mentsu, the number of tiles needed is max(0, 3 - current_count_in_hand).\n\nWait, no. Because even if the current hand has some tiles, but perhaps multiple copies, but that's not relevant because the ments",

Each initial hand consists of three tiles, and we need to compute the minimal draws for each of the three hands.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Generate All Possible Mentsu**: There are 48 possible mentsu combinations, which include 27 triplets (koutsu) and 21 sequences (shuntsu).\n2. **Check Each Hand**: For each of the three initial hands, check how many of the 48 possible mentsu can be formed.\n3. **Calculate Missing Tiles**: For each mentsu, count how many tiles are already present in the hand. The number of additional tiles needed is `3 - count`, where `count` is the number of tiles from the mentsu present in the hand.\n4. **Determine Minimum Draws**: Track the minimum number of additional tiles required across all possible mentsu for each hand.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    hands = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        hands.append(input[i])\n    \n    def min_draws(hand):\n        current = set(hand)\n        min_add = 3  # worst case, need all three\n        # Generate all possible mentsu\n        # Koutsu: same three tiles\n        for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n            for num in range(1, 10):\n                triplet = [f\"{num}{suit}\"]\n                triplet_set = set(triplet)\n                present = len(triplet_set & current)\n                add = 3 - present\n                if add < min_add:\n                    min_add = add\n        \n        # Shuntsu: consecutive numbers in the same suit\n        for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n            for start in range(1, 8):\n                s = f\"{start}{suit}\"\n                n = f\"{start+1}{suit}\"\n                t = f\"{start+2}{suit}\"\n                sequence = {s, n, t}\n                present = len(sequence & current)\n                add = 3 - present\n                if add < min_add:\n                    min_add = add\n        return min_add\n    \n    results = []\n    for h in hands:\n        results.append(str(min_draws(h)))\n    print(' '.join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into three hands.\n2. **Helper Function**: `min_draws` computes the minimum number of extra tiles needed for a given hand.\n3. **Checking Mentsu**: For each hand, it checks all possible mentsu combinations (both triplets and sequences) to determine how many additional tiles are needed.\n4. **Output Results**: The results for each hand are collected and printed as space-separated values.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimal number of draws needed for each hand by considering all possible valid mentsu combinations.",
