    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem says that Neko has two integers a and b, and he wants to find a non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple (LCM) of a + k and b + k is as small as possible. If there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, we need to choose the smallest k.\n\nHmm, interesting. So the goal is to minimize the LCM of (a+k) and (b+k). Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's note that adding the same k to both a and b might have some properties. For example, the difference between a and b remains the same because (a + k) - (b +k) = a - b. Wait, no, wait: if a is less than b, then after adding k, the difference could change? No, wait, no: a + k minus (b +k) is a - b. So the difference remains the same as the original a - b.\n\nWait, but the LCM of two numbers depends on their product divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). So LCM(x, y) = x*y / GCD(x,y). So perhaps if the two numbers are as close as possible, their GCD is higher, which would lower the LCM.\n\nSo maybe the minimal LCM occurs when (a +k) and (b +k) are as close as possible. But since they are separated by d = |a - b|, we can't make them closer than that. So perhaps the optimal k is when a +k is as close as possible to b +k, which is when a +k equals b +k, but that's only possible if a = b, in which case any k would work, but the minimal LCM is a +k, so choosing k=0.\n\nWait, no, if a = b, then for any k, a +k and b +k are equal. So their LCM is just a +k. To minimize this, we choose the smallest possible k, which is 0. So in that case, the answer is 0.\n\nBut what if a â‰  b? Then the two numbers differ by d = |a - b|. So to make them as close as possible, one of them should be just larger than the other by d. So perhaps the optimal point is when a +k is just equal to or as close as possible to b +k.\n\nWait, but that's always the case because the difference is fixed. So maybe the optimal k is chosen such that a +k and b +k are co-prime, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is equal to the LCM of (a +k, d), where d is |a - b|. Because (a +k) and (b +k) have a difference of d, so their GCD is the same as the GCD of (a +k, d).\n\nLet me explain that step by step. Let's say d = |a - b|. Without loss of generality, assume that a <= b, so b = a + d.\n\nThen, a + k and b + k = a +k +d. The difference is d.\n\nSo the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) is equal to the GCD of (a +k, d). Because:\n\nLet g be a divisor of (a +k) and (b +k). Then g divides their difference, which is d. So g must divide d. So GCD(a +k, b +k) = GCD(a +k, d).\n\nThat's a crucial observation. So the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is equal to (a +k) * (b +k) / GCD(a +k, d).\n\nBut since (a +k) and (d) may share factors, perhaps the minimal LCM can be found by choosing (a +k) and d to have as high a GCD as possible.\n\nWait, because the LCM is (a +k) * (b +k) / g, where g = GCD(a +k, d). But (b +k) = a +k +d. So substituting, the LCM becomes (a +k) * (a +k +d) / g.\n\nHmm, but since (a +k) and (a +k +d) have a GCD of g, then their product is (a +k)*(a +k +d) = (a +k)^2 + d*(a +k). Divided by g, that's the LCM.\n\nBut perhaps another way to",
