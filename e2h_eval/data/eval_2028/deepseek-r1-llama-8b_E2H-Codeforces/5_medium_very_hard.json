Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Colored Boots.\" Hmm.\n\nSo, the setup is that there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color represented by a lowercase letter or a question mark. We need to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of one left and one right boot, and their colors are compatible.\n\nWhat counts as compatible? Two specific colors are compatible only if they're exactly the same. A question mark is compatible with any color, including another question mark. So, for example, '?' can pair with 'a', 'b', or '?'. But 'a' can't pair with 'b'.\n\nThe goal is to compute the maximum number of such pairs and list them. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nHmm. So, the approach here must involve figuring out which left and right boots can form compatible pairs and then selecting as many as possible without overlapping.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, I think we need to consider each possible color (including the question mark) and determine how many left boots have that color and how many right boots have that color. Then, for each color, the number of pairs possible is the minimum of the left and right counts for that color. But wait, because the question mark can pair with anything.\n\nWait, but the question marks complicate things because they can match any color. So perhaps it's better to split the problem into two parts: considering the fixed colors and then handling the question marks separately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can precompute for each position whether a left and right boot can form a pair, and then find a maximum matching in a bipartite graph. But with n up to 150,000, that's way too big for standard algorithms like the Hungarian method, which is O(n^3), so that's not feasible.\n\nSo, I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me break down the problem:\n\nEach left boot can be paired with a right boot if:\n\n- l_i == r_j, or\n- either l_i or r_j is '?'\n\nBut since each left and right can be used only once, it's a matter of optimally matching as many as possible.\n\nHmm.\n\nAn alternative idea is to model the problem by first counting all possible compatible pairs, but ensuring that each left and right is used at most once.\n\nBut this seems tricky. How can we count the maximum possible pairs without overlapping?\n\nWait, maybe we can separate the problem into two cases: pairs where both are specific colors, and pairs involving question marks.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to precompute for each color the available left and right boots, and then for each color, take the minimum of the counts. Then, subtract these from the total and handle the question marks.\n\nWait, but question marks can pair with any color, including themselves. So perhaps the process would be:\n\n1. For each color c (excluding '?'), calculate the number of lefts with c and rights with c. The maximum possible pairs for this color is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). Sum these across all c.\n\n2. Then, handle the question marks. Each left '?' can pair with any right, but also any right can pair with a left '?'.\n\nWait, but when you have a left '?' and a right '?', pairing them is also allowed. So perhaps after handling the fixed colors, the remaining question marks can be paired among themselves.\n\nWait, no. Because the question marks can pair with any color, including other question marks.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe an alternative approach is to model this as a bipartite graph where edges exist between left and right boots that are compatible, and then find a maximum matching.\n\nBut again, with n=15e4, this is impossible with standard algorithms.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find a way to compute the maximum possible pairs without explicitly building the graph.\n\nAlternative idea: the problem can be thought of as a bipartite graph with left and right nodes, and edges where the pair is compatible. We need a maximum matching in this graph. But again, for n=15e4, we can't compute this directly.\n\nWe need an efficient way to compute the maximum matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding for each right node, the best possible left node that hasn't been matched yet. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a greedy approach. For each left boot, find the first right boot that is compatible and hasn't been used yet, and pair them. But this might not give the optimal result because sometimes it's better to leave certain boots for later pairings that could yield more overall matches.\n\nHmm, but given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal way is to use a frequency-based approach, considering the specific colors and the question marks.\n\nLet me try to outline a plan:\n\n1. Count the number of left and right boots for each color, excluding '?'.\n\n2. For each color c, the number of possible pairs is the minimum of left_count[c] and right_count[c]. Summing these gives a base number of pairs.\n\n3. Subtract these pairs from the available left and right boots, leaving some left and right boots unpaired.\n\n4. Now, handle the question marks. The unpaired left and right boots include some '?', which can be paired together.\n\nWait, but during step 2, we may have used up some '?', so perhaps the steps are more involved.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach should be:\n\n- First, process the non-'?' colors. For each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]).\n\n- Then, process the '?' pairs. Each left '?' can pair with any right, including other '?'. So, the number of '?' left and right boots is L and R, respectively. The maximum possible pairs is min(L, R). But wait, because some of those '?' may have already been paired with non-'?' in step 1.\n\nWait, no. Because in step 1, the processing for non-'?' doesn't involve the '?'.\n\nWait, perhaps the '?' are processed separately. Let me clarify.\n\nIn step 1, for each color c != '?', we take as many pairs as possible. This doesn't affect the '?' in l or r.\n\nThen, after that, the remaining left and right boots include all the '?' plus any leftovers from other colors.\n\nSo, for the '?' pairs:\n\nThe total available left '?' is the original count minus the ones used in step 1. Wait, no, because in step 1, the '?' were not considered as part of the colors, so the left_count['?'] is untouched.\n\nWait, no. Because in step 1, for each c != '?', we took min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) pairs. So, the left_count['?'] remains as the original count.\n\nWait, no, because the left_count['?'] is separate.\n\nSo, perhaps after step 1, the remaining left and right boots are those that couldn't be paired with their specific color. But then, the '?' in left and right can still be paired.\n\nSo, the total number of '?' left is L_q, and the total of '?' right is R_q. Then, the number of possible pairs between them is min(L_q, R_q).\n\nSo, adding that to the base sum gives the maximum possible pairs.\n\nBut wait, perhaps this isn't correct because some of the '?' could have been used in step 1. Or perhaps not, because step 1 didn't involve '?'.\n\nWait, no. Because in step 1, we process non-'?' colors. The '?' in left and right are not affected by that step. So, the L_q is the original count of '?' in left, R_q is original in right.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because after step 1, some right boots that were '?' may have been used in step 1. No, wait, no. Because in step 1, when we process a specific color c, we take min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) pairs. So, for example, if a right boot is '?', it's not considered as part of any specific color. So, the '?' right boots are available for pairing with the left '?'.\n\nThus, after step 1, the number of '?' in left is L_q = left_count['?'], and the number of '?' in right is R_q = right_count['?'].\n\nSo, the total number of pairs is the sum of step 1 pairs plus min(L_q, R_q).\n\nWait, but that's assuming that all the '?' can be paired together, which may not be the case because other possibilities might allow more pairs.\n\nFor example, suppose there are some left boots that are '?', and right boots that are specific colors. Then, the left '?' can pair with those right specific colors, leading to more pairs than just the min(L_q, R_q).\n\nAh, right! So, the initial approach is incorrect because it ignores the possibility of pairing '?' with non-'?' right boots.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n1. Compute for each color c != '?', the number of pairs as min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). Sum these.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining left and right boots, which include the '?' and possibly some others, find the maximum number of pairs by pairing left '?' with any right (including other '?') and right non-'?' with left non-'?'. But this is getting complex.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of the step 1 pairs plus the number of pairs formed by the remaining left and right, considering that any left can pair with any right as long as the left is compatible.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because the remaining left and right may have various colors, and the compatibility depends on each pair.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea is to model the problem as:\n\nEach left boot can be paired with any right boot that is compatible with it. So, the maximum matching is the largest possible set of such pairs where each left and right is used once.\n\nBut again, for large n, this is computationally expensive.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution involves using a greedy algorithm, but in a way that's efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps we can represent the left and right boots in a way that allows us to efficiently find the best matches.\n\nLet me think differently. For each right boot, the number of left boots it can pair with is the sum of:\n\n- All left boots with the same color as the right boot, if it's not '?'.\n- All left boots that are '?'.\n- All left boots whose color is the same as the right boot (if it's not '?').\n\nWait, no, because a left boot can only pair with a right boot if they are compatible.\n\nSo, for a right boot with color c:\n\n- It can pair with any left boot with color c (if c is not '?').\n- It can pair with any left boot that is '?'.\n- If the right boot is '?', it can pair with any left boot.\n\nWait, but the left boot's color determines whether it's compatible. So, for a right boot r_j, the compatible left boots are:\n\n- Those l_i where l_i == r_j, unless r_j is '?', in which case all l_i are compatible.\n\nWait, no, the rule is: two specific colors are compatible if and only if they are the same. If either is '?', it's compatible.\n\nSo, for a right boot r_j:\n\nIf r_j is 'a', then it can pair with left boots that are 'a' or '?'.\n\nSimilarly, if r_j is '?', it can pair with any left boot.\n\nSo, the maximum number of pairs is the maximum matching in a bipartite graph where edges connect compatible left and right boots.\n\nBut again, for n=15e4, this is not feasible with standard methods.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find a way to compute the maximum number of pairs without explicitly modeling the graph.\n\nAnother angle: since each left can be connected to multiple rights and vice versa, perhaps the problem can be reduced to a problem where we can greedily match as many as possible, but in a way that maximizes the count.\n\nWait, maybe it's possible to model this as a bipartitioned graph with the left and right nodes, and then find the maximum matching using a priority queue approach.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the \"maximum bipartite matching\" with high efficiency:\n\nWe can sort the left and right boots in a way that allows us to find the maximum possible pairs quickly.\n\nLet me think: for each left boot, collect all right boots that are compatible with it. Then, assign each left to the earliest possible right that is compatible and hasn't been assigned yet.\n\nBut again, for 15e4, this could be manageable if done efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into two parts:\n\n1. Pair as many as possible where left and right are the same color (and not '?').\n\n2. Then, pair the remaining left and right boots, including the '?', using the fact that '?' can pair with anything.\n\nBut even this may not capture all possibilities optimally.\n\nWait, let's think about the first part: for each color c, the number of possible pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). Summing these gives the base number of pairs.\n\nAfter that, we have some left and right boots that couldn't be paired in this way. These could be:\n\n- Left boots with color c where right_count[c] was zero.\n- Right boots with color d where left_count[d] was zero.\n- All the '?' boots.\n\nSo, now, the remaining left and right can be paired, but the condition is that each left can pair with any right, provided their colors are compatible.\n\nNow, the challenge is to pair as many as possible of these remaining left and right.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, the remaining left and right may have varying colors, and the '?' can act as wildcards.\n\nPerhaps the way to proceed is:\n\n- For each remaining left boot, find the earliest possible right boot that is compatible and hasn't been paired yet.\n\nBut for n=15e4, even this approach may be too slow unless optimized.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nThe remaining left and right are grouped into two sets: those that are '?', and others.\n\nWe can count the number of remaining left '?' and right '?'. The maximum number of pairs possible between them is the minimum of the two counts.\n\nAdditionally, any left non-'?' can pair with any right non-'?' if they are compatible, but that's not straightforward.\n\nWait, but the problem is that some left non-'?' may not have any right non-'?' compatible, so they can only pair with right '?'.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n1. For each color c != '?', compute min(left_count[c], right_count[c]), add to the total.\n\n2. Remove these from the left and right counts.\n\n3. Now, for the remaining left and right:\n\n   a. For each left boot that is '?', it can pair with any right boot (either '?', or any specific color).\n\n   b. Similarly, a right boot that is '?', it can pair with any left boot.\n\nSo, perhaps the remaining left and right can be handled by considering:\n\nThe total number of remaining left and right is L and R.\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is the minimum of L and R.\n\nBut wait, that's only true if all can pair. Because for some left and right, their colors may not be compatible.\n\nNo, because for a left boot that is not '?', it can only pair with a right boot that is either the same color or a '?'.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nAfter step 1, for the remaining left and right:\n\nLet Lq be the number of left boots that are '?'.\n\nRq be the number of right boots that are '?'.\n\nAdditionally, let's have L_other be the number of left boots that are not '?', and R_other be the number of right boots that are not '?'.\n\nNow, the maximum number of pairs possible is:\n\nmin(Lq + L_other, Rq + R_other) ?\n\nNo, that's not accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is that:\n\nEach left boot can be either '?' or a specific color.\n\nEach right boot can be either '?' or a specific color.\n\nSo, for a left boot that is a specific color c, it can pair with any right boot that is c or '?'.\n\nSimilarly, a right boot that is c can pair with any left boot that is c or '?'.\n\nSo, the maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\n- Pairs between left '?' and any right (including '?')\n\n- Pairs between right '?' and any left (including '?')\n\n- Plus, any possible pairs between left and right specific colors that are compatible.\n\nWait, but this is getting tangled.\n\nPerhaps a better way is to model the remaining left and right as follows:\n\nWe have two sets: left_non_q and left_q.\n\nSimilarly, right_non_q and right_q.\n\nEach left_non_q can pair with any right_non_q that is the same color, or with any right_q.\n\nEach left_q can pair with any right (left_non_q or right_non_q, etc.).\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\na) The number of left_non_q that can find a compatible right_non_q.\n\nb) The number of left_q that can find a compatible right (any type).\n\nc) The number of right_non_q that can find a compatible left (any type).\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is equal to the maximum of:\n\n- The number of pairs possible by matching left_non_q with right_non_q (specific colors) plus the rest.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a bipartite graph and find a maximum matching, but with an efficient algorithm.\n\nGiven that the problem is about bipartite graphs, perhaps the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm is applicable, which runs in O(√N * E) time, which for n=15e4 is manageable if the number of edges is manageable.\n\nBut for n=15e4, the number of edges could be up to O(n), but perhaps we can manage.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Create a bipartite graph where each left node is connected to all right nodes that are compatible.\n\n- Find the maximum matching in this graph.\n\n- Output the size of the matching and the pairs.\n\nBut for n=15e4, creating adjacency lists may not be feasible because the number of edges can be up to n^2, which is 2.25e9—way too big.\n\nSo, this approach is not feasible.\n\nSo, back to the drawing board.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nSince the problem requires maximum matching, perhaps we can model the problem in a way that allows for a greedy approach, but with a clever data structure.\n\nPerhaps, for each right boot, we can collect all left boots that are compatible and can be paired.\n\nBut again, this seems difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps for each right boot, we can assign the earliest possible left boot that is compatible and hasn't been used yet.\n\nThis is similar to the standard maximum bipartite matching approach but done greedily.\n\nBut again, with 15e4 nodes, this approach may be too slow unless optimized.\n\nBut perhaps, if we can process the left and right in a certain order, this could be manageable.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nWe can model the problem as a bipartite graph where each left is connected to all rights that are compatible.\n\nTo maximize the number of pairs, we can arrange the left and right in a way that allows for the maximum possible matches.\n\nOne approach is to sort the left and right in a particular order, and then greedily match them.\n\nBut what sorting order would help?\n\nPerhaps, for each right boot, we can note the earliest left boot that can pair with it and hasn't been used yet.\n\nBut again, this seems unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a bipartite graph where the edges are determined by the compatibility rules. The maximum matching is the solution.\n\nBut given the problem's constraints, we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nAlternative Idea Inspired by Two Pointer Approach:\n\nPerhaps, for each right boot, we can find the earliest left boot that can pair with it, and then mark both as used.\n\nBut again, the order matters.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach works:\n\nSort all left boots in a certain way and all right boots in another way, then try to pair them in a way that maximizes the number of compatible pairs.\n\nBut what's the best way to sort them?\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nWe can separate the problem into two parts:\n\n1. Handle the specific color pairs.\n\n2. Handle the pairs involving '?'.\n\nFor the first part, for each color c != '?', the maximum number of pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). We can accumulate this and subtract these from the left and right counts.\n\nFor the second part, the remaining left and right can be paired as follows:\n\n- Each left '?' can pair with any right.\n\n- Each right '?' can pair with any left.\n\n- Each left non-'?' can pair with right non-'?' if they are the same.\n\nSo, for the remaining left and right:\n\nCompute the number of pairs possible between left '?' and any right (including other '?'), and similarly for right '?'.\n\nBut this may not capture all possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of additional pairs is the minimum of the total number of remaining left and right boots.\n\nBecause each pair uses one left and one right.\n\nBut this is only possible if every left can pair with a right. Which is not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, for example, if a left boot is 'a' and a right is 'b', they cannot pair, but they are both in the remaining pool.\n\nSo, the assumption that the maximum possible is min(remaining left, remaining right) is incorrect.\n\nThus, this approach won't work.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps, after handling the specific color pairs, the remaining left and right can be grouped into four categories:\n\n- Left Specific (LS): left boots that are specific colors (not '?').\n\n- Left Question (LQ): left boots that are '?'.\n\n- Right Specific (RS): right boots that are specific colors (not '?').\n\n- Right Question (RQ): right boots that are '?'.\n\nNow, the LS can pair with RS if they have the same color, or with RQ.\n\nSimilarly, LQ can pair with any of LS, RS, or RQ.\n\nBut again, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\na) The number of LS that can pair with RS.\n\nb) The number of LQ that can pair with any of LS, RS, RQ.\n\nc) The number of RS that can pair with LQ.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be considered as a bipartite graph where each node is a left or right boot, and edges exist between compatible pairs. Then, the maximum matching is the answer.\n\nBut again, with n=15e4, this is impractical.\n\nThus, perhaps the way forward is to think of the problem in terms of frequencies and not individual boots.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nSuppose I have:\n\n- For each color c != '?', the number of left and right boots is known. We can pair as many as min(left_c, right_c), which gives us a certain number of pairs.\n\n- For the '?', the left and right counts are Lq and Rq. The maximum possible pairs is min(Lq, Rq), but this is only possible if we can pair all of them. However, this ignores the fact that some left and right may have specific colors that are incompatible, but are in the remaining pool.\n\nWait, but after the specific color pairs are handled, the remaining left and right may have specific colors that can't pair with each other, but can pair with '?'.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nTotal_pairs = sum over c (min(left_c, right_c)) \n\n+ min(Lq, Rq) \n\n+ number of pairs between LS and RQ \n\n+ number of pairs between RS and LQ \n\nBut how do we compute the last two terms?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of pairs between LS and RQ is the minimum of the sum of LS and RQ, but that's not necessarily correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\n- Pairs from specific colors.\n\n- Pairs between LS and RQ.\n\n- Pairs between RS and LQ.\n\n- Pairs between LQ and RQ.\n\nBut this seems like it's getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps the correct way is to realize that after handling the specific color pairs, the remaining left and right can be paired in any way as long as the left can pair with the right.\n\nSo, the maximum possible pairs is the sum of the specific color pairs plus the number of pairs that can be formed from the remaining left and right.\n\nBut how to compute the number of such pairs?\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of such pairs is the minimum of the total remaining left and right.\n\nBut again, this is only possible if every left can pair with a right, which is not necessarily the case.\n\nThus, perhaps this approach is not sufficient.\n\nSo, perhaps the way forward is to find a way to count the maximum possible pairs without considering the exact pairs, but that's not helpful for the output.\n\nWait, the problem requires us to output the actual pairs, so we need to know which specific left and right are paired.\n\nBut for n=15e4, we can't store all possible pairs.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative Idea Inspired by Greedy Matching:\n\nPerhaps, for each right boot, we can find the earliest left boot that can pair with it and hasn't been used yet. This is similar to the standard bipartite matching approach.\n\nBut to do this efficiently, we can sort the left and right boots in a way that allows us to process them quickly.\n\nHere's a possible approach:\n\n1. Sort all left boots in increasing order of index.\n\n2. Sort all right boots in increasing order of index.\n\n3. For each right boot in sorted order, find the earliest left boot that is compatible and hasn't been used yet.\n\nBut this may not lead to the maximum number of pairs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can sort the right boots based on their color, and for each right, find the earliest left that can pair with it.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea Inspired by Two Pointers:\n\nLet's imagine that we have two pointers, one starting at the beginning of the left list, and one starting at the beginning of the right list. For each right boot, we move the left pointer as far as possible, pairing left[i] with right[j], if they are compatible.\n\nThis is similar to the way two-sum is solved.\n\nBut will this approach yield the maximum number of pairs?\n\nI'm not sure, but perhaps it's worth exploring.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nInitialize i=0, j=0, count=0.\n\nWhile i < n and j < n:\n\n   if l[i] is compatible with r[j]:\n\n      pair them, increment count, i +=1, j +=1.\n\n   else:\n\n      i +=1.\n\nBut this approach may miss some possible pairs, leading to a suboptimal count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can process the left and right in a certain order, but I'm not sure.\n\nBut for n=15e4, this approach is O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nBut will it yield the correct maximum number of pairs? Not necessarily.\n\nBut perhaps, given the problem's constraints, this approach is the best we can do.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Let me test with an example.\n\nConsider left = ['a', '?'], right = ['a', 'b'].\n\nProcessing in order:\n\ni=0, j=0: l[0] = 'a' and r[0]='a' → compatible. Pair (0,0). i=1, j=1.\n\nl[1]='?', r[1]='b' → compatible. Pair (1,1). Total 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nleft = ['a', 'b'], right=['c', 'a'].\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0, j=0: 'a' vs 'c' → not compatible. i increases to 1.\n\nj=0: 'b' vs 'c' → not compatible. i increases to 2, loop ends. Only 0 pairs.\n\nBut the optimal is pairing left[1] with right[1], which is 1 pair.\n\nSo, the approach fails in this case.\n\nThus, this approach is not correct.\n\nThus, the two-pointer approach may not always find the maximum number of pairs.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem requires a different approach.\n\nAlternative Idea Inspired by Frequency Analysis:\n\nAnother approach is to model the problem using the frequencies of colors, including '?'.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- For each color c, left_count[c] = number of left boots of color c.\n\n- right_count[c] = number of right boots of color c.\n\n- left_question = number of left boots that are '?'.\n\n- right_question = number of right boots that are '?'.\n\nThen, the maximum number of pairs from specific colors is sum over c (min(left_count[c], right_count[c])).\n\nThen, the remaining left and right are:\n\nleft_remaining = n - sum_c (left_count[c]) - left_question\n\nWait, no, because left_count[c] includes the left boots that are '?'. So, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nleft_remaining = sum over c (left_count[c]) + left_question - sum(min(left_count[c], right_count[c]))\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, after handling the specific color pairs, the remaining left and right are:\n\nleft_remaining = sum of (left_count[c] - min(left_count[c], right_count[c])) for all c.\n\nPlus, the left_question.\n\nSimilarly for right_remaining.\n\nWait, no. Because for each c, after taking min(left_count[c], right_count[c]), the remaining left_count[c] is left_count[c] - taken.\n\nBut perhaps, the remaining left and right can be considered as:\n\nleft_remaining = sum (left_count[c] - min(left_count[c], right_count[c])) for all c.\n\nPlus, left_question - (number of '?' used in specific pairs).\n\nWait, no. Because the specific pairs don't involve '?'.\n\nThus, the remaining left and right after step 1 are:\n\nleft_remaining = sum (left_count[c] - min(left_count[c], right_count[c])) for c != '?' \n\nplus left_question.\n\nSimilarly for right_remaining.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for hints or similar problems.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for a solution approach used in similar problems could help.\n\nUpon thinking, I recall that for maximum bipartite matching where edges are based on certain conditions, sometimes the problem can be transformed into a flow problem and solved with a max flow algorithm. But for n=15e4, this is not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph where edges are between left and right if they are compatible, and then the maximum matching is found using a greedy approach that is efficient.\n\nBut again, with n=15e4, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\n- The maximum number of pairs where left is '?', right is anything.\n\n- The maximum number of pairs where right is '?', left is anything.\n\n- The maximum number of pairs where both are specific colors and compatible.\n\nBut this seems like it's overlapping with previous thoughts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\n1. The number of pairs where both are specific colors and compatible.\n\n2. The number of pairs where left is '?', right is anything.\n\n3. The number of pairs where left is specific, right is '?'.\n\n4. The number of pairs where both are '?.\n\nBut again, the problem is how to compute this without double-counting.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\ntotal_pairs = sum_over_c min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) \n\n+ left_question * right_question \n\n+ (left_question * (right_non_question - sum_c (min(left_count[c], right_count[c]))) )\n\n+ (right_question * (left_non_question - sum_c (min(left_count[c], right_count[c]))) )\n\n+ ... \n\nNo, perhaps not.\n\nAnother Idea Inspired by Inclusion-Exclusion:\n\nPerhaps, the total number of pairs is:\n\nsum_over_c min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) \n\n+ (left_question + right_question) - (number of pairs where left is '?', right is '?') \n\n+ (left_question * (right_non_question - sum_c min(left_count[c], right_count[c])) ) \n\n+ (right_question * (left_non_question - sum_c min(left_count[c], right_count[c])) )\n\nBut I'm not confident.\n\nAt this point, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to model the problem as a bipartite graph where left and right are nodes, and edges exist if compatible. Then, the maximum matching is the answer. But for n=15e4, this is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps the problem can be transformed into a bipartite graph where the edges are based on the colors, and the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm can be applied, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea Inspired by Frequency Counting:\n\nPerhaps, the maximum number of pairs can be computed as follows:\n\n- For each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]).\n\n- The number of '?' in left and right can form pairs as follows: the maximum is min(left_question, right_question).\n\n- Additionally, the remaining left and right can form pairs as follows:\n\n   Each left that is not '? can pair with any right that is '?.\n\n   Each right that is not '? can pair with any left that is '?.\n\nSo, the total would be:\n\ntotal_pairs = sum_c min(left_count[c], right_count[c])\n\n+ min(left_question, right_question)\n\n+ (left_non_question * right_question) ?\n\nNo, that's not correct because some right_non_question may have already been paired with left_non_question.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nAfter step 1, the remaining left and right are:\n\nleft_remaining = sum (left_count[c] - min(left_count[c], right_count[c])) for c != '?' \n\n+ left_question.\n\nright_remaining = sum (right_count[c] - min(left_count[c], right_count[c])) for c != '?' \n\n+ right_question.\n\nNow, the maximum number of pairs is the sum of step 1 plus the maximum matching between left_remaining and right_remaining, considering that:\n\n- A left can pair with a right if:\n\n   - They are both '?', or\n\n   - The left is '?', or\n\n   - The right is '?', or\n\n   - Their colors are the same.\n\nBut again, computing this is difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of step 1 plus the minimum of left_remaining and right_remaining.\n\nBecause each pair requires one left and one right.\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\ntotal_pairs = sum_c min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) + min(left_remaining, right_remaining)\n\nBut is this correct?\n\nWait, let's test with an example.\n\nExample:\n\nn=2.\n\nl = \"ab\"\n\nr = \"ba\"\n\nSo, step 1: for color 'a', min(1,1)=1. For color 'b', min(1,1)=1. So total is 2.\n\nleft_remaining = 0, right_remaining = 0. So no more pairs.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=2.\n\nl = \"?a\"\n\nr = \"b?\"\n\nSo, step 1: 'a' in l and 'b' in r: min(1,0)=0. 'a' in l and 'b' in r: same. So step 1 contributes 0.\n\nThen, left_remaining is 1 ('?') + 1 ('a').\n\nright_remaining is 1 ('b') + 1 ('?').\n\nSo, min(2, 2) = 2.\n\nThus, total_pairs is 0+2=2.\n\nWhich is correct because:\n\nPair left 1 ( ? ) with right 2 ( ? ), and left 2 (a) with right 1 (b) → no, because a and b are incompatible. So, can't pair.\n\nWait, but in this case, the approach suggests 2 pairs, but in reality, only one is possible.\n\nSo, the approach is incorrect.\n\nThus, the initial idea is flawed.\n\nSo, what's the issue here?\n\nBecause the approach assumes that all remaining left and right can be paired, but in reality, some may not be compatible.\n\nThus, the problem is more complex than initially thought.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I need to look for a different approach.\n\nAlternative Idea Inspired by Edge Cases:\n\nPerhaps, the problem can be considered as a bipartite graph, and the maximum matching can be found using a greedy approach where each left is matched to the earliest possible right that is compatible.\n\nBut again, for n=15e4, this may be too slow.\n\nBut perhaps with optimizations, it's manageable.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- For each right boot, precompute a list of left boots that are compatible.\n\n- Then, for each right in order, find the earliest left that is compatible and hasn't been used yet.\n\nThis is similar to the standard approach for maximum bipartite matching.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nImplementing this would require for each right to have a list of lefts that can pair with it, and then using a data structure to track which lefts are available.\n\nBut for n=15e4, this could be O(n) per right, which is O(n^2) time—too slow.\n\nThus, this approach is not feasible.\n\nFinal Idea:\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the only feasible approach is to process the specific color pairs first, then process the '?' pairs, and finally, process the remaining specific color pairs that can pair with '?'.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a bipartite graph with the left and right nodes, and the maximum matching can be found using the built-in functions, but this seems unlikely.\n\nThus, I'm stuck and perhaps need to look for hints or consider that the problem is beyond my current understanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to precompute for each color c, the min(left_count[c], right_count[c]), sum these, then compute the number of '?' pairs as min(left_question, right_question), and also compute the number of pairs between left_question and right_non_question, and right_question and left_non_question.\n\nBut",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs between left and right boots.

The maximum number of pairs for each color is the minimum of these counts.\n2. **Handle Question Marks**: After handling specific colors, consider the question marks.
