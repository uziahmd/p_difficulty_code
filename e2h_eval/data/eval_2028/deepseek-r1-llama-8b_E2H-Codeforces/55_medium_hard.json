    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Minimum Ternary String. Hmm. So, the task is to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing certain swap operations. \n\nWait, the allowed swaps are only between '0' and '1' if they are adjacent, and between '1' and '2' if they are adjacent. So, for example, you can't swap a '0' and a '2' directly because they aren't adjacent in the swap rules. Oh right, that's an important point.\n\nSo the string consists of 0s, 1s, and 2s. And we can only swap adjacent 0 and 1, or 1 and 2. The goal is to rearrange the string as much as possible using these swaps to get the lex smallest possible string.\n\nHmm. So how do I approach this? Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible relative orderings between the characters. Since swapping 0 and 1 can change their positions, but 0 cannot be swapped with 2, and 2 cannot be swapped with 0, except through other characters. Wait, no—because 1 can be swapped with 2. So, for example, a 0 can be moved past a 2 by moving the 1 between them. Like, 0,1,2: you can first swap 1 and 2 to make 0,2,1, then swap 0 and 2? No, wait, no, because 0 and 2 can't be swapped directly. Oh right, so that's not possible. So perhaps 0 can't be reordered beyond certain points.\n\nWait, maybe I need to model the dependencies here. So the key is to figure out which characters can be swapped with each other through a chain of allowed swaps. For instance, 0 and 1 can be swapped, and 1 and 2 can be swapped. So 0 can be moved past 2 via 1, but only if there's a path.\n\nWait, no. Because 0 can't be swapped with 2 directly, but 0 can be swapped with 1, and 1 can be swapped with 2. So the presence of 1s allows 0s and 2s to move past each other, but only if they're on opposite sides of a 1.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of groups. Like, all 0s can be moved among themselves freely because they can be swapped with 1s, but 1s can also be swapped with 2s. But wait, 0s can't be directly moved past 2s, unless there's a 1 in between.\n\nSo, perhaps the 0s can be arranged in any order relative to each other, but their movement relative to 2s is constrained. Or maybe not. This part is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s can be thought of as a group that can be reordered among themselves, but their relative order to 2s can't be changed. Or maybe it's the other way around.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to realize that 0s can be reordered among themselves, but their positions relative to 2s can't be altered without some constraints. Because 0s can't be directly moved past 2s, but if there's a 1 in between, perhaps they can be swapped indirectly.\n\nWait, maybe the 0s can be moved past 2s by passing through 1s. For example, consider the string \"021\". How can it be rearranged? Well, initially, 0 is before 2. We can't swap 0 and 2 directly. But if there's a 1 in between, like \"012\", can we rearrange it?\n\nWait, let's take the string \"012\". We can swap 1 and 2 to make it \"021\". Then, 0 is still before 2. But wait, can we swap 0 and 2 somehow? No, because they are adjacent only after the first swap, but 0 and 2 can't be swapped. So in this case, the 0 stays before the 2.\n\nBut suppose we have \"0102\". Can we arrange the 0s and 2s in a different order? Let's see: the initial string is 0,1,0,2. Maybe we can move the 2 towards the left as much as possible by swapping it with 1s.\n\nWait, the 2 is at position 3 (0-based index 3). It's preceded by 0. To move it left, the only way is to swap with 1, but in this case, the 2 is after 0, which can't be swapped. Hmm, maybe that's not possible. So perhaps the 0s can't be moved past 2s unless there's a way to shift the 2s to the right via 1s.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as follows:\n\nEach 0 can be moved past 1s, but not past 2s. Similarly, 2s can be moved past 1s, but not past 0s. So the relative order of 0s and 2s in the original string can't be changed. Because 0s can't cross over 2s, since you can't swap 0 and 2 directly, and moving 0s past 2s would require a series of swaps that may not be possible.\n\nWait, wait. Let's think about this. Suppose I have a string like \"02\". Can I swap them? No, because 0 and 2 can't be swapped directly. So the order remains \"02\".\n\nIf the string is \"20\", same thing; can't swap, so it stays \"20\".\n\nWhat if the string is \"201\"? So 2,0,1. Can I rearrange this to get 0,1,2? Let's see.\n\nThe 2 is first. To move it past 0, I need to swap it with 0, but that's not allowed. Alternatively, can I swap 0 and 1 to bring 1 next to 2, then swap 2 and 1. That way, the 2 moves to the end.\n\nLet's see:\n\nOriginal: 2,0,1.\n\nSwap 0 and 1: 2,1,0.\n\nThen, swap 2 and 1: 1,2,0.\n\nWait, but that doesn't help. Now the string is 1,2,0. Then, can I swap 2 and 0? No, because they are adjacent but can't be swapped. So the 0 is stuck after the 2. So the minimum possible is 102, which is worse than 010 or 001 or something else.\n\nWait, maybe the initial string can't be rearranged into a form where 0 comes before 2. So perhaps the relative order of 0s and 2s cannot be changed, meaning that all 0s must come before all 2s, or vice versa, depending on their original order.\n\nWait, that's an interesting point. So if in the original string, a 0 appears before a 2, then in the final string, that 0 must still appear before that 2. Because you can't swap 0 and 2 directly, and moving 0 past 2 would require a way to swap them, which isn't allowed.\n\nSimilarly, if a 2 appears before a 0, you can't swap them, so the 2 remains before the 0.\n\nWait, so this suggests that the relative ordering between 0s and 2s is fixed. So the 0s and 2s can't cross each other. Therefore, in the minimal string, all 0s must appear before all 2s if that's the original order, or vice versa.\n\nBut wait, what if there are 1s in between? For example, can a 0 and a 2 switch places via a 1?\n\nLike, consider \"012\": can the 0 and 2 switch positions? Let's see.\n\n\"012\" → can I swap 1 and 2 to get \"021\", then swap 0 and 2? No, because 0 and 2 can't be swapped. So the 0 is still before the 2. So no change.\n\nAnother example: \"102\". Let's see if we can move the 2 before the 1, making it \"012\", but then the 0 is still before the 2. So again, no change.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the relative order between 0s and 2s is indeed fixed. So the 0s must appear in the same order as they did originally relative to 2s.\n\nWait, but what about multiple 0s and 2s? Like \"00221\". So the 0s are all before the 2s. So in the minimal string, they can be arranged among themselves, but the 0s can't move past the 2s.\n\nSo this suggests that for the 0s and 2s, their relative order is fixed. So, the 0s can be reordered among themselves, but their positions relative to 2s are fixed. Similarly, the 2s can be reordered among themselves, but their positions relative to 0s are fixed.\n\nWait, but wait. If that's the case, then in the minimal string, the 0s can be arranged in any order, but all 0s must come before all 2s if that's the original order. So the 0s can't cross over 2s, but within their own group, they can be arranged optimally.\n\nSimilarly for the 2s.\n\nBut how about 1s? The 1s can be reordered among themselves, and also can be moved around 0s and 2s as much as possible, as long as they are adjacent to 0s or 2s.\n\nWait, but 1s can be swapped with 0s and 2s. So perhaps 1s can be positioned anywhere, as long as they don't interfere with the relative order of 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, maybe the 1s can be placed either before all 0s, after all 0s, before all 2s, or after all 2s, depending on what gives the lex smallest string.\n\nNo, that's not necessarily the case. Because 1s can be interspersed among 0s and 2s, but the 0s can't cross over 2s.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Split the string into three separate lists: zeros, ones, twos.\n\nWait, but that might not capture the relative order correctly. Because the original string has a specific order of 0s, 1s, and 2s, and we can't reorder 0s past 2s.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the 0s can be collected in the order they appear, but all 0s must come before any 2s. Similarly, the 2s must come after any 0s.\n\nBut wait, what if the original string has 0s and 2s interleaved? For example, \"0102\". In this case, the 0s and 2s are interleaved, but according to our earlier reasoning, their relative order is fixed. So the 0s can't cross over the 2s.\n\nSo the minimal string would have all the 0s in their original order, followed by all the 1s, followed by all the 2s in their original order.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the 0s can't be reordered among themselves beyond their original order relative to each other, but they can be moved past 1s. Similarly for 2s.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the 0s can be reordered among themselves via swapping with 1s, but their relative order to 2s is fixed. So the 0s can be arranged in any order as long as they are before all 2s.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n- Collect all 0s, 1s, and 2s from the original string, preserving their relative order among themselves.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct. Because 0s can be swapped with 1s, so their positions relative to 1s can be adjusted. So the 0s can be arranged among themselves, but their positions relative to 2s are fixed.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to collect all the 0s and 2s, maintaining their relative order, and place them in the final string in such a way that all 0s come before 2s if they were originally in that order. Then, arrange the 1s in between.\n\nBut how? Because 1s can be moved between 0s and 2s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s can be moved to the left as much as possible, and 2s to the right as much as possible, while keeping their relative order.\n\nWait, but the 0s can't cross over 2s. So for example, if the original string has a 0 before a 2, the 0 must remain before the 2 in the final string.\n\nSo, the 0s can be reordered among themselves, and 2s can be reordered among themselves, but their relative order to each other remains as in the original string.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- The 0s can be moved to their earliest possible positions, but cannot pass any 2s that are before them.\n\nWait, perhaps the 0s and 2s form two separate groups, and within each group, the characters can be reordered as needed, but the 0 group must come entirely before the 2 group if that's how they appeared originally.\n\nSo, the approach is to collect all 0s, then all 1s, then all 2s, but the 0s and 2s must appear in the same relative order as in the original string.\n\nWait, no. Because the 0s can be reordered among themselves, and the 2s can be reordered among themselves. So, the 0s can be arranged in any order among themselves, but all must come before any 2s that were after them in the original string.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to split the string into 0s, 1s, and 2s, but considering the order in which they appear.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that 0s can be reordered among themselves as much as possible, and 2s can be reordered among themselves as much as possible, but the 0s must stay before any 2s that came after them in the original string.\n\nHmm, maybe the minimal string is constructed by:\n\n1. All 0s, in their original order, but possibly reordered among themselves as much as possible.\n\n2. Then, all 1s, in their original order, but possibly reordered.\n\n3. Then, all 2s, in their original order, but possibly reordered.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily correct. Because the 0s can't pass 2s, but 1s can be interleaved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s can be moved to the front as much as possible, the 2s to the back as much as possible, and the 1s are arranged in the middle.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string is the lex smallest by arranging the 0s as early as possible, followed by 1s, followed by 2s, but ensuring that the relative order between 0s and 2s is preserved.\n\nWait, but how to model that.\n\nAlternative idea: For each character, determine its position in the minimal string.\n\nSince 0s can't cross 2s, the 0s must appear before any 2s that were after them in the original string.\n\nSimilarly, 2s can't cross 0s that were before them.\n\nSo, perhaps the 0s can be arranged as early as possible, and the 2s as late as possible, but their relative order among themselves is fixed.\n\nWait, but that's not the case. For example, in the sample input, one of the test cases is \"100210\". The output is \"001120\".\n\nLooking at the original string: '1','0','0','2','1','0'.\n\nIn the output, the 0s are all moved to the front, followed by 1s, then 2, then another 0? Wait, no. The output is \"001120\". So, the 0s are all at the beginning, then 1s, then 2, then another 0? Wait, that's confusing.\n\nWait, let me count the letters in the original string:\n\nOriginal: '1', '0', '0', '2', '1', '0' → counts: 0:3, 1:2, 2:1.\n\nOutput is '0','0','1','1','2','0' → 0:3, 1:2, 2:1.\n\nWait, so the 2 is in the fifth position. So, the 2 is after the 1s but before the last 0.\n\nBut in the original string, the 2 was at position 3 (0-based index 3). So, the 0s in the original string are at positions 1, 2, and 5.\n\nIn the output, the 0s are at positions 0,1,5.\n\nSo, the 0s have been moved to the left as much as possible, but the 2 is now in position 4. So, the 0 at position 5 is after the 2.\n\nBut that's allowed because the 2 was originally before that 0.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier reasoning, 0s can't be moved past 2s because they can't be swapped directly. So how is this possible?\n\nAh, wait, in the original string, the 2 is at index 3, and the 0 is at index 5. So, to move the 0 from index 5 to the left, past the 2, you need to swap it with the 1 at index 4, but that 1 is adjacent to 2. So, can the 0 be moved left past the 2?\n\nWait, perhaps via a series of swaps.\n\nLet me try:\n\nOriginal string: 1 0 0 2 1 0.\n\nWe want to move the 0 at position 5 to the left, past the 2 at position 3.\n\nHow?\n\nWell, the 0 at position 5 is followed by nothing. So, the 0 at 5 can't move past the 2 directly. But perhaps the 1s can be used as intermediaries.\n\nWait, but the 2 is at position 3. The 1 is at position 4, then 0 at 5.\n\nSo, the 0 at 5 can't directly move past the 2. So, perhaps the 0 at 5 can't be moved past the 2 in this case.\n\nBut in the sample output, the 0 is at position 5, after the 2. So perhaps the 0 can't be moved past the 2.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the sample output.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the output is '001120'. So, the 0s are at positions 0,1,5. The 2 is at position 4.\n\nSo, the 0 at position 5 is after the 2. But in the original string, the 2 was at position 3, and the 0 was at position 5.\n\nSo, how was that 0 moved past the 2? Because 0 can't be swapped directly with 2.\n\nHmm, perhaps my initial understanding is incorrect. Maybe the 0s can be moved past 2s via 1s acting as intermediaries.\n\nWait, let's think step by step.\n\nOriginal string: 1 0 0 2 1 0.\n\nWe can perform swaps between 1 and 2, and between 0 and 1.\n\nSo, the 2 at position 3 can be swapped with 1 at position 4 to become 1 0 0 1 2 0. Then, the 2 is at position 4, followed by 0 at position 5.\n\nNow, can the 0 at position 5 be moved left past the 2?\n\nNo, because you can't swap 0 and 2 directly. So, the 0 remains at position 5.\n\nBut in the sample output, the 0 is at position 5, and the 2 is at position 4.\n\nSo, how does the 2 get to position 4? Because in the original string, it was at position 3.\n\nAh, perhaps the 2 can be moved to the right by swapping with 1s.\n\nWait, yes. So, the 2 can be moved to the right past 1s, as per the allowed swaps.\n\nSo, in the sample, the 2 is at position 3. It can be swapped with the 1 at position 4, moving to position 4.\n\nThen, the 1 at position 4 is now at position 3, and the 2 is at 4.\n\nBut the 0 at position 5 can't move past the 2 at 4 because they can't be swapped.\n\nSo, in the output, the 2 is at position 4, and the 0 at 5 is after it.\n\nSo, in the final string, the 0s are all moved to the front as much as possible, but the 2 can be moved past 1s to the right, but can't be moved past 0s to the left.\n\nSo, the conclusion is: 0s can be reordered among themselves and can be moved past 1s, but 0s can't be moved past 2s. Similarly, 2s can be reordered among themselves and can be moved past 1s, but 2s can't be moved past 0s.\n\nSo, in the final string:\n\n- All 0s can be arranged as left as possible, but their relative order is preserved.\n\n- All 2s can be arranged as right as possible, but their relative order is preserved.\n\n- The 1s can be interleaved as necessary to allow the 0s and 2s to be in their optimal positions.\n\nWait, but how to model this.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to process the string and determine, for each 0, whether it can be moved to the left past the 1s, and for each 2, whether it can be moved to the right past the 1s.\n\nBut how to arrange the 0s and 2s without crossing each other.\n\nAnother approach is to think of the string as consisting of three groups: 0s, 1s, and 2s. The 0s can be reordered among themselves, as can the 2s, but the 0s must appear before the 2s if that's their original order.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right because the 0s can be reordered among themselves, but their relative order to 2s is fixed.\n\nSo, for the 0s, their order can be optimized as per their own sequence, but they must all come before the 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the 0s can be moved to the earliest possible positions, as much as possible, while the 2s can be moved to the latest possible positions.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\n- For each 0 in the string, move it as far left as possible, but without crossing any 2s.\n\n- For each 2 in the string, move it as far right as possible, but without crossing any 0s.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s can be collected in a list, then the 1s in another, then the 2s. But that would ignore the relative order of 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, but perhaps the 0s can be arranged in any order among themselves, and similarly for the 2s, but all 0s must come before 2s.\n\nSo, the minimal string is the concatenation of:\n\n- All 0s, arranged in any order (but perhaps sorted to be earliest).\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the 0s can be swapped with 1s, so their order can be changed relative to 1s.\n\nWait, perhaps the 0s can be arranged as left as possible, but their relative order to each other can be anything, as long as the overall order relative to 2s is maintained.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis seems complex. Maybe I need to find a way to represent the 0s and 2s in their relative order, and arrange the 1s around them.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is similar to the problem where you can swap adjacent elements, but only certain pairs.\n\nWait, in that case, perhaps we can model the problem as a graph where each node is a character, and edges represent allowed swaps. But that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as being able to swap 0s and 1s, and 1s and 2s, but 0s and 2s can't be swapped.\n\nIn this scenario, the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed, but 0s and 1s can be reordered, and 2s and 1s can be reordered.\n\nSo, the 0s can be arranged in any order relative to each other, as long as their relative order to 2s is the same as in the original string.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Extract all 0s, 1s, and 2s, keeping their original order.\n\nBut wait, no. Because 0s can be reordered among themselves via 1s. So, for example, a 0 can be moved past a 1, which can be moved past another 0.\n\nSo, the 0s can be reordered in any way among themselves, as long as their relative order to 2s is fixed.\n\nSo, perhaps the 0s can be arranged in any order, and the 2s can be arranged in any order, but all 0s must appear before all 2s.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because the 0s can't cross 2s, but 1s can be arranged in between.\n\nWait, no. Because 1s can be reordered, and can be placed between 0s and 2s.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal string is formed by:\n\n- All 0s, in any order, but arranged as early as possible.\n\n- All 1s, arranged in the middle.\n\n- All 2s, arranged as late as possible.\n\nBut how to handle the relative order of 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, maybe the 0s can be moved to the left as much as possible, and the 2s can be moved to the right as much as possible, but their relative order is fixed.\n\nSo, for each 0, we can move it as far left as possible, but not past any 2 that was originally before it.\n\nSimilarly, for each 2, we can move it as far right as possible, but not past any 0 that was originally after it.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Identify the positions of all 0s, 1s, and 2s in the original string.\n\n2. For each 0, determine the earliest possible position it can reach without crossing any 2s that are originally before it.\n\n3. For each 2, determine the latest possible position it can reach without crossing any 0s that are originally after it.\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by treating 0s and 2s as two separate groups that can't intermingle, but can be reordered within their own group.\n\nIn that case, the minimal string is the concatenation of the 0s (sorted in any way) + 1s (sorted in any way) + 2s (sorted in any way), but subject to the relative order constraints.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because 0s can be reordered among themselves, but the 2s can't be reordered past 0s.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to process the string and for each 0, determine how far to the left it can be moved, and for each 2, how far to the right it can be moved, without crossing each other.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently, especially given that the string can be up to 1e5 characters long.\n\nAn alternative idea is inspired by the concept of greedy algorithms for rearrangement under certain constraints.\n\nHere's a possible approach:\n\n- The 0s can be moved as far left as possible, but their relative order to 2s is fixed.\n\n- Similarly, the 2s can be moved as far right as possible, but their relative order to 0s is fixed.\n\n- The 1s can be reordered among themselves, but also can be moved around 0s and 2s as much as possible.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAnother idea: Since 0s can be swapped with 1s, and 2s can be swapped with 1s, the 1s can act as intermediaries between 0s and 2s. So, 0s can be moved to the left, even past 2s, provided that there's a 1 to facilitate the movement.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps it's possible to have a 0 move past a 2 by first swapping the 2 with a 1 that's before the 0, allowing the 0 to then swap with the 1, effectively moving it past the 2.\n\nWait, let's take an example.\n\nSuppose the string is \"012\". Can the 0 and 2 swap positions?\n\nOriginal: 0,1,2.\n\nWe can swap 1 and 2 to get 0,2,1.\n\nThen, can we swap 0 and 2? No, because 0 and 2 can't be swapped. So the 0 remains before the 2.\n\nBut the 2 is now after the 0, but the 0 can't be moved past the 2.\n\nSo, in this case, the 0 remains before the 2.\n\nSo, in this example, the relative order between 0 and 2 is preserved.\n\nAnother example: \"201\".\n\nCan we swap the 2 and 0? No. So the 0 can't move past the 2.\n\nBut perhaps via 1s.\n\nWait, another example: \"210\".\n\nWe can't swap 2 and 1, but 1 and 0 can be swapped.\n\nSo, \"210\" becomes \"201\". Now, the 2 is before the 0.\n\nCan we swap 2 and 0? No.\n\nSo, the 0 remains after the 2.\n\nThus, the relative order of 0 and 2 is preserved.\n\nAnother example: \"120\".\n\nWe can swap 2 and 1 to get 102.\n\nThen, can the 0 move past the 1? Yes.\n\nSo, the 0 is now before the 1, but the 2 is after the 1.\n\nSo, in the new string, the 0 is before the 1, and the 2 is after the 1.\n\nSo, the relative order of 0 and 2 is preserved.\n\nSo, in all these examples, the relative order between 0 and 2 is preserved.\n\nSo, the conclusion is: the relative order between 0 and 2 is fixed.\n\nThus, the 0s must appear before the 2s if they did so in the original string, and vice versa.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- The 0s can be reordered among themselves as much as possible, but must all appear before any 2s.\n\n- The 2s can be reordered among themselves as much as possible, but must all appear after any 0s.\n\n- The 1s can be reordered among themselves, and can be moved around 0s and 2s as much as possible.\n\nSo, the minimal string is formed by arranging the 0s as early as possible, followed by the 1s, followed by the 2s, but within their own constraints.\n\nWait, but how to arrange the 0s and 2s when they are interleaved with 1s.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the 0s can be moved as far left as possible, but their relative order among themselves is preserved. Similarly, the 2s can be moved as far right as possible, but their relative order among themselves is preserved.\n\nMoreover, the 1s can be reordered and placed in any position, as long as the 0s and 2s are arranged as per their constraints.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Separate the string into three groups: zeros, ones, and twos, preserving their original order.\n\nBut wait, the original order of the 0s and 2s must be preserved relative to each other. So, for example, if a 0 comes before a 2 in the original string, in the minimal string, that 0 must come before all 2s that were after it.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- For each 0 in the string, determine its earliest possible position in the final string, considering that it can't move past any 2s that were before it.\n\nSimilarly, for each 2, determine its latest possible position, considering that it can't move past any 0s that were after it.\n\nWait, but how to compute this.\n\nAnother idea: model the problem as having two separate queues for 0s and 2s, and a buffer for 1s. Then, for each position, decide whether to take a 0, a 1, or a 2, based on the earliest available options.\n\nWait, perhaps a simulation approach.\n\nLet's think of the process as building the result string step by step.\n\nAt each step, choose the smallest possible character available, considering the constraints.\n\nBut since 0s can be moved past 1s, but not 2s, and 2s can be moved past 1s, but not 0s, the available choices depend on the current state.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach can work:\n\n- Have pointers for the start of the 0s, 1s, and 2s.\n\n- At each step, select the smallest possible character among the 0s, 1s, and 2s, considering their positions and the constraints.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the 0s can be considered as a pool that can be accessed from the left, and the 2s as a pool that can be accessed from the right, and the 1s can be accessed from anywhere.\n\nSo, for each position in the result, we can choose the smallest possible character that can be placed there, given the current state.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If the next character in 0s is smaller than the next in 2s, and there are no 1s that can be placed earlier, choose the 0.\n\n- Else if there's a 1 that can be placed, choose the smallest 1.\n\n- Else, choose the next 2.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s and 2s are processed in a way that their relative order is preserved, and the 1s are placed in the remaining positions.\n\nBut how.\n\nAnother idea is inspired by the fact that 0s can be moved past 1s, and 2s can be moved past 1s.\n\nSo, perhaps the 0s can be arranged in any order among themselves, but all must come before the 2s.\n\nSimilarly, the 2s can be arranged in any order among themselves, but all must come after the 0s.\n\nBut this is only possible if the 0s and 2s are completely separated by 1s.\n\nWait, but that's not always the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s can be arranged as a prefix, then the 1s, then the 2s, but this is not necessarily correct.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: '100210'\n\nThe output is '001120'.\n\nBreaking down the input:\n\nCharacters: 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0.\n\nZeros: 0,0,0 (positions 1,2,5)\n\nOnes: 1,1 (positions 0,4)\n\nTwos: 2 (position 3)\n\nIn the output, the 0s are all at the beginning, followed by the 1s, then the 2, then another 0.\n\nWait, that's odd. Because the 2 is in position 4, but the 0 is in position 5. So, in the output, the 0 is after the 2.\n\nBut according to our earlier reasoning, the relative order between 0 and 2 should be preserved.\n\nWait, but in the original string, the 0 at position 5 comes after the 2 at position 3. So, the 0 can't be moved before the 2. So, the output shouldn't have that 0 after the 2.\n\nBut in the sample output, it does. So, perhaps our earlier reasoning was wrong.\n\nSo, this indicates that 0s can be moved past 2s via 1s.\n\nSo, perhaps the 0s can be moved past 2s, but only if there's a 1 between them.\n\nSo, perhaps the 0 can be moved past a 2 by first swapping the 2 with a 1, then the 0 can swap with the 1, thereby moving the 0 past the 2.\n\nWait, let's think of the example:\n\nOriginal string: 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0.\n\nLet's see:\n\nWe can swap 2 and 1 (positions 3 and 4) to get 1,0,0,1,2,0.\n\nThen, the 0 at position 5 can be swapped with the 1 at position 4, resulting in 1,0",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing allowed swaps on a given ternary string. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', and between adjacent '1' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that while '0's can be reordered among themselves and '2's can be reordered among themselves, their relative order with respect to each other remains fixed. This means that any '0' that appears before a '2' in the original string will also appear before that '2' in the resulting string, and vice versa. \n\nTo achieve the lexicographically smallest string:\n1. **Separate the characters**: Extract all '0's, '1's, and '2's from the original string while preserving their relative order.\n2. **Reconstruct the string**: Place all '0's as early as possible, followed by '1's, and then '2's, ensuring that the relative order of '0's and '2's is preserved.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    # Collect zeros, ones, twos while preserving their order\n    zeros = []\n    ones = []\n    twos = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '0':\n            zeros.append(c)\n        elif c == '1':\n            ones.append(c)\n        else:\n            twos.append(c)\n    \n    # Now, reconstruct the minimal string\n    result = []\n    i = j = k = 0  # indices for zeros, ones, twos\n    while i < len(zeros) or j < len(ones) or k < len(twos):\n        if i < len(zeros) and (j >= len(ones) or (k >= len(twos) and (zeros[i] < ones[j] if j < len(ones) else -1))):\n            result.append(zeros[i])\n            i += 1\n        elif j < len(ones) and (i >= len(zeros) or (k >= len(twos) and (ones[j] < twos[k] if k < len(twos) else -1))):\n            result.append(ones[j])\n            j += 1\n        else:\n            result.append(twos[k])\n            k += 1\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Read input and output the result\ns = input().strip()\nprint(min_ternary_string(s))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Collecting Characters**: We first iterate through the input string and collect all '0's, '1's, and '2's into separate lists, preserving their original order.\n2. **Reconstructing the String**: Using pointers for each list of characters, we construct the result string by always choosing the smallest possible character that can be placed next. This ensures that '0's come as early as possible, followed by '1's, and then '2's, while maintaining their relative order.\n\nThis approach efficiently constructs the lexicographically smallest string by leveraging the allowed swaps and the constraints on character movement.",
