Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"TV Game,\" and from the description, I need to find a sequence of moves for Homer and Marge that maximizes their total prize. \n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step. The game involves two players taking turns picking digits from a string A. Each player makes exactly n moves. On each turn, the current player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their number. Then that digit is removed from A. So, initially, both S1 (Homer) and S2 (Marge) are empty strings. After all moves, the prize for each depends on their respective numbers.\n\nOur goal is to determine the order of H and M (since each move is either Homer or Marge) such that when all moves are made, the sum of the prizes S1 and S2 is as large as possible. And if there are multiple ways to achieve this maximum sum, we can output any.\n\nHmm, how do I model this? It seems like a dynamic programming problem because we're making a series of choices (assigning each digit to either player) with the goal of maximizing some value, and the choice affects future states.\n\nLet me think about the state representation. Since each digit is taken in order, the state can be represented by the current position in the string A and which player is about to make the next move. Wait, but wait: the turns alternate between the two players. So after each move, the next player is determined. So perhaps the state should include which player is to take the next digit.\n\nWait, no. Because the players alternate turns. So for example, the first move is player 1, second is player 2, third is player 1, and so on. So the state could be represented by the current index in the string and whether it's player 1's turn or not.\n\nBut given that each player must make exactly n moves, the state also needs to track how many moves each has made so far. So perhaps the state is (pos, h, m), where pos is the current position in A, h is the number of moves made by Homer, and m is the number by Marge. But since h + m = pos (since each move consumes one digit), maybe we can just track pos and who is to move next.\n\nYes, because h + m = pos, since each move uses one digit. So the state can be (pos, turn), where turn indicates whose turn it is next. Since the initial turn is player 1 (Homer), then after each move, it alternates.\n\nThe objective is to assign each digit to either player 1 or 2, ensuring each gets exactly n digits, and maximize the sum of their numbers.\n\nSo the DP approach would involve considering for each position, and each possible turn, the best way to assign the current digit and proceed.\n\nBut wait, the sum is based on the numerical value of S1 and S2. How do we represent the contribution of each digit to this sum?\n\nEach digit assigned to S1 increases its value by 10^(length - 1 - current_pos_in_S1). Similarly for S2. Hmm, that's a bit tricky because the positions affect the weight of each digit.\n\nFor example, if a digit is placed as the first digit of S1, it contributes 10^(n-1) * digit. If it's the second, it's 10^(n-2), and so on.\n\nSo the key is to model the current state of S1 and S2's lengths, as each new digit affects the weight at which they contribute to the total sum.\n\nWait, but that's impossible because the state space becomes too large. For each possible length of S1 and S2, and each position in the string, it's computationally intensive.\n\nHmm, maybe we can precompute the weight of each digit based on when it's added to S1 or S2.\n\nWait, here's another idea: the order in which digits are added determines their place value. So, for each digit, the earlier it's added to a player's string, the higher its contribution. So, to maximize the total, we want the largest digits to be placed as early as possible in the strings of the players.\n\nBut since the assignment is interdependent (each digit can go to either player, but each player has exactly n digits), it's a matter of choosing which player gets which digit in a way that maximizes the overall sum.\n\nSo perhaps we can model this as a problem where each digit's contribution is determined by when it's placed in S1 or S2. The earlier the digit is placed in a longer string, the higher its weight.\n\nWait, let's think about the weight of a digit in S1. Suppose S1 has k digits so far. When a new digit is added, it's placed at",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for two players, Homer and Marge, to maximize their total prize in a TV game. The game involves taking turns to pick digits from a given string, with each player making exactly `n` moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of the numerical values of the numbers formed by each player's collected digits.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming (DP). The key idea is to model the state based on the current position in the string and whose turn it is next. Each state will keep track of the maximum possible sum achievable from that point onward.\n\n1. **State Representation**: Use a DP table where `dp[pos][turn]` represents the maximum sum achievable starting from position `pos` with `turn` indicating whose turn it is next (0 for Homer, 1 for Marge).\n\n2. **Transition**: For each state, consider assigning the current digit to either player. Update the DP table by considering both possibilities and choosing the one that maximizes the sum.\n\n3. **Weight Calculation**: Each digit's contribution to the sum depends on its position in the respective player's number. The earlier a digit is placed, the higher its weight. This is precomputed for efficiency.\n\n4. **Memoization**: Use memoization to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations and improve efficiency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Precompute the weights for each position\n    weight = [0] * (2 * n)\n    for i in range(2 * n):\n        # The digit is at position i (0-based), so the length of the current S is i\n        # So the new digit is added as the (i+1)th digit, contributing 10^(i) * digit_value\n        weight[i] = 10 ** i\n    \n    # Now, model the problem with DP\n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(pos, turn):\n        if pos == 2 * n:\n            return 0\n        max_sum = 0\n        current_digit = int(A[pos])\n        # Assign the current digit to either player\n        if turn == 0:\n            # Assign to Homer\n            # Compute the contribution: current_digit * weight[pos]\n            # Then, add the best possible sum from the next state (pos+1, 1)\n            option1 = current_digit * weight[pos] + dp(pos + 1, 1)\n            # Also, assign to Marge and take the best\n            option2 = dp(pos + 1, 0)\n            max_sum = max(option1, option2)\n        else:\n            # Assign to Marge\n            option1 = current_digit * weight[pos] + dp(pos + 1, 0)\n            option2 = dp(pos + 1, 1)\n            max_sum = max(option1, option2)\n        return max_sum\n    \n    # Now, reconstruct the path\n    result = []\n    pos = 0\n    turn = 0  # initial turn is Homer's\n    total = dp(pos, turn)\n    \n    while pos < 2 * n:\n        current_digit = int(A[pos])\n        if turn == 0:\n            # Check if assigning to Homer is better\n            sum_homer = current_digit * weight[pos] + dp(pos + 1, 1)\n            sum_marge = dp(pos + 1, 0)\n            if sum_homer >= sum_marge:\n                result.append('H')\n                pos += 1\n                turn = 1\n            else:\n                result.append('M')\n                pos += 1\n                turn = 0\n        else:\n            sum_marge = current_digit * weight[pos] + dp(pos + 1, 0)\n            sum_homer = dp(pos + 1, 1)\n            if sum_marge >= sum_homer:\n                result.append('M')\n                pos += 1\n                turn = 0\n            else:\n                result.append('H')\n                pos += 1\n                turn = 1\n    \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Weights**: The weight of each digit is determined by its position in the string, with higher positions having higher weights.\n2. **Dynamic Programming**: The DP function `dp(pos, turn)` calculates the maximum sum starting from position `pos` with the given `turn`.\n3. **Memoization**: Using `lru_cache` to store results of subproblems ensures efficient computation.\n4. **Reconstruction**: After computing the maximum sum, backtrack to determine the optimal sequence of moves by checking which player (Homer or Marge) should take each digit to maximize the sum.\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible sequences of moves efficiently and select the one that maximizes the total prize for both players.",
