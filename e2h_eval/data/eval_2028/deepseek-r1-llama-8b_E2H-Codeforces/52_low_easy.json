Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Vasily has some candles and can make new ones from the stubs. The goal is to find out how many hours he can keep the room lit. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nHmm, the problem says that each candle burns for one hour before going out. Then, b of these stubs can be made into a new candle. So the process is: burn as many candles as possible, collect the stubs, exchange them for new candles, and repeat until you don't have enough stubs left to make any more.\n\nLet me take the example given. For input 4 2: initially, 4 candles. They burn for 4 hours. Then, he takes those 4 stubs and makes 2 new candles. He burns those, adding 2 hours, making total 6. Then, he has 2 stubs again, which he uses to make another candle. That's another hour, totaling 7. Now, he only has one stub, which isn't enough to make another candle. So the answer is 7.\n\nSo the approach is to simulate this process step by step. Start with the initial number of candles 'a'. Burn all of them, add 'a' to the total hours. Then, collect 'a' stubs. Exchange them for (a // b) new candles. The remaining stubs are a % b. Add the new candles to the total, and then burn them, adding their count to the total hours. The stubs from these new candles are added to the existing ones.\n\nWait, no. Wait: when you make new candles, each candle comes from b stubs. So for every x new candles made, you spend b*x stubs and get x candles. Each of those x candles contributes 1 hour each, so x more hours. Also, after burning, they produce x stubs, which are added back to the pool.\n\nSo perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize total_hours = 0\n2. current_stubs = a\n3. While current_stubs >= b:\n   a. Make new_candles = current_stubs // b\n   b. total_hours += new_candles\n   c. current_stubs = (current_stubs % b) + new_candles  # because new_candles are burned and now become stubs.\n4. Return total_hours.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait let's test this logic with the first example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ncurrent_stubs =4.\n\nLoop since 4>=2.\n\nnew_candles=2.\n\ntotal becomes 2. current_stubs =4%2=0 +2=2.\n\nAgain, 2>=2: new_candles=1. total becomes 3. current_stubs =0+1=1.\n\nNow 1<2, loop ends. total is 3? Wait wait, that's not right. Because in the example, the total was 7.\n\nWait, I must have missed something. Oh wait, the initial a is 4. So the initial step is to burn all 4, which adds 4 hours. Then, the stubs are 4, which can make 2 new candles. So the total is 4+2=6. Then, those 2 new candles burn, adding 2 hours, total 8. Then, the stubs are 2, which make 1 new candle. So total 9. But wait the example says 7. Hmm, maybe my initial understanding is wrong.\n\nWait wait no, the example says that the initial four candles are burned, giving 4 hours. Then, using 4 stubs, make 2 candles, which add 2 hours. Then, after burning those, stubs are 2, which make another candle (adding 1 hour). Now stubs are 1, which is less than 2. So total is 4+2+1=7. So how does my algorithm compute this?\n\nAh! Oh right, because in the algorithm, I'm only adding the new_candles each time, but not considering the initial a. Because in the initial state, the a is already burned. So perhaps the algorithm should start by adding a to the total, then process the stubs.\n\nSo the steps should be:\n\n1. total = a\n2. current_stubs = a\n3. while current_stubs >=b:\n   a. new = current_stubs // b\n   b. total += new\n   c. current_stubs = (current_stubs %b) + new\n4. return total.\n\nAh, yes, that's the correct approach.\n\nLet me test this with the first example.\n\nInitial a=4. total=4.\n\ncurrent_stubs=4.\n\nLoop:\n\nnew =4//2=2. total becomes 6. current_stubs=0 +2=2.\n\nLoop again:",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has. Each candle burns for exactly one hour before going out, and Vasily can convert a certain number of burned-out candles into new ones to continue burning.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start by burning all the initial candles. This gives us the initial count of hours the room can be lit.\n2. **Recycle Process**: After burning the initial candles, collect the stubs and use them to make new candles. Each new candle requires a fixed number of stubs (given as `b`).\n3. **Iterative Recycling**: Continue recycling the stubs into new candles until there are not enough stubs left to make another candle. Each time new candles are made, add the count of these new candles to the total hours as they will each burn for an hour.\n4. **Update Stubs**: After making new candles from the stubs, update the count of stubs to include both the remaining stubs after making new candles and the stubs from the newly burned candles.\n\nThis approach ensures that we optimally use every possible stub to maximize the illumination time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Burn**: The initial number of candles `a` is burned, contributing `a` hours to the total.\n2. **Recycling Loop**: While there are enough stubs (`stubs >= b`), convert stubs into new candles. Each iteration calculates how many new candles can be made, adds this count to the total hours, and updates the stub count to reflect the new stubs from the burned new candles plus any remaining stubs after conversion.\n3. **Termination**: The loop terminates when there are not enough stubs to make another candle, and the total hours are printed.\n\nThis method efficiently recycles stubs and ensures that every possible hour of illumination is accounted for.",
