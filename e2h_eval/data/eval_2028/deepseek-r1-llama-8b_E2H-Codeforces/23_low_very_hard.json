In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about determining the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu in her hand. Mentsu can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). \n\nHmm. So the input is three tiles, each represented by a string like '1m', '2p', etc. The output is three integers, each representing the minimal draws needed for each of the three cases. Oh wait, no—wait, the output is the minimal number of draws needed overall, but looking at the example, the output is three numbers, which I think correspond to each of the three initial hands. Or maybe not. Wait, the sample input is three strings, and the output is three integers. Oh, right, because each of the three hands could require different minimal draws. So for each of the three initial hands, we need to compute the minimal number of draws required to make that particular hand have at least one mentsu.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says \"print a single integer—the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\" But the sample output has three numbers. Oh wait, looking back, the problem statement says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" Then the input is three strings, and the output is three integers. So each of the three initial hands is considered separately, and for each, we need to compute the minimal draws required to form a mentsu in that particular hand.\n\nWait, no. Or perhaps, the initial three tiles are all part of the same hand. Wait, the problem says she has three tiles in her hand. She can draw any tiles, including those already present. So the initial three are part of the same set of tiles, and when she draws more, the total includes the original three plus the drawn ones. So for all the four tiles (including the three originals), we need to find the minimal number of draws such that among all the tiles, there's at least one mentsu.\n\nWait, no. Because the output in the sample is three integers, each corresponding to the three initial tiles' groups. Or perhaps the problem is that each of the three initial hands is treated as separate scenarios, each requiring their own calculation. Because in the sample, the input is three lines, but wait, no, the input is one line with three strings. So the three strings represent the initial three tiles, and the problem is to consider all possible additional tiles drawn (including none) such that the total set (original three plus any drawn) forms at least one mentsu. But the output is three integers, which suggests that for each of the three initial tiles, the minimal draws required to form a mentsu in their respective subsets? Or perhaps the output is three integers, each representing the minimal draws needed for each of the three possible mentsu possibilities across all tiles.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nThe task is to determine the minimal number of extra tiles needed so that she can form at least one mentsu. But the output is three integers, each being the minimal for each of the three initial tiles' possibilities. Or perhaps, no, the output is three integers, each corresponding to each of the three tiles in the input, representing how many draws are needed for each of them to form a mentsu on their own. That doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSample Output:\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nExplanation: For the first case, the tiles form a shuntsu (1s,2s,3s), so zero draws. Second case is a koutsu, so zero draws. Third case needs one tile to complete a shuntsu (like 4p).\n\nSo the output is three integers, each representing the minimal draws needed for each of the three initial hands. So for each initial hand, compute the minimal number of tiles needed to be added so that that hand (the three given tiles plus the added ones) contains at least one mentsu.\n\nAh, okay. So for each of the three initial hands, we need to calculate the minimal number of draws required for that specific hand to form a mentsu. Then, output the three numbers.\n\nSo our approach should be: for each of the three initial sets of three tiles, compute the minimal number of additional tiles needed to form a mentsu. Then output the three numbers.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the three initial tiles are all part of the same hand, and the minimal draws is based on adding tiles to that entire hand. But in the sample, each output corresponds to the initial three tiles, implying",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) from her hand. Each initial hand consists of three tiles, and we need to compute the minimal draws required for each of these three hands individually.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Mentsu Types**: A mentsu can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu).\n   - **Triplet (Koutsu)**: Three identical tiles.\n   - **Sequence (Shuntsu)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n2. **Check Current Hand for Mentsu**: For each initial hand, check if it already forms a mentsu. If it does, the required draws are zero.\n3. **Calculate Minimum Draws**:\n   - **For Triplet**: Check how many more tiles are needed to form a triplet from any of the existing tiles.\n   - **For Sequence**: Check how many more tiles are needed to extend any existing sequence to form a valid shuntsu.\n4. **Determine the Minimum**: For each hand, determine the minimum number of additional tiles needed to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef min_draws(tiles):\n    suits = {'m', 'p', 's'}\n    tiles = [tile.replace(' ', '') for tile in tiles]\n    \n    # Function to check if current tiles form a mentsu\n    def has_mentsu(t):\n        count = {}\n        seq = []\n        for tile in t:\n            num = int(tile[:-1])\n            suit = tile[-1]\n            count[num] = count.get(num, 0) + 1\n            seq.append(num)\n        \n        # Check for triplet\n        for num in count:\n            if count[num] >= 3:\n                return True\n        \n        # Check for sequence\n        sorted_seq = sorted(seq)\n        for i in range(len(sorted_seq) - 2):\n            a, b, c = sorted_seq[i], sorted_seq[i+1], sorted_seq[i+2]\n            if b == a + 1 and c == b + 1:\n                return True\n        return False\n    \n    # For each possible mentsu type, compute the minimal draws needed\n    # Check all possible triplets\n    min_tri = float('inf')\n    seen = set()\n    for tile in tiles:\n        num = int(tile[:-1])\n        suit = tile[-1]\n        if num not in seen:\n            seen.add(num)\n            # To form a triplet, need two more of the same\n            min_tri = min(min_tri, 2)\n    # Check all possible sequences\n    min_seq = float('inf')\n    # Collect all possible sequences\n    for suit in suits:\n        nums = []\n        for tile in tiles:\n            if tile[0] == suit:\n                num = int(tile[:-1])\n                nums.append(num)\n        nums.sort()\n        # Find the longest possible sequence in this suit\n        max_len = 0\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            j = i\n            while j < len(nums) and nums[j+1] == nums[j] + 1:\n                j += 1\n            current_len = j - i\n            if current_len > max_len:\n                max_len = current_len\n        if max_len >= 3:\n            # No need to add any tiles\n            min_seq = 0\n        else:\n            # Need to find how many to add to extend the max_len\n            # For example, if max_len is 2, need 1 more\n            # Or if max_len is 1, need 2 more\n            needed = 3 - max_len\n            min_seq = needed\n    # Now, the minimal between forming a triplet or a sequence\n    overall_min = min(min_tri, min_seq)\n    return overall_min\n\n# Read input\ninput_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\ntiles_list = input_line.split()\ntiles = [tiles_list[i] for i in range(3)]\n\n# Compute minimal draws for each of the three initial hands\nresult = []\nfor hand in tiles:\n    result.append(str(min_draws(hand)))\n\nprint(' '.join(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution processes each initial hand separately to determine the minimal number of draws needed to form a mentsu.
