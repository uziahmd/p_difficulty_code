Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is related to Morse code and counting the number of valid substrings after each modification to a string S.\n\nHmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, each character in Morse code is represented by a string of 0s and 1s with lengths from 1 to 4. But not all possible combinations correspond to an English letter. Specifically, four strings are invalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So when processing a substring, it shouldn't be one of these four.\n\nThe task is, after each modification (adding a '0' or '1' to S), to output the number of non-empty substrings that represent valid English letters. And since the numbers can get huge, we need to compute them modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, okay, the key points are:\n\n- For each step, after adding a character, consider all possible substrings ending at that position.\n- Each such substring must not be one of the four invalid patterns.\n- We need to count how many of these substrings are valid, considering their Morse code representation.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"some substring of S in Morse code.\" Oh right, because each substring corresponds to a Morse code pattern, which might map to a letter or not.\n\nSo, for every possible substring of the current S, we check if its Morse code is valid. Then, we count all such valid substrings across all possible positions.\n\nBut directly checking every possible substring each time would be computationally expensive, especially since m can be up to 3000, and each step could add a lot of substrings. So, we need an efficient way to track this.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming or some kind of state tracking approach.\n\nWait, each new character added can form new substrings that end at this position. For example, if the string is s_1 s_2 ... s_n, then adding s_{n+1} will create substrings s_{n+1}, s_n s_{n+1}, ..., s_1 ... s_{n+1}.\n\nEach of these new substrings needs to be checked against the invalid patterns. If the substring is valid, it contributes to the total count.\n\nBut instead of checking each substring every time, maybe we can keep track of the valid substrings as we build the string incrementally.\n\nSo, perhaps for each position i, we can track all possible substrings ending at i that are valid. Then, the total count is the sum over all these substrings.\n\nBut the issue is that the length of these substrings can vary from 1 to 4. Because Morse code can only represent strings up to 4 characters long. Wait, no: the problem says each letter is represented by a string of length 1 to 4. So any longer substring won't correspond to a single letter. Therefore, for any substring longer than 4, it can't be a valid Morse code. So, when considering substrings, we only need to look at the last 1, 2, 3, or 4 characters.\n\nAh, that's a crucial point. So for each new character, we only need to consider the last 1, 2, 3, 4 characters as possible substrings. Because any longer substring would have a length >=5, which is invalid.\n\nSo, for each new character, we can look back up to 4 steps and check all possible substrings ending at this character, with lengths 1, 2, 3, or 4. But wait, for the first few steps, the string might be shorter than 4, so we have to adjust.\n\nSo here's an idea: for each position i (after adding the new character), we'll consider all possible substrings ending at i with lengths 1 to min(4, i). For each such substring, we check if it's one of the four invalid patterns. If it's not, then it's a valid Morse code, so we add 1 to the total count.\n\nBut even better, perhaps we can precompute for each possible substring whether it's valid, and then keep a running total of how many valid substrings exist up to the current step.\n\nAlternatively, we can model this using a DP approach where dp[i] represents the number of valid substrings ending at position i. Then, the total count is the sum of all dp[i] for all i.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each new character, we look back up to 4 positions and check for each possible substring whether it's valid. If it is, we add 1 to the current dp[i], but also consider overlapping possibilities.\n\nWait, let's formalize this.\n\nLet's denote that S has length n after the m-th operation. For each position i (from 1 to n),",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to efficiently count the number of valid Morse code substrings after each modification to a string S. Each modification appends either a '0' or '1' to S, and we need to consider all possible substrings ending at the new character, checking if they form a valid Morse code pattern.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each letter in Morse code is represented by a string of '0's and '1's of lengths 1 to 4. However, four specific strings are invalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". For each modification to the string S, we need to count how many non-empty substrings ending at the new character are valid.\n\n2. **Efficient Checking**: Instead of checking every possible substring each time, we use dynamic programming. We maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid substrings ending at position `i`. We only need to check substrings of lengths 1 to 4 ending at the current position since longer substrings cannot be valid Morse codes.\n\n3. **Precomputation**: We precompute which 4-character combinations are invalid. This allows us to quickly determine if a substring of length 4 is invalid.\n\n4. **Dynamic Programming Update**: For each new character added to S, we update the `dp` array by considering all valid substrings ending at the new position. If a substring is valid, we increment the corresponding `dp` value.\n\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be large, we take results modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n# Precompute invalid patterns\ninvalid_4 = {\n    '0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'\n}\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    s = []\n    for i in range(1, m+1):\n        c = input[i]\n        s.append(c)\n    \n    total = 0\n    dp = [0] * (len(s) + 1)  # 1-based index\n    for i in range(1, len(s)+1):\n        current = s[i-1]\n        dp[i] = 0\n        # Check substrings of length 1\n        substr = current\n        if substr not in invalid_4:\n            dp[i] += 1\n        # Check substrings of length 2\n        if i >= 2:\n            substr = s[i-2] + current\n            if substr not in invalid_4:\n                dp[i] += 1\n        # Check substrings of length 3\n        if i >= 3:\n            substr = s[i-3] + s[i-2] + current\n            if substr not in invalid_4:\n                dp[i] += 1\n        # Check substrings of length 4\n        if i >= 4:\n            substr = s[i-4:i] + current\n            if substr not in invalid_4:\n                dp[i] += 1\n        total = (total + dp[i]) % MOD\n        print(total)\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Precomputation**: We store the invalid 4-character Morse code patterns in a set for quick lookup.\n- **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**: This array keeps track of valid substrings ending at each position. For each new character, we check substrings of lengths 1 to 4 ending at that position.\n- **Efficiency**: By only checking up to 4 characters back, the solution efficiently handles each modification in constant time, making it suitable for large inputs up to 3000 modifications.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count valid Morse code substrings after each modification, providing the required results in an optimal manner.",
