The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Neko Finds Grapes.\" Hmm, sounds interesting. So, Neko found some treasure chests and keys. The goal is to open as many chests as possible using the keys.\n\nLet me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, each chest has a number a_i and each key has b_j. A key can unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd. That means either one is even and the other is odd because even + odd = odd. Oh right, but wait, no: wait, 1+2=3 which is odd. Yes. So for each key j and chest i, a_i + b_j must be congruent to 1 mod 2, which is equivalent to being odd.\n\nEach key can be used once at most, and each chest can be opened once.\n\nThe task is to find the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\nHmm, so the approach here is to pair keys and chests such that their sum is odd, and each key is used once, each chest once.\n\nI think the key here is to count how many even and odd numbers are in the chests and the keys, then determine the maximum possible pairs.\n\nWait, because for a key to open a chest, their types (even or odd) must differ.\n\nSo let's separate the a's into even and odd counts, same for the b's.\n\nSuppose:\n\n- Number of even a's: A_even\n- Number of odd a's: A_odd = n - A_even\n\nSimilarly, for b's:\n\n- Number of even b's: B_even\n- Number of odd b's: B_odd = m - B_even\n\nNow, when a key is even, it can only open an odd a, and when a key is odd, it can only open an even a.\n\nSo the maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum between the available keys of each type and the available chests of the opposite type.\n\nWait, yes. So the maximum possible is min(A_even, B_odd) + min(A_odd, B_even).\n\nBut wait, why? Because for each even key, we can use it on an odd a. And for each odd key, we can use it on an even a.\n\nSo the total is the sum of these two minima.\n\nThat makes sense. So the plan is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd a's.\n2. Count the number of even and odd b's.\n3. Compute the sum of min(A_even, B_odd) + min(A_odd, B_even).\n4. Output that sum.\n\nWait, but is there any scenario where this isn't the maximum? For example, maybe if after pairing some, others can't be paired optimally. But I think that the optimal way is to match all possible even keys with odd a's, and all possible odd keys with even a's. Because any other matching would result in fewer pairs.\n\nSo yes, that approach should work.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nn=5, m=4.\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\nb = [8,4,7,20]\n\nSo a's are: 9 (odd), 14 (even), 6 (even), 2 (even), 11 (odd). So A_even is 3, A_odd is 2.\n\nb's are: 8 (even),4 (even),7 (odd),20 (even). So B_even is 3, B_odd is 1.\n\nSo min(A_even, B_odd) = min(3,1)=1.\n\nmin(A_odd, B_even) = min(2,3)=2.\n\nTotal is 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\na = [2,4,6,8,10] → all even. So A_even=5, A_odd=0.\n\nb is [5] → odd. So B_even=0, B_odd=1.\n\nmin(A_even, B_odd) = min(5,1) =1.\n\nmin(A_odd, B_even)=min(0,0)=0.\n\nTotal is 1, which matches the sample.\n\nThird example:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\na is [10], even.\n\nb is [20,30,40,50], all even.\n\nSo A_even=1, A_odd=0.\n\nB_even=4, B_odd=0.\n\nmin(A_even, B_odd)=0.\n\nmin(A_odd, B_even)=0.\n\nTotal is 0, correct.\n\nSo the logic works for samples.\n\nAnother test case: what if a has both even and odd, and b has both even and odd.\n\nLike a has 2 evens and 3 odds; b has ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the available keys. Each key can only unlock a chest if their numbers have an odd sum, which means one must be even and the other must be odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Even and Odd Numbers**: First, count how many even and odd numbers are present in both the chests and the keys.\n2. **Pairing Strategy**: To maximize the number of chests opened, we pair even keys with odd chests and odd keys with even chests. The number of such pairs is determined by the minimum of the respective counts from the two groups (even or odd).\n3. **Sum the Pairs**: The total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of these pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Count even and odd in a\na_even = 0\na_odd = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        a_even += 1\n    else:\n        a_odd += 1\n\n# Count even and odd in b\nb_even = 0\nb_odd = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        b_even += 1\n    else:\n        b_odd += 1\n\nmax_pairs = min(a_even, b_odd) + min(a_odd, b_even)\nprint(max_pairs)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading**: The code reads the number of chests and keys, followed by the numbers on each chest and key.\n2. **Counting Evens and Odds**: It iterates through the chests and keys to count how many are even and how many are odd.\n3. **Calculating Pairs**: Using the counts of even and odd numbers, it calculates the maximum number of pairs where an even key can open an odd chest and vice versa.\n4. **Output the Result**: Finally, it prints the total number of chests that can be opened.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of chests that can be opened by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers, resulting in an optimal solution.",
