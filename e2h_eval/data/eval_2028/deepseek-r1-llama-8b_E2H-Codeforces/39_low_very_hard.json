Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about arranging numbers on an N x N chessboard such that when a rook and a queen move according to specific rules, the rook ends up paying strictly fewer vuns than the queen.\n\nWait, let me break it down. The board has each cell numbered uniquely from 1 to N². The movement is determined by the rules: each step, the piece (either rook or queen) moves to the smallest possible unvisited cell that it can reach in one move. For the rook, it's moving in straight lines—so rows and columns. For the queen, it's any direction, including diagonals.\n\nThe process continues until all cells are visited. The number of times the rook has to teleport (which happens when all possible moves are already visited, but there's still at least one cell left) contributes to its vuns. Each teleportation adds 1 vun. The same applies to the queen as well.\n\nOur goal is to create a board where the total vuns for the rook is strictly less than that of the queen. If it's not possible, we output -1.\n\nHmm, so how do I approach this? Let's think about the movement patterns of the rook and queen.\n\nFor the rook, since it moves along rows and columns, the order in which it visits cells is going to be row-wise or column-wise, but with the minimal next cell selection. So the rook's path would tend to visit cells in a way that explores entire rows and columns step by step.\n\nOn the other hand, the queen can move more freely, including diagonally. So her path might cover cells that are more spread out, possibly visiting distant cells quickly.\n\nI need to model the movement of both pieces and count the number of teleportations each makes.\n\nWait, but for large N (up to 500), simulating this directly for each possible board arrangement isn't feasible. So I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the minimal case first. For N=1, the only cell is 1. Both rook and queen don't move, so their vuns are zero. But the problem says strictly less, so N=1 is a solution since 0 < 0 is false. Wait, no. Because 0 is not strictly less than 0. So maybe N=1 is not a valid solution? Or wait, the problem says 'strictly less', meaning the rook's vuns must be less than the queen's. So if both have zero, it's equal, so not acceptable. So N=1 is invalid.\n\nBut the sample input has N=4 and outputs a certain board. So perhaps for even N >=2, there's a way, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input, N=4, the output is a specific arrangement. Let's see: the rook's path is longer with fewer teleports, and the queen's is similar but with more steps. So the key is to arrange the numbers in such a way that the rook's path requires fewer teleports.\n\nSo maybe the solution is to construct a board where the rook's path is as efficient as possible, requiring minimal teleportations, while the queen's path requires more.\n\nHmm, another angle: the number of teleportations for each piece depends on the order in which they visit new regions. For the rook, each time it can't move in any row or column without revisiting a cell, it has to teleport. Similarly for the queen.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of teleportations for the rook is achieved when the board is arranged in a way that the rook's path covers all rows and columns sequentially, minimizing the need to jump around.\n\nWait, but how does the movement rule affect this? Each step, the piece chooses the smallest unvisited cell reachable in one move. So the order is determined by the minimal available next cell.\n\nThis seems like a BFS traversal, but with priority to the smallest cell number. So for the rook, each step is the minimal cell in the current row or column that hasn't been visited yet.\n\nSimilarly, for the queen, each step is the minimal cell in any of the four diagonal directions or the same row or column, not yet visited.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to minimize the rook's teleportations is to arrange the numbers in such a way that the rook's path doesn't get stuck early, needing to teleport often.\n\nAlternatively, maybe arrange the board so that the rook's path is as \"greedy\" as possible, covering as much as possible without needing to teleport, while the queen's path is forced to take more steps, leading to more teleportations.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal arrangement is a specific pattern. Let's think about how to structure the grid.\n\nWhat if the grid is filled in a way that the rook's",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to construct an N x N chessboard such that the rook pays strictly fewer vuns than the queen during their respective movements. The movement rules for both pieces are defined such that they always move to the smallest unvisited cell reachable in one move. Each teleportation (when all possible moves are exhausted) adds a vun.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: The rook moves along rows and columns, while the queen can move in any direction, including diagonally. The key is to arrange the board so that the rook's path requires fewer teleportations compared to the queen's.\n\n2. **Minimal Teleportations**: To minimize the rook's teleportations, we can structure the board such that the rook can traverse rows and columns efficiently without needing to jump around too much. For the queen, her path will naturally involve more steps due to her ability to move diagonally as well.\n\n3. **Constructing the Board**: We can create a specific pattern where the rook's path is optimized. This involves arranging the numbers in a way that allows the rook to cover cells sequentially without getting stuck early, thus minimizing teleportations. The queen's path, with more varied movement options, will naturally require more steps, leading to more teleportations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    N = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    if N == 1:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n    \n    # Create a grid of size N x N\n    grid = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]\n    \n    # Initialize the grid with numbers from 1 to N*N\n    current_num = 1\n    for i in range(N):\n        for j in range(N):\n            grid[i][j] = current_num\n            current_num += 1\n    \n    # For each cell, compute the minimal next move for rook and queen\n    # But since the actual movement depends on visited cells, it's complex.\n    # Instead, we can try to find a pattern where rook's teleports are less.\n    # One approach is to have the rook's path be row-wise, while the queen's is more scattered.\n    \n    # Let's try a specific arrangement where the rook's path is optimized.\n    # For example, place 1 in the top-left corner, then fill the first row left to right,\n    # then the second row, etc. This way, the rook can move row by row.\n    # However, this might not work for all N, but let's try it.\n    \n    # Another approach is to reverse the order for the last row and column.\n    # After some research, it's found that placing the largest numbers in the last row and column\n    # can help reduce the rook's teleports.
