Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Colored Boots.\" Hmm.\n\nSo, the setup is that there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color represented by a lowercase letter or a question mark. We need to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of one left and one right boot, and their colors are compatible.\n\nWhat counts as compatible? Two specific colors are compatible only if they're exactly the same. A question mark is compatible with any color, including another question mark. So, for example, '?' can pair with 'a', 'b', or '?'. But 'a' can't pair with 'b'.\n\nThe goal is to compute the maximum number of such pairs and list them. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nHmm. So, the approach here must involve figuring out which left and right boots can form compatible pairs and then selecting as many as possible without overlapping.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, I think we can process each position i (from 0 to n-1) and check whether l[i] and r[i] are compatible. Wait, but that's just one possible pairing—maybe not the optimal. Because sometimes, pairing i with j might allow more overall pairs than just looking at each position.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 150,000, we need an efficient algorithm. So brute-forcing all possibilities is out of the question.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal approach is to match each left boot with a right boot in a way that maximizes the count, possibly using some greedy strategy or frequency counting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a bipartite graph where edges exist between left and right boots if they are compatible. Then, finding the maximum matching in this graph would give the answer. But for n=150,000, building such a graph isn't feasible because it's O(n^2), which is way too big.\n\nSo that's not going to work. We need a smarter way.\n\nAnother idea: for each left boot, determine which right boots it can pair with, and then select as many pairs as possible without overlaps.\n\nBut again, with n being large, this needs to be done efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps we can group the left and right boots by their colors (or types) and find how many can be matched across these groups.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. For any left boot, it can pair with a right boot if:\n\n- The left's color is the same as the right's, or\n- Either of them is a '?'.\n\nSo, for each left boot, we can have multiple possible right boots it can pair with. But since we can't pair the same right boot with multiple lefts, we need to assign optimally.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model this as a bipartite graph and find a maximum matching. But as before, this isn't feasible for n=150k.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to counting certain frequencies. Maybe for each specific color, count how many lefts have that color and how many rights have that color. Then, for each color, the number of possible pairs is the minimum of the left and right counts. But also, the '?' can pair with any color.\n\nWait, but this approach might not account for all possibilities. For example, a left '?' can pair with a right '?', which is a pair on its own. Or a left '?' can pair with a right 'a' or vice versa.\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's consider all non-'?' cases. For each specific color c, the maximum possible pairs is the minimum of the number of lefts with c and rights with c.\n\nThen, for the '?' cases, we can pair left '?'s with right '?'s, but also with other specific colors.\n\nWait, but perhaps the optimal approach is to first pair all the non-'?' pairs, and then handle the '?'s as a separate group.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the following steps:\n\n1. For each specific color, calculate how many lefts and rights have that color. The number of pairs for that color is the minimum of the two counts. Sum these up.\n\n2. Then, handle the '?' cases. Each left '?' can pair with any right boot, regardless of color. Similarly, each right '?' can pair with any left boot.\n\nWait, but this might not capture all possibilities because a left '?' can pair with a right '?', but also with a right specific color.\n\nSo perhaps the steps are:\n\n- Count the number of lefts that are '?'. Let's call this L_q.\n- Count the number of rights that are '?'. Let's call this R_q.\n- Then, the maximum possible pairs from the '?' group is min(L_q, R_q). Because each pair requires one left and one right '?',",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. Each pair must consist of one left boot and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. The solution involves efficiently counting and matching compatible boots using a combination of frequency counts and greedy matching.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Frequencies**: First, we count the frequency of each specific color in both the left and right boot lists. This helps us determine how many pairs can be formed between specific colors.\n2. **Match Specific Colors**: For each specific color, the number of pairs is the minimum of the count of that color in the left and right boots.\n3. **Handle Question Marks**: We then handle the question mark ('?') characters separately. Each '?' can pair with any other boot, including another '?'. We first form as many pairs as possible between left and right '?', and then use any remaining left or right '?' to pair with the most frequent specific colors.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Count frequencies for specific colors\n    left_counts = defaultdict(int)\n    for c in l:\n        if c != '?':\n            left_counts[c] += 1\n\n    right_counts = defaultdict(int)\n    for c in r:\n        if c != '?':\n            right_counts[c] += 1\n\n    # Step 1: Pair specific colors\n    specific_pairs = 0\n    for c in set(left_counts.keys()) | set(right_counts.keys()):\n        min_left = left_counts.get(c, 0)\n        min_right = right_counts.get(c, 0)\n        specific_pairs += min(min_left, min_right)\n\n    # Now, collect all specific color pairs and remove them from the counts\n    used_left = defaultdict(int)\n    used_right = defaultdict(int)\n    for c in left_counts:\n        used_left[c] = left_counts[c]\n    for c in right_counts:\n        used_right[c] = right_counts[c]\n\n    # Remove the used ones\n    for c in left_counts:\n        if used_left[c] > 0:\n            used_left[c] -= 1\n\n    for c in right_counts:\n        if used_right[c] > 0:\n            used_right[c] -= 1\n\n    # Now, handle the question marks\n    L_q = l.count('?')\n    R_q = r.count('?')\n\n    # First, pair ? with ?\n    pairs = 0\n    # Also, track which indices are used in the output\n    left_used = [False] * n\n    right_used = [False] * n\n\n    # Precompute all possible pairs and choose optimally\n    # But since n is large, we need an efficient way\n\n    # Let's try to collect all possible candidates\n\n    # Collect all lefts that are '?'\n    left_q_indices = [i for i, c in enumerate(l) if c == '?']\n    right_q_indices = [i for i, c in enumerate(r) if c == '?']\n\n    # Pair as many as possible between left_q and right_q\n    q_pairs = min(L_q, R_q)\n    pairs += q_pairs\n    used_left_q = q_pairs\n    used_right_q = q_pairs\n\n    # Now, for remaining '?', we can pair them with specific colors\n    # Let's collect the remaining specific colors in left and right\n\n    # For left specific colors (excluding those used already)\n    available_left = []\n    for c in left_counts:\n        cnt = left_counts[c]\n        if used_left[c] < cnt:\n            available = cnt - used_left[c]\n            available_left.extend([c]*available)\n\n    # Similarly for right\n    available_right = []\n    for c in right_counts:\n        cnt = right_counts[c]\n        if used_right[c] < cnt:\n            available = cnt - used_right[c]\n            available_right.extend([c]*available)\n\n    # Now, create a list of all possible left candidates (sorted by frequency)\n    # Then, match greedily\n\n    # Create a list of available left and right, sorted by frequency\n    from collections import Counter\n    left_counter = Counter(available_left)\n    right_counter = Counter(available_right)\n\n    # Get the most frequent colors on both sides\n    max_left_color, max_count_left = max(left_counter.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])\n    max_right_color, max_count_right = max(right_counter.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    # Determine how much we can take from the most frequent\n    take = min(max_count_left, max_count_right)\n    pairs += take\n    used_left[max_left_color] += take\n    used_right[max_right_color] += take\n\n    # Update counters\n    left_counter[max_left_color] -= take\n    right_counter[max_right_color] -= take\n\n    # Now, proceed similarly for the next most frequent\n    while left_counter and right_counter:\n        current_max_left, current_max_left_cnt = max(left_counter.items())\n        current_max_right, current_max_right_cnt = max(right_counter.items())\n\n        take = min(current_max_left_cnt, current_max_right_cnt)\n        pairs += take\n        used_left[current_max_left] += take\n        used_right[current_max_right] += take\n\n        left_counter[current_max_left] -= take\n        right_counter[current_max_right] -= take\n\n        if left_counter.get(current_max_left, 0) == 0:\n            del left_counter[current_max_left]\n        if right_counter.get(current_max_right, 0) == 0:\n            del right_counter[current_max_right]\n\n    # Now, collect all the pairs\n    result = []\n\n    # First, process the q_pairs\n    for i in range(q_pairs):\n        left_idx = left_q_indices[i]\n        right_idx = right_q_indices[i]\n        result.append(f\"{left_idx + 1} {right_idx + 1}\")\n\n    # Then, process specific color pairs\n    for c in left_counts:\n        used = used_left[c]\n        if used > 0:\n            # We need to find the right indices for these\n            # To do this, we have to track which specific rights can be paired with c\n            # But this is complicated.
