Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Lanterns.\" Hmm.\n\nSo, the setup is that Vanya is walking along a straight street of length l. There are n lanterns placed along this street. Each lantern can light all points within a distance d from it. The goal is to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nWait, right. So each lantern covers a segment of the street. The union of all these segments needs to cover the entire [0, l] interval. And we need the smallest possible d.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Well, let's think about the input. We get n and l, followed by a list of ai's, which are the positions of the lanterns.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is that for the minimal d, the coverage of the lanterns must just barely cover the entire street. So perhaps the minimal d is determined by the maximum distance between consecutive lanterns, or maybe some other critical points.\n\nBut wait, that's not entirely accurate. Because when the lanterns are arranged in a certain way, their combined coverage might require a larger d than just the gaps between them.\n\nLet me think with an example. Suppose the street is from 0 to 15 meters, and there are lanterns at 0, 5, 10, 15. Then each lantern needs to cover up to halfway to the next one to ensure full coverage. So d would be 7.5 in that case because the middle lantern at 5 covers from 0-10, but wait, no, wait: each lantern's coverage is a radius d around itself. So for the first lantern at 0, it covers [0, d]. The last at 15 covers [15 - d, 15]. For the middle ones, like 5, they cover up to d beyond, so 5 + d, but perhaps that's more than enough if the overall arrangement allows.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to find all the necessary intervals where the street must be covered, and determine the minimal d such that each of these intervals is covered by at least one lantern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is determined by the farthest point on the street from any lantern. So for each point x in [0, l], the distance to the nearest lantern should be <= d. Thus, d is the maximum of these minimal distances across all x.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum distance from any point on the street to the closest lantern. That maximum is the minimal d required.\n\nOh right! So this is similar to the problem of finding the largest gap between the street and the nearest lantern. The minimal d is the maximum of the minimal distances from each point on the street to the nearest lantern.\n\nSo how do I compute this efficiently?\n\nWell, the street is a line from 0 to l. The lanterns are at various points along this line. The minimal d is the maximum of the minimal distances from any point x in [0, l] to the nearest lantern.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions.\n2. Consider the sorted list of lantern positions as a set of points that divide the street into intervals.\n3. For each interval between two consecutive lanterns (after adding 0 and l as virtual lanterns), compute the maximum distance from any point in that interval to the nearest lantern.\n4. The maximum of all these values is the required d.\n\nWait, yes. So the steps would be:\n\n- Sort the lantern positions.\n- Create an extended list that includes 0 and l as additional lanterns. Or, alternatively, consider the first interval from 0 to a_1, and the last interval from a_n to l.\n- For each interval [prev, current], where prev and current are consecutive lantern positions, compute the maximum distance from any point in [prev, current] to the nearest lantern. That maximum for each interval will give us the required d for that interval, and the overall d is the maximum of these.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think about an interval between two lanterns. Suppose we have two lanterns at positions a and b, where a < b. The interval to consider is [a, b]. The coverage from a is up to a + d, and from b is down to b - d. But in this interval, the furthest point from both a and b is somewhere in the middle, but perhaps the minimal distance is determined by the midpoint or something else.\n\nWait, for a single interval between two lanterns a and b, the maximal minimal distance occurs at the midpoint of the interval if the interval is longer than 2d, but wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think.\n\nIn the interval [a, b], the minimal distance from any point x to the nearest lantern is min(x - a, b - x) for x in [a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns on a street of length \\( l \\) cover the entire street. The key insight is to find the maximum distance from any point on the street to the nearest lantern, as this will be the minimal \\( d \\) required.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns. This helps in efficiently determining the intervals between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Extend the Intervals**: Consider the street as an interval from 0 to \\( l \\). Extend this by including virtual lanterns at the boundaries (0 and \\( l \\)) to handle edge cases where coverage starts or ends at the street's endpoints.\n3. **Calculate Coverage Gaps**: For each interval between two consecutive lanterns (including the virtual ones), compute the maximum distance from any point in that interval to the nearest lantern. This is done by checking the midpoint of each interval, which gives the furthest point from both ends.\n4. **Determine Minimum \\( d \\)**: The maximum value of these distances across all intervals gives the minimum \\( d \\) needed to cover the entire street.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    l = float(input[1])\n    a = list(map(float, input[2:2+n]))\n    \n    # Add 0 and l as virtual lanterns\n    a = [0] + a + [l]\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    for i in range(1, len(a)):\n        left = a[i-1]\n        right = a[i]\n        if left >= right:\n            continue\n        # The farthest point from both ends is at the midpoint\n        mid = (left + right) / 2\n        current_max = min(mid - left, right - mid)\n        if current_max > max_d:\n            max_d = current_max\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of lanterns, the street length, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Virtual Lanterns**: Virtual lanterns are added at the start (0) and end (l) of the street to handle boundary conditions.\n3. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate interval calculations.\n4. **Interval Processing**: For each interval between consecutive lanterns, the midpoint is considered to find the maximum distance from the nearest lantern. This ensures that we capture the furthest point within each interval.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The maximum distance found across all intervals is printed with high precision to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal \\( d \\) required to cover the entire street, ensuring all points are illuminated.",
