The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a Rock-Paper-Scissors game between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They play n rounds, and in each round, the winner gives the loser a pinch, which leaves a red spot. We need to calculate how many red spots each has after all the rounds.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to figure out who wins each round based on their strategies. Both have sequences of choices that they cycle through. For example, if Nikephoros's sequence is \"RPS\" and Polycarpus's is \"RSPP\", then for each round, we take the next character from each sequence in order, cycling as needed.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input correctly. The first line is n, then the two sequences A and B.\n2. For each of the n rounds, determine who wins.\n3. Count the number of times each loses, because each loss adds a red spot to them.\n\nWait, no. Because the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros loses a round, he gets a red spot. Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\nSo for each round:\n- Compare A's move and B's move.\n- Determine who loses (the one whose move is beaten by the other).\n- Increment the respective counter.\n\nBut wait, since the sequences are cyclic, for each round i (from 0 to n-1), we need to get the i-th character of both sequences, considering the cycles.\n\nSo the main challenge is efficiently getting the correct characters for each round without exceeding time limits, especially since n can be up to 2e5, which is manageable but needs an efficient approach.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nEach sequence is a string. For each round, the current index for A is (i mod len(A)), and same for B. So for the ith round (starting from 0?), we take A[i % m] and B[i % k], where m is length of A, k is length of B.\n\nWait, but what if the sequences are different lengths? Like m is 3 and k is 5. Then each round, the index for A increments every 3 rounds, and for B every 5. So yes, for each round, compute the index modulo their respective lengths.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute for each round the choice of A and B.\n- For each pair, determine the winner.\n- Update the counters accordingly.\n\nBut with n up to 2e5, doing this in a loop should be manageable.\n\nNow, how do we compare the choices to determine the winner?\n\nRock (R) beats scissors (S)\nScissors (S) beat paper (P)\nPaper (P) beats rock (R)\n\nSo for a given pair (a, b):\n\nIf a beats b: a wins, b loses.\nIf b beats a: b wins, a loses.\nElse: it's a draw, no one gets a pinch.\n\nSo for each round, check if a beats b, or b beats a, else nothing happens.\n\nSo let's create a helper function or a way to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, we can represent the winning conditions as a dictionary or something similar.\n\nWait, another approach: create a mapping of what each choice beats.\n\nFor example:\nbeats = {\n    'R': 'S',\n    'S': 'P',\n    'P': 'R'\n}\n\nSo if a's choice is R, it beats S; if b's choice is S, then a wins.\n\nSo for each round, get a_char = A[i % m], b_char = B[i % k]\n\nCheck if a_char == b_char: no one gets a pinch.\n\nElse, check if beats[a_char] == b_char: then a wins, so b gets a pinch.\n\nElse, b wins, so a gets a pinch.\n\nYes, that's a solid approach.\n\nSo now, the steps for each round are:\n\n1. Compute a_char and b_char for the current round.\n2. If equal: nothing.\n3. Else, determine who beats whom.\n4. Add 1 to the loser's count.\n\nSo now, the code structure would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B as strings.\n\nInitialize counters: nike = 0, poly = 0.\n\nFor i in 0 ... n-1:\n\n   a = A[i % len(A)]\n   b = B[i % len(B)]\n\n   if a == b:\n       continue\n   elif beats[a] == b:\n       # a wins, b loses: increment poly\n       poly +=1\n   else:\n       # b wins, a loses: increment nike\n       nike +=1\n\nFinally, print(nike, poly)\n\nWait, but wait—what's the index for each round? Because the sequences start at 0 or 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on each player after they play a series of Rock-Paper-Scissors rounds. Each round is played according to a cyclic sequence of choices by both players. The loser of each round gets a red spot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** First, read the number of rounds and the sequences for both players.\n2. **Determine Winners:** For each round, determine the winner based on the cyclic nature of the sequences. Use a helper function or a dictionary to check if one choice beats another.\n3. **Count Losers:** Maintain counters for each player to track how many times they lost (and thus received a red spot).\n4. **Efficient Indexing:** Use modulo operations to cycle through the sequences efficiently without precomputing all possible indices.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\nnike = 0\npoly = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    \n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    \n    if beats[a] == b:\n        poly += 1\n    else:\n        nike += 1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The code reads the number of rounds `n` and the sequences `A` and `B` from the input.\n2. **Helper Dictionary:** The `beats` dictionary is used to determine which choice beats another. For example, 'R' beats 'S'.\n3. **Cyclic Indexing:** For each round, the current choice of each player is determined using modulo operations to cycle through their respective sequences.\n4. **Determine Loser:** For each round, if both players choose the same, it's a draw. Otherwise, the winner is determined, and the loser gets a red spot.\n5. **Count Red Spots:** The counters `nike` and `poly` are incremented based on who loses each round, and the results are printed at the end.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles all edge cases within the constraints.",
