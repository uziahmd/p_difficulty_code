Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Lanterns.\" Hmm.\n\nSo, the setup is that Vanya is walking along a straight street of length l. There are n lanterns placed at various points along this street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance d from itself. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nThe input gives me two numbers: n and l. Then a line with n integers representing the positions of the lanterns. Oh right, and the output should be the minimal d with sufficient precision.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. The key idea is to determine the maximum distance between any two consecutive points that are covered by the lanterns. Because, for each segment between two lanterns (sorted), the required radius is half the length of that segment. But wait, no—wait, the lanterns' coverage might overlap, so maybe the maximum gap between the end of one lantern's coverage and the start of another's is what determines d.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to sort all the lantern positions, then consider the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the required d must be at least half the distance between them because the middle point needs to be covered. Also, we need to consider the edges of the street beyond the first and last lanterns.\n\nWait, right. So the steps I should take are:\n\n1. Sort the list of lantern positions.\n2. Compute the required d for each possible interval:\n   a. From 0 to the first lantern.\n   b. Between each pair of consecutive lanterns.\n   c. From the last lantern to l.\n3. Find the maximum of all these required d's. That will be the minimal d needed.\n\nSo, for example, in the second sample input:\n\nn=2, l=5\nLantern positions: 2 and 5.\n\nAfter sorting, they are [2,5].\n\nCompute the intervals:\n\n- From 0 to 2: the length is 2. So the midpoint is 1. So d needs to be at least 1 to cover from 0 to 2 (since the lantern at 2 covers up to 2 + d). Wait, no—wait, the lantern at 2 covers from 2 -d to 2 +d. So to cover 0, the lantern at 2 must have d >= 2 (so that 2 -d <=0). But wait, the lantern at 5 also contributes. Wait, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to model it is as follows: for each consecutive pair of lanterns, say a_i and a_j, the distance between them is delta = a_j - a_i. The midpoint is at (a_i + a_j)/2. To cover this entire delta, the required d must be at least delta / 2. Because if you have two lanterns, their combined coverage needs to meet or overlap in the middle.\n\nBut wait, no. Because each lantern can cover a radius around itself. So for two lanterns, the maximum distance between them is 2d, but to ensure that every point is covered, the sum of their individual radii must be at least the distance between them. So for two lanterns at x and y (x < y), the distance is y - x. To cover the entire stretch between x and y, the sum of the two d's must be >= y -x. But wait, no. Because each lantern covers d on either side. So the total coverage would be from (x -d) to (y +d). Wait, no, each lantern's coverage is [x -d, x +d] and [y -d, y +d]. So the union of these two intervals must cover [x, y], but also, the entire street.\n\nWait, perhaps that's complicating things. Maybe the correct approach is to model the problem as needing to cover the entire street from 0 to l with the union of all the circles (intervals) of radius d around each lantern.\n\nSo, the minimal d is the smallest value where all points in [0, l] are covered by at least one lantern's interval [ai -d, ai +d].\n\nHmm. So how do I model this? One way is to compute the minimal d such that for every point x in [0, l], x is covered by at least one ai's interval.\n\nTo find the minimal d, perhaps it's easier to model the problem by considering the points where the coverage ends. For each lantern, the leftmost point it covers is ai -d, and the rightmost is ai +d. The entire street must be covered, so the maximum of (ai -d) across all lanterns must be <= 0, and the minimum of (ai +d) across all lanterns must be >= l. Or wait, no: the entire street is 0 to l, so the union of all [ai -d, ai +d] must include all points from 0 to l.\n\nWait, that's a bit tricky. Another approach is to model the problem by finding the regions that are not covered and ensuring that there are no such regions. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the required d based on the sorted lantern positions.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in non-decreasing order.\n2. Consider the street as divided into intervals by the lanterns. The first interval is from 0 to the first lantern's position. The next intervals are between consecutive lanterns, and the last interval is from the last lantern's position to l.\n3. For each of these intervals, calculate the required d such that the entire interval is covered. For the first interval (from 0 to a[0]), the required d is a[0] - 0, but since the lantern's coverage is a[0] -d <=0, which implies d >= a[0]. Wait no, because a[0] is the position, and the coverage is a[0]-d to a[0]+d. To cover 0, we need a[0] -d <=0 → d >= a[0]. Similarly, for the last interval, the last lantern is a[-1], so to cover l, we need a[-1] +d >=l → d >= l - a[-1].\n\nFor the intervals between consecutive lanterns, say a[i] and a[i+1], the required d must satisfy that the coverage of both lanterns overlaps enough to cover the entire interval.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet's say between a[i] and a[i+1], the distance is delta = a[i+1] - a[i]. To ensure that the entire delta is covered by the two lanterns, the sum of their coverage radii must be >= delta. Because each lantern covers d on either side, the combined coverage would be from a[i]-d to a[i+1]+d. So the entire delta must fit within this interval. So the condition is a[i+1] + d >= a[i] + d → that's always true. Wait, no, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is that a[i] +d >= a[i+1] -d → 2d >= a[i+1] - a[i] → d >= (a[i+1] - a[i])/2.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because the two lanterns' coverage must meet at some point in the middle of the delta. So the minimal d for this interval is half the delta.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- For the first interval (0 to a[0]), the required d is a[0] (since the lantern at a[0] must reach 0, so d >= a[0]).\n- For the last interval (a[-1] to l), the required d is l - a[-1].\n- For each intermediate interval between a[i] and a[i+1], required d is (a[i+1] - a[i])/2.\n\nWe collect all these required d's, and the maximum among them is the minimal d needed.\n\nWait, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\nn=2, l=5\nPositions: 2 and 5.\n\nSorted: [2,5]\n\nFirst interval: 0 to 2. Required d is 2-0=2?\nWait no. Because the lantern at 2 must cover 0. So d must be at least 2, because 2 -d ≤0 → d≥2.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier reasoning, the required d for this interval is a[0], which is 2.\n\nThen, the intermediate interval between 2 and 5 has delta 3, so required d is 1.5.\n\nThen, the last interval is 5 to 5 (since l=5). So required d is 0.\n\nSo the maximum of 2, 1.5, 0 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nWait, but wait in the sample explanation, d is 2. So the first lantern covers from 0 to 4, and the second covers from 3 to 5. So the entire street is covered.\n\nIn this case, the first interval requires d=2, which is indeed the maximum.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nSample Input 1:\n7 15\nLantern positions: 15,5,3,7,9,14,0.\n\nWhen sorted, it's [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nCompute the required d for each interval:\n\nFirst interval: 0 to 0. So required d is 0.\n\nWait, no, wait the first lantern is at 0. The first interval is 0 to 0. So the required d is 0.\n\nWait no, wait the first interval is from 0 to a[0], which is 0. So it's just a single point, so no required d.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the intervals:\n\nThe first interval is from 0 to a[0]. So if a[0] is 0, then the interval is 0-0, which is just a point. So the required d is 0.\n\nThen the intervals between a[i] and a[i+1]:\n\nBetween 0 and 3: delta is 3. So required d is 1.5.\n\nBetween 3 and5: delta 2 → required d=1.\n\nBetween5 and7: delta 2 → d=1.\n\nBetween7 and9: delta 2 → d=1.\n\nBetween9 and14: delta5 → d=2.5.\n\nBetween14 and15: delta1 → d=0.5.\n\nLast interval is 15 to15, which is zero.\n\nSo the maximum required d is 2.5, which is 5/2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the list of lantern positions.\n\n2. Compute for each interval the required d.\n\n3. The minimal d is the maximum of all these required d's.\n\nSo now, how to implement this in code.\n\nSteps for code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the intervals:\n\n- The first interval is from 0 to a[0]. Required d is a[0] (since 0 must be covered by a[0]'s left end). So d = a[0].\n\n- For i from 0 to n-2: compute the delta between a[i+1] and a[i]. Then required d is delta / 2.\n\n- The last interval is from a[-1] to l. Required d is l - a[-1].\n\nCollect all these d's, and the maximum is the answer.\n\nWait, but wait: for the first interval, is the required d a[0]? Because a[0] -d must be ≤0 → d ≥a[0]. So yes.\n\nSimilarly, for the last interval, a[-1] +d must be ≥l → d ≥ l -a[-1].\n\nYes.\n\nSo in code:\n\nmax_d = 0\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\nprev = 0\n\nfor current in sorted_a:\n\n    if prev ==0 and current ==0:\n\n        # nothing to do, d is 0.\n\n        pass\n\n    else:\n\n        # first interval\n\n        d = current - 0\n\n        max_d = max(max_d, d)\n\n    # for intervals between current and next\n\n    # after processing all, handle the last interval.\n\nWait, perhaps the better way is:\n\nCompute the required d for each interval:\n\nInitialize max_d as 0.\n\nCompute the first interval:\n\nd1 = sorted_a[0] - 0 → since a[0] is the first lantern's position. So d1 is a[0].\n\nmax_d = max(max_d, d1).\n\nThen, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, i from 0 to len(sorted_a)-1:\n\nWait, no. Wait, for the pairs (sorted_a[i], sorted_a[i+1]), the delta is sorted_a[i+1] - sorted_a[i]. So the required d for this interval is delta / 2.\n\nSo loop from i=0 to i = len(sorted_a)-1:\n\ndelta = sorted_a[i+1] - sorted_a[i]\n\nd = delta / 2\n\nif i is not the last index, then check this delta.\n\nWait, but in code, the loop will be for i in range(len(sorted_a)-1):\n\ncurrent = sorted_a[i]\n\nnext = sorted_a[i+1]\n\ndelta = next - current\n\nd = delta / 2\n\nmax_d = max(max_d, d)\n\nThen, after that, handle the last interval.\n\nd_last = l - sorted_a[-1]\n\nmax_d = max(max_d, d_last)\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0\n\n# first interval: 0 to a[0]\n\nd = a[0] - 0\n\nmax_d = max(max_d, d)\n\n# intervals between consecutive lanterns\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    current = a[i]\n\n    next = a[i+1]\n\n    delta = next - current\n\n    d = delta / 2\n\n    max_d = max(max_d, d)\n\n# last interval: a[-1] to l\n\nd = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_d = max(max_d, d)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but wait: in the first interval, the required d is a[0], but what if a[0] is zero? Then d is zero, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the second sample:\n\na = [2,5]\n\nd1 = 2 → max_d is 2.\n\nthen, between 2 and5: delta=3 → d=1.5 → max_d remains 2.\n\nlast interval: 5 to5 → d=0 → no change.\n\nso output is 2.\n\nSample 1:\n\na sorted is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nd1 =0 → no change.\n\nthen:\n\n3-0 → delta 3 → d=1.5 → max_d becomes 1.5.\n\n5-3 → delta2 → d=1 → max_d remains 1.5.\n\n7-5 → delta2 → d=1 → same.\n\n9-7→d=1 → same.\n\n14-9 → delta5 → d=2.5 → new max.\n\n15-14 → delta1 →d=0.5 → same.\n\nlast interval:15 →15 to15. d=0.\n\nso overall max is 2.5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if all lanterns are at the same position?\n\nE.g., n=3, l=10, a=[5,5,5].\n\nsorted is [5,5,5].\n\nd1:5.\n\nbetween 5 and5: delta=0 →d=0.\n\nanother between 5 and5: same.\n\nlast interval:5 to10 →d=5.\n\nso max_d is 5.\n\nBecause the first interval is 0-5, requiring d=5 (since a[0]=5). The last interval requires 5.\n\nYes, because the lanterns are at 5. Each can cover up to 5+d. So to cover 10, 5+d ≥10 →d≥5.\n\nSo the code correctly returns 5.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[3].\n\nThen, first interval:0-3 →d=3.\n\nlast interval:3-10 →d=7.\n\nmax_d is7.\n\nWhich makes sense because the lantern at 3 can cover up to 6. So to cover from 3 to10, d must be 7.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=0. Well, but l is at least 1 according to constraints.\n\nWait, the problem says l can be zero? Or wait, no: the constraints say 1<= l <=1e9.\n\nSo no, l is at least 1.\n\nSo code should handle l=0, but according to the problem statement, it's not possible.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would read the input, process as described, and print the result with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nCompute the required d.\n\nmax_d = 0\n\nif n ==0:\n    # but n is at least 1 per the problem statement.\n\nd = a[0]\nmax_d = max(max_d, d)\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    current = a[i]\n    next = a[i+1]\n    delta = next - current\n    d = delta / 2\n    if d > max_d:\n        max_d = d\n\nd = l - a[-1]\nif d > max_d:\n    max_d = d\n\nPrint with 10 decimal places.\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but what about when the street is already fully covered without any lanterns? No, because n is at least 1.\n\nWait, but what if n=1 and a[0]=0, l=0: but again, l is at least 1.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nTesting sample input 1:\n\nInput line 2 is '15 5 3 7 9 14 0'\n\nSo a is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. After sorting, [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nAs before, the code correctly computes 2.5.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput line is '2 5\\n2 5' → a = [2,5], code computes 2.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns on a street can illuminate the entire street from point 0 to point \\( l \\).
