Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Vasily has some candles and can create new ones from the stubs. The goal is to find out how many hours he can keep the room lit. Hmm.\n\nLet me read the problem again. So, initially, he has 'a' candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour and becomes a stub. Then, he can take 'b' stubs and make a new candle. This new candle can then be burned again, adding another hour. The process continues until he doesn't have enough stubs to make more candles.\n\nSo, the approach is to calculate how many additional candles he can make from the stubs and add that to the initial burn time.\n\nWait, let's think with an example. Like the sample input: 4 2.\n\nHe starts with 4 candles. They burn for 4 hours. Then, the stubs are 4. He can exchange 4/2=2 new candles. Burn them, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 stubs (from those 2 candles). He can exchange again: 2/2=1 new candle. Burn it, add 1 hour. Now he has 1 stub, which isn't enough for another candle. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\nAnother example: 6 3.\n\nInitial burn: 6 hours. Stubs:6. 6/3=2 new. Burn them: 2 hours. Stubs now 2. 2 <3, can't make more. So total 6+2=8.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Start with a hours.\n2. Calculate the number of new candles made from the stubs each time, add their burn time, and update the stubs count.\n3. Repeat until stubs < b.\n\nBut how to model this in code?\n\nI think we can use a loop where in each iteration, we calculate how many new candles can be made from current stubs. Then, add those to the total hours. Then, the stubs are updated by subtracting the used ones and adding the new ones from burning these new candles.\n\nWait, let's formalize:\n\n- total = a\n- stubs = a\n\nWhile stubs >= b:\n    new_candles = stubs // b\n    total += new_candles\n    stubs = (stubs % b) + new_candles\n\nBecause each new candle burns, adding 1 hour per candle, and leaves one stub.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for the first sample:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal=4, stubs=4.\n\nLoop:\n\nstubs=4 >=2.\n\nnew_candles =4//2=2. total becomes 6. stubs =4%2=0 +2=2.\n\nNext iteration: stubs=2 >=2.\n\nnew_candles=1. total=7. stubs=0 +1=1.\n\nNow, stubs <2. Loop ends.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal=6, stubs=6.\n\nLoop:\n\n6 >=3 → new=2, total=8. stubs=0 +2=2.\n\n2<3, loop ends. So output is 8.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: a=1, b=1000. He can't make any new candles. So total is 1.\n\nCase 2: a=5, b=5. Initial burn 5. stubs=5. Make 1 new, burn it (6 total), stubs=1. Can't make more. So total 6.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=3.\n\nInitial 10.\n\nStubs:10. 10//3=3. Add 3 hours. Total 13. Stubs: 10%3=1 +3=4.\n\nNow 4 >=3. 4//3=1. Add 1. Total 14. Stubs:4%3=1 +1=2.\n\nNo more. So total is 14.\n\nWait, let's compute step by step.\n\nStart: 10, stubs=10.\n\nFirst loop: 10//3=3 → total=13, stubs=1+3=4.\n\nSecond loop:4//3=1 → total=14, stubs=4%3=1 +1=2.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo the code needs to implement this logic.\n\nIn Python, read a and b as integers.\n\nThen initialize total = a, stubs =a.\n\nThen loop while stubs >=b:\n\nnew = stubs // b\n\ntotal += new\n\nstubs = (stubs % b) + new\n\nRepeat until stubs <b.\n\nFinally, print(total).\n\nThat should handle all cases.\n\nTesting with the examples:\n\nSample Input 1: 4 2 → output 7.\n\nSample Input 2:6 3 → output 8.\n\nEdge case 1: a=1, b=1000 → output 1.\n\nEdge case 2: a=5, b=5 → 5+1=6.\n\nAnother test: a=0? But according to constraints, a is ≥1, so no.\n\nWhat if b is 1? Wait, the problem says b ≥2. Oh right, because in the problem statement, b is between 2 and 1000.\n\nSo no need to handle b=1.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nRead a and b from input. The input is given as two integers in a single line, separated by space.\n\nIn Python:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute as described.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\nprint(total)\n\nThat should do it.\n\nTesting the code with the samples:\n\nFor 4 2:\n\nLoop 1:\n\nstubs=4 >=2 → new=2, total=6, stubs=0+2=2.\n\nLoop 2: 2>=2 → new=1, total=7, stubs=0+1=1.\n\nLoop exits. Output 7.\n\nAnother sample:6 3.\n\nLoop once: new=2, total=8, stubs=0+2=2.\n\nNo more loops. Output 8.\n\nLooks correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has and the stubs from burned-out candles. The process involves burning candles and then using the resulting stubs to create new candles, which can be burned again.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a`. Each candle burns for exactly one hour, so initially, the total hours of illumination is `a`.\n2. **Recycle Stubs**: After burning all initial candles, we collect the stubs. For every `b` stubs, we can create a new candle. This new candle will also burn for one hour and leave another stub.\n3. **Iterative Process**: Continue creating new candles from the collected stubs until we no longer have enough stubs to create a new candle. Each time we create new candles, add the corresponding hours to the total illumination time and update the count of stubs.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when the number of stubs is less than the required number to create a new candle `b`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the initial number of candles and the number of stubs needed to create a new candle, respectively.\n2. **Initial Burn Time**: The variable `total` is initialized to `a` because each candle burns for one hour.\n3. **Stubs Collection**: The variable `stubs` is initialized to `a` as well, representing the stubs after the initial burn.\n4. **Loop to Recycle Stubs**: The while loop continues as long as there are enough stubs to create at least one new candle. In each iteration:\n   - Calculate the number of new candles that can be made (`new`).\n   - Add the number of new candles to the total burn time.\n   - Update the stubs count to reflect the remainder after making new candles plus the stubs from the newly burned candles.\n5. **Output Result**: Finally, the total number of hours is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum illumination time by iteratively recycling stubs and creating new candles, ensuring optimal use of resources.",
