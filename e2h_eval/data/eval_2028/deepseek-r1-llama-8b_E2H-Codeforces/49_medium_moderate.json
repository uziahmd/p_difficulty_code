They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Mushroom Strife. Hmm. So the setup is that Pasha and Akim made a forest map where lawns are vertices and roads are edges. Each edge has two numbers: GCD and LCM of the mushrooms on the connected lawns. But now, some of the map is torn, leaving only m roads. My task is to help restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn based on the given roads. If it's not possible, output NO; else, output any valid arrangement.\n\nThe input gives n and m, followed by m lines each with four numbers: the two lawns connected by a road, their GCD, and LCM.\n\nWait, but how do I determine the mushrooms on each lawn from the given edges? Because each edge connects two lawns and gives their GCD and LCM. So for each edge (u, v), the mushrooms at u and v must satisfy that the GCD of their values is g, and the LCM is l.\n\nBut wait, for any two numbers a and b, GCD(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So if I have an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, then a_u * a_v = g * l, right?\n\nSo for each edge, the product of the two nodes' mushroom counts equals g * l, and the GCD is g, LCM is l.\n\nBut how do we model this as constraints for all the nodes?\n\nHmm. So each node's value must be a positive integer, because the initial numbers were at least 1. Also, the GCD and LCM constraints must hold for each edge.\n\nThis sounds like a graph problem where each edge imposes certain constraints on the variables (the mushroom counts) of the connected nodes. So perhaps we can model this as a system of equations and inequalities and find a solution.\n\nBut how to approach solving this? Well, considering that each node's value is a variable, and for each edge (u, v), we have:\n\na_u * a_v = g * l\nGCD(a_u, a_v) = g\nLCM(a_u, a_v) = l\n\nWait, but since LCM(a,b) is the smallest number divisible by both a and b, and GCD is the largest divisor common to both, perhaps the relationship is that a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where x and y are coprime integers such that LCM(x,y) = l/g. Because then, the LCM of a_u and a_v would be g * x * y / GCD(x,y). Wait, let's think:\n\nIf a_u = g * x and a_v = g * y, then GCD(a_u, a_v) = g * GCD(x, y). But in our case, GCD(a_u, a_v) is given as g. So that implies that GCD(x, y) must be 1. Because g * GCD(x, y) = g => GCD(x, y) = 1.\n\nAlso, LCM(a_u, a_v) = (g*x*y)/GCD(x,y) = g*x*y, since GCD(x,y) is 1. So the given LCM l must equal g*x*y. So from this, x*y = l/(g). But since x and y are coprimes, their product is equal to l/g.\n\nSo for each edge, the variables a_u and a_v must be expressible as multiples of g, with their quotients being coprimes whose product is l/g.\n\nSo putting it all together, for each edge (u, v):\n\n- a_u = g * x\n- a_v = g * y\n- x and y are coprimes\n- x * y = (l / g)\n\nAnd since x and y are coprimes, l must be divisible by g, which is already given in the problem statement because the initial roads had GCD and LCM no less than 1.\n\nSo for each edge, I can compute possible factor pairs (x, y) of (l/g), ensuring x and y are coprimes.\n\nWait, but how do I handle multiple edges between the same pair of nodes? Because according to the problem statement, no two lawns are connected by more than one road. So each pair is connected by at most one road. So that simplifies things.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each edge, extract u, v, g, l.\n\n2. Compute s = l / g. Check that s is an integer, but the problem says that the initial numbers on the roads were at least 1 and didn't exceed 106, so s must be an integer.\n\n3. Find all possible pairs (x, y) where x <= y, x * y = s, and GCD(x, y) = 1. Since x and y are factors of s and coprimes.\n\n4. For each edge, assign possible values to a_u and a_v as g*x and g*y, in either order.\n\nBut since the graph is a collection of connected components (because it's a forest, so it's acyclic), each connected component can be processed independently.\n\nWait, but trees are connected and acyclic. So the graph is a collection of trees, each of which is connected.\n\nSo for each connected component, I can model the variables a_i as variables connected via these constraints, and perform a topological sort or use Union-Find with constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps model the problem as setting variables and checking for consistency.\n\nBut how to represent this? Maybe using BFS or DFS, assigning variables step by step.\n\nWait, but the variables are interdependent. For example, if node A is connected to B, which is connected to C, then the value of A depends on B, which depends on C, and vice versa. So it's a system of equations.\n\nOne approach is to model the problem using a graph where each node's value is determined relative to its parent. For example, choose a root node, set its value to a certain variable (like 1), and then propagate the constraints through the tree.\n\nWait, but the root's value could be any value, right? Or perhaps not, because other constraints might fix it.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as a system of equations where each equation is a_u * a_v = g * l for each edge (u, v).\n\nBut solving such a system is tricky because it's non-linear.\n\nAnother approach is to model each node's value as a multiple of some base variable. For example, pick a starting node, assign it a value, and then express other nodes in terms of that value.\n\nWait, but the system may have multiple solutions, and we need to find any one that satisfies all constraints.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem.\n\nEach edge (u, v) imposes a_u * a_v = s, where s = g*l (wait, no: s = g * l? Wait, no, because a_u is g*x and a_v is g*y, so a_u * a_v = g^2 * x * y = g * (g x y) = g * l, since l = g x y. So s = g * l? Wait, no: earlier calculation shows that a_u * a_v = g * l.\n\nWait, a_u = g x, a_v = g y. Their product is g² x y. But from the edge's LCM, l = g x y. So the product is g² x y = g * (g x y) = g * l. So yes, a_u * a_v = g * l.\n\nSo for each edge, the product of the two nodes' values is equal to g * l.\n\nSo for each edge, a_u * a_v = k, where k = g * l.\n\nSo the problem is to assign values to all nodes such that for each edge (u, v), the product of their values is k.\n\nBut this seems difficult because it's a multiplicative constraint.\n\nWait, but if we take logarithms, the product becomes a sum, but that introduces floating points which may complicate things. Plus, dealing with logs can cause precision issues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps model the variables as exponents in their prime factorization. But that could get complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node, the value can be expressed as a product of primes raised to certain exponents. Then, for each edge (u, v), the sum of exponents for each prime in u and v must add up in a way that their product is k.\n\nBut this feels too abstract. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose I have a tree structure. I can pick a root, say node 1, and assign it a value. Then, for each child, the value is determined based on the edge's product.\n\nWait, for example, suppose node 1 is connected to node 2 via an edge with product k=6. Then, node 1's value is a, node 2's is b, and a*b=6.\n\nIf node 2 is connected to node 3 via an edge with product k=8, then b*c=8. So c = 8/(b) = 8/(6/a) = (8a)/(6) = (4a)/3.\n\nBut for c to be an integer, 4a must be divisible by 3, so a must be a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, but how do I choose a? Because a can be any value, but the constraints must hold.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach can be used, but requires careful handling of the factors.\n\nSo, here's an outline of the steps I think I need to take:\n\n1. For each connected component (tree) in the graph, process it.\n\n2. Choose a root node for the tree. Let's say we choose node 0 as the root.\n\n3. Assign a value to the root. The root's value can be any positive integer, but perhaps we can choose it to be 1 for simplicity, but wait—no, because other edges may impose constraints that require the root to be a specific value.\n\nWait, but if the root is assigned a value, all other nodes' values are determined based on the edges. But sometimes, the constraints may not allow a consistent assignment.\n\nSo, for example, when processing a tree, I can represent each node's value as a function of the root's value. Then, after processing all edges, I check whether all the functions are consistent. If any function leads to a contradiction, the answer is NO.\n\nBut how to represent these functions?\n\nEach function for a node can be expressed as a rational number, indicating the ratio between the node's value and the root's value.\n\nFor example, if node u is connected to the root via an edge with product k, then a_u = k / a_root.\n\nThen, for each subsequent node, their a is determined by the path from the root, multiplying the ratios along the path.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So for each node, we can track a ratio (in terms of numerator and denominator) representing a_u / a_root. Then, along each edge, we can verify that the product of a_u and a_v equals the edge's k.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\n- Let r be the root.\n\n- For each node u, let f(u) = a_u / a_r.\n\n- Then, for each edge (u, v) with product k, we have a_u * a_v = k.\n\nSubstituting, (f(u) * a_r) * (f(v) * a_r) = k.\n\nWhich simplifies to f(u)*f(v) * a_r^2 = k.\n\nThus, f(u)*f(v) must equal k / a_r^2.\n\nBut wait, since a_r is the root, we can choose it freely, but it's constrained by the edges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each connected component, we can represent the relationships as a system where the product of the ratios along any path must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, for each edge (u, v), the product a_u * a_v is fixed. So in terms of f(u) and f(v), f(u)*f(v) = k / a_r^2.\n\nBut since a_r is a variable, perhaps we can represent f(u) as a fraction, and when processing all edges, ensure that the product of the fractions multiplied by a_r squared equals k.\n\nWait, but a_r is a variable that can be chosen, but subject to the constraints imposed by the edges.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose the root is node 1, and it has two edges:\n\nEdge 1: connects 1-2 with k=6.\n\nEdge 2: connects 2-3 with k=8.\n\nThen, for edge 1-2: a_1 * a_2 = 6.\n\nExpressed in terms of f(2) = a_2 / a_1, so a_2 = f(2)*a_1. Substituting into the equation: a_1 * (f(2)*a_1) = 6 → f(2)*a_1² =6 → f(2) = 6/(a_1²).\n\nSimilarly, for edge 2-3: a_2 * a_3 =8.\n\nExpressed as a_3 = 8/(a_2) = 8/(f(2)*a_1) = 8/(6/(a_1²)) ) → 8 * a_1² /6 → (4 a_1²)/3.\n\nSo a_3 = (4 a_1²)/3.\n\nBut a_3 must be an integer, so 4 a_1² must be divisible by 3, which implies that a_1² must be a multiple of 3. So a_1 must be a multiple of sqrt(3), but since a_1 is an integer, a_1 must be a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, but a_1 is the value of the root. So if a_1 is 3, then a_2 is 6/3=2, and a_3 is 8/(2)=4. So the values are 3,2,4. Does this satisfy the constraints?\n\nCheck edge 1-2: 3*2=6, correct.\n\nEdge 2-3: 2*4=8, correct.\n\nYes. So a_1 can be 3, which is a multiple of 3.\n\nAlternatively, a_1 could be 6, leading to a_2=6/6=1, a_3=8/(1)=8. That also works.\n\nSo in this case, there are multiple possible assignments, depending on the choice of a_1.\n\nBut the problem allows any valid assignment, so we just need to find one.\n\nHmm. So the key is to model the relationships between the nodes in terms of the root's value and find a value that makes all the constraints satisfied.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each connected component (tree):\n\n1. Assign a variable to the root (say, a_r = x).\n\n2. For each node u in the tree, express a_u as f(u) * x, where f(u) is a rational number (numerator and denominator).\n\n3. For each edge (u, v), the product a_u * a_v must equal the edge's k. Substituting, f(u)*x * f(v)*x = k → f(u)*f(v) = k/(x²).\n\n4. We need to find x such that for all edges in the tree, the product f(u)*f(v) equals k/(x²).\n\nBut how do we model this? Because f(u) is determined by the path from the root to u.\n\nWait, but for each node, the f(u) can be represented as a product of the ratios along the edges from the root to u.\n\nSo, for each node u, f(u) = product of f(e) for each edge e along the path from root to u.\n\nWait, but each edge e is between u and its parent p(u), so f(e) is a function that depends on the edge's k and the parent's x.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let's think of the f(u) as fractions, built incrementally as we traverse the tree.\n\nHere's a possible algorithm:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- Pick a root.\n\n- Perform a BFS or DFS traversal, keeping track of the current value x (the root's value is x).\n\n- For each node u, during traversal, assign a_u = x * (product of the edge ratios along the path from root to u).\n\nWait, but the edge ratios are determined by the edges. So for each edge (p, u), the product a_p * a_u = k_p (k_p is the product for that edge). So a_u = k_p / a_p.\n\nSo if a_p is known, a_u can be computed as k_p divided by a_p.\n\nSo the traversal can proceed as follows:\n\n1. Start with the root, assign a_r = x (variable to determine).\n\n2. For each neighbor v of u (excluding parent), compute a_v = k_uv / a_u.\n\n3. Proceed recursively until all nodes are processed.\n\nBut since a_r is a variable, how do we determine x such that all a_i are integers?\n\nBecause each a_v is computed as k_uv / a_u, which depends on a_u, which in turn depends on x.\n\nSo, for each node u, a_u can be expressed as (some function of x) which is a rational number.\n\nThe key is to model a_u as a rational number in terms of x, and then enforce that for each edge (u, v), a_u * a_v = k.\n\nBut since a_u = f(u) * x, and a_v = f(v) * x, then f(u)*x * f(v)*x = k → f(u)*f(v) = k/(x²).\n\nSo f(u) is a function of x, and f(u)*f(v) must equal k/(x²) for each edge (u, v).\n\nBut how can we model f(u)? Since each a_u is built from the root via a series of divisions by previous a's, perhaps f(u) can be represented as a product of fractions.\n\nFor example, if the root is x, and the first edge from root to u has k = k1, then a_u = k1/x. So f(u) = k1/(x * x) ?\n\nWait, maybe I should model f(u) as a fraction, numerator and denominator, which is a_u divided by x. So a_u = f(u) * x.\n\nThen, for each edge (u, v), a_u * a_v = (f(u)*x) * (f(v)*x) = f(u)*f(v)*x² = k.\n\nSo f(u)*f(v) = k/(x²).\n\nBut how to compute f(u)?\n\nWhen you move from u to v via an edge with product k_uv, a_v = k_uv / a_u.\n\nBut a_u is f(u)*x, so a_v = k_uv / (f(u)*x) → a_v / x = k_uv/(f(u)*x²) → f(v) = k_uv/(f(u)*x²).\n\nWait, that seems recursive. So f(v) depends on f(u), which in turn depends on x.\n\nBut perhaps I can represent f(u) as a rational number in terms of x. So for each node, f(u) can be written as a fraction numerator/denominator, where denominator is a power of x.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to represent f(u) as a rational number where the denominator is a square-free part, and the numerator is a product of factors.\n\nAlternatively, for each node, track the minimal polynomial equation that a_u must satisfy in terms of x.\n\nBut this seems complex.\n\nAnother approach: Since all the a's are expressed in terms of x, and we have multiple edges, perhaps we can collect all the constraints on x and solve them.\n\nFor each edge, the product a_u * a_v must be equal to k_uv.\n\nExpressed in terms of x, this is:\n\n(f(u) * x) * (f(v) * x) = k_uv → f(u) * f(v) * x² = k_uv.\n\nSo, for each edge, we have an equation involving f(u), f(v), and x.\n\nBut f(u) and f(v) are determined by the path from the root to u and v.\n\nSo, during the BFS/DFS traversal, for each node, we can compute f(u) as a function of x.\n\nFor example, if the root is x, and it has an edge to u with k = k1, then a_u = k1/x → f(u) = k1/(x^2).\n\nThen, if u has an edge to v with k = k2, then a_v = k2 / a_u = k2 / (k1/x) = (k2 x)/k1 → f(v) = (k2 x)/k1 / x = k2/(k1 x).\n\nSo, f(v) is (k2)/(k1 x^2).\n\nWait, but that's getting a bit messy. Perhaps, instead of tracking f(u) as a fraction, we can represent it as a linear function in x. Like f(u) = (A_u) * x + B_u, but that might not capture all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, for each node u, f(u) can be represented as a rational number in terms of x, say, p/q x^d, where d is the depth from the root.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: For each node, the value a_u can be expressed as x multiplied by a product of factors derived from the edges. So a_u = x * (product of (k_i) / (x * ... )) etc.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to model the problem as a system of equations. For each edge (u, v), a_u * a_v = k_uv. So each edge contributes an equation.\n\nWe can model this as a system of equations with variables being the a's, but since the a's are connected via multiplicative equations, it's non-linear.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to represent the variables in terms of each other.\n\nWait, for example, if we have a chain u1 - u2 - u3 - ... - un, then each consecutive pair (ui, ui+1) has a product equation. So a_u1 * a_u2 = k1, a_u2 * a_u3 = k2, ..., a_un * a_u(n+1) = kn.\n\nBut solving this would require expressing a_u in terms of a_u1.\n\nSo a_u2 = k1 / a_u1.\n\na_u3 = k2 / a_u2 = k2 * a_u1 / k1.\n\na_u4 = k3 / a_u3 = k3 * k1 / (k2 a_u1).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn general, a_un = (k_{n-1} * ... * k1) / (k_{n-2} * ... * k2) ) * (1/a_u1).\n\nWait, but for this to result in integer a's, all the intermediate steps must result in integers.\n\nSo, for the entire chain, a_u1 must be chosen such that all a's are integers.\n\nThis suggests that the product of the constants in the numerator and denominator must divide appropriately.\n\nBut how can this be generalized for arbitrary trees?\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, perhaps for each connected component, I can:\n\n- Choose a root node.\n\n- Express each node's value in terms of the root's value, as a function of x (the root's value).\n\n- For each edge, create an equation that must be satisfied.\n\n- Collect all such equations and solve for x.\n\nOnce x is determined, all a's can be computed.\n\nBut how to represent these functions?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model each a as a product of the edge constants and the inverse of the path products.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node, during BFS, we can track a fraction that represents a_u in terms of x.\n\nFor example, a_u = (product of edge constants along the path from root to u) / (x raised to the depth of u).\n\nWait, but this may not capture all cases correctly.\n\nAlternatively, during BFS, for each node u, track a value that is a fraction, say numerator and denominator, such that a_u = (numerator * x) / denominator.\n\nWait, but this could lead to a lot of fractions, which may become unwieldy.\n\nBut perhaps, using the fact that all edge products are known, we can manage this.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. For each connected component:\n\n   a. Perform a BFS or DFS starting from the root (e.g., node 0).\n\n   b. For each node u, track a value f(u), which is a rational number, such that a_u = f(u) * x.\n\n   c. For each edge (u, v), when processing it, compute f(v) in terms of f(u) and x.\n\n   d. Enforce that a_u * a_v = k_uv → f(u)*x * f(v)*x = k_uv → f(u)*f(v) = k_uv / (x^2).\n\n   e. Thus, for each edge, we can derive a constraint on x.\n\n2. After processing all edges in the component, collect all constraints on x and solve for x.\n\n   a. The constraints will be equations of the form f(u)*f(v) = k_uv / x^2.\n\n   b. These can be transformed into equations involving x, and then solved.\n\n   c. If there's no solution, the entire arrangement is impossible.\n\n3. Once x is found, compute all a's as f(u) * x.\n\nBut how to represent f(u) and collect the constraints?\n\nWell, for each node, f(u) is built as a product of fractions derived from the edges.\n\nFor example, when moving from u to v via an edge with k, a_v = k / a_u.\n\nBut a_u is f(u)*x, so a_v = k/(f(u)*x) → a_v/x = k/(f(u)*x²) → f(v) = k/(f(u)*x²).\n\nSo f(v) = k / (f(u) * x²).\n\nBut this is a recursive relation.\n\nSo during BFS, for each node, we can compute f(u) based on the parent's f and the edge's k.\n\nThus, during traversal:\n\n- For the root, f(root) is 1, because a_root = f(root)*x → a_root = x.\n\n- For each child v of u, f(v) = k_uv / (f(u) * x²).\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because a_v = k_uv / a_u → a_v = k_uv/(f(u)*x). Then, a_v /x = k_uv/(f(u)*x²) → f(v) = k_uv/(f(u)*x²).\n\nYes.\n\nSo, during BFS, for each node, compute f(v) based on the parent's f(u) and the edge's k.\n\nNow, for each edge (u, v), we can also write a constraint equation.\n\nBecause, for the edge (u, v), a_u * a_v = k_uv.\n\nExpressed in terms of f(u) and f(v), this is:\n\n(f(u)*x) * (f(v)*x) = k_uv → f(u)*f(v)*x² = k_uv.\n\nBut since f(v) is expressed in terms of f(u) and x, substituting into the equation gives:\n\nf(u) * (k_uv/(f(u)*x²)) * x² = k_uv → k_uv = k_uv.\n\nWhich is always true. So perhaps the edge constraints are automatically satisfied once f(u) and f(v) are computed correctly.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the way f(v) is computed from f(u) and x must ensure that the edge (u, v) is satisfied.\n\nSo perhaps during the BFS, all edges are automatically satisfied, provided that the f(u) and f(v) are computed correctly.\n\nThus, the main thing is to compute f(u) correctly for all nodes, and then find an x such that all f(u) are defined (i.e., denominators are non-zero, etc.), and that for any cycles, the product around the cycle is 1.\n\nWait, but what about cycles? Because in a tree, there are no cycles, but if the graph is not a tree, it's a forest, but each connected component is a tree. So cycles don't exist in the input, as it's a forest.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem statement says that the given roads form a forest. So each connected component is a tree.\n\nSo, no cycles, so the BFS approach is feasible without worrying about conflicting paths.\n\nSo, in that case, perhaps for each connected component, the f(u) can be uniquely determined, given x.\n\nWait, but how? Because each f(u) is expressed in terms of x and the path from the root.\n\nBut for each connected component, the way f(u) is built is based on the path from the root, which is unique in a tree.\n\nSo, for each node u, f(u) can be represented as a product of the edge factors, divided by x raised to the depth of u.\n\nBut how to represent this product as a fraction.\n\nSo, during BFS, for each node, we can track a numerator and denominator, and the exponent of x.\n\nWait, perhaps f(u) can be represented as (numerator, denominator, exponent), where f(u) = (num / den) * x^exp.\n\nBut this may complicate the implementation.\n\nAlternatively, during BFS, for each node u, track f(u) as a tuple (a, b), meaning a/b, and the exponent of x is tracked as the depth.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node u, f(u) is represented as a fraction, where the denominator is x^d, with d being the depth from the root.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nRoot is at depth 0, f(root) = 1 = 1/1 * x^0.\n\nIts child u is at depth 1, f(u) = k/(x^2) → (k, 1, 2).\n\nWait, but this is getting a bit abstract.\n\nPerhaps it's better to represent f(u) as a fraction, say p / q, where q is a product of x's.\n\nWait, let's think about the example again.\n\nIn the earlier example, with root 1, edges to 2 with k=6, and 2 to 3 with k=8.\n\nProcessing root 1: f(1) = 1.\n\nEdge 1-2: f(2) = 6/(x^2) → 6/(x²).\n\nEdge 2-3: f(3) = 8/(f(2)*x²) → 8/( (6/(x²)) * x² ) → 8/6 = 4/3 → f(3) = 4/3.\n\nWait, but then for the edge 1-2, a_1 * a_2 = x * (6/(x²)) = 6/x → which must equal 6.\n\nSo 6/x = 6 → x=1.\n\nBut then a_1=1, a_2=6/1=6, a_3=8/6=4/3. But 4/3 is not an integer. So that's invalid.\n\nWait, but earlier when I chose x=3, it worked.\n\nHmm, perhaps my approach is missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should track the exponents of x in the denominator.\n\nIn the earlier example, when processing node 2, f(2) = 6/(x²) → which is 6 * x^(-2).\n\nThen, for node 3, f(3) = 8/(f(2)*x²) → 8/( (6 x^(-2)) * x² ) → 8/(6) → 4/3.\n\nBut 4/3 is not dependent on x anymore. So for node 3, f(3) is 4/3.\n\nBut for the edge 1-3, a_1 * a_3 = x * (4/3 x) = 4/3 x².\n\nBut the edge 1-3 doesn't exist, but in this case, the edge 1-2 and 2-3 is sufficient.\n\nWait, but in this case, for the edge 2-3, a_2 * a_3 = (6/x) * (4/3 x) = 6/x *4x/3 = 8, which matches k=8.\n\nSo for the edge 2-3, it's satisfied.\n\nBut the root's x is determined by the other edges.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet's think of each node's a as a multiple of x, and during BFS, track the exponents and the coefficients.\n\nSo for each node u, a_u = coeff_u * x^power_u.\n\nThen, for an edge (u, v) with k, a_u * a_v = k.\n\nSubstituting, (coeff_u * x^power_u) * (coeff_v * x^power_v) = k.\n\nWhich implies coeff_u * coeff_v * x^{power_u + power_v} = k.\n\nSo, for each edge, this must hold.\n\nNow, the question is, how to assign coeff_u and power_u for each node, such that all edges are satisfied.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps during BFS, for each node, we can express coeff_u and power_u in terms of the root's coeff and power.\n\nWait, for the root, a_root = coeff_root * x^power_root.\n\nBut the root's a is just x (since it's the starting point), so coeff_root is 1, power_root is 1.\n\nWait, no. Because a_root is x, which is 1 * x^1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for the root, coeff is 1, power is 1.\n\nThen, for each edge (root, v), a_v = k / a_root = k / x.\n\nBut a_v must be expressed as coeff_v * x^power_v.\n\nSo, k/x = coeff_v * x^power_v.\n\nRearranged: coeff_v = k / (x^{power_v + 1}).\n\nBut this must be an integer, as a_v is an integer.\n\nWait, but coeff_v is a coefficient, not necessarily an integer. Hmm, perhaps this approach is not suitable.\n\nAlternatively, for each edge, we can express the product of the coefficients and the exponents.\n\nSo, for edge (u, v), coeff_u * coeff_v * x^{power_u + power_v} = k.\n\nThus, for each edge, this must hold.\n\nSo, during BFS, for each node, we can track the coefficient and exponent.\n\nFor the root, it's (1, 1).\n\nFor a child node v connected via edge k, a_v = k / a_root.\n\nSo, a_v = k / (1 * x^1) → a_v = (k) * x^{-1}.\n\nSo, coeff_v = k, power_v = -1.\n\nThen, for the next edge from v to another node w, a_w = k_vv / a_v → a_w = k_vv / (k x^{-1}) ) → a_w = (k_vv / k) * x.\n\nSo, coeff_w = k_vv / k, power_w = 1.\n\nBut for this to be integer, k must divide k_vv.\n\nSo, for each step, the division must result in an integer.\n\nThus, during BFS, for each edge, we can compute the necessary conditions on x.\n\nBut how to collect all these conditions and solve for x.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n1. Assign a root.\n\n2. Perform BFS, tracking for each node u, (coeff_u, power_u) such that a_u = coeff_u * x^{power_u}.\n\n3. For each edge (u, v), the product of a_u and a_v must equal k_uv. So, coeff_u * coeff_v * x^{power_u + power_v} = k_uv.\n\n   This equation must hold for x.\n\n4. Collect all such equations for each edge in the component.\n\n5. Solve the system of equations to find x.\n\n   a. If no solution exists, output NO.\n\n   b. Else, compute x, and then compute a_u for each node.\n\n6. Check that all a_u are integers, and that all edges satisfy a_u * a_v = k_uv.\n\n7. If all checks pass, output YES and the a's. Else, output NO.\n\nNow, the challenge is to model these equations and solve for x.\n\nBut how?\n\nEach equation is of the form:\n\nc1 * c2 * x^{e1 + e2} = k,\n\nwhere c1 and c2 are the coefficients of u and v, respectively.\n\nBut this can be rewritten as:\n\nc1 * c2 * x^{e1 + e2} = k.\n\nWhich can be rearranged as:\n\nx^{e1 + e2} = k / (c1 * c2).\n\nBut x must be an integer, so k must be divisible by c1 * c2.\n\nWait, but c1 and c2 are themselves variables depending on x.\n\nNo, wait: c1 and c2 are the coefficients determined during BFS, which are functions of x.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because during BFS, c1 and c2 are determined based on the path from the root.\n\nWait, but in the BFS, for each node u, c_u and e_u are determined based on the edges and the root.\n\nSo, perhaps for each node, c_u and e_u are known as rational numbers.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to represent c_u and e_u as fractions, such that c_u = p_u / q_u, and e_u is an integer.\n\nThen, the equation for edge (u, v) becomes:\n\n(p_u / q_u) * (p_v / q_v) * x^{e_u + e_v}",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of laughy mushrooms on each lawn based on the given roads and their GCD and LCM values. The solution involves reconstructing the graph and ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Representation**: Treat the lawns as nodes and roads as edges in a graph. Each edge has a GCD and LCM which constrains the product of the mushrooms on the connected nodes.\n2. **Connected Components**: Since the graph is a forest (acyclic), it consists of multiple trees. Each tree can be processed independently.\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use BFS to traverse each tree starting from an arbitrary root node. For each node, track the coefficient and exponent of the root's value in terms of x.\n4. **Equations for Constraints**: For each edge, derive an equation that relates the coefficients and exponents of the connected nodes. These equations help in determining the value of x (the root's mushroom count).\n5. **Solving for x**: Collect all constraints and solve for x. If no valid x exists, output \"NO\". Otherwise, compute the mushroom counts for each node and verify they satisfy all edge constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef readints():\n    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nedges = [[] for _ in range(n)]\nfor _ in range(m):\n    u, v, g, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    u -= 1\n    v -= 1\n    edges[u].append((v, g, l))\n    edges[v].append((u, g, l))\n\npossible = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    if not edges[i]:\n        possible.append(1)\n    else:\n        possible.append(None)\n\ncomponents = []\nvisited = [False] * n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if not visited[i]:\n        q = deque()\n        q.append(i)\n        visited[i] = True\n        component = []\n        while q:\n            u = q.popleft()\n            component.append(u)\n            for v, g, l in edges[u]:\n                if not visited[v]:\n                    visited[v] = True\n                    q.append(v)\n        components.append(component)\n\ndef solve_component(root, component):\n    coeff = {root: (1, 1)}  #
