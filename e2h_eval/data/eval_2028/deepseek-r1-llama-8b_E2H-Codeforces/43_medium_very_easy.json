He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem says that a string is formed in a specific way, and I need to check if a given string meets certain conditions.\n\nHmm, the process is: A starts with some 'a's, then B appends some 'b's, and then C appends some 'c's. But there are some constraints. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the initial string from A has at least one 'a'. Then B adds at least one 'b'. So after B, the string has both 'a's and 'b's. Then C adds some 'c's, but the number of 'c's must equal either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's (or both). Also, the order must be strictly a's followed by b's followed by c's.\n\nSo, the string S must satisfy these conditions:\n\n1. It starts with one or more 'a's.\n2. After the 'a's, there's one or more 'b's.\n3. After the 'b's, there's one or more 'c's.\n4. The count of 'c's must be equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's.\n\nWait, but wait. No— because when C appends the 'c's, the counts of 'a's and 'b's are as they were after B. So the 'c's added by C must equal the count of 'a's (before C) OR the count of 'b's (before C).\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input 'aaabccc', the counts are a:3, b:1, c:3. So c equals a, which is 3. So it's valid.\n\nIn the second example, 'bbacc'— let's parse this. Wait, no, the order matters. Because the string must be a... followed by b... followed by c.... So in 'bbacc', the first character is 'b'— that can't be right. Because A gives the string to B, who appends 'b's. So the string after A and B is a bunch of a's followed by a bunch of b's. So any 'b's can't come before 'a's, and similarly for 'c's.\n\nSo the structure must be: all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So the string cannot have any 'a's after a 'b' or 'c', or any 'b's after a 'c'.\n\nSo step one is to check the structure of the string. If the string doesn't consist of a sequence of a's, followed by b's, followed by c's without any interleaving, then it's automatically invalid.\n\nSo first, I need to split the string into three parts: a's, then b's, then c's. Each part must be non-empty.\n\nWait, no. Because according to the note, after A and B, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So after B, the string has at least one of each. Then C appends at least one 'c'. So the final string must have a's, then b's, then c's, each part at least length 1.\n\nSo the entire string can't be just a's or just b's or just c's.\n\nSo, the steps to check are:\n\n1. Check that the string has the form a^+ b^+ c^+.\n\n2. Once the structure is correct, check whether the count of 'c's is equal to the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's.\n\nSo how do I split the string into the a's, b's, and c's parts?\n\nI think we can iterate through the string and find where the transitions happen.\n\nLet me think: the string starts with a's, then switches to b's, then to c's. So the indices where the character changes can help.\n\nFor example, in 'aaabccc':\n\n- The first transition is from a to b at index 3 (0-based, 4th character).\n- The next transition is from b to c at index 4 (5th character).\n\nSo the a's are from 0 to 2, b's from 3 to 3, c's from 4 to 6.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Find the first occurrence where a character isn't 'a'— that's the end of a's.\n- Then, find the first occurrence where a character isn't 'b'— that's the end of b's.\n- Then, find the first occurrence where a character isn't 'c'— that's the end of c's.\n\nBut wait, the string must start with a's, then b's, then c's. So if any of these transitions don't happen, the string is invalid.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\n1. Check that the string starts with 'a's. So the first character must be 'a'. Else, it's invalid.\n\n2. Then, after the a's, the next part must be 'b's. So the next character after the a's must be 'b'. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to split the string into three segments. Let's see.\n\nSo, for a string S:\n\n- The a's are from the start until the first occurrence of 'b' or 'c'.\n- The b's are from the first 'b' until the first occurrence of 'c'.\n- The c's are from the first 'c' to the end.\n\nWait, but suppose the string is like 'aabbaaccc'— that would have a's, then b's, then a's again. Which would not fit the structure.\n\nSo, for the string to be valid, once the a's are done, only b's can follow, and then only c's.\n\nSo, the string must consist of a single block of a's, followed by a single block of b's, followed by a single block of c's.\n\nSo, the first step is to check this structure.\n\nHow can I do that?\n\nWe can track the current expected character.\n\nStart with 'a'. As long as the characters are 'a's, continue. Once a different character is found, switch to 'b' mode. All subsequent characters must be 'b's until a 'c' is encountered. Then, all remaining characters must be 'c's.\n\nIf at any point this condition is violated, the string is invalid.\n\nAlso, after all checks, the a's, b's, c's must all be present.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n- Initialize expected_char as 'a'.\n- For each character in the string:\n   - if char != expected_char:\n      - if expected_char is 'a':\n          expected_char becomes 'b'\n          continue\n      - elif expected_char is 'b':\n          expected_char becomes 'c'\n          continue\n      - else: (expected_char is 'c')\n          return invalid\n   - else:\n      continue\n- After processing all characters, if expected_char is still 'a' or 'b', that means the string didn't reach the 'c's, which is invalid.\n\nWait, but the string must have at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'. So the expected_char must transition from 'a' to 'b' to 'c' exactly once each, and the string ends with 'c's.\n\nSo, during iteration:\n\n- If the first character is not 'a', invalid.\n- Then, switch to 'b' when a 'b' is found after 'a's.\n- Then, switch to 'c' when a 'c' is found after 'b's.\n- After that, all must be 'c's.\n\nIf any other pattern occurs, like 'a' after 'b' or 'c' after 'b', it's invalid.\n\nOnce the structure is validated, then we need to count the number of 'a's, 'b's, 'c's.\n\nThen, check if the count of 'c's is equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's.\n\nWait, but in the case where the count of 'c's equals both, it's still acceptable.\n\nSo, for the counts:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's\n\nif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b → valid.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe algorithm is:\n\n1. Check the structure of the string:\n   a. Starts with one or more 'a's.\n   b. Followed by one or more 'b's.\n   c. Followed by one or more 'c's.\n   Any deviation makes it invalid.\n\n2. Count the number of 'a's, 'b's, 'c's.\n\n3. Check if count_c equals count_a or count_b. If yes, output YES; else, NO.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nSo, first, read the input string.\n\nThen, perform the structure check.\n\nImplementing the structure check:\n\nInitialize expected_char as 'a'.\n\nLoop through each character in the string:\n\n- For the first character, it must be 'a'; else, invalid.\n\n- For each subsequent character:\n\n   if current expected_char is 'a':\n\n      if char is 'a': continue\n\n      else:\n\n          expected_char becomes 'b'\n\n   elif expected_char is 'b':\n\n      if char is 'b': continue\n\n      else:\n\n          expected_char becomes 'c'\n\n   elif expected_char is 'c':\n\n      if char is 'c': continue\n\n      else: invalid.\n\nBut wait, this may not capture all cases correctly. Because, for example, after switching to 'b', any 'a' after that is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to track the current phase:\n\nPhase can be 'a', 'b', or 'c'.\n\nStart in phase 'a'.\n\nOnce a phase change happens, you can't go back.\n\nSo, here's another approach:\n\ncurrent_phase = 'a'\n\nfor char in S:\n\n    if current_phase == 'a':\n\n        if char == 'a':\n\n            continue\n\n        else:\n\n            # must be 'b'\n\n            current_phase = 'b'\n\n    elif current_phase == 'b':\n\n        if char == 'b':\n\n            continue\n\n        else:\n\n            # must be 'c'\n\n            current_phase = 'c'\n\n    elif current_phase == 'c':\n\n        if char == 'c':\n\n            continue\n\n        else:\n\n            # invalid\n\n            return False\n\n    else:\n\n        # shouldn't happen\n\n        pass\n\nAfter processing all chars, the current_phase must be 'c'.\n\nBecause the string must end with 'c's.\n\nAdditionally, each phase must have at least one character.\n\nWait, because after phase 'a', you switch to 'b' only once, and 'b' phase must have at least one 'b', same for 'c'.\n\nSo, during the iteration, when the phase changes from 'a' to 'b', we must ensure that 'b' exists (i.e., the first 'b' comes after 'a's), and then when it changes to 'c', 'c' exists.\n\nSo, perhaps we can track the last phase change.\n\nAnother idea: after the phase changes, the previous phases must have been completed.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to track the positions where the phases end.\n\nFor example:\n\nstart of a's: 0\n\nend of a's: i (where S[i] is 'b')\n\nthen, end of b's: j (where S[j] is 'c')\n\nthen, rest are c's.\n\nSo, the string is divided into three parts: a_part, b_part, c_part.\n\nEach part must be non-empty.\n\nSo, in code:\n\na_end = None\n\nb_end = None\n\nc_start = None\n\nfor i, char in enumerate(S):\n\n    if a_end is None:\n\n        if char == 'a':\n\n            a_end = i\n\n        else:\n\n            # must be 'b'\n\n            b_end = i\n\n    elif b_end is None:\n\n        if char == 'b':\n\n            b_end = i\n\n        else:\n\n            # must be 'c'\n\n            c_start = i\n\n    else:\n\n        # c part\n\n        if char != 'c':\n\n            # invalid\n\n            return False\n\nSo, after this loop, the a_end must be not None, b_end must be not None, and c_start must be not None.\n\nAnd, a_end < b_end < c_start.\n\nWait, no: a_end is the index after the last 'a' (so the next character is 'b'). Similarly, b_end is the index after the last 'b' (next is 'c').\n\nWait, no. Because, for example, in 'aaaabbbbc', the a_end is 4 (assuming 0-based indexes), the b_end is 8, and c_start is 9.\n\nSo, the a_part is from 0 to a_end (inclusive?), but perhaps it's better to represent a_end as the index of the last 'a'. Similarly for b_end and c_start.\n\nSo, for the string to be valid, the following must hold:\n\na_end is not None: meaning there's at least one 'a'.\n\nb_end is not None: meaning there's at least one 'b'.\n\nc_start is not None: meaning there's at least one 'c'.\n\nMoreover, a_end must be less than b_end, and b_end must be less than c_start.\n\nBecause the a's come before b's, which come before c's.\n\nSo, in code, after the loop:\n\nif a_end is None or b_end is None or c_start is None:\n\n    return False\n\nif a_end >= b_end or b_end >= c_start:\n\n    return False\n\nThis ensures that the a's end before the b's start, and b's end before c's start.\n\nWait, no. Because a_end is the index of the last 'a' (the position after the last a is b_end). So, a_end must be less than b_end.\n\nSimilarly, b_end must be less than c_start.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead the string.\n\nCheck that the string starts with 'a's, followed by 'b's, then 'c's.\n\nCompute count_a = a_end + 1.\n\ncount_b = b_end - a_end.\n\ncount_c = len(S) - c_start.\n\nThen, check if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nIf all the structural conditions are met, and the count_c condition is satisfied, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, let's test this logic against the examples.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc'\n\nProcessing:\n\na_end is 3 (indices 0-3 are 'a's).\n\nThen, the next is 'b' at index 4.\n\nb_end is 4? Or wait, let's see.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nInitially, a_end is None.\n\nAt i=0, char='a' → a_end=0.\n\ni=1, 'a' → a_end=1.\n\ni=2, 'a' → a_end=2.\n\ni=3, 'a' → a_end=3.\n\ni=4, 'b' → since a_end is not None and b_end is None → set b_end=4.\n\ni=5, 'c' → since b_end is not None and c_start is None → set c_start=5.\n\ni=6, 'c' → in c part, ok.\n\ni=7, 'c' → same.\n\nSo, a_end=3, b_end=4, c_start=5.\n\ncount_a = 3+1=4? Wait, no. Because a_end is the index of the last 'a' (3), so the number of a's is a_end+1=4.\n\ncount_b is b_end - a_end → 4-3=1.\n\ncount_c is len(S) - c_start → 7-5=2.\n\nWait, wait, no.\n\nWait, S is 'aaabccc' → indexes 0-6 (length 7).\n\nSo len(S) is 7.\n\nc_start is 5 (index 5 is 'c'), so c_part is from 5 to 6, which is 2 'c's.\n\nSo count_c is 2.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the count_c was 3. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sample.\n\nWait, no, the first sample input is 'aaabccc' → 'a','a','a','b','c','c','c'? Or wait, let me recheck.\n\nWait, no. The first sample input is 'aaabccc' → 'a','a','a','b','c','c','c' ?\n\nWait, no, the first sample input is 'aaabccc' → which is a a a b c c c → length 7.\n\nSo a_end is 3 (indexes 0-3 are a's), then b is at 4, then c starts at 5.\n\nSo c_part is from 5 to 6: two c's.\n\nWait, but in the note, the count of 'c's is equal to 'a's, which is 3. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, 'aaabccc' → the string is 'aaa' followed by 'b' followed by 'ccc' → a's count is 3, b's count is 1, c's count is 3.\n\nAh, okay, so in my earlier analysis, the code would have:\n\na_end is 3 (index of the last a is 3).\n\nb_end is 4 (index of the last b is 4).\n\nc_start is 5 (index of first c is 5).\n\nSo, count_a is 3+1=4? No, wait, a_end is the last index of 'a's. So the number of a's is a_end + 1.\n\nWait, no. Because a_end is 3, which is the index of the last 'a' in the string. So the a's are from 0 to 3, inclusive, which is 4 letters.\n\nBut wait, in the sample, the a's count is 3, not 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how to calculate the counts.\n\nWait, no. In the sample, the string is 'aaabccc' → the a's are 'aaa' → 3 a's.\n\nWait, why is that?\n\nWait, let's count the letters:\n\nIndices:\n\n0: a\n\n1: a\n\n2: a\n\n3: b\n\n4: c\n\n5: c\n\n6: c\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, 'aaabccc' is a a a b c c c → a's are 3, b's 1, c's 3.\n\nSo the code I'm thinking of would have:\n\na_end is 2 (index 2 is the last a), because the next character is 'b' at index 3.\n\nSo, a_end is 2.\n\nb_end is 3.\n\nc_start is 4.\n\nSo, count_a is a_end + 1 → 3.\n\ncount_b is b_end - a_end → 1.\n\ncount_c is len(S) - c_start → 7 -4=3.\n\nSo, count_c is 3, which equals count_a.\n\nSo the code will output YES.\n\nSo in code, the variables should be correctly capturing the counts.\n\nSo perhaps the code needs to:\n\ncount_a = a_end + 1\n\ncount_b = b_end - a_end\n\ncount_c = len(S) - c_start\n\nSo, yes.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nRead S.\n\nCheck if the first character is 'a'. If not, return NO.\n\nThen, track a_end, b_end, c_start.\n\nIf any of them are None after processing, return NO.\n\nAlso, check that a_end < b_end < c_start.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nThen, compute counts.\n\nCheck if count_c equals count_a or count_b.\n\nIf yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo, now, let's write this in code.\n\nBut first, handle edge cases.\n\nWhat about a string that's just 'a'? It fails because it doesn't have b's and c's.\n\nWhat about 'ab'? Fails because no c's.\n\nWhat about 'abc'? a's count is 1, b's count 1, c's count 1. So count_c equals both, so YES.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbbc' → a's count 2, b's count 3, c's count 1. So count_c is 1. Is 1 equal to a (2) or b (3)? No. So output is NO.\n\nAnother example: 'abbcca' → structure is a, then bb, then cca. So after a, comes b, then c. So the structure is invalid because after 'b's, 'c's start, but then 'a's appear again. So it's invalid.\n\nSo, the code needs to correctly track the phases.\n\nSo, code:\n\nRead S.\n\nif len(S) == 0:\n\n    print('NO')\n\nelse:\n\n    a_end = None\n\n    b_end = None\n\n    c_start = None\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(S):\n\n        if a_end is None:\n\n            if char == 'a':\n\n                a_end = i\n\n            else:\n\n                if char != 'b':\n\n                    print('NO')\n\n                    exit()\n\n                b_end = i\n\n        elif b_end is None:\n\n            if char == 'b':\n\n                b_end = i\n\n            else:\n\n                if char != 'c':\n\n                    print('NO')\n\n                    exit()\n\n                c_start = i\n\n        else:\n\n            if char != 'c':\n\n                print('NO')\n\n                exit()\n\n    # After loop\n\n    if a_end is None or b_end is None or c_start is None:\n\n        print('NO')\n\n        exit()\n\n    # Check phase transitions\n\n    if a_end >= b_end or b_end >= c_start:\n\n        print('NO')\n\n        exit()\n\n    # Compute counts\n\n    count_a = a_end + 1\n\n    count_b = b_end - a_end\n\n    count_c = len(S) - c_start\n\n    # Check c count\n\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n        print('YES')\n\n    else:\n\n        print('NO')\n\nWait, but in the code, after a_end is set, the next character is 'b' or 'c'?\n\nNo, wait: when a_end is not None, and b_end is None, then the next character must be 'b'. Otherwise, it's invalid.\n\nBut in the code, after a_end is set, the next step is to check if b_end is None. So in the first case, when a_end is set, the next character is checked.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the string starts with a's, then a 'c'— then, the code would set a_end, then in the next iteration, since b_end is None, and the char is 'c', which is not 'b', so it's invalid.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, this should handle the structure correctly.\n\nTesting the sample input 1: 'aaabccc' → a_end=2, b_end=3, c_start=4.\n\ncount_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3 → 3 ==3 → YES.\n\nSample input 2: 'bbacc' → the first character is 'b', so in the code, a_end remains None. So, the code returns 'NO' immediately.\n\nSample input 3: 'aabc' → structure is a, then a, then b, then c. So, after a_end is set to 0 (first 'a'), the next character is 'a' again. Since b_end is None, the code expects 'b' now. So 'a' is not 'b', so it's invalid. So output is 'NO'.\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nWait, the string is 'aabc' → 'a','a','b','c'.\n\nSo, a_end is set to 0 (i=0), then i=1, char is 'a' → a_end becomes 1.\n\nThen, since a_end is not None and b_end is None → the next char must be 'b'. At i=2, char is 'b' → b_end is set to 2.\n\nThen, i=3: char is 'c' → since b_end is not None, and c_start is None → set c_start=3.\n\nSo, the loop completes.\n\nCheck a_end=1, b_end=2, c_start=3.\n\na_end < b_end < c_start → 1<2<3 → true.\n\nCount_a: 1+1=2.\n\ncount_b: 2-1=1.\n\ncount_c:4-3=1.\n\ncount_c=1 → compare to 2 and 1.\n\nIt equals count_b (1). So output YES.\n\nWait, but according to the sample input 3, the output is 'YES'.\n\nWait, but the sample input 3 is 'aabc'?\n\nWait, wait, no. The third example in the problem statement is 'aabc'?\n\nWait, the problem says that the third example's output is 'YES' because the number of c's equals the number of b's.\n\nWait, 'aabc' has a's count 2, b's count 1, c's count 1.\n\nSo, count_c=1 equals count_b=1. So it's valid.\n\nSo code would output YES.\n\nBut according to the code, in the structure check:\n\nAfter a_end=1, b_end=2, c_start=3.\n\nSo, the structure is a's (0-1), then b's (2), then c's (3). So the string is 'aa bc' → 'aabc' is 'aa' followed by 'b' followed by 'c' → which is valid.\n\nWait, but the code seems to accept it.\n\nSo, in code, the structure is correct, and count_c is equal to count_b.\n\nSo, the code would output YES.\n\nBut in the sample input, the third example is 'aabc'?\n\nWait, the problem's sample inputs are written as a list, but perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the sample input is:\n\nInput:\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\nOutput:\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\nSo, the third string is 'aabc' → which is 'a', 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\nSo, according to the code, it's valid.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → a:1, b:1, c:1 → c equals a and b → valid.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbbc' → a:2, b:3, c:1 → c is 1. Not equal to a or b. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → a:1, b:3, c:1 → 1 ==1 → YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaaccc' → structure is a, then abbaaccc → so after a, it's b, but then a appears again. So the code would detect this and return NO.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nWhat about when the string is 'a' → too short.\n\nOr 'ab' → no c's.\n\nOr 'abcde' → but the problem says only a, b, c are allowed. So perhaps the code doesn't need to handle that, but according to the problem statement, the string consists only of a, b, c.\n\nSo, the code can assume that.\n\nNow, code-wise:\n\nWe can proceed as above.\n\nSo, the code reads the string, processes it, and outputs accordingly.\n\nAnother test case: 'ac' → structure invalid, since after a comes c → code returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'acb' → same issue.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaaccc' → after a's, the next is b's, but then a's again → invalid.\n\nSo, code correctly rejects.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by a specific sequence of operations. The string must start with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and end with one or more 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Structure**: The string must strictly follow the order 'a's → 'b's → 'c's without any interleaving.\n2. **Count Characters**: After verifying the structure, count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n3. **Validate Counts**: Ensure the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nS = input().strip()\n\nif not S:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\na_end = None\nb_end = None\nc_start = None\n\nfor i, char in enumerate(S):\n    if a_end is None:\n        if char == 'a':\n            a_end = i\n        else:\n            if char != 'b':\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit()\n            b_end = i\n    elif b_end is None:\n        if char == 'b':\n            b_end = i\n        else:\n            if char != 'c':\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit()\n            c_start = i\n    else:\n        if char != 'c':\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n\nif a_end is None or b_end is None or c_start is None:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif a_end >= b_end or b_end >= c_start:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\ncount_a = a_end + 1\ncount_b = b_end - a_end\ncount_c = len(S) - c_start\n\nif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Structure Check**: The code iterates through the string to ensure it starts with 'a's, transitions to 'b's, and then transitions to 'c's. It uses indices to track where each segment ends and starts.\n2. **Character Counting**: After ensuring the correct structure, the code counts the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n3. **Validation**: The code checks if the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If both conditions are met, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the structure and validates the counts, ensuring the solution handles all edge cases correctly.",
