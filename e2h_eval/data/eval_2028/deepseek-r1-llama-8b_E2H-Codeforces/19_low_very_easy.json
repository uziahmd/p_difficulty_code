The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem is called \"The Number Games.\" Hmm. The setup is that there are n districts connected in such a way that each pair has exactly one path between them. So it's a tree structure.\n\nEach district's contestant has a number of fans equal to 2^i, where i is the district number. The president wants to remove k contestants, but when he does, the districts they're from become inaccessible. So all the remaining districts must form a connected component. Oh right, because otherwise, how would someone travel through the districts that are removed?\n\nWait, no. Wait: the problem says that the removed districts will not allow anyone to cross through them. So the remaining districts must be such that their paths do not go through any removed district. That means the remaining districts form a connected subtree where none of the removed nodes are on any of their paths.\n\nSo the goal is to select k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected subgraph, and the sum of their fans is as large as possible. And we need to output which districts are removed, in increasing order.\n\nHmm, okay. So how do we approach this?\n\nI think the key here is to find the minimal set of nodes to remove so that the remaining nodes form a connected component. But wait, since the president can only remove k nodes, perhaps we need to find a way to choose the k nodes whose removal maximizes the sum of the remaining 2^i terms.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the fans is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n - sum of the removed nodes' 2^i. Wait, no—because when you remove a node, you subtract its contribution, and also, the remaining nodes must form a connected component. So it's not just about choosing the top k nodes with the highest 2^i values, because sometimes removing certain nodes might split the tree into multiple components, which we cannot allow.\n\nSo we need to ensure that after removing the k nodes, the remaining nodes form a connected subtree. So the problem reduces to selecting a subset S of nodes such that:\n\n- |S| = n - k\n- S is connected (i.e., forms a connected subtree)\n- The sum of 2^i for i in S is maximized.\n\nAnd then, the nodes not in S are the ones to remove.\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum sum subset S with size n-k that is connected. Then, the nodes to remove are those not in S.\n\nNow, the question is, how to find such a subset S efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tree. Since it's a tree, any two nodes have exactly one path between them. So if S is connected, it must form a subtree. So the idea is to find a subtree S of size n-k that includes as many high-value nodes as possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, the value of each node is 2^i, which grows exponentially with i. So higher-numbered nodes contribute more to the sum. Therefore, to maximize the sum, we want to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut the problem is that including some lower-numbered nodes may allow us to include more higher-numbered nodes. For example, if the tree is a straight line (like a linked list), then to include the last node, you have to include all previous ones up to some point.\n\nSo the optimal S is a subtree that includes the largest possible number of high-numbered nodes, while ensuring that they form a connected component.\n\nSo the plan is to find the largest possible subtree S that contains as many high-numbered nodes as possible. Because 2^i increases with i, including higher-numbered nodes gives a larger sum.\n\nWait, but the subtree must be connected. So perhaps the optimal S is the largest possible connected subtree that includes the highest possible nodes.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe we can model this as trying to find a subtree that consists of a chain of nodes, starting from some root, and including as many high-numbered nodes as possible, but without requiring that all lower-numbered nodes are included.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: think about the tree as a collection of nodes, each contributing 2^i. We need to select a connected subset S of size m = n -k. To maximize the sum, we want S to include the m nodes with the highest 2^i values, but they must form a connected component.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true because maybe including some lower-numbered nodes allows more high-numbered nodes to be included. For example, imagine a star-shaped tree where the center is node 1, and all other nodes are connected directly to it. If we decide to exclude node 1, then the remaining nodes form a star shape with node 1 removed. But that's disconnected. So to include",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component and maximize the total number of fans. The key insight is that higher-numbered districts contribute more to the total number of fans, so we should aim to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring they remain connected.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Exponential Fan Contribution**: Each district's fan count is \\(2^i\\), which grows exponentially with the district number. Higher-numbered districts have significantly more fans.\n3. **Connected Component**: After removing k districts, the remaining districts must form a single connected component.\n\nThe optimal strategy is to find a subtree that includes the maximum number of high-numbered districts while maintaining connectivity. This can be achieved by finding the subtree rooted at the highest possible node (with the largest index) and including as many nodes as possible from its descendants.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nsys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n    \n    parent = [0] * (n + 1)\n    depth = [0] * (n + 1)\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    stack = [1]\n    visited[1] = True\n    order = []\n    while stack:\n        u = stack.pop()\n        order.append(u)\n        for v in edges[u]:\n            if not visited[v]:\n                visited[v] = True\n                parent[v] = u\n                depth[v] = depth[u] + 1\n                stack.append(v)\n    \n    result = []\n    removed = set()\n    target_size = n - k\n    max_node = n\n    current_size = 1\n    while current_size < target_size:\n        next_node = parent[max_node]\n        if next_node == 0:\n            break\n        if next_node not in removed:\n            removed.add(next_node)\n            current_size += 1\n            max_node = next_node\n    while len(order) > 1:\n        if order[-1] not in removed:\n            removed.add(order.pop())\n    print(' '.join(map(str, sorted(removed))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Tree Construction**: We first build the tree using adjacency lists.\n2. **BFS for Parent and Depth**: Using BFS, we determine the parent and depth of each node starting from node 1.\n3. **Determine Removed Nodes**: Starting from the highest-numbered node, we move up towards the root, removing nodes until we reach the required size of the connected component.\n4. **Collect Results**: The nodes to be removed are collected and printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we keep the highest possible sum of fans while maintaining connectivity, efficiently solving the problem within the given constraints.",
