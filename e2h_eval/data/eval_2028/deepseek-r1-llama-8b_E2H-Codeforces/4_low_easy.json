The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a Rock-Paper-Scissors game between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They play n rounds, and in each round, the winner gives the loser a pinch, which leaves a red spot. We need to calculate how many red spots each has after all the rounds.\n\nHmm, let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n- Each player has their own sequence of moves that they cycle through.\n- For each round, both choose the next move in their respective sequences. So, for the i-th round, Nikephoros uses A[i % m], where m is the length of his sequence. Similarly for Polycarpus with B[i % k].\n- Then, we determine who wins each round. If it's a draw, no one gets a spot. Otherwise, the winner gets a point, and the loser adds a spot.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that the loser gets pinched. So each round, if there's a winner (not a draw), the loser gets a spot. So for each round, exactly one person gets a spot unless it's a draw.\n\nSo our task is to simulate each round, determine the outcome, and count the number of times each loses.\n\nBut simulating each round for n up to 2e5 (200,000) is manageable because 2e5 is not too big for Python.\n\nWait, but wait. The sequences A and B can be up to 1000 characters each. So for each round, we have to find the current choice of each player based on their cyclic sequences.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, for each round i (starting from 0?), or from 1? Well, in programming terms, it's zero-based or one-based, but for the index, it depends on how we handle it. But in any case, for each round, the current move of each player is A[i % m] and B[j % k], where j is perhaps the same as i? Or wait, no—each round is determined by the same i. Because both players choose their moves based on the same round number. So for the first round, both start at position 0 (if zero-based) or 1 (if one-based). Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nIn the sample input, for n=7, the sequences are RPS and RSPP. Let's see how the rounds go.\n\nRound 1: A's move is R, B's move is R. It's a draw. No one gets a spot.\n\nRound 2: A's next is P, B's next is S. P beats S, so B wins. So A gets a spot.\n\nWait, but the sample explanation says that in the second round, P vs S: P beats S, so Polycarpus loses (since he played S). So Polycarpus gets a spot. Wait, no: in that scenario, Polycarpus is the loser. So in that round, Polycarpus would get a spot.\n\nWait, the sample explanation says:\n\nThe game went like:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → P wins. So Polycarpus chose S, Nikephoros chose P. So Polycarpus lost. So he gets a spot.\n\nThen Round 3: S vs P → S beats P. So Polycarpus chose P, loses again. So he gets a spot.\n\nWait, but according to the sample output, Polycarpus has 2 spots. So how does that add up?\n\nWait the sample input is:\n\nA = 'RPS' (so m=3), B = 'RSPP' (k=4).\n\nn=7 rounds.\n\nLet me list each round:\n\nRound 1: i=0.\n\nA's move: R (i=0 mod 3 is 0)\n\nB's move: R (i=0 mod4 is 0)\n\nDraw. No spots.\n\nRound 2: i=1.\n\nA: P (index 1)\n\nB: S (index1)\n\nP vs S: P beats S. So Polycarpus loses. He gets a spot. So Polycarpus's count is 1.\n\nRound3: i=2.\n\nA: S (index2)\n\nB: R (index2)\n\nS vs R: Rock beats scissors. So A wins. So Polycarpus (chose R) loses. So he gets another spot. Now he has 2.\n\nRound4: i=3.\n\nA: R (index3 mod3 is 0).\n\nB: P (index3 mod4 is3).\n\nR vs P: Paper beats rock. So B wins. So Polycarpus's move is P. So A (chose R",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots each player gets after playing n rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each round, the winner pinches the loser, leaving a red spot. If the round is a draw, no one gets a spot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B` for each player.\n2. **Cyclic Selection**: For each round, both players select their move cyclically from their respective sequences. This means that each player's move repeats in a cycle based on the length of their sequence.\n3. **Determine Winner**: For each round, check who wins based on the Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:\n   - Rock beats Scissors\n   - Scissors beat Paper\n   - Paper beats Rock\n4. **Count Spots**: If a player loses a round, increment their red spot count.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\na_spots = 0\nb_spots = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a_move = A[i % len(A)]\n    b_move = B[i % len(B)]\n    \n    if a_move == b_move:\n        continue\n    # Determine winner\n    if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n        a_spots += 1\n    else:\n        b_spots += 1\n\nprint(a_spots, b_spots)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Cyclic Selection**: Each player's moves are selected cyclically using modulo operations to cycle through their sequence.\n- **Winning Check**: For each round, we check if the current move of Nikephoros beats Polycarpus's move or vice versa. If it's a draw, no spots are awarded.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently processes each round in constant time, making the overall time complexity O(n), which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly simulate each round and count the red spots accurately for both players.",
