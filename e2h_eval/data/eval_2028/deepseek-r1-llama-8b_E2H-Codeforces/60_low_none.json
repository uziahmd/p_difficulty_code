Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is related to Morse code and counting the number of valid substrings after each modification to a string S.\n\nHmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, each character in S can be either '0' or '1', representing dots and dashes respectively. After each append operation, we need to compute how many non-empty sequences of English letters (each represented by a unique Morse code) are present as substrings of S. And because the numbers can be huge, we have to output them modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, right. So for every possible substring of S, we check if it's a valid Morse code for an English letter. Then, we count all such valid substrings across all possible substrings, but without double-counting. Or wait, no—wait, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\". So each valid substring contributes exactly one count, regardless of how many times it appears. Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no: the problem says the number of non-empty sequences, which are the English letters. So for example, each valid Morse substring corresponds to exactly one English letter. So the task is to find the total number of distinct English letters that can be formed from any substring of the current S.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code. So each substring of S that is a valid Morse code (i.e., corresponds to an English letter) counts as one towards the total. But wait, each such substring can represent exactly one letter. So the task is to count all possible distinct substrings of S that form valid Morse codes, but considering that different substrings could correspond to the same letter. Or wait, no: no, the count is for each substring, regardless of whether it represents the same letter as another substring.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. For example, if S is \"11\", then the substrings are \"1\" and \"11\". Each of these corresponds to a letter, say M for \"11\". So the total count would be 2: one for the first \"1\" (T), and another for the second \"11\" (M). So the count is the number of valid Morse code substrings, not the number of unique letters they represent.\n\nSo the problem is to count, for each step, the number of substrings of S (up to m steps) that form a valid Morse code. Each such substring is a sequence of 0s and 1s, possibly length 1-4, that is not one of the four invalid strings.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each step i (after adding the ith character), we need to consider all possible substrings ending at position i (since we add characters one by one, perhaps it's efficient to track all possible substrings that end at each position).\n\nBut the problem is that the number of substrings can be O(n^2), which for m up to 3000 is manageable since 3000^2 is 9 million, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is to, for each new character added, look back up to 4 positions and for each possible length (1 to 4), check if the substring is valid. If it is, add it to a running total.\n\nBut wait, how do we efficiently check if a substring is valid? Well, the invalid substrings are known: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". Any other substring of 0s and 1s of length 1-4 is valid.\n\nSo for any substring of length 1-4, if it's not one of these four, it's valid.\n\nThus, for each new character, we can look back 0,1,2,3,4 steps, and for each possible window, extract the substring, check if it's in the invalid set. If it's not, then it's a valid substring, and we add 1 to the total.\n\nWait, but for each new character, the maximum possible new substrings added are 4: the ones ending at the current character with lengths 1,2,3,4.\n\nBecause, for example, when the string is built up to position i, the new substrings that end at i are those starting at i, i-1, i-2, i-3, i-4 (but only if those positions are >=0).\n\nSo for each new character, we can consider all possible substrings ending at i with lengths 1,2,3,4, and check each against the invalid set.\n\nSo for each step, the maximum number of substrings to check is 4, each of length up to 4. That's manageable.\n\nSo the steps",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of valid Morse code substrings in a string after each modification. Each character in the string can be either '0' (dot) or '1' (dash). A valid Morse code substring corresponds to an English letter and is not one of the four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: After each modification to the string, we need to count all valid Morse code substrings. Each valid substring must be checked against the known invalid strings.\n2. **Efficient Checking**: For each new character added to the string, check the last 4 possible substrings (of lengths 1 to 4) ending at the current position. This ensures we efficiently count valid substrings without redundant checks.\n3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, use modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to keep the results manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\ninvalid = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\nm = int(input())\ns = []\nresult = []\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    c = input().strip()\n    s.append(c)\n    total = 0\n    # Check all substrings ending with current character with length 1 to 4\n    for l in range(1, 5):\n        if len(s) < l:\n            continue\n        substr = ''.join(s[-l:])\n        if substr not in invalid:\n            total += 1\n    result.append(total % MOD)\n\nfor res in result:\n    print(res)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: Read the number of modifications and each subsequent character.\n- **String Construction**: Maintain a list `s` to build the string incrementally.\n- **Substring Checking**: For each new character, check all possible substrings of lengths 1 to 4 ending at this character. If a substring is not in the set of invalid strings, count it as valid.\n- **Result Collection**: Collect results after each modification and print them modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count valid substrings by only checking the necessary substrings after each modification, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
