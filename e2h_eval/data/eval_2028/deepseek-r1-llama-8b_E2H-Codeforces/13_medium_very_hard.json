For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. Hmm, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem statement again. The notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. And they loop cyclically after H back to C. The distance between consecutive notes is one semitone, which is 0.5 tone. But for this problem, I think we only care about the semitone counts.\n\nA major triad is when the notes can be ordered such that the first two have a distance of 4 semitones and the next two have 3. So total 7 semitones apart. Wait, no—wait, the triad consists of X, Y, Z. When arranged in some order, the distance from X to Y is 4, Y to Z is 3. So overall, X to Z is 7.\n\nFor a minor triad, it's the opposite: X to Y is 3, Y to Z is 4. So X to Z is 7 as well. Oh, right, but in different orderings.\n\nSo the task is, given three notes, check all possible orderings of these three notes and see if any of them form a major or minor triad.\n\nWait, but since it's an unordered set, we need to consider all possible permutations of the three notes to find if any permutation satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\nBut wait, what if the same note is present more than once? Oh, but according to the problem statement, the input is three space-separated notes. So each note is distinct, I assume. Because otherwise, it's unclear how a chord would be formed with repeated notes. So I can assume that the three notes are all distinct.\n\nSo, for the given three notes, I need to generate all possible orderings (permutations) of these three, and for each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes. Then, check if any permutation satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to compute all possible cycles of the three notes in the circular note list and check their distances. But perhaps the permutation approach is easier.\n\nWait, but the note ordering is important because the distance is calculated in a specific direction. For example, the distance from X to Y is the number of semitones upwards from X to Y. So if the notes are arranged in a certain way, the distances add up.\n\nSo, for each permutation of the three notes, we can calculate the distances between the first and second, and between the second and third. Then, if either of those sequences is 4 followed by 3, it's a major; if it's 3 followed by 4, it's minor.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the triad is considered major or minor based on the existence of such an ordering. So for a given set of three notes, if any permutation satisfies the major condition, then it's a major triad. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut the problem also states that there are no cases where a triad is both major and minor. So I don't have to worry about that.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read the three notes into a list.\n\n2. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes. Since there are 3! = 6 permutations.\n\n3. For each permutation (X, Y, Z), compute the distances between X and Y, and Y and Z.\n\n   a. Compute the index positions of each note in the list of 12 notes. So first, create a dictionary mapping each note to its position. For example, 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, 'D' is 2, and so on up to 'H' being 11.\n\n   b. Then, the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12, but wait, no—since the distance is measured from lower to higher. So for example, if X is H (11) and Y is C (0), the distance is 1 semitone (from H to C). Wait, but according to the problem statement, the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So the distance is always the number of steps forward in the cycle.\n\nWait, no. The problem says: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone.\" So the distance from C to E is 4 semitones because E is four steps ahead: C (0), C# (1), D (2), D# (3), E (4). So distance is 4.\n\nBut the distance from E to C is 8 semitones because you go E (4), F (5), F# (6), G (7), G# (8), A (9), B (10), H (11), C (0). So that's 8 steps.\n\nSo, for any two notes X and Y, the distance from X to Y is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12. Because if X is before Y, it's straightforward. If Y is after X, it's Y - X. If Y is before X, then it's (Y + 12 - X) mod 12? Wait no. Wait, the distance is always the minimal steps going forward, but according to the problem statement, the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So if X is H (11) and Y is C (0), the distance is 1 semitone (since moving forward from H to C is one step). Wait, no: H to C is a half-step, which is 0.5 tone, but in semitones, that's 1 semitone. Because a semitone is 1/2 of a tone. So yes, the distance from X to Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. Because even when Y comes after X in the cycle, the mod will wrap around correctly.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let's say X is at index i, Y is at j. The distance from X to Y is (j - i) % 12. Because if j < i, it wraps around. For example, i=11 (H), j=0 (C): 0-11 = -11 mod 12 = 1. Which is correct, as H to C is one semitone.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for each permutation (X, Y, Z), compute d1 = (Y - X) mod 12, d2 = (Z - Y) mod 12.\n\nIf d1 is 4 and d2 is 3, then the permutation is a major triad.\n\nIf d1 is 3 and d2 is 4, then it's a minor triad.\n\nSo, for each permutation, check these two conditions. If any permutation satisfies major, then output 'major'. Else, check for minor. If any permutation satisfies minor, output 'minor'. Else, output 'strange'.\n\nNow, the challenge is to generate all possible permutations of the three notes, compute the distances, and check.\n\nBut wait, considering that the same set can be arranged in different ways, but each permutation is a different order. So for each permutation, we need to calculate the distances.\n\nSo, in code, the steps are:\n\n- Create a note_to_index dictionary, mapping each note to its position.\n\n- Read the three notes as a list, say notes = [n1, n2, n3].\n\n- For each permutation of notes:\n\n   For perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n\n      x, y, z = perm\n\n      ix, iy, iz = note_to_index[x], note_to_index[y], note_to_index[z]\n\n      d1 = (iy - ix) % 12\n\n      d2 = (iz - iy) % 12\n\n      if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n          return 'major'\n\n      elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n          return 'minor'\n\n- After checking all permutations, if none found, return 'strange'.\n\nWait, but in the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: C E G\n\nIn the permutation C, E, G: d1 is E-C is 4 semitones, E-G is 3. So major.\n\nSample Input 2: C# B F\n\nLooking for the permutation that could satisfy minor. Let's see:\n\nNotes are C#, B, F.\n\nWe can arrange them as B, C#, F.\n\nB is index 10, C# is 1, F is 5.\n\nd1 = (1 -10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3.\n\nd2 = (5-1) mod 12 =4.\n\nSo yes, that's a minor triad.\n\nAnother sample: A B H.\n\nWhat's the indexes?\n\nA is 9, B is 10, H is 11.\n\nCheck all permutations:\n\nA B H:\n\nd1 = (10-9)=1, d2=1. Not.\n\nA H B:\n\nA (9), H(11): d1=2 mod12=2.\n\nH (11), B(10): d2=(10-11) mod12= ( -1 ) mod12=11. No.\n\nB A H:\n\nB(10) to A(9): (9-10) mod12= 11.\n\nA to H: (11-9) mod12=2. No.\n\nB H A:\n\nB(10) to H(11): 1.\n\nH to A: (9-11) mod12=10. No.\n\nH A B:\n\nH(11) to A(9): (9-11) mod12=10.\n\nA to B: 1. No.\n\nH B A:\n\nH to B: (10-11) mod12=11.\n\nB to A: (9-10) mod12=11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations give the required distances. So the output is 'strange'.\n\nSo the code should correctly handle these cases.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, how do I represent the notes? They are given as strings, like 'C', 'E', etc. So first, I'll create a list of the 12 notes in order, and a dictionary to map each note to its index.\n\nSo the list can be:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but the problem statement says the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the order is correct.\n\nSo the dictionary will be:\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nSo for 'C' it's 0, 'C#' is 1, etc., up to 'H' being 11.\n\nOnce the notes are read, we process each permutation.\n\nBut in the input, the notes are given as strings, like ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nSo in the code, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input line as a list of three strings.\n\n2. For each permutation of the three notes:\n\n   a. Get the indices for each note.\n\n   b. Compute d1 and d2.\n\n   c. Check if the permutation is major or minor.\n\nIf any permutation is major, output 'major' and stop processing.\n\nElse, if any permutation is minor, output 'minor' and stop.\n\nElse, output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(input_notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    ix, iy, iz = note_to_index[x], note_to_index[y], note_to_index[z]\n    d1 = (iy - ix) % 12\n    d2 = (iz - iy) % 12\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first case is C E G. So the permutation is (C, E, G). Let's see:\n\nC is 0, E is4, G is7.\n\nd1 =4-0=4 mod12=4.\n\nd2=7-4=3 mod12=3.\n\nSo yes, major.\n\nAnother sample: C# B F.\n\nInput is ['C#', 'B', 'F']\n\nWe need to check if any permutation gives d1=3 and d2=4.\n\nLike the permutation B, C#, F.\n\nB is 10, C# is1, F is5.\n\nd1 =1-10 =-9 mod12=3.\n\nd2=5-1=4.\n\nSo yes, minor.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about the order in the permutation?\n\nBecause, for each permutation, it's possible that any of the six possible orders could satisfy the condition.\n\nSo the code correctly checks all possibilities.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nWhat if the same note is present twice? Well, according to the problem statement, the input is three space-separated notes, but the problem doesn't specify whether they are unique. But in the sample inputs, they are unique.\n\nWait, the problem says \"three space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\" It doesn't say they are distinct. So perhaps the input could have duplicates. But the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, meaning that no two chords can be both major and minor, but perhaps having duplicated notes may cause issues.\n\nWait, for example, if two notes are the same and the third is such that the distances meet the condition.\n\nBut wait, in music theory, a triad must consist of three distinct notes. So perhaps in the problem, the input notes are all distinct. But the problem statement isn't clear on this.\n\nHmm, but the problem says \"unordered set of no less than three notes,\" implying that they can be the same, but for triads, I think the definition requires three distinct notes.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"Vasya studies music. He has learned lots of interesting stuff. For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\"\n\nIt's not specified whether the input can have duplicate notes. So perhaps the code should handle duplicates as well.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input has distinct notes. So perhaps the code can handle duplicates, but in practice, for a triad to be considered major or minor, it must consist of three distinct notes.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that the teacher gave Vasya a triad of exactly three notes. So perhaps the input will always have three distinct notes.\n\nBut to cover all bases, perhaps the code should process duplicates as part of the input, but in practice, for the problem's constraints, it's safe to assume that the input has three distinct notes.\n\nThus, the code is fine as written.\n\nAnother edge case: what if the permutation wraps around multiple times?\n\nLike, for example, X is H (11), Y is C (0), Z is E (4).\n\nSo permutation is H, C, E.\n\nd1 = (0-11) mod12=1.\n\nd2 = (4-0) mod12=4.\n\nSo d1=1, d2=4. Not matching.\n\nWait, but perhaps another permutation could have the right distances.\n\nWait, for example, X is H, Y is C, Z is D#: index 3.\n\nd1= (0-11) mod12=1.\n\nd2= (3-0) mod12=3.\n\nSo d1=1, d2=3. Not matching.\n\nSo perhaps it's better to think through all possibilities.\n\nBut the code handles all permutations, so it should catch any valid arrangement.\n\nAnother test case: what about a major triad where the order is E, G, C.\n\nE is4, G is7, C is0.\n\nd1 =7-4=3 mod12=3.\n\nd2=0-7= -7 mod12=5.\n\nSo no.\n\nWait, but perhaps the permutation is E, G, C.\n\nWait, E (4), G (7), C (0).\n\nd1=3, d2= (0-7) mod12=5. So no.\n\nBut the correct major triad is C, E, G.\n\nWhich the code should find.\n\nAnother test case: Minor triad. Let's take C, D#, G.\n\nWait, C is 0, D# is3, G is7.\n\nSo permutation C, D#, G: d1=3, d2=4. That's minor.\n\nSo the code should output 'minor' for this input.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Are the note names case-sensitive? The problem says the input is in the given notation, so probably lowercase, but the code treats them as case-sensitive. But the problem says the input is given in the specified notation, so assuming the input is correct.\n\nAnother thing: what if the input has more than three notes? The problem says the input is three, so the code is safe.\n\nNow, thinking about the code's efficiency. Since it's just 6 permutations and each involves simple calculations, it's efficient enough for any input.\n\nSo, the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The notes are cyclically ordered, and the distance between consecutive notes is measured in semitones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: A major triad is defined by two distances of 4 and 3 semitones in sequence, while a minor triad is defined by distances of 3 and 4 semitones in sequence. The notes are cyclic, meaning after H comes C again.\n2. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Create a mapping from each note to its corresponding index in a predefined order of notes.\n3. **Generate Permutations**: Since the order of notes matters for determining the triad type, generate all permutations of the three given notes.\n4. **Check Each Permutation**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes. If any permutation satisfies the major or minor condition, classify the triad accordingly.\n5. **Output Result**: Print \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" based on the checks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(input_notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    ix, iy, iz = note_to_index[x], note_to_index[y], note_to_index[z]\n    d1 = (iy - ix) % 12\n    d2 = (iz - iy) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The notes are mapped to their respective indices using a dictionary. This helps in quickly finding the position of each note in the cyclic order.\n2. **Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible orderings of the three notes to check each potential arrangement.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes. The distance is computed modulo 12 to handle the cyclic nature of the notes.\n4. **Triad Check**: For each permutation, check if the distances match the criteria for a major or minor triad. If a match is found, print the result and exit immediately.\n5. **Result Handling**: If no valid permutation is found, print \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the notes to accurately determine the type of triad or if it is neither.",
