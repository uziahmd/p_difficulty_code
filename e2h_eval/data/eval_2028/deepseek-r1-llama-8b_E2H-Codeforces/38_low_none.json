    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Node Pairs\" and involves directed graphs. Hmm.\n\nThe first part of the problem asks for the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph. Then, among all such graphs with that minimum number of nodes, we need to find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs. \n\nLet me try to understand what a p-reachable graph is. From the description, a directed graph is p-reachable if it has exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v, u and v are reachable from each other. Oh right, so these are the pairs where u can reach v and v can reach u. So each such pair contributes 1 to p.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the definition says that an ordered pair (u, v) is unidirectional if u != v, there's a path from u to v, and no path from v to u. So a p-reachable graph has exactly p such unidirectional pairs where u < v. So the p is the count of such (u, v) pairs in the graph.\n\nSo for example, if the graph is strongly connected, then for every pair u < v, both (u, v) and (v, u) would have paths, so there are zero unidirectional pairs. But in our case, p is given, and we need to construct a graph with exactly p such pairs.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimal number of nodes needed to achieve this, and then, for that minimal setup, maximize the number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to model the graph. To minimize the number of nodes, we want as few nodes as possible while having exactly p unidirectional pairs (u, v) where u < v.\n\nWait, but in a directed graph, the unidirectional pairs are those where only one direction exists between two nodes, but not both. So for any two distinct nodes u and v, either (u, v) is unidirectional or (v, u) is, or neither if they're in a cycle, or both if the graph is undirected in that particular edge.\n\nBut wait, in the definition, a unidirectional pair (u, v) requires that u != v, there's a path from u to v, and no path from v to u. So it's a directed edge in one direction only.\n\nSo for two nodes u and v, if u can reach v but v cannot reach u, then (u, v) is an unidirectional pair. If neither can reach the other, then neither is unidirectional. If both can reach each other, then (u, v) is not unidirectional. Or wait, if u can reach v and v can reach u, then (u, v) is not unidirectional because the condition requires that there are no paths from v to u.\n\nWait, no: the condition for (u, v) being unidirectional is that u can reach v (so path u->v exists) and v cannot reach u (no path v->u). So if both u and v can reach each other, then (u, v) is not unidirectional.\n\nSo the p is the count of such (u, v) pairs where u < v, and (u, v) is unidirectional.\n\nNow, the problem is to find a graph with exactly p such pairs, using as few nodes as possible, and then among all such minimal-node graphs, find the one with the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nI think the minimal node count can be determined by considering the structure of the graph. Let's see:\n\nFor a graph with n nodes, the maximum possible number of unidirectional pairs is when the graph is a DAG where edges are arranged such that for as many as possible, u can reach v but v cannot reach u. How?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n is related to triangular numbers. Because for each new node added, how much does p increase?\n\nWait, let's think about how adding a new node affects the number of unidirectional pairs. Maybe it's better to model it as a complete DAG where each node points to all the previous ones, but none point back. That way, each new node adds as many unidirectional pairs as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of nodes is roughly sqrt(2p), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the problem mathematically. Let's denote m as the number of unidirectional pairs. We need m = p.\n\nEach unidirectional pair (u, v) implies that u can reach v but v cannot reach u. So, in the graph, u must have a path to v,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a directed graph that is p-reachable and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such a graph.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: A p-reachable directed graph has exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v, u can reach v, and v cannot reach u. We need to find the minimum number of nodes required to form such a graph and maximize the number of unidirectional pairs among all such graphs.\n\n2. **Graph Structure Insight**: The minimal number of nodes required can be derived from the structure of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In a DAG, each node points to all subsequent nodes, maximizing the number of unidirectional pairs.\n\n3. **Mathematical Formulation**: For a graph with `k` nodes, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs forms a triangular number sequence. The minimum number of nodes required is determined by finding the smallest integer `n` such that the sum of the first `n-1` integers is at least `p`.\n\n4. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Once the minimum number of nodes is determined, we can compute the maximum number of unidirectional pairs using the formula for the sum of the first `n-1` integers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\np = int(input())\n\nif p == 0:\n    print(\"0 0\")\nelse:\n    n = 0\n    total = 0\n    while total < p:\n        n += 1\n        total += n - 1\n    max_uni = total // 2\n    print(f\"{n} {max_uni}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `p`, which represents the number of unidirectional pairs required.\n\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If `p` is 0, the output is directly \"0 0\" since no nodes are needed and no unidirectional pairs exist.\n\n3. **Finding Minimum Nodes**: Using a loop, we determine the smallest number of nodes `n` such that the sum of the first `n-1` integers is at least `p`. This sum is given by the formula `n*(n-1)/2`, ensuring we have enough unidirectional pairs.\n\n4. **Calculating Maximum Unidirectional Pairs**: The maximum number of unidirectional pairs in a graph with `n` nodes is half of the total possible pairs, which is `n*(n-1)/2 // 2`.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum number of nodes and the maximum number of unidirectional pairs, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of `p`.",
