And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Average Sleep Time.\" Hmm.\n\nThe task says that Polycarp has been keeping track of his sleep times for n days. But a week in Berland is k days long. So the doctor wants to find the average sleep time per week over all possible consecutive weeks. Oh right, like sliding windows of size k.\n\nSo the input gives me two integers, n and k, followed by a list of n integers representing each day's sleep time. My goal is to compute the average of these k-day windows.\n\nWait, how do I approach this? Well, let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to process all possible consecutive k-day windows in the array a. For each window, calculate the sum, then find the average of all those sums.\n\nLet me think about the example they gave. Like when n=3, k=2, and a = [3,4,7], the windows are [3,4] and [4,7]. Their sums are 7 and 11, so the average is (7+11)/2 = 9.0, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate through the array, taking each possible window of size k.\n2. For each window, compute the sum.\n3. Sum all these window sums and then divide by the number of windows (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\nBut wait, calculating each window's sum naively might be inefficient, especially since n can be up to 2e5. So if I do an O(nk) solution, that would be 2e10 operations, which is way too slow. Need a better approach.\n\nHmm, so the key is to compute the sums efficiently. How?\n\nI remember that using a sliding window technique can help here. The idea is to compute the sum of the first window, then for each subsequent window, subtract the element leaving the window and add the new element entering.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the steps would be:\n\n- Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n- Add this sum to a total_sum variable.\n- Then, for each i from k to n-1:\n   - Subtract a[i - k] from total_sum\n   - Add a[i] to total_sum\n   - Add the new sum to the total_sum variable (or wait, no: wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, each window is a separate sum. So perhaps we should have a running sum, and for each window, we add the new sum to the total.)\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. Each window is a consecutive k elements. The first window is a[0..k-1], sum is S1. The next is a[1..k], sum is S2. The third is a[2..k+1], sum S3, etc.\n\nSo the sum for the first window is added as S1. Then, for each step, we subtract the element leaving (i.e., a[i - k]) and add the new element (a[i]), then the current sum is S_i+1. We add this to the total.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\ntotal = 0\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[0:k])\ntotal += current_sum\n\nfor i in range(k, n):\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i - k] + a[i]\n    total += current_sum\n\nThen, average = total / (number of windows)\n\nWait, but the number of windows is (n - k + 1). Because the first window is at position 0, and the last is at position (n -k). So yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo this way, we only traverse the array once, making it O(n) time, which is efficient enough for n up to 2e5.\n\nGreat, so that's manageable.\n\nNow, about the data types. Since n can be up to 2e5 and each ai up to 1e5, the maximum sum for a window could be up to 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10. And multiplied by 2e5 windows, the total could be up to 4e15. So using integer variables might not be enough, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem.\n\nBut when dividing, we need to handle it as a floating point number.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the array as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n\nAdd to total.\n\nThen loop from k to n-1:\n\ncurrent_sum = current_sum - a[i -k] + a[i]\n\nAdd to total.\n\nFinally, compute average as total / (n -k +1).\n\nWait, but in the sample inputs, sometimes the average is an integer, like ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of size k days from a given list of sleep times for n days. The goal is to efficiently calculate this average using a sliding window technique.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: We use a sliding window approach to efficiently compute the sum of each consecutive k-day window. This allows us to compute the sum in O(n) time complexity, which is efficient for large values of n.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the first window of k days.\n3. **Iterate Through Windows**: For each subsequent window, update the current sum by subtracting the element that slides out of the window and adding the new element that slides into the window. Add each window's sum to a running total.\n4. **Compute Average**: After processing all windows, compute the average by dividing the total sum by the number of windows, which is (n - k + 1).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal = 0\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\ntotal += current_sum\n\nfor i in range(k, n):\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i - k] + a[i]\n    total += current_sum\n\naverage = total / (n - k + 1)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the integers n and k, followed by the list of sleep times.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first k elements is computed and added to the total sum.\n3. **Sliding Window Update**: For each subsequent day from index k to n-1, the current sum is updated by removing the element that is no longer in the window and adding the new element. This updated sum is then added to the total.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all windows is divided by the number of windows to get the average sleep time per week. The result is formatted to 10 decimal places for precision.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required average with optimal time complexity, making it suitable for large input sizes.",
