The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem is about radio towers in towns arranged along a coordinate line. The towns are numbered from 0 to n+1. We build a tower in each of the towns 1 to n with a probability of 1/2, independently. Then, for each tower built, we assign a signal power p (an integer between 1 and n). The signal from tower i covers all cities c where |c - i| < p. \n\nOur goal is to find the probability that after building the towers, there exists a way to set the signal powers such that:\n- Towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal.\n- Each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. So, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets of built towers (from towns 1 to n) that can form a valid configuration where the signals cover exactly the towns 1..n, and 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nWait, but how do the signal assignments work? Each tower in the subset can have any power as long as the coverage doesn't include 0 or n+1, and every town 1..n is covered exactly once.\n\nI think the key here is to model this as a partitioning problem. Each tower's coverage interval must not overlap in a certain way, and collectively they must cover all towns 1..n without overlapping beyond what's allowed.\n\nLet me think about what the coverage looks like. For a tower at position i with power p, it covers [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)]. But since the towns are on integers, the exact range is from max(1, i - (p-1)) to min(n, i + (p-1)), but wait, no, because the coverage is |c - i| < p, which means c can be from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1), inclusive? Or is it exclusive?\n\nWait, the condition is |c - i| < p. That means c can be as low as i - (p-1) + 1? Wait, no, let's clarify.\n\nFor example, if p=2, then |c - i| < 2 implies c is within i-1, i, i+1. So the range is from i-1 to i+1, inclusive. So the coverage includes three towns: i-1, i, i+1.\n\nSo for a tower at i with power p, it covers the interval [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)] inclusive, but only for those points that are in 1..n.\n\nBut wait, when p is 1, the coverage is just town i.\n\nSo, each tower's coverage is a contiguous interval of length 2*(p-1) +1, centered at i. So, the intervals don't have to be non-overlapping, but in our case, the intervals must cover the entire 1..n exactly once, and 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any.\n\nHmm, so the setup is that the union of all these intervals must be exactly 1..n, and each point in 1..n must be covered by exactly one interval.\n\nThis sounds like a tiling problem where each interval must fit without overlapping, except that each interval is determined by the positions of the towers and their assigned powers.\n\nWait, but the assignment of powers is part of the problem. So perhaps the structure must form a partition of 1..n into non-overlapping, contiguous intervals, each centered at some tower.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each interval is a consecutive set of towns, and each such interval is determined by exactly one tower located somewhere in it.\n\nWait, for example, if the towers are placed at positions 2 and 5, and their powers are 2 and 1 respectively, then:\n\n- Tower 2 with p=2 covers 1, 2, 3.\n- Tower 5 with p=1 covers 5.\n\nSo the total coverage is 1,2,3,5. But that's not covering all towns up to 5, so this wouldn't be a valid configuration.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the union is exactly 1..n, so in this case, if n=5, the coverage should include all 5 towns.\n\nSo, the intervals must form a partition of 1..n, and each interval is exactly the coverage of a single tower.\n\nWait, another example: n=5. Towers built at 2,4,5. Assign p=2 to 2, p=1 to 4 and 5.\n\n- 2 with p=2 covers 1,2,3.\n- 4 with p=1 covers 4.\n- 5 with p=1 covers 5",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in some towns, we can assign signal powers such that each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal, while towns 0 and n+1 receive none. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the problem can be modeled as tiling the towns into non-overlapping contiguous intervals, each centered at a tower with a specific power. Each interval must cover exactly one segment of towns, and these segments must collectively cover all towns from 1 to n without overlap.\n\nWe can use dynamic programming to count the number of valid configurations. Let `dp[i]` represent the number of ways to cover the first `i` towns. For each town `i`, if it is covered by a tower placed at `i` with power 1, then `dp[i] += dp[i-1]`. If it is covered by a tower placed at `i` with power greater than 1, we look back further to see how many ways we can cover up to `i`.\n\nThe probability is then calculated using the number of valid configurations divided by the total possible subsets of towers, which is `2^n`. The result is taken modulo `998244353`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\nn = int(input())\nif n == 0:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\n# dp[i] represents the number of ways to cover the first i towns\ndp = [0] * (n + 1)\ndp[0] = 1  # Base case: zero towns, one way\n\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    if i >= 1:\n        dp[i] += dp[i - 1]  # Tower at i with power 1\n    if i >= 2:\n        dp[i] += dp[i - 2]  # Tower at i with power at least 2\n    dp[i] %= MOD\n\n# The number of valid subsets is dp[n]\n# Total possible subsets is 2^n\ntotal = pow(2, n, MOD)\ninv_total = pow(total, MOD-2, MOD)\nresult = (dp[n] * inv_total) % MOD\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We use an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to cover the first `i` towns.\n2. **Base Case**: `dp[0]` is initialized to 1 because there's exactly one way to cover zero towns.\n3. **Iterate Through Towns**: For each town `i`, we consider two cases:\n   - Placing a tower at `i` with power 1, which covers only town `i`.\n   - Placing a tower at `i` with power greater than 1, which allows us to cover town `i` and some previous towns, contributing `dp[i-2]` ways.\n4. **Modulo Operations**: All operations are performed modulo `998244353` to handle large numbers and prevent overflow.\n5. **Probability Calculation**: The result is the number of valid configurations divided by `2^n`, computed using modular inverse for the division.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the valid configurations and computes the required probability using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic.",
