He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Prefixes and Suffixes.\" Hmm, Ivan has a string s of length n, and I don't know it. He tells me all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so from lengths 1 to n-1). But he doesn't say which are which—whether they're prefixes or suffixes. My task is to determine for each of the 2n-2 given strings whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the actual string s. Then output a string of 'P' and 'S' accordingly.\n\nWait, but how do I approach this? Because I don't know the actual string, but I have all possible prefixes and suffixes provided. So I need to find a way to assign P or S to each input string such that there exists at least one possible string s that fits all these assignments.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the structure of the problem. For each possible string s_candidate, I can check if all the given strings fit either as a prefix or suffix. But since n can be up to 100, the number of possible candidates is huge—way too big to check each one individually.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach. Let's think about the constraints that the given strings must satisfy when assigned as P or S.\n\nEach string of length k (from 1 to n-1) can be either a prefix, a suffix, or neither? Wait, no. Because the problem says that exactly two of each length are present in the input, and all are prefixes or suffixes of some s. So for each k, there are exactly two strings of length k, each being either a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nBut wait, no: the problem says that the 2n-2 strings are composed of exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1. So for each k, two strings of length k are given. These could be both prefixes, both suffixes, or one prefix and one suffix.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, all these strings are proper prefixes or suffixes of some s. So for each k, the two strings of length k are either both prefixes, both suffixes, or one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, in the first sample input, the two 'a's of length 1: one is a prefix, the other is a suffix. Because the actual string is 'ababa', which starts with 'a' and ends with 'a'. So for each k, the two strings of length k can be any combination of prefix and suffix.\n\nSo, my goal is to assign each string in the input to be either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S) such that there exists a string s where all the P's are prefixes of s and the S's are suffixes of s.\n\nThe challenge is to find such an assignment.\n\nHow can I model this? Well, perhaps I can model it by considering the possible transitions between prefixes and suffixes. For example, a prefix of length k must be a prefix of some suffix of length k+1, because the next character is added. Similarly, a suffix of length k must be a suffix of some prefix of length k+1.\n\nWait, maybe another way: the correct string s must be built by starting with a certain prefix, then adding characters, and ending with a certain suffix. So for each possible pair of a prefix p of length k and a suffix s of length k, perhaps the correct s is p concatenated with the reverse of the suffix? No, that might not work directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find for each string whether it could be a prefix or a suffix, and then see if there's a consistent way to build the string s that satisfies all these conditions.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the entire string s.\n\nSuppose s is of length n. Then:\n\n- All the P's are prefixes, i.e., their order in s is as follows: P_1 is the first character, P_2 is the first two, etc.\n- All the S's are suffixes, i.e., their order is S_{n-1}, S_{n-2}, ..., S_1, where S_1 is the last character.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, the suffixes are S_1, S_2, ..., S_{n-1}, which are the last 1, 2, ..., n-1 characters of s. So for the string 'ababa', the suffixes are 'a', 'ba', 'aba', 'ababa' for lengths 1-4, but wait no—wait, n is 5, so suffixes are lengths 1-4. So the suffixes are 'a', 'ba', 'aba', 'ababa'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the suffixes are the substrings starting from position 0 to the end. So for 'ababa' (indices 0-based), the suffixes of length 1 is 'a', length 2 is 'ba', length 3 is 'aba', length 4 is 'abab'? Wait no, wait 'ababa' is 5 letters. The suffixes are:\n\nlength 1: last 1 char: 'a'\n\nlength 2: last 2 chars: 'ba'\n\nlength 3: last 3 chars: 'aba'\n\nlength 4: last 4 chars: 'baba'\n\nAh right. So for each possible length k, the suffix is the last k characters.\n\nSimilarly, the prefixes are the first k characters.\n\nSo, for the correct assignment, each P_i is the first i characters of s, and each S_j is the last j characters of s.\n\nNow, the problem is to assign each of the input strings to either P or S such that:\n\n- For each k, exactly two strings of length k are in the input. They must be assigned to either P or S, but not necessarily both.\n\nWait, no. Because for each k, there are two strings of length k in the input. Each can be a P or S. But for the correct s, each k will have exactly one P and one S, except perhaps when k is such that the P and S are the same? Or is that possible?\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the 2n-2 strings are all prefixes and suffixes of some s. So for each k, the two strings of length k are both either prefixes or suffixes, or one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Because if both were prefixes, then for the same k, the s would have two different prefixes of length k, which is impossible. Similarly for suffixes. So for each k, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\nAh, right! Because the two strings of length k cannot both be prefixes of s, since s can only have one prefix of length k. Similarly, they can't both be suffixes. So for each k, exactly one string is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\nSo this is a key insight: for each k, among the two strings of length k, one must be assigned as P, the other as S.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: for each k, decide which of the two strings is P and which is S, such that the resulting assignment is consistent with the existence of a string s.\n\nSo how to find such an assignment.\n\nLet me think about the structure of s. Suppose for each k, the P_k is the first k characters, and S_k is the last k characters.\n\nWe can model this as follows:\n\nFor each k, P_k must be a prefix of S_{k} (since the last k characters of s start with the first k-1 characters of P_{k}, but perhaps I'm getting this wrong).\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately: the prefix P_{k} must be the first k characters of s, and the suffix S_{k} must be the last k characters of s.\n\nThus, for any k, the prefix P_{k} must be a substring that starts at position 0 of s, and the suffix S_{k} must end at position n-1.\n\nBut for k=1, P_1 is the first character, S_1 is the last. For k=2, P_2 is the first two, S_2 is the last two.\n\nWait, but how are P_k and S_k related? For example, S_{k} must be equal to the last k characters of s, which is also the same as the substring s[n-k : n].\n\nBut how does this relate to P_k? Well, perhaps for k>1, the last k-1 characters of P_k must match the first k-1 characters of S_k.\n\nBecause the prefix P_{k} is s[0:k], and the suffix S_{k} is s[n-k: n]. So the first k-1 characters of S_{k} are s[n-k+1 : n], which is the same as s[k-1 : n] (since n-k+1 = (n - (k-1)) ). Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, s is of length n. So for S_k, which is the last k characters, s[n-k : n]. So the first k-1 characters of S_k are s[n-k : n-k + (k-1)] = s[n-k + (k-1)] = s[n-1]. Wait, no, that's not right.\n\nWait, perhaps the first k-1 characters of S_k are s[n - k + 1 ... n -1]. Because S_k is s[n-k] s[n-k+1] ... s[n-1]. So the first k-1 characters are s[n-k], s[n-k+1], ..., s[n-2], s[n-1]. So the first k-1 characters of S_k are the same as the last k-1 characters of the prefix P_{k}.\n\nBecause P_k is s[0..k-1]. So the last k-1 characters of P_k are s[k-2], s[k-1]. And the first k-1 characters of S_k are s[n-k], s[n-k+1], ..., s[n-1 - (k-1 - 1)]? Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for the two strings P_k and S_k, the last k-1 characters of P_k must equal the first k-1 characters of S_k.\n\nBecause, in the full string s, the first k characters are P_k, and the last k characters are S_k. So the first k-1 characters of S_k are the same as the last k-1 characters of P_k.\n\nYes! Because the last k-1 characters of P_k (which is s[0..k-1]) are s[k-1 - (k-2)], ..., s[k-1] — wait, no. Wait, the last k-1 characters of P_k are s[k-2], s[k-1], since P_k is s[0..k-1].\n\nAnd the first k-1 characters of S_k are s[n - k + 1], s[n -k + 2], ..., s[n-1]. But s[n -k + 1] is s[k], because n -k +1 = k. Because n = len(s) = k + m, but perhaps that's not the case. Wait, no, n is fixed.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Let's say n=5, and k=3. So the P_3 is s[0..2], the S_3 is s[2..4] (since n -k =5-3=2). So the first 2 characters of S_3 are s[2], s[3], which are the last 2 characters of P_3 (s[1], s[2]?). Wait, no.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, S_k is s[n -k : n]. So for k=3, n=5, S_3 is s[2:5] → 'aba' (assuming s is 'ababa').\n\nThe first k-1=2 characters of S_3 are s[2] and s[3], which are 'a' and 'b'.\n\nThe last k-1=2 characters of P_3 are s[1] and s[2], which are 'b' and 'a'.\n\nWait, but in this example, the first two characters of S_3 are 'ab', and the last two of P_3 are 'ba'. So they are not equal.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier thought. So perhaps my initial idea is incorrect.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the example.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the string is 'ababa' (n=5). The prefixes are:\n\nLength 1: 'a' (P)\n\nLength 2: 'ab' (P)\n\nLength 3: 'aba' (P)\n\nLength 4: 'abab' (P)\n\nSuffixes:\n\nLength 1: 'a' (S)\n\nLength 2: 'ba' (S)\n\nLength 3: 'aba' (S)\n\nLength 4: 'baba' (S)\n\nSo for k=3, P_3 is 'aba', S_3 is 'aba'. So their first k-1=2 characters are 'ab' and 'ab' respectively. And the last 2 characters of P_3 are 'ba' and 'ab'—no, wait 'aba' is 3 characters, so the last two are 'ba'.\n\nWait, so for k=3, the last 2 characters of P_3 are 'ba', and the first 2 characters of S_3 are 'ab' (since S_3 is 'aba'). So they are not equal. So my earlier idea was wrong.\n\nSo that suggests that the last k-1 of P_k and first k-1 of S_k must be equal. But in this case, they aren't. So that idea is invalid.\n\nHmm, so maybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that for any k, the suffix S_k must be equal to the substring s[n -k : n]. And the prefix P_k must be equal to s[0 : k].\n\nBut how do the P and S for various k's relate to each other?\n\nAnother approach: For each possible k, the prefix P_k must be a prefix of the suffix S_{k+1}.\n\nBecause the suffix S_{k+1} is the last k+1 characters of s, which starts with the last k characters of s, which is S_k. So S_{k+1} starts with S_k.\n\nWait, yes. Because S_{k+1} is the last k+1 characters, which is the same as S_k followed by the (n -k)th character.\n\nWait, no, because S_{k+1} is s[n - (k+1) : n]. Which is the same as s[n -k -1 : n]. So the first k characters of S_{k+1} are s[n -k -1 : n -k], which is the same as S_k's last k-1 characters plus the next character.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet me denote that for each k, S_k is the last k characters of s. So S_{k} = s[n -k : n].\n\nAlso, for k > 1, S_{k} must start with S_{k-1}. Because the last k characters include the last (k-1) characters, which is S_{k-1}.\n\nWait, no. Because S_k is the last k characters of s, and S_{k-1} is the last k-1 characters of s. So S_k is S_{k-1} followed by the (n -k + 1)th character of s, which is the (k)th character of s (since s starts at 0). So S_k = S_{k-1} + s[k].\n\nSimilarly, for the prefixes: P_k is the first k characters of s, so P_k is P_{k-1} followed by s[k].\n\nSo for each k >=1, P_{k} starts with P_{k-1}, and S_{k} starts with S_{k-1}.\n\nThis gives us a recursive structure.\n\nSo for the given input, the correct assignment of P and S must satisfy:\n\nFor each k, the two strings of length k are P and S. Moreover, for each k>1, S_k must be equal to S_{k-1} + c, where c is some character. Similarly, P_k must be equal to P_{k-1} + d, where d is another character.\n\nWait, but how can we model this for our problem?\n\nLet me think about the process of building s step by step.\n\nWe can model the possible prefixes and suffixes as a graph, where each node represents the current state of the prefix and suffix.\n\nWait, but perhaps that's overcomplicating things.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible k, the two strings of length k must form a pair where one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. But how to choose which is which.\n\nWait, for each k, the two strings can't both be prefixes or both be suffixes, because s can only have one prefix and one suffix of each length.\n\nSo, for each k, the two strings are P and S, but which one is which?\n\nWe need to decide for each k whether the first string is P and the second is S, or vice versa.\n\nOnce we have this assignment, we can check whether it's possible to construct a string s that satisfies all the conditions.\n\nBut how to make this efficient.\n\nHmm.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the constraints that the assignment must satisfy.\n\nLet's consider the following:\n\nFor each k, the prefix P_k must be a prefix of S_k (the suffix of length k). Because S_k is the last k characters of s, which starts with the last k-1 characters of s. Wait, no, S_k is the last k characters of s. So the first k-1 characters of S_k are the same as the last k-1 characters of s. Which is equal to the last k-1 characters of the prefix P_k.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. But in the sample, for k=3, P_3 is 'aba' and S_3 is 'aba'. So the last 2 characters of P_3 are 'ba', and the first 2 of S_3 are 'ab'—they are not equal.\n\nSo that theory was wrong.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe another angle: For each possible pair of P and S for each k, we can see if the two can be arranged in a way that allows us to reconstruct s.\n\nWait, but that's vague.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as a directed graph where each node represents a possible state after processing a certain length, and edges represent possible transitions based on the given strings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each k, the two strings must form a chain where one is a possible extension of the other.\n\nWait, maybe for the correct assignment, for each k, the P_k is the first k characters, and the S_k is the last k characters.\n\nMoreover, for any k < n, the S_{k} must be a suffix of S_{k+1}, because S_{k+1} is longer.\n\nSimilarly, the P_{k} must be a prefix of P_{k+1}.\n\nSo, for each k, the S_k must be a suffix of S_{k+1}, and the P_k must be a prefix of P_{k+1}.\n\nWait, that makes sense because S_{k+1} is the last k+1 characters, which is S_k plus one more character. Similarly, P_{k+1} is P_k plus one more character.\n\nSo, for each k from 1 to n-1, the two strings for length k must be arranged such that one is a prefix of the other (for the P and S of k+1), and the other is a suffix of the other.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each k, the P_k is the first k characters of s. For k+1, P_{k+1} is the first k+1 characters of s, which is P_k followed by s[k].\n\nSimilarly, S_{k+1} is the last k+1 characters, which is S_k followed by s[n -k -1] (because S_{k} is the last k characters, and S_{k+1} adds the previous character).\n\nSo for each k, S_{k+1} must start with S_k, and P_{k+1} must start with P_k.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, for k=2, S_2 is 'ba' (last 2 characters), and S_3 is 'aba' (last 3 characters). So S_3 starts with S_2? Yes, 'aba' starts with 'ba'.\n\nSimilarly, P_2 is 'ab', P_3 is 'aba'—yes, it starts with 'ab'.\n\nSo the condition holds.\n\nSo, for the correct assignment, for each k, S_{k} must be a prefix of S_{k+1}, and P_{k} must be a prefix of P_{k+1}.\n\nWait, no. Because S_{k+1} is S_k followed by one more character. So S_{k} is a prefix of S_{k+1}.\n\nSimilarly, P_{k+1} is P_k followed by another character. So P_k is a prefix of P_{k+1}.\n\nSo, for each k, the two strings of length k must be such that one is a prefix of the other when considering the next length.\n\nSo, for each k, among the two strings of length k, one must be the prefix of the other for the next k+1.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nBecause for each k, the two strings are P and S. For the next k+1, the P_{k+1} is the first k+1 characters, which is P_k followed by a new character. The S_{k+1} is the last k+1 characters, which is S_k followed by a new character.\n\nSo, for the two strings of length k+1, one must be the P_{k+1} and the other must be the S_{k+1}, which must be compatible with the current P_k and S_k.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find, for each k, whether one of the two strings is a prefix of the other for k+1.\n\nWait, but for each k, the two strings are the ones for that length, and the next k+1 is determined by the possible extensions.\n\nThis seems complex.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the possible transitions for each k.\n\nFor each k, the two strings are A and B.\n\nWe can assume that A is the P_k and B is the S_k, or vice versa.\n\nThen, for k+1, the two strings are C and D. One of them must be the P_{k+1}, which must be a prefix of P_k followed by a new character. Similarly, the other must be the S_{k+1}, which must be a suffix of S_k followed by a new character.\n\nWait, but how do we model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each k, the two strings are either a prefix and a suffix, and for each possible assignment, we can see if the next k+1 can be built correctly.\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming approach, but with n up to 100, it's manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each k from 1 to n-1, collect the two strings of that length.\n\n2. For each k, try both possibilities: assign the first string as P_k and the second as S_k, and vice versa.\n\n3. For each possibility, check whether it's compatible with the next k+1.\n\n   For example, for the current assignment (P_k, S_k), the next P_{k+1} must be a string that is a prefix of P_k followed by a new character. Similarly, the next S_{k+1} must be a string that is a suffix of S_k followed by a new character.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, for each k, the next k+1's P must be a prefix of the current P_k plus a new character. Similarly, the next S must be a suffix of the current S_k plus a new character.\n\nWait, but for k+1, the two strings for that length must be either P and S. So perhaps, for each k, the two options for P and S must allow the next k+1's P and S to be formed by appending a character.\n\nBut this is getting a bit abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to proceed is to find, for each k, the two possible assignments (A as P, B as S; or B as P, A as S), and then for each, see if it can lead to a valid assignment for the next k+1.\n\nThis seems like a recursive approach, but given the small n (up to 100), it's manageable.\n\nWait, but n can be 100, so a recursive approach may not be feasible due to stack depth. So perhaps a dynamic programming approach, memoizing the possible states for each k.\n\nBut how to model the state.\n\nWait, the state can be represented by the current P_k and S_k assignments. But for each k, there are only two possibilities: which string is P and which is S.\n\nSo for each k, the state is which of the two strings is P_k and which is S_k.\n\nThen, for each k, we can model the possible transitions to k+1 based on these choices.\n\nThus, the DP state can be represented as a tuple indicating for each k, which string is P and which is S.\n\nBut even that may be too much for n=100.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each k, the choice is independent of the previous choices, except for the fact that the P_{k} must be a prefix of P_{k+1}, and S_k must be a suffix of S_{k+1}.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true because the P_{k+1} is built from P_k, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps for each k, the two options are:\n\nOption 1: A is P_k, B is S_k.\n\nThen, for k+1, the two strings C and D must be such that:\n\nEither:\n\nC is a prefix of A + some character, and D is a suffix of B + some character.\n\nOr:\n\nD is a prefix of A + some character, and C is a suffix of B + some character.\n\nWait, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each k, the next P_{k+1} must be a prefix of the current P_k, but that's not necessarily the case because P_{k+1} is built by adding a character to P_k.\n\nWait, no. P_{k+1} is the first k+1 characters of s, which is P_k followed by s[k].\n\nSo, P_{k+1} must be equal to P_k plus a single character.\n\nSimilarly, S_{k+1} is equal to S_k plus a single character.\n\nSo, for each k, the next P_{k+1} must be a string that starts with P_k, and the next S_{k+1} must end with S_k.\n\nThus, for the current k, the two options for P and S are:\n\nCase 1: P_k is A, S_k is B.\n\nThen, for k+1, the two strings C and D must be such that either:\n\n- C is equal to A + c (some character c), and D is equal to B + d (some character d).\n\nOR\n\n- D is equal to A + c, and C is equal to B + d.\n\nBut how to determine which is which.\n\nWait, perhaps for each k, the next P_{k+1} must be a prefix of one of the two strings of k+1, and the next S_{k+1} must be a suffix of one of them.\n\nWait, but it's getting complicated.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the possible assignments as a binary decision for each k, and for each decision, track the possible prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The correct assignment is such that for each k, the two strings of length k are P and S, and the next k+1's P and S are built by appending a character.\n\nSo, for each k, the next P is either the first string or the second, and the next S is the other.\n\nWait, perhaps for each k, the two strings must be compatible with the next k+1.\n\nSo, for each k, the two possible assignments (A as P, B as S; or B as P, A as S) must be checked against the next k+1.\n\nSo, for each k, we can try both possibilities, and see if they can be extended to k+1.\n\nIf so, proceed recursively.\n\nThis sounds like a backtracking approach, but for n=100, that's not feasible.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a graph, where each node is the current assignment for a particular k, and edges represent possible transitions to k+1.\n\nBut again, for n=100, this might be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved greedily.\n\nFor each k, the two strings must be the P and S for that k.\n\nOnce we have determined for k=1, which is the first character and the last character, perhaps we can build the rest.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, perhaps for k=1, the two strings are the first character (P_1) and the last character (S_1). So the correct assignment is that one is P and the other is S.\n\nOnce that is determined, for k=2, the two strings are P_2 and S_2. They must be such that P_2 is P_1 followed by a character, and S_2 is S_1 followed by a character.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because S_2 is the last two characters, which is S_1 plus the previous character. Similarly, P_2 is the first two characters, which is P_1 plus the next character.\n\nSo, perhaps for each k, the next P is P_k plus a character, and the next S is S_k plus a character.\n\nThus, for each k, the two possible options for P and S are:\n\nOption 1: P_k is A, S_k is B.\n\nThen, for k+1, the two strings are C and D. We need to check whether either:\n\n- C = A + c, and D is some string that starts with B + d.\n\nOR\n\n- D = A + c, and C is some string that starts with B + d.\n\nWait, no. Because P_{k+1} must be equal to P_k + a character, and S_{k+1} must be equal to S_k + a character.\n\nSo, for option 1, P_{k} is A, S_{k} is B.\n\nFor k+1, the two strings are C and D.\n\nWe need to assign:\n\nEither:\n\nP_{k+1} = C, S_{k+1} = D.\n\nWhich implies that:\n\nC must be equal to A + some character c.\n\nD must be equal to B + some character d.\n\nOR\n\nP_{k+1} = D, S_{k+1} = C.\n\nWhich implies:\n\nD = A + c.\n\nC = B + d.\n\nSo, for each option, we can check whether either of these possibilities holds.\n\nIf for a given k, one of the options leads to a valid transition, we proceed with that option.\n\nIf neither does, then the initial assignment is invalid.\n\nSo, the algorithm can be structured as follows:\n\nStart with k=1.\n\nFor each possible assignment of P_1 and S_1 (two options):\n\n   For each subsequent k from 2 to n-1:\n\n      Get the two strings for this k: C and D.\n\n      Check if either:\n\n         Option 1: C is P_{k} (A + c), D is S_{k} (B + d). That is, C starts with A, and D starts with B.\n\n         OR\n\n         Option 2: D is P_{k} (A + c), C is S_{k} (B + d). That is, D starts with A, and C starts with B.\n\n      If neither option is possible, backtrack and try the other assignment for k=1.\n\nProceed until k reaches n-1. If all steps are valid, output the assignment.\n\nThis approach can be implemented using recursion with memoization, but perhaps with memoization, it's manageable.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, group the input strings by their lengths.\n\nThen, for each k, collect the two strings.\n\nThen, for each k starting from 1, try both possible assignments (swap the two strings for P and S).\n\nFor each such assignment, check if the next k+1 can be formed.\n\nWait, but for k=1, the next is k=2, and so on.\n\nBut for n=100, this can be done via a recursive function.\n\nAlternatively, we can model it iteratively.\n\nLet me think about writing a function that tries all possible assignments and returns the first valid one.\n\nIn Python, perhaps a recursive approach with memoization would be manageable, but given the small n, a simple recursive approach might suffice.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read all the input strings and group them by their lengths.\n\n2. For each k from 1 to n-1, sort the two strings of length k.\n\n   Wait, but we don't know which is which. So, for each k, the two strings could be in any order.\n\n3. For each k, the two strings are either P and S, but we need to determine which is which.\n\n4. Try all possible assignments for each k, ensuring that the transitions are valid.\n\nSo, the code structure would involve trying all possibilities for each k and checking if a valid path exists.\n\nLet's think about the data structures.\n\nWe can create a list for each k, containing the two strings.\n\nSo, group the input into a dictionary where the key is k, and the value is a list of two strings.\n\nOnce that's done, we can proceed.\n\nNow, the core part is to assign P and S for each k.\n\nWe can represent the current state as the assignments for k up to the current step.\n\nAt each step k, we have two possible assignments (which string is P and which is S).\n\nFor each possible assignment, we can check if it's compatible with the next step k+1.\n\nSo, let's write a helper function that, given the current k, the current P and S, returns the next possible assignments.\n\nBut for code purposes, perhaps a recursive function is better.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible assignment, we can proceed step by step.\n\nSo, for k=1, we have two options:\n\nOption 1: P_1 = A, S_1 = B.\n\nOption 2: P_1 = B, S_1 = A.\n\nFor each option, we proceed to k=2.\n\nFor each option, check if the next strings can be assigned in a way that P_2 is P_1 + c, and S_2 is S_1 + d.\n\nSo, for each k, the current P and S are known.\n\nAt k+1, the two strings are C and D.\n\nWe need to see if either:\n\nC is a possible P_{k+1} (i.e., C starts with current P), and D is a possible S_{k+1} (D starts with current S).\n\nOR\n\nD is a possible P_{k+1} (starts with current P), and C is a possible S_{k+1} (starts with current S).\n\nIf either is true, proceed with that assignment.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe can represent the current P and S as variables.\n\nFor each step, we try both possible assignments (swap P and S) and see if the next step can be satisfied.\n\nIf yes, proceed recursively.\n\nIf not, backtrack.\n\nBut for n=100, this may take a while, but with the constraints, it's manageable.\n\nSo, let's outline the code.\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen, read 2n-2 lines, stripping any leading/trailing whitespace and newlines.\n\nGroup them by their lengths.\n\nSo, for each string s in input:\n\n   l = len(s)\n\n   add s to the group for l.\n\nThen, for each k from 1 to n-1, sort the two strings in the group. But perhaps it's better to keep them as a list without sorting.\n\nWait, but for each k, the two strings can be in any order. So, for each k, the two strings are just the two options for P and S.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nImplement a recursive function:\n\ndef backtrack(k, current_p, current_s):\n\n    if k == n-1:\n\n        return True, current_p, current_s\n\n    next_k = k+1\n\n    # get the two strings for next_k\n\n    next_strings = groups[next_k]\n\n    # for each possible assignment of P and S for next_k:\n\n    # try both possibilities\n\n    for p_candidate, s_candidate in [(next_strings[0], next_strings[1]), (next_strings[1], next_strings[0])]:\n\n        # check if p_candidate starts with current_p\n\n        if p_candidate.startswith(current_p) and s_candidate.startswith(current_s):\n\n            # proceed with this assignment\n\n            result = backtrack(next_k, p_candidate, s_candidate)\n\n            if result[0]:\n\n                return True, p_candidate, s_candidate\n\n        # else, check the other possibility\n\n        if p_candidate.startswith(current_p) and s_candidate.startswith(current_s):\n\n            # same as above\n\n            pass\n\n        # check if s_candidate is the new P, and p_candidate is the new S.\n\n        # So, s_candidate should start with current_p, and p_candidate should start with current_s.\n\n        if s_candidate.startswith(current_p)",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of a hypothetical string `s` of length `n`. The goal is to output a string where each character is either 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) based on the input strings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading and Grouping**: Read the input strings and group them by their lengths. This helps in efficiently accessing the strings of each length when needed.\n2. **Recursive Backtracking with Memoization**: Use a recursive approach to explore all possible assignments of the strings as prefixes or suffixes. For each possible assignment at length `k`, check if it can be extended to the next length `k+1` while maintaining consistency with the current assignment.\n3. **Transition Check**: For each step from `k` to `k+1`, ensure that the new prefix starts with the current prefix and the new suffix starts with the current suffix. This ensures that the string `s` can be consistently built.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    groups = defaultdict(list)\n    for _ in range(2 * n - 2):\n        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        l = len(s)\n        groups[l].append(s)\n    \n    # We'll try all possibilities using backtracking\n    def backtrack(k, current_p, current_s):\n        if k == n-1:\n            return True, current_p, current_s\n        next_k = k + 1\n        if next_k not in groups:\n            return False, None, None\n        candidates = groups[next_k]\n        for p, s in [(candidates[0], candidates[1]), (candidates[1], candidates[0])]:\n            if p.startswith(current_p) and s.startswith(current_s):\n                result, new_p, new_s = backtrack(next_k, p, s)\n                if result:\n                    return True, new_p, new_s\n            if s.startswith(current_p) and p.startswith(current_s):\n                result, new_p, new_s = backtrack(next_k, s, p)\n                if result:\n                    return True, new_p, new_s\n        return False, None, None\n    \n    # Try both possibilities for k=1\n    result, p_final, s_final = backtrack(1, None, None)\n    # Now, assign the labels\n    output = []\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        if p_final == groups[k][0]:\n            output.append('P')\n        else:\n            output.append('S')\n        if s_final == groups[k][1]:\n            output.append('S')\n        else:\n            output.append('P')\n    print(''.join(output))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading and Grouping**: The input strings are read and grouped into a dictionary where the key is the length of the string and the value is a list of two strings of that length.\n2. **Backtracking Function**: The `backtrack` function recursively explores all possible assignments of the strings as prefixes or suffixes.
