    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about finding the number of positive integers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeros. And then I have to output all those n's in increasing order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n, because there are usually more 2s than 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is sum of n divided by 5, plus n divided by 25, and so on until n divided by 5^k is zero.\n\nSo, for example, for n=5: 5/5 =1, 5/25=0. So total is 1. For n=6, same as 5, since 6/5 is 1, 6/25 is 0. So 1 trailing zero. But wait, 5! is 120, which has one zero, 6! is 720, also one. Oh right, but when does the count increase?\n\nLike, 24 is 4*5 + 4, so 24//5=4, 24//25=0, total 4 zeros. 25! would add another 5 (since 25 is divisible by 25 once), so 25//5=5, 25//25=1, total 6 zeros.\n\nSo the key is to find all n where the trailing zeros are exactly m. Now, how do we find the possible n's for a given m?\n\nI think the approach is to find the smallest n such that the trailing zeros are >=m, and then check if that's exactly m. Because for certain m, there might be a range of n's that give the same count.\n\nWait, but how? Let's think. Suppose m is 5. Let's compute the function f(n) which gives the number of trailing zeros.\n\nFor n=24: f(n)=4.\nn=25: f(n)=6. Wait, no. Wait, 25//5=5, 25//25=1, so total 6.\n\nWait, so from n=20 to 24: each has 4 trailing zeros. Then 25 jumps to 6. So for m=5, there's no n where f(n)=5. So the output would be 0.\n\nBut in the sample input, when m=1, the output is 5 followed by 5,6,7,8,9. So 5! has 1 zero, 6! also 1, etc., up to 9!.\n\nWait, let's calculate f(5): 5//5=1, others 0. So yes, 1. f(6)=1, same. So the numbers 5-9 all have f(n)=1. So for m=1, the count is 5, and the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo, the idea is that for some m, there's a range of n's where the trailing zeros are exactly m. We need to find all such n's and output them.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the lower bound of n where f(n) = m. Let's call this lower.\n\n2. Find the upper bound where f(n) = m. Call this upper.\n\n3. If lower > upper, then there are no solutions, output 0.\n\n4. Otherwise, the count is upper - lower +1, and the numbers are from lower to upper.\n\nSo the steps are to find lower and upper for a given m.\n\nBut how to compute these efficiently?\n\nWe can perform a binary search to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Once we find that, we can check if f(n) is exactly m. Similarly, we can find the largest n where f(n) <= m.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to find the minimal n where f(n) = m, and then find the next n where f(n) increases beyond m. Then, all numbers between min and max (but not including) will have f(n) = m.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to find the first n where f(n) >=m, and then check if f(n) is exactly m. Then, find the maximum n where f(n) <=m. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, let me think. For example, when m is 5:\n\nLooking for n where f(n) =5.\n\nWhat is f(20)? 20//5=4, 20//25=0. Sum is 4. f(21)=4, same. ... f(24)=4, f(25)=6.\n\nSo there's no n where f(n)=5. So the answer is 0.\n\nAnother example: m=6.\n\nf(25)=6. Then 26: 26//5=5, 26//25=1 → total 6. So 25,26,27,28,29,30. Because 30//5=6, 30//25=1 → 7. So wait, no: 30//5=6, 30//25=1 (since 25 divides into 30 once). So 6+1=7. So for m=6, the upper bound is 25.\n\nWait, no, wait: f(25) is 6, f(26) is 6, f(27) is 6, f(28) is 6, f(29) is 6, f(30) is 7.\n\nSo for m=6, the possible n's are 25 to 29 inclusive. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo the steps to find lower and upper:\n\nLower is the smallest n where f(n)=m.\n\nUpper is the largest n where f(n)=m.\n\nIf lower doesn't exist, output 0.\n\nOtherwise, the count is upper - lower +1.\n\nSo how to find lower and upper.\n\nApproach:\n\nCompute the function f(n) as the number of trailing zeros.\n\nWe can perform a binary search to find the first occurrence where f(n) >=m.\n\nOnce we find that, we can check if f(n) is equal to m. If it's larger, then there's no solution, because maybe m is not attainable.\n\nWait, no. Because sometimes m could be in between two values. Like, for m=5, the binary search would find that the minimal n where f(n)>=5 is 25, but f(25)=6>5, so there's no solution.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\nFor a given m:\n\n1. Use binary search to find the smallest n where f(n) >= m. Let's call this low.\n\n2. Check if f(low) == m. If not, then no solution. So return 0.\n\n3. Else, find the largest n where f(n) <=m. Let's call this high.\n\n4. So the numbers from low to high (inclusive) are the solutions.\n\nWait, but step 3 may not be necessary. Because after step 2, we know that f(low) =m. Now, find the maximum n where f(n) =m.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given m, the possible n's are all the numbers between the first occurrence of m and the last occurrence before the next jump.\n\nSo, after finding that f(low) =m, we can find the next n where f(n) >m, say next_n. Then, the upper is next_n -1.\n\nSo, for example, for m=6:\n\nlow is 25, f(25)=6.\n\nnext_n is 30, where f(30)=7.\n\nso upper is 29.\n\nThus, the numbers are 25-29 inclusive.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFind low via binary search for the first n where f(n)>=m.\n\nIf f(low)!=m → output 0.\n\nElse, find the smallest n where f(n)>m. Let's call this next_low.\n\nThen, upper = next_low -1.\n\nThe possible n's are from low to upper, inclusive.\n\nSo the count is upper - low +1.\n\nSo how to implement this.\n\nImplementing the binary search for low and next_low.\n\nWait, but how to find next_low.\n\nAlternatively, for next_low, we can start searching from low+1 upwards, but that could take time. Alternatively, perform another binary search for the first n where f(n) >m.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\n2. Binary search for the smallest n where f(n) >=m. Let's call this low.\n\n3. If f(low) != m → output 0.\n\n4. Else, binary search again to find the smallest n where f(n) >m. Let's call this high.\n\n5. The upper bound is high-1.\n\n6. So the numbers are from low to upper (high-1).\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute low via binary search.\n\nIf f(low) !=m → print 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   compute high via binary search for the first n where f(n) >m.\n\n   upper = high-1.\n\n   count = upper - low +1.\n\n   if count is 0 → print 0.\n\n   else → print count followed by the numbers.\n\nBut wait, what if m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1, so we don't have to handle m=0.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement the binary search correctly.\n\nLet me think about the binary search function.\n\nWe need to find the smallest n where f(n) >= target.\n\nThe initial range can be from 0 to some upper limit. What should be the upper limit?\n\nWell, the maximum possible n for a given m can be approximated. Since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero, and higher multiples contribute more.\n\nSo for m, the maximum n could be 5*m, but that's a rough estimate.\n\nAlternatively, since each step adds at least one zero, but sometimes more (like when n is a multiple of 25, etc.), perhaps a higher upper bound is needed.\n\nBut for binary search purposes, perhaps setting the upper bound to 5*m is sufficient. Or even 5*(m+1), to cover cases where m is just below a multiple.\n\nWait, for m=5, the upper bound would need to be at least 25, but 5*5=25, so that's correct.\n\nWait, let's see: for m=5, the binary search for the first n with f(n)>=5 would find 25, but f(25) is 6>5. So in that case, low is 25, but f(low) is 6≠5, so output is 0.\n\nSo perhaps the upper bound can be set to something like 5*(m+1), which should cover all possibilities.\n\nSo in the binary search, low starts at 0, high at 5*(m+1), and mid is (low + high) //2.\n\nWait, but in code, perhaps the binary search can be written as follows.\n\nFunction to compute f(n):\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's the standard method.\n\nSo now, the binary search function for finding the first n where f(n) >= m.\n\nSo let's write a helper function to find the minimal n where f(n) >= target.\n\ndef find_first_ge(target):\n    low =0\n    high = 5 * (target +1)\n    res = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        current = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if current >= target:\n            res = mid\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return res\n\nWait, but when current < target, we set low=mid+1. When current >= target, we try to find a smaller mid, so high=mid-1.\n\nAt the end, res is the minimal n where f(n) >= target.\n\nSimilarly, for finding the first n where f(n) > target.\n\nWait, no. To find the first n where f(n) > target.\n\nWait, in the case where m=6:\n\nWe have f(25)=6, f(30)=7.\n\nSo to find the first n where f(n) >6 is 30.\n\nSo the function would be similar, but looking for f(n) >m.\n\nSo another helper function.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can adjust the binary search condition.\n\nAlternatively, for the high variable, perhaps we can search for the first n where f(n) >m.\n\nSo, the helper function could be:\n\ndef find_first_gt(target):\n    low =0\n    high =5*(target +2) # some upper bound\n    res = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        current = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if current > target:\n            res = mid\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return res\n\nWait, let's test this for m=6.\n\nWe want to find the first n where f(n) >6.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nf(25)=6 → not >6.\n\nf(30)=7>6 → yes.\n\nSo the function should return 30.\n\nTesting the binary search:\n\nlow=0, high=5*(6+2)=40.\n\nmid starts at (0+40)//2=20.\n\nf(20)=4 <6 → set low=21.\n\nNext mid: (21+40)//2=30.\n\nf(30)=7>6 → set res=30, high=29.\n\nNow, low=21, high=29.\n\nmid=(21+29)//2=25.\n\nf(25)=6 → not >6 → set low=26.\n\nmid= (26+29)//2=27.\n\nf(27)=6 → low=28.\n\nmid= (28+29)//2=28.\n\nf(28)=6 → low=29.\n\nmid= (29+29)//2=29.\n\nf(29)=6 → low=30.\n\nNow, low>high, loop ends. res is 30.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the function seems to work.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nFirst, read m.\n\nCompute low = find_first_ge(m).\n\nIf low is -1 or f(low) !=m → output 0.\n\nElse, compute high = find_first_gt(m).\n\nupper = high-1.\n\ncount = upper - low +1.\n\nif count <=0 → output 0.\n\nelse → output count and the list from low to upper.\n\nWait, but how do I ensure that low exists?\n\nWait, the find_first_ge function returns -1 only if there is no n where f(n)>=m.\n\nBut for m>=1, is that possible?\n\nBecause for any m, there's an n where f(n) is m, but wait no. For example, m=5, as in the earlier example.\n\nSo, in that case, find_first_ge(5) would return 25, but f(25)=6>5. So the check after is to see if f(low) ==m.\n\nIf not, output 0.\n\nSo in code:\n\nread m.\n\nlow = find_first_ge(m)\n\nif low is None or f(low)!=m → output 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   high = find_first_gt(m)\n\n   upper = high -1\n\n   if upper < low → output 0.\n\n   else → count is upper -low +1.\n\nBut wait, in cases where m is 1, find_first_ge(1) would return 5, because f(5)=1.\n\nfind_first_gt(1) would return 10, since f(10)=2>1.\n\nSo upper is 9.\n\nSo the numbers are 5-9, which is correct.\n\nSo now, let's structure the code.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead m as integer.\n\nImplement count_trailing_zeros.\n\nImplement find_first_ge and find_first_gt.\n\nThen proceed as above.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: m=1 → output 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nCase 2: m=5 → no n exists, output 0.\n\nCase 3: m=6 → output 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nCase 4: m=0 → but according to the problem statement, m is ≥1.\n\nCase 5: m=2 → what's the range.\n\nf(10) = 2.\n\nf(11)=2.\n\nf(14)=2.\n\nf(15)=3.\n\nSo the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14.\n\nSo for m=2, the output is 5 numbers: 10,11,12,13,14.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nAnother test case: m=7.\n\nf(30) =7.\n\nf(35) = 7+7 (35//5=7, 35//25=1 → 8).\n\nSo the high is 35, which is the first n where f(n) >7.\n\nSo upper is 34.\n\nNumbers from 30 to 34: 30,31,32,33,34 → 5 numbers.\n\nSo, the code should correctly output 5 numbers.\n\nNow, coding in Python.\n\nBut wait, what about when m is very large, like 1e5.\n\nWe need to make sure that the binary search is efficient.\n\nBut since each step is O(log n), and n can be up to 5*(1e5 +1) → 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nRead m.\n\nDefine count_trailing_zeros(n):\n\n   count =0\n\n   while n>0:\n\n       n = n//5\n\n       count +=n\n\n   return count\n\nDefine find_first_ge(target):\n\n   low =0\n\n   high =5*(target +1)\n\n   res = -1\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid = (low + high) //2\n\n       cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n\n       if cnt >= target:\n\n           res = mid\n\n           high = mid -1\n\n       else:\n\n           low = mid +1\n\n   return res if res != -1 else None\n\nWait, but in code, how to represent 'res' as None if not found?\n\nAlternatively, in the function, return None if no n found.\n\nBut for our problem, for m≥1, find_first_ge(m) will always return a value, because f(n) increases as n increases.\n\nWait, is that true?\n\nBecause for any n, f(n) can be as large as needed.\n\nSo for any m, there exists an n where f(n) >= m.\n\nBut wait, for m=5, the function returns 25, which is where f(25)=6>5.\n\nSo the function returns 25, but in that case, f(25) is 6≠5. So the code after will check if f(low) ==m.\n\nSo for the code, the function will return a value, but after that, we have to check whether f(low) is m.\n\nSo the code can proceed.\n\nSimilarly, for find_first_gt, it's safe.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nm = int(input())\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count =0\n    while n>0:\n        n = n//5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_first_ge(target):\n    low =0\n    high =5*(target +1)\n    res = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt >= target:\n            res = mid\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return res\n\ndef find_first_gt(target):\n    low =0\n    high =5*(target +2) # arbitrary large enough upper bound\n    res = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt > target:\n            res = mid\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return res\n\nlow = find_first_ge(m)\nif low is None or count_trailing_zeros(low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    high = find_first_gt(m)\n    upper = high -1\n    if upper < low:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        count = upper - low +1\n        print(count)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(low, upper+1))))\n\nWait, but wait, in Python, if the list is empty, 'range(low, upper+1)' won't produce any elements. So in that case, the code would print 0 and an empty line. But according to the problem statement, the output is either the count followed by the numbers on the same line, separated by spaces, or 0.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: '1'\n\nSample Output 1: '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'\n\nWait, no, the sample input in the problem is written as ['1', '5'], but perhaps the actual input is a single integer.\n\nWait, the input is a single integer m, which can be up to 1e5.\n\nSo the code should read m as integer.\n\nWait, the code I wrote reads m as an integer.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first line is '1', which is the m value. Then the second line is '5' which is the output.\n\nWait, no, the sample input is probably:\n\nInput is a single integer m, perhaps provided as a string.\n\nWait, no, the problem says, \"The only line of input contains an integer m.\"\n\nSo the code should read a single line, parse it as an integer.\n\nBut in the sample input, it's written as ['1', '5'], which suggests that perhaps the code is taking multiple lines as input. Wait, perhaps that's a formatting issue in the problem description.\n\nNo, the problem says, the input is a single integer. So the code should read a single line.\n\nSo the code is correct in reading m as int(input()).\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample Input: m=1.\n\nfind_first_ge(1) returns 5.\n\ncount_trailing_zeros(5)=1 ==1 → proceed.\n\nfind_first_gt(1) → returns 10.\n\nupper=9.\n\nSo numbers 5,6,7,8,9 → count=5.\n\nOutput is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nfind_first_ge(5) returns 25.\n\ncount_trailing_zeros(25)=6 !=5 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nfind_first_ge(6) returns 25.\n\ncount is 6 → proceed.\n\nfind_first_gt(6) returns 30.\n\nupper=29.\n\ncount=5.\n\noutput is '5\\n25 26 27 28 29'.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nfind_first_ge(2) is 10.\n\ncount is 2 → proceed.\n\nfind_first_gt(2) is 15.\n\nupper=14.\n\nnumbers 10-14 → 5 numbers.\n\nSo output is '5\\n10 11 12 13 14'.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Time constraints. For m=1e5, the binary search runs in log(5e5) steps, which is acceptable.\n\n- Correctness.\n\nAnother thing to consider is when the upper is less than low. But that shouldn't happen because if low is found and f(low) =m, then find_first_gt must return a number greater than low, so upper= high-1 is >= low.\n\nWait, no. Suppose m is such that the next_high is low.\n\nBut that can't happen because for any n, f(n) can be increased by adding 1, but in reality, f(n) can jump by more than 1.\n\nBut in the binary search for high, the function will find the first n where f(n)>m.\n\nSo for example, if m=7, and the next n is 30, which has f(n)=7, but 31 has f(n)=7 as well.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nn=30: f(30)=7.\n\nn=31: 31//5=6, 31//25=1 → 7.\n\nn=35: 35//5=7, 35//25=1 → 8.\n\nSo f(31) is 7, f(35) is 8.\n\nSo find_first_gt(7) would be 35.\n\nSo upper is 34.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: m=3.\n\nf(14)=3, f(15)=3+3=6.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, f(14)=14//5=2, 14//25=0 → 2.\n\nWait, no, my mistake.\n\nWait, m=3.\n\nWait, let's compute f(n) for n=10: 2, 11:2, 12:2, 13:2, 14:2, 15:3.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, f(10) is 2.\n\nf(11)=2.\n\nf(12)=2.\n\nf(13)=2.\n\nf(14)=2.\n\nf(15)=3.\n\nSo find_first_ge(3) is 15.\n\ncount is 3.\n\nfind_first_gt(3) is 20, because f(20)=4>3.\n\nSo upper=19.\n\nNumbers from 15 to 19: 5 numbers.\n\nSo output is 5, followed by 15 16 17 18 19.\n\nSo the code will output that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in the code, after computing upper, the code checks if upper < low, but that shouldn't happen.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to include that condition.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute low.\n\nIf low is None or f(low)!=m → print 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   compute high = find_first_gt(m).\n\n   upper = high-1.\n\n   if upper < low → print 0.\n\n   else:\n\n      count = upper - low +1.\n\n      print(count)\n\n      print the numbers.\n\nBut for m=1, the high is 10.\n\nupper is 9.\n\nlow is 5.\n\n9 >=5 → okay.\n\nSo code proceeds.\n\nAnother case: m=0 is not allowed.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother thing: the function find_first_gt could have a higher upper bound, but 5*(target +2) is sufficient for any reasonable m.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nThus, the final code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list all such integers \\( n \\) in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{count} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently find the range of \\( n \\) values that produce exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros, we use binary search:\n   - **Lower Bound**: Find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\).\n   - **Upper Bound**: Find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeros exceeds \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Determine Valid Range**: Once we have the lower and upper bounds, the valid range of \\( n \\) values is from the lower bound to one less than the upper bound. If no such range exists, the result is 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nm = int(input())\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_first_ge(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (target + 1)\n    res = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt >= target:\n            res = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return res\n\ndef find_first_gt(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (target + 2)\n    res = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt > target:\n            res = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return res\n\nlow = find_first_ge(m)\nif low is None or count_trailing_zeros(low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    high = find_first_gt(m)\n    upper = high - 1\n    if upper < low:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        count = upper - low + 1\n        print(count)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(low, upper + 1))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input integer \\( m \\) is read.\n2. **Counting Trailing Zeros**: The helper function `count_trailing_zeros` calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\).\n3. **Finding Lower Bound**: The function `find_first_ge` uses binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) where the number of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\).\n4. **Finding Upper Bound**: The function `find_first_gt` finds the smallest \\( n \\) where the number of trailing zeros exceeds \\( m \\).\n5. **Determining Valid Range**: If the lower bound \\( n \\) has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros, compute the upper bound and list all valid \\( n \\) values. If no valid range exists, output 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of \\( m \\).",
