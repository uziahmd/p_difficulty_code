A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the task is to determine how many toasts each friend can make given certain constraints. Hmm.\n\nLet me read the problem again carefully.\n\nWe have n friends. They bought k bottles of soft drink, each with l milliliters. So total drink is k * l ml.\n\nThey also have c limes, each cut into d slices. So total lime slices are c * d.\n\nAnd they have p grams of salt.\n\nEach toast requires for each friend: nl ml of drink, a lime slice, and np grams of salt.\n\nWait, so per toast, all friends need these things. So for one toast, the group needs n * nl ml of drink, n slices (since each of n friends takes one), and n * np grams of salt.\n\nSo the total possible toasts is limited by how much each resource allows.\n\nSo first, let's calculate how much each resource can support.\n\nFor the drink: total_drink = k * l. Each toast uses n * nl. So max_toasts_from_drink = total_drink // (n * nl).\n\nFor the limes: total_limes = c * d. Each toast uses n slices. So max_toasts_from_limes = total_limes // n.\n\nFor the salt: total_salt = p. Each toast uses n * np. So max_toasts_from_salt = p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the actual number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum of these three values.\n\nSo the answer is min(max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_limes, max_toasts_salt).\n\nWait, but wait—no, because each friend can make as many toasts as possible, but all of them must make the same number. So the maximum number of toasts is the smallest among the three, because each toast consumes resources for all friends.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nCompute the drink limit: (k * l) / (n * nl). But since we can't do fractions, we take integer division.\n\nCompute the lime limit: (c * d) / n.\n\nCompute the salt limit: p / (n * np). Again, integer division.\n\nThe minimum of these three is the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about how to code this.\n\nWe'll read the input line as a list of integers. So in Python, something like:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute each of the three limits.\n\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime = (c * d) // n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink, lime, salt)\n\nThen, print result as a string.\n\nWait, but what if any of these divisions are zero? Like, if the required amount exceeds the available, then that resource is the limiting factor. So the min function will correctly pick zero in that case.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5 → drink=4*5=20ml. Each toast needs 3*3=9ml. So 20//9 is 2 (since 9*2=18 <=20, 9*3=27>20). So drink is 2.\n\nLimes: c=10, d=8 → 80 slices. Each toast uses 3. 80//3 is 26 (3*26=78, 3*27=81>80). So lime is 26.\n\nSalt: p=100. Each toast needs 3*1=3g. 100//3=33. So salt is 33.\n\nThe minimum is 2. So output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3.\n\nn=5.\n\nDrink: 100*10=1000ml. Each toast needs 5*4=20ml. 1000//20=50.\n\nLime: 1*19=19 slices. 19//5=3 (since 5*3=15 ≤19, 5*4=20>19).\n\nSalt: 90/(5*3)= 90/15=6.\n\nMinimum is 3. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\nn=10.\n\nDrink: 1000*1000=1e6 ml. Each toast needs 10*50=500ml. 1e6//500=2000.\n\nLime: 25*23=575 slices. 575//10=57.\n\nSalt: 1/(10*",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource for all friends to participate.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Determine the total amount of each resource available:\n   - Total drink in milliliters.\n   - Total lime slices.\n   - Total salt in grams.\n\n2. **Compute Resource Limits**:\n   - For drink: Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink. Compute how many toasts can be made with the total drink available.\n   - For lime slices: Each toast requires `n` slices. Compute how many toasts can be made with the total lime slices available.\n   - For salt: Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt. Compute how many toasts can be made with the total salt available.\n\n3. **Determine the Limiting Factor**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the smallest value among the three computed limits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Calculate the resources for each toast\ndrink_toast = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime_toast = (c * d) // n\nsalt_toast = p // (n * np)\n\n# Find the minimum toasts possible due to any resource constraint\nmax_toasts = min(drink_toast, lime_toast, salt_toast)\n\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Drink Calculation**: The total drink available is `k * l`. Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters, so the number of toasts possible from the drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n- **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total lime slices available are `c * d`. Each toast requires `n` slices, so the number of toasts possible from lime slices is `(c * d) // n`.\n- **Salt Calculation**: The total salt available is `p` grams. Each toast requires `n * np` grams, so the number of toasts possible from salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n- The result is the minimum of these three values, ensuring that no resource is overused and all friends can make the same number of toasts.",
