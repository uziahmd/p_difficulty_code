She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a girl named Luba who has multiple tabs open in her browser and needs to close some of them as quickly as possible. \n\nHmm, let me read the problem statement again to make sure I understand it correctly. Oh right, she has n tabs open, each indexed from 1 to n. The cursor is currently at position 'pos'. She needs to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. So, all other tabs outside this range must be closed.\n\nEach second, she can either move the cursor left or right (but within the current range of open tabs) or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to do this.\n\nWait, but when she moves, the available positions change because closing tabs can affect the current range. So for example, if she closes tabs on the left, then the left boundary 'a' increases, which affects where she can move next.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Maybe we need to consider two main steps: moving the cursor to the optimal position to close the left or right tabs, and then performing the close operations.\n\nBut since she can close either side first, perhaps we should calculate both possibilities and choose the one with the least time.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Calculate the time needed if she closes the left first.\n2. Calculate the time needed if she closes the right first.\n3. Take the minimum of these two times.\n\nBut wait, maybe sometimes it's better to close both sides, but in that case, she might have to move between the two sides. Hmm, but no, because after closing one side, the other side's closure might not require moving as much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal approach is to determine whether to close left or right first, depending on which requires less steps.\n\nLet me break down the steps.\n\nFirst, let's consider the initial state. The open tabs are 1..n. But she needs to have l..r open. So any tabs before l or after r must be closed.\n\nSo, what needs to be done:\n\n- If there are tabs to the left of l, they must be closed.\n- If there are tabs to the right of r, they must be closed.\n\nSo, the process involves:\n\n1. Move to the optimal position to close the left tabs.\n2. Close the left tabs.\n3. Move to the optimal position to close the right tabs.\n4. Close the right tabs.\n\nAlternatively, she could reverse steps 2 and 3, but the order might affect the total time.\n\nWait, but when she closes the left, the left boundary 'a' changes. Similarly for the right. So when she moves after closing one side, the available positions may have changed.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's best to model this as two separate cases: close left first, then close right; or close right first, then close left. For each case, compute the required steps and take the minimum.\n\nSo, let's consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: Close left first.\n\nSteps:\na. Move from pos to the optimal position to close left tabs.\nb. Close left tabs.\nc. Then, move to the optimal position to close right tabs.\nd. Close right tabs.\n\nCase 2: Close right first.\n\nSteps:\na. Move from pos to optimal position to close right.\nb. Close right.\nc. Move to optimal position to close left.\nd. Close left.\n\nWe'll compute the time for both cases and pick the smaller one.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a scenario where she doesn't need to close one side. Like if l=1, then she doesn't need to close left. Similarly, if r=n, no need to close right.\n\nSo, first, check whether left needs to be closed and right needs to be closed.\n\nLet me define:\n\nleft_needed = (l > 1)\nright_needed = (r < n)\n\nIf neither is needed, output 0.\n\nIf only left is needed, then she just needs to close left.\n\nIf only right is needed, same.\n\nNow, for each case where both are needed, proceed as above.\n\nSo, for each case, how do we compute the time?\n\nLet's formalize the steps for Case 1: Close left first.\n\nStep a: Move from pos to the optimal position to close the left. What's the optimal position here?\n\nThe left needs to be closed, which means she needs to get to a position i such that all tabs to the left are closed. So the optimal i is l. Because once she's at l, she can close all tabs to the left (from a to i-1, which would be from 1 to l-1). So moving to l is the target for the left closure.\n\nBut wait, initially, a is 1 and b is n. After closing the left",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves moving the cursor and closing tabs efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Need for Closing Tabs**: Determine if tabs need to be closed on the left (if l > 1) or on the right (if r < n).\n2. **Calculate Time for Closing Left First**: Compute the time required to move to the optimal position (l), close the left tabs, then move to the optimal position for the right tabs and close them.\n3. **Calculate Time for Closing Right First**: Similarly, compute the time required to move to the optimal position (r), close the right tabs, then move to the optimal position for the left tabs and close them.\n4. **Choose the Minimum Time**: Compare the times from both strategies and select the minimum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nleft_needed = l > 1\nright_needed = r < n\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Function to calculate the time when closing one side first\n    def calculate_time(close_left_first):\n        time = 0\n        # Move to the position to close left\n        start_pos = pos\n        end_pos = l\n        if start_pos != end_pos:\n            time += abs(end_pos - start_pos)\n        # Close left\n        time += 1\n        # Now, after closing left, the right part is from l to r\n        # So, we need to move to the right position to close right\n        # The current position is l\n        # The target is r\n        time += abs(l - r)\n        # Close right\n        time += 1\n        return time\n\n    # Similarly for closing right first\n    def calculate_time_right_first():\n        time = 0\n        # Move to r\n        start_pos = pos\n        end_pos = r\n        if start_pos != end_pos:\n            time += abs(end_pos - start_pos)\n        # Close right\n        time += 1\n        # Now, current position is r\n        # Need to move to l\n        time += abs(r - l)\n        # Close left\n        time += 1\n        return time\n\n    time_close_left = calculate_time(True) if left_needed else float('inf')\n    time_close_right = calculate_time_right_first() if right_needed else float('inf')\n\n    min_time = min(time_close_left, time_close_right)\n\n    print(min_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Identify Needs**: Check if tabs need to be closed on either side of the segment.\n- **Movement and Closure**: For each strategy (closing left first or right first), calculate the time by considering the movement steps and the closure step.\n- **Efficiency**: Ensure the solution efficiently computes the minimal time by comparing both strategies and selecting the optimal one.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider both possible strategies and efficiently determine the minimal time required for Luba to close the necessary tabs.",
