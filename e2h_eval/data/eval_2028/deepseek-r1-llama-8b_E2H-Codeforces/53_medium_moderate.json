    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The task is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The substrings can overlap, which is an important point.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. First, I need to understand what exactly a substring is here. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string. So for example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears starting at position 0 and position 2. They overlap because the second occurrence starts where the first ends.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum possible length of such a substring that occurs at least twice. So, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Generate all possible substrings of the input string.\n2. For each substring, check if it appears more than once (allowing overlaps).\n3. Find the longest such substring and return its length.\n\nWait, but generating all substrings might be time-consuming, especially if the string is long. But since the problem states that the string length doesn't exceed 100, it's manageable.\n\nLet me break it down further.\n\nFirst, I'll loop through all possible substring lengths, starting from the largest possible down to 1. For each length L, I'll check all possible substrings of that length. If any of them appears more than once, then L is the answer, and I can return it immediately.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because checking longer substrings first allows us to find the maximum possible length early, without having to check smaller ones.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n   - For each possible starting index i in 0 to len(s) - L:\n      - Extract substring s[i:i+L]\n      - Check if this substring appears again in s, possibly overlapping.\n      - If found, return L as the answer.\n- If no such L is found (which shouldn't happen as per the problem statement, but just in case), return 0.\n\nNow, how to efficiently check if a substring appears more than once?\n\nOne approach is to, for each substring, look for its occurrence in the string, allowing for overlaps.\n\nBut how to do that? For a given substring, we can scan the entire string and see if it appears again after its initial occurrence.\n\nFor example, for 'ababa' and L=3, the substring 'aba' starts at 0 and 2. So when i=0, the substring is 'aba'. Then, when i=2, the same substring is found again.\n\nSo the steps for each substring would be:\n\n- For each i, get the substring s[i:i+L].\n- Then, check if there exists another j >= i + 1 where s[j:j+L] == substring.\n\nWait, but j can be less than i + L, because overlapping is allowed.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, if L is 3, and i is 0, the next occurrence could be at j=2. That's allowed because 2 < 0+3.\n\nSo the way to check is: for a substring starting at i, does any other occurrence exist either before or after, regardless of the position, as long as it's a different starting index.\n\nWait, but the same substring can appear multiple times, not necessarily consecutive.\n\nSo perhaps, for a given substring, we can collect all starting indices where it occurs. If any two indices are present (could be same or different), but wait, same indices would mean same substring. Wait, no—each occurrence is a different starting index.\n\nWait, no, because each occurrence is a different starting index. So for each i, extract the substring, then check if any other j exists such that j != i, and s[j:j+L] equals the substring.\n\nWait, no, because for the same substring, multiple j's can have the same substring.\n\nSo for example, in 'zzz', the substring 'zz' occurs starting at 0 and 1. So for L=2, the function should return 2.\n\nSo, for each substring, I need to see if there exists at least one other occurrence, which can be anywhere else in the string.\n\nSo the algorithm for each substring is:\n\nCollect all positions where it occurs. If the count is >=2, then yes.\n\nSo for each substring, we can create a list of all starting indices where it occurs. If the length of this list is >=2, then it's a valid substring.\n\nSo now, the question is, for a given substring, how do I collect all starting indices where it appears in s.\n\nI can loop through the string, for each possible i, extract the substring s[i:i+L], and add i to a list if it matches. Once I have this list, if its length is >=2, then this L is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, this might be computationally expensive if done naively. For each L, and each i, checking all possible j's.\n\nAlternatively, for a given substring, I can collect all the occurrences.\n\nLet me think of code structure.\n\nIn Python, for a given L, I can create a dictionary where the keys are substrings and the values are lists of starting indices. Then, for each substring, if the list has more than one element, then L is acceptable.\n\nSo, for each L from len(s) down to 1:\n\n   create a dictionary.\n\n   for each i in 0 to len(s)-L:\n\n       substring = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substring in the dictionary:\n\n           add i to the list\n\n       else:\n\n           add substring with [i]\n\n   for each key in the dictionary:\n\n       if len(dictionary[key]) >=2:\n\n           return L\n\nIf after all L's, nothing is found, return 0.\n\nWait, but for each L, I process all substrings of that length. So for each L, I go through every possible starting index, extract the substring, and track their positions.\n\nOnce I've built the dictionary, I check if any substring has been seen more than once. If yes, then L is the answer.\n\nThat sounds efficient enough for the given constraints.\n\nBut wait, for L= len(s), the only possible substring is the entire string. It will be seen once, so no. So for L= len(s)-1, we have two possible substrings. So on.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nLoop L from len(s) down to 1:\n\n   seen = {}\n\n   for i in 0 to len(s)-L:\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr in seen:\n\n           seen[substr].append(i)\n\n       else:\n\n           seen[substr] = [i]\n\n   # Now check if any substr has multiple occurrences.\n\n   for key in seen:\n\n       if len(seen[key]) >=2:\n\n           print(L)\n\n           exit()\n\nIf none found after all L's, print 0.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: 'abcd'\n\nPossible L's: 4,3,2,1.\n\nFor L=4: only one substring 'abcd', so no.\n\nL=3: substrings are 'abc', 'bcd'. No duplicates.\n\nL=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' → no duplicates.\n\nL=1: all single letters. Each appears once, except maybe if the string has duplicates. But in 'abcd', all are unique. So no.\n\nSo output is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: 'ababa'\n\nCheck L=5: only one substring.\n\nL=4: substrings 'abab' and 'baba' → no duplicates.\n\nL=3: substrings 'aba' (positions 0 and 2), 'bab' (position 1), 'aba' (position 2). Wait, no, wait for i=0, substr is 'aba'; i=1: 'bab'; i=2: 'aba'; i=3: 'baa' (assuming length is 5, 5-3=2). So for substr 'aba', it's found at 0 and 2. So yes, L=3 is the answer.\n\nSo the code would return 3.\n\nThird example: 'zzz'\n\nCheck L=3: only 'zzz' once.\n\nL=2: for i=0, substr is 'zz'; i=1, substr is 'zz'. So 'zz' appears at 0 and 1. So L=2 is the answer.\n\nSo code returns 2.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaa'.\n\nWhat's the expected output? The longest substring that appears at least twice.\n\nSubstrings of length 3: 'aaa' (only once).\n\nLength 2: 'aa' appears at 0, 1, 2.\n\nSo yes, L=2 is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, the code for L=2 will find 'aa' appearing at 0,1,2. So the code returns 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abacaba'.\n\nLooking for the longest possible.\n\nThe substring 'aba' appears at 0, 2, 4.\n\nSo for L=3, the code would find that 'aba' is present at 0,2,4. So the code returns 3.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa'.\n\nLongest substring is 'aaaaa' (appears once). Then, 'aaaa' (appears at 0 and 1). So the code returns 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, thinking about edge cases.\n\nWhat if the string is length 1? Like 'a'. Then, it's impossible to have a substring that appears twice. So output is 0.\n\nAnother edge case: string length 2, 'aa'. Substring 'a' appears twice. So the maximum L is 1.\n\nWait, but according to the code, for L=2, the substring is 'aa' occurs once. So then L=1: the substrings are 'a' at 0 and 1. So the code returns 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nIn Python, read the input string. But wait, the input is given as a list? Or is it a single string?\n\nLooking back: the input is given as a string, but in the sample input, it's shown as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but probably that's a representation; perhaps the actual input is a single line.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" So, the input is a single string, not a list.\n\nSo in code, read using input().strip().\n\nBut the sample shows outputs as ['0', '3', '2'], but perhaps that's a formatting thing. The output should be a single number, so for each case, the code should print the integer.\n\nSo in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nmax_length = 0\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor l in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = {}\n\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            seen[substr].append(i)\n\n        else:\n\n            seen[substr] = [i]\n\n    for substr, indices in seen.items():\n\n        if len(indices) >= 2:\n\n            print(l)\n\n            exit()\n\nprint(0)\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 'abcd'\n\nWhen l=4, the substring is 'abcd' occurs once.\n\nl=3: 'abc' and 'bcd' → no.\n\nl=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' → no.\n\nl=1: each occurs once. So output 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' → l=3, substring 'aba' occurs at 0 and 2. So code returns 3.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz' → l=2, substrings 'zz' at 0 and 1. So code returns 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaa' → l=2, substr 'aa' occurs at 0,1,2 → code returns 2.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa' → l=4, substr 'aaaa' occurs at 0 and 1 → code returns 4.\n\nAnother test case: 'a' → returns 0.\n\nAnother test case: 'abab' → l=4: one occurrence. l=3: 'aba' and 'bab' → no. l=2: 'ab' occurs at 0, 'ba' at 1, 'ab' at 2. So substr 'ab' occurs at 0 and 2. So code returns 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
