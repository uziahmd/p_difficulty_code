The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, Xenia is in a city with houses arranged in a ring, right? She needs to do some tasks, and each task requires her to be at a specific house. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks.\n\nWait, the problem says that each task i must be done after all tasks j where j < i. Oh, right, because the list is given in order. So for each task ai, she must reach it after completing all previous ones.\n\nHmm, how do I model this? Well, let's think about the movement. The ring road is circular, so moving from house n to 1 takes one unit of time as well, since it's a ring.\n\nSo, Xenia starts at house 1. Then for each task, she has to go to the next required house. But wait, the tasks are given in order, so maybe she can process them sequentially.\n\nBut how do I calculate the minimal steps? Because sometimes going the other way around the ring could be faster, but since the traffic is one-way clockwise, she can't go back. Oh no, wait, the ring is one-way and clockwise. So she can only move in the clockwise direction, meaning she can't go back to the previous houses. So, any movement must be in the direction of increasing house numbers, but since it's a ring, 1 comes after n.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So the movement is only possible in the clockwise direction, which means the next house after n is 1. So, she can't move counter-clockwise.\n\nSo, for example, if she is at house 4 and needs to go to house 2, she can't go directly. She has to go 4 -> 1 -> 2, which is two steps.\n\nSo, the key here is that when moving from a current position to a target, the path is determined by the ring structure. So, for any two points a and b, the distance is (b - a) mod n, because you have to go through the next houses in clockwise order until you reach b.\n\nWait, but wait: the distance between a and b is (b - a) if b > a, else (n - a + b). Or more generally, it's (b - a) % n, but since n is up to 105, we can compute it directly.\n\nSo, now, the problem reduces to: starting from 1, she needs to visit a1, then a2, etc., each in order. For each step, she moves from the current position to the next required a_i, adding the minimal time required.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the tasks must be done in the order given. So, the first task is a1, second a2, etc. But she must process each task in order, which means that after processing a1, she must process a2, and so on.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because the list is a1, a2, ..., am. So, the first task is to be at a1, then the second task to be at a2, etc. So, the order is fixed, and each task must be completed before the next. So, the movement is a sequence: 1 → a1 → a2 → ... → am.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. So, perhaps the order is such that for task i, she must have already done all j < i. But the way the problem is phrased, the tasks are given in an arbitrary order. Oh wait, no, looking back, the second line contains m integers a1...am. So the i-th task is ai, and for each i, she must have done all j < i before.\n\nSo, the order of processing is in the order of the list. So, the first task is a1, the second a2, etc. So, the movement is 1 → a1 → a2 → ... → am.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because suppose a1 is 3, then a2 is 2. So, she can't just go from 3 to 2, because the ring is one-way. So, she would have to go from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. But that's longer than the other way.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the ring is one-way and also is clockwise. So, the direction is fixed; she can only move in the clockwise direction, meaning that the next house after 4 is 1, and so on.\n\nSo, in that case, to get from 3 to 2, she must go 3→4→1→",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks given that she can only move in a clockwise direction around a ring of houses. Each task must be completed in the order they are given, starting from house 1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to complete tasks in the given order. The ring is one-way and clockwise, so movement is restricted to increasing house numbers (with house n followed by house 1).\n2. **Movement Calculation**: For each task, calculate the shortest path from the current house to the next required house. Since movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction, the distance between two houses `a` and `b` can be computed as `(b - a) % n`.\n3. **Summing Distances**: Sum the distances for each consecutive pair of tasks to get the total time required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent = 1\ntime = 0\n\nfor ai in tasks:\n    if ai > current:\n        time += ai - current\n    else:\n        time += (n - current) + ai\n    current = ai\n\nprint(time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with time initialized to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the distance from the current house to the task's house. If the task's house is ahead (clockwise), simply add the difference. If it is behind, wrap around the ring and compute the distance accordingly.\n- **Update Current Position**: After each task, update the current position to the task's house.\n- **Output Total Time**: Print the accumulated time after all tasks are completed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time by leveraging the properties of the ring structure and ensuring movement is always in the correct direction.",
