Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about finding two vouchers that don't overlap, their durations add up exactly to x, and the total cost is as minimal as possible. If no such pair exists, we return -1.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step. So, each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost costi. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need to choose two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) such that:\n\n1. Their durations sum exactly to x.\n2. They don't intersect. That means either the first ends before the second starts or the second ends before the first starts. So, for vouchers i and j, either ri < lj or rj < li.\n\nAnd among all possible pairs that satisfy these conditions, find the one with the smallest total cost. If none exist, output -1.\n\nThe input gives n vouchers, each described by li, ri, costi.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to process each voucher and extract its duration. For each voucher, calculate d = ri - li + 1. Then, for each voucher, I can look for another voucher whose duration is x - d. Because the sum of the two durations must be exactly x.\n\nWait, right. So for each voucher i with duration di, we need to find a voucher j with duration dj = x - di. And vouchers i and j must not overlap.\n\nBut since the order matters (i and j can be in any order), but the condition is symmetric, maybe I can precompute for each voucher, the possible candidates that could form a valid pair.\n\nSo here's an idea: for each voucher i, compute its duration di. Then, compute the required dj = x - di. Then, for each voucher j where dj equals x - di, check if i and j can be paired without overlapping. If yes, then consider the sum of their costs.\n\nBut wait, because for each i, I have to find a j such that dj = x - di, and also that i and j are non-overlapping.\n\nBut checking all possible pairs like this might be O(n^2), which for n=2e5 is way too slow. So that's not feasible.\n\nHmm, so we need a more efficient approach.\n\nAlternative approach: group vouchers by their duration. So, for each possible duration d, we have a list of vouchers with that duration.\n\nThen, for each voucher i of duration di, we look into the group of vouchers with duration x - di. For each such j in that group, check if they can be paired without overlapping.\n\nBut again, even if we group them, for each i, iterating through all j in the group could be O(n) per i, leading to O(n^2) time, which is not acceptable for n=2e5.\n\nSo we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps we can sort the vouchers based on their end times, and for each voucher, find the earliest possible voucher that comes after it, with the required duration and non-overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, for each voucher, find the best possible voucher that doesn't overlap and has the required duration.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem.\n\nEach voucher has a start and end time. So for two vouchers to not overlap, one must end before the other starts. So, for voucher A and B:\n\nif A ends before B starts: A's end <= B's start.\nOr vice versa, B ends before A starts.\n\nBut when considering pairing, the order matters. So when looking for j, we need to know whether j's end is before i's start or i's end is before j's start.\n\nWait, but for each pair (i,j), the condition is symmetric. So when processing i, we can look for j's that are non-overlapping and have the required duration.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother thought: for each possible duration d, pre-sort the vouchers of duration d in a way that makes it easy to query for vouchers that end before a certain time, or start after a certain time.\n\nFor example, for each d, have two sorted lists:\n\n- One sorted by end time.\n- Another sorted by start time.\n\nWait, perhaps for each duration d, we can create a list of all vouchers with duration d, sorted by their end time. Then, for a given voucher i of duration di, which requires a voucher j of duration dj = x - di, we can perform a binary search on the sorted list of j's to find vouchers that end before i's start.\n\nSimilarly, we can look for vouchers j where j's start is after i's end.\n\nWait, but vouchers can be used in both ways: either i comes first and j comes after, or j comes first and i comes after. So for each i, we need to check both possibilities.\n\nBut let's think about the case where i comes before j. So, j's end must be <= i's start. So, for j's in the required duration group, we can collect those whose end is <= i's start.\n\nSimilarly, for the case where j comes before i, i's end must be <= j's start. So, we can collect j's in the group whose start >= i's end.\n\nSo for each i, we can compute the target duration dj = x - di. Then, within the group of vouchers with duration dj, find all j's that either end <= li (so i comes after j) or start >= ri (so j comes after i).\n\nWait, no. Wait, for i comes before j: j's start must be > i's end. So, j's start >= i's end + 1.\n\nSimilarly, for j comes before i: i's start >= j's end + 1.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nIf i is before j, then j must start after i ends. So j's start >= i's end + 1.\n\nBecause if j starts on the same day or earlier than i's end, they would overlap.\n\nWait, suppose i ends on day 3, and j starts on day 4: that's okay. But if j starts on day 3, then the days are overlapping (i's last day is 3, j's first is 3). So, in that case, the vouchers would have overlapping days.\n\nWait, according to the problem statement, two vouchers don't intersect if at least one of the following is true:\n\n- ri < lj (i.e., i ends before j starts)\nOR\n- rj < li (j ends before i starts)\n\nSo, the condition is that either i ends before j starts or j ends before i starts.\n\nSo, for i and j, the condition is that i's end <= j's start - 1 or j's end <= i's start - 1.\n\nWait, no. Because if i ends on day 3, and j starts on day 4, then i's end is 3, j's start is 4: 3 < 4, so the condition holds. Similarly, if j ends on day 2, i starts on day 3: j's end is 2 < 3, condition holds.\n\nSo, the condition is simply that i's end <= j's start or j's end <= i's start.\n\nWait no, because the condition is \"either i ends before j starts OR j ends before i starts\". So it's sufficient that one of these is true.\n\nSo, for i and j, we can have:\n\nri < lj --> i ends before j starts\n\nOR\n\nrj < li --> j ends before i starts.\n\nSo, for each i, to find j's in the required duration group where either:\n\nCase 1: j's start >= i's end + 1 (so j starts after i ends)\n\nOR\n\nCase 2: j's end <= i's start - 1 (so j ends before i starts)\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase:\n\nIn Case 1: j's start >= i's end + 1 --> ri < lj.\n\nIn Case 2: j's end <= i's start - 1 --> rj < li.\n\nSo, for each i, when looking for j's in the required duration group, we can split the search into two parts:\n\na) j's end <= li - 1.\n\nOR\n\nb) j's start >= ri + 1.\n\nWait, because:\n\n- For a) j's end <= li - 1 implies rj < li, so j ends before i starts.\n\n- For b) j's start >= ri + 1 implies lj > ri, so j starts after i ends.\n\nSo, for each i, when looking for j's in the target duration group, we need to find all j's where either j ends before i starts or j starts after i ends.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers into a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of tuples (li, ri, costi) for that duration.\n\n2. For each voucher i:\n\n   a. Compute di = ri - li + 1.\n\n   b. Compute target duration dj = x - di.\n\n   c. If dj is not present in the dictionary, skip.\n\n   d. Else, for j's in the dj group:\n\n      i. Check if j's end <= i's start - 1, or j's start >= i's end + 1.\n\n      ii. For each such j, add the cost of i and j to the candidate sum.\n\n3. Keep track of the minimum sum found across all such pairs.\n\nBut the problem is that for each i, the number of j's could be large, making this approach O(n^2) in the worst case.\n\nSo, to optimize, we need a way to quickly find the j's in the dj group that satisfy either condition a or condition b.\n\nHow can we do this efficiently?\n\nIdea: For each duration group, pre-sort the vouchers in such a way that we can quickly query for j's that end before a certain time, or start after a certain time.\n\nSo, for each duration d, we can maintain two separate sorted lists:\n\n- Sorted by end time (rj): This allows us to quickly find all j's with rj <= a certain value.\n\n- Sorted by start time (lj): This allows us to quickly find all j's with lj >= a certain value.\n\nAdditionally, for each duration d, we can have the list of all j's, sorted by their end time and their start time.\n\nSo, for each i, when processing, we can:\n\n- For the target duration dj:\n\n   a. Use the end-sorted list to find all j's where rj <= li - 1. Since the list is sorted, we can perform a binary search to find the maximum j with rj <= li - 1, and then collect all j's up to that point.\n\n   b. Similarly, use the start-sorted list to find all j's where lj >= ri + 1. Again, binary search to find the first j with lj >= ri + 1, and collect all from that index onwards.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for part a, j's end must be <= li - 1. So in the sorted end list, all j's with rj <= li-1 are candidates.\n\nSimilarly, for part b, j's start must be >= ri + 1. So in the sorted start list, all j's with lj >= ri+1 are candidates.\n\nSo, for each duration d, we can pre-sort the vouchers in the group by their end times and by their start times.\n\nThis way, for each i and each target dj, we can quickly find the relevant j's.\n\nBut for each i, we have to process two separate searches within the dj group.\n\nSo, how to implement this?\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n and x.\n\n2. Read each voucher, compute its duration di = ri - li + 1.\n\n3. Group the vouchers by their duration into a dictionary, say 'duration_groups'. Each key is a duration, and the value is a tuple containing two lists:\n\n   a. end_times: list of tuples (rj, costj), sorted by rj.\n\n   b. start_times: list of tuples (lj, costj), sorted by lj.\n\n   Additionally, for each group, perhaps we should also keep the original list of vouchers, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, no. Because for each j in the group, we need to get the costj. So perhaps, for each group d, the end_times is a list of (rj, costj), sorted by rj. Similarly, the start_times is a list of (lj, costj), sorted by lj.\n\nSo when we perform the binary search, for each j that meets the criteria, we can get their cost and add it to the current i's cost.\n\nSo, during preprocessing:\n\nfor each voucher:\n    di = ri - li +1\n    append (ri, costi) to end_times of di's group\n    append (li, costi) to start_times of di's group\n\nthen, for each group, sort the end_times by ri and start_times by li.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher i:\n\ndi = ri - li +1\ndj = x - di\nif dj is not in duration_groups: continue\nelse:\n    for the group dj:\n        list_end = end_times of dj, sorted by ri\n        using binary search, find the largest ri_j <= li_i -1\n        all j's in end_times up to that index are candidates for case a\n        for each such j, sum costi + costj and track min\n\n        list_start = start_times of dj, sorted by li\n        using binary search, find the first li_j >= ri_i +1\n        all j's from that index onward are candidates for case b\n        for each such j, sum costi + costj and track min\n\nSo, for each i, we perform two binary searches on the groups of the required duration.\n\nEach binary search is O(log m), where m is the size of the group. Since n is up to 2e5, and for each i, we have two log operations, this should be manageable.\n\nWait, but for each j found in the binary search, we have to consider adding their cost. But for a group of size m, each binary search gives a range, but in the worst case, for each i, you may have to iterate through a lot of j's.\n\nWait no, no. Because the binary search returns the position where the condition is met, and we can include all j's up to that position for case a, and all j's from that position for case b.\n\nBut even then, in the worst case, for each i, you might have to process O(m) j's, which is again O(n^2).\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because if for each i, you have to loop through all j's in the group, it's still O(n^2) time, which is not feasible.\n\nSo we need a way to find the j with minimal cost quickly.\n\nAh! Right. Because we're trying to minimize the total cost, for each i, when considering j's that fit the duration and non-overlapping condition, we want the j with the smallest cost.\n\nSo, for each group d, perhaps we can also pre-sort the vouchers in the group by cost. Then, for each i, when we find the set of j's that meet the condition, we can pick the one with the smallest cost.\n\nWait, but for case a and case b, the j's are in different subsets. So for each i, we can find the minimal cost j in both subsets, and take the minimal between them.\n\nWait, no. Because for case a, j's end before i starts, and for case b, j's start after i ends. So for each i, we can find the minimal cost j in both cases, and then compare.\n\nBut how to find the minimal cost j in each case.\n\nWait, for case a, all j's with rj <= li -1. So, among these j's, which one has the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for case b, all j's with lj >= ri +1, which one has the minimal cost.\n\nSo, for each group d, we can pre-sort the vouchers in two ways:\n\n1. For end-sorted list: sorted by rj, but for each rj, keep track of the minimal cost up to that rj.\n\n   So, for the end_times list, we can create an array where each entry is (rj, min_cost_up_to_rj). The min_cost_up_to_rj is the minimal cost among all j's with rj <= current rj.\n\n2. Similarly, for the start_times list, sorted by lj, and for each lj, keep track of the minimal cost from that lj onward.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, for each group d, we can have a structure that allows us to quickly find the minimal cost j that satisfies either case a or case b.\n\nLet's think differently. For each group d, for the end-sorted list, we can precompute a prefix array that keeps the minimal cost up to each index. Similarly, for the start-sorted list, we can precompute a suffix array that keeps the minimal cost from each index onwards.\n\nSo, for the end-sorted list:\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(costs[0..i])\n\nSimilarly, for the start-sorted list:\n\nsuffix_min[i] = min(costs[i..end])\n\nThen, when for a given i, we find the position pos in the end-sorted list where rj <= li-1, the minimal cost j in case a is prefix_min[pos].\n\nSimilarly, when we find the position pos in the start-sorted list where lj >= ri+1, the minimal cost j in case b is suffix_min[pos].\n\nThis way, for each i, we can find the minimal cost j in O(1) time after the binary search.\n\nThis sounds promising.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each duration group d:\n\n- Sort the end_times list by rj in ascending order.\n\n- Compute a prefix_min array, where prefix_min[i] is the minimal cost from the first element up to the i-th element.\n\n- Sort the start_times list by lj in ascending order.\n\n- Compute a suffix_min array, where suffix_min[i] is the minimal cost from the i-th element to the end.\n\nThen, for each i:\n\nCompute di, dj = x - di.\n\nCheck if dj exists in the groups.\n\nFor the dj group:\n\nCase a: j's rj <= li-1.\n\nFind the maximum index pos in the end_times where rj <= li-1. All elements up to pos are candidates.\n\nIf pos >=0, the minimal cost j is prefix_min[pos]. So, total cost is i's cost + prefix_min[pos]. Track the minimal total cost.\n\nCase b: j's lj >= ri+1.\n\nFind the minimal index pos in the start_times where lj >= ri+1. All elements from pos to end are candidates.\n\nIf pos < len(start_times), the minimal cost j is suffix_min[pos]. So, total cost is i's cost + suffix_min[pos]. Track the minimal total cost.\n\nThus, for each i, we perform two binary searches on the end_times and start_times lists of the dj group, and then retrieve the minimal cost j in O(1) time.\n\nThis approach reduces the per-i processing to O(log m) time, where m is the size of the group dj.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\n1. Read all vouchers.\n\n2. Group them by their duration, and for each group, prepare the end_times (sorted by rj), start_times (sorted by lj), prefix_min, and suffix_min arrays.\n\n3. For each voucher i:\n\n   a. Compute di and dj.\n\n   b. If dj is not present in the groups, continue.\n\n   c. For the dj group:\n\n      i. In the end_times list, find the rightmost rj <= li -1. Use binary search. If pos >=0, get the minimal cost from prefix_min[pos].\n\n      ii. In the start_times list, find the leftmost lj >= ri +1. Use binary search. If pos < len(start_times), get the minimal cost from suffix_min[pos].\n\n      iii. Update the global minimal cost with the sums from i and j.\n\n4. After processing all vouchers, output the minimal cost, or -1 if no such pair exists.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this.\n\nImplementing the binary search correctly is crucial. Also, handling the prefix and suffix min arrays correctly.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the same voucher i can't be paired with itself. So, when i is being considered, j can't be i. However, in our grouping, each voucher is processed once, so when i is in group di, j can't be i unless dj == di. But in that case, for j to be i, the condition needs to be checked.\n\nWait, but j is in the group dj, which is x - di. So, if dj == di, then we can have j being i only if the duration is x - di = di → x = 2di. But even then, j must be i but satisfy the non-overlapping condition, which is impossible because i and j are the same voucher.\n\nSo, in our code, when we process i, and j is in the group dj, which may include i itself, but in that case, the j would be i only if di + dj = x, which is 2di =x. But in that case, when i is being processed, j can't be i because i and j must be different vouchers.\n\nWait, no. Because if di = x - di → x = 2di. So, when processing i, j's group is dj = x - di = di. So, in that group, j can be i. But then, when i is looking for j in the same group, j can be i, but we must ensure that i and j are different vouchers.\n\nBut since the problem states that i and j must be different, we need to make sure that when j is i, it's not considered.\n\nHmm, but how? Because in the group, the j's could include i itself.\n\nSo, perhaps in the code, when j is the same as i, we have to skip it.\n\nBut how can we detect that?\n\nWell, perhaps when we process j in the group, if j's li and ri are equal to i's li and ri, then we can skip adding it.\n\nBut that would require storing the vouchers in a way that allows us to check this.\n\nAlternatively, during the grouping phase, for each voucher, we can store a unique identifier or index, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to process all j's in the group and then, after computing the sum, check if j is the same as i. If yes, skip.\n\nBut that would require O(1) access to i's data, which is possible.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor each voucher i:\n\n   di = ri - li +1\n\n   dj = x - di\n\n   if dj not in groups: continue\n\n   group = groups[dj]\n\n   # process case a: j's rj <= li-1\n\n   end_list = group['end_list']\n\n   # perform binary search to find the rightmost rj <= li-1\n\n   low = 0\n\n   high = len(end_list) -1\n\n   pos = -1\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n       if end_list[mid][0] <= li -1:\n\n           pos = mid\n\n           low = mid +1\n\n       else:\n\n           high = mid -1\n\n   if pos != -1:\n\n       min_cost_a = group['prefix_min'][pos]\n\n       total_a = costi + min_cost_a\n\n       if total_a < current_min:\n\n           current_min = total_a\n\n   # process case b: j's lj >= ri +1\n\n   start_list = group['start_list']\n\n   low = 0\n\n   high = len(start_list) -1\n\n   pos = len(start_list) # default to beyond the end\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid = (low + high) //2\n\n       if start_list[mid][0] >= ri +1:\n\n           pos = mid\n\n           high = mid -1\n\n       else:\n\n           low = mid +1\n\n   if pos < len(start_list):\n\n       min_cost_b = group['suffix_min'][pos]\n\n       total_b = costi + min_cost_b\n\n       if total_b < current_min:\n\n           current_min = total_b\n\n   # Now, check if j is i in the group, but in that case, when j is i, it's invalid.\n\n   # How to do this?\n\n   # Well, in the group, for case a and b, j could be i.\n\n   # For case a: j's rj <= li-1. But i's rj is ri, which is >= li. So, if li-1 >= ri, then j can't be i.\n\n   # Because i's rj is ri, which is >= li. So li-1 could be less than ri, meaning j's rj is ri, which is > li-1.

So no solution.\n\nAnother case: when a voucher's duration is zero, but that's impossible as li <= ri, so duration is at least 1.\n\nWait, no. Because li can be equal to ri, but the voucher's duration is ri - li +1, which is positive.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling of the binary search correctly.\n\n- The binary search for the case when the condition is correctly handled.\n\nAnother issue: when a voucher's duration is x but the two vouchers are overlapping, which is correctly handled.\n\nWait, but in the code, for each voucher i, we are considering j's that are non-overlapping.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the vouchers are allowed to be in any order, but must not overlap.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the two vouchers must not overlap. So, for i and j to be non-overlapping, and the sum of durations is x.\n\nNow, the code seems to correctly handle this.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nWait, but in the code, the vouchers are stored as (li, ri, costi). So, perhaps, in the group_data for each voucher, we should process the vouchers, but for each voucher, when it is considered as a possible candidate for i and j.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the problem says, 'exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j)'.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the code selects the first and third vouchers, which have durations 3 and 2, but their sum is 5.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the code selects two vouchers that are not overlapping.\n\nWait, no, sorry. Wait, the sample input shows that the code correctly handles the problem.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, to write the Python code.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers, but in the sample input, the input is given as ['4 5\\n ...', etc. Or perhaps the input is read as lines, but the problem says that the input is read as standard.\n\nWait, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and x.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105).\n\nEach of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri, costi.\n\nSo, in code, reading the input.\n\nWait, but the sample input is presented as:\n\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\nWait, perhaps that's a typo, but the actual input would be four lines after the first.\n\nBut in any case, the code reads the input correctly.\n\nSo, now, writing the code.\n\nBut wait, the code needs to read the input as:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n lines",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers such that their total duration equals the given vacation duration and their combined cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently searching for valid pairs of vouchers using sorting and binary search techniques.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, group all vouchers by their duration. Each group will store vouchers sorted by their end time and start time, along with prefix and suffix minimum cost arrays.\n2. **Precompute Minimum Costs**: For each duration group, sort vouchers by their end times and compute a prefix array of minimum costs up to each index. Similarly, sort vouchers by their start times and compute a suffix array of minimum costs from each index onwards.\n3. **Binary Search for Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, determine the required duration of the second voucher to sum up to the total vacation duration. Use binary search on the precomputed groups to quickly find the minimum cost voucher that does not overlap and meets the duration requirement.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        ri = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        costi = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        duration = ri - li + 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, costi, duration))\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    groups = defaultdict(list)\n    for v in vouchers:\n        li, ri, costi, d = v\n        groups[d].append((ri, costi))\n        groups[d].append((li, costi))\n\n    group_data = {}\n    for d in groups:\n        end_list = groups[d]\n        end_list.sort()\n        prefix_min = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for r, c in end_list:\n            if c < min_so_far:\n                min_so_far = c\n            prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n\n        start_list = groups[d]\n        start_list.sort()\n        suffix_min = [float('inf')] * len(start_list)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(start_list)-1, -1, -1):\n            l, c = start_list[i]\n            if c < min_so_far:\n                min_so_far = c\n            suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n\n        group_data[d] = {\n            'end_list': end_list,\n            'start_list': start_list,\n            'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n            'suffix_min': suffix_min\n        }\n\n    min_total = float('inf')\n\n    for v in vouchers:\n        li, ri, costi, d = v\n        dj = x - d\n        if dj not in group_data:\n            continue\n\n        group = group_data[dj]\n        end_list = group['end_list']\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(end_list, (li-1, float('inf'))) - 1\n        if pos >= 0:\n            min_cost_a = group['prefix_min'][pos]\n            total_a = costi + min_cost_a\n            if total_a < min_total:\n                min_total = total_a\n\n        start_list = group['start_list']\n        target = ri + 1\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(start_list, (target, float('inf')))\n        if pos < len(start_list):\n            min_cost_b = group['suffix_min'][pos]\n            total_b = costi + min_cost_b\n            if total_b < min_total:\n                min_total = total_b\n\n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers, each characterized by its start day, end day, cost, and duration.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration, with each group storing sorted end times and start times along with prefix and suffix minimum cost arrays.\n3. **Binary Search for Non-overlapping Pairs**: For each voucher, the required duration of the second voucher is computed.
