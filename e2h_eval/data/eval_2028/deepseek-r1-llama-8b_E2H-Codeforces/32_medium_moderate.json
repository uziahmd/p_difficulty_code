    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Array Stabilization. Hmm.\n\nThe task is, given an array of integers, to remove exactly one element such that the instability of the remaining array is minimized. Instability is defined as the maximum element minus the minimum element in the array.\n\nSo, I need to find which single element to remove so that the resulting array has the smallest possible max - min. And then output that minimal instability.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this efficiently? Because if I just try removing each element one by one and calculate the instability each time, that would be O(n^2), which won't work for n up to 1e5.\n\nWait, right. So for a large n, we can't do anything with O(n) per operation. We need a way to compute the best possible removal quickly.\n\nLet me think about what happens when you remove an element. The new array's max and min could either stay the same, or change if the removed element was contributing to either.\n\nBut since we have to remove exactly one element, the minimal instability can't be less than the current instability unless the removed element was either the current max or the current min.\n\nWait, no. Because maybe by removing a middle element, the new max and min are closer together. For example, suppose the array has elements [1,3,4,7]. The current max is 7, min is 1, instability is 6. If I remove 7, the new array is [1,3,4], instability is 3 (4-1). That's better. So in that case, removing the max reduces the instability.\n\nSimilarly, if I have an array where all elements are the same except one, like [5,5,5,100]. The instability is 95. If I remove 100, the instability becomes 0. Or if I remove any of the 5s, the instability is still 95. So in that case, it's better to remove the max or min if they are contributing to the instability.\n\nSo the key idea is that the minimal instability after removal could be found by considering whether the current max or min is part of the array. Because removing them might reduce the max-min.\n\nBut wait, what if the array is already having multiple max or min elements? Like [3,3,3,1,1,1]. The instability is 2. If I remove one of the 3s, the array's max is 3, min is 1; instability remains 2. But if I remove a 1, then the new min is 1, max is 3, same result.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal choice is to remove either the global max or the global min, whichever gives a lower instability.\n\nBut wait, in some cases, perhaps removing a different element could lead to a better result. Let me think of another example.\n\nSuppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The current max is 7, min is 1, instability 6. If I remove 7, the new max is 6, min is 1, instability 5. If I remove 1, the new min is 2, max is 7, instability 5. So same result.\n\nWhat if the array is [10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9]. Current max is 10, min 1. Instability 9. Suppose I remove 10: new max is 9, min 1 → instability 8. If I remove 1: new max is 10, min 2 → instability 8. Alternatively, what if I remove 5? Then the array becomes [10,1,2,3,4,9]. Max is 10, min 1 → instability 9. So worse than before.\n\nSo in this case, removing either the current max or min gives a better result.\n\nAnother example: [5,5,5,5]. The instability is 0. Removing any element leaves the array with instability 0. So no problem there.\n\nWhat about [1,3,3,7]? The initial instability is 6 (7-1). If I remove 7, the new array is [1,3,3], instability 2. If I remove 1, the new array is [3,3,7], instability 4. So the best is to remove 7.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute the initial max and min of the array. The initial instability is max - min.\n\n- Then, consider two possibilities: removing the max element or removing the min element.\n\n- For each possibility, compute the new max and min of the array without that element.\n\n- The minimal instability is the minimum between the initial instability and the instability after removing max or min.\n\nWait, but what if the array has multiple occurrences of the max or min? For example, [5,5,5,5,10,10]. The initial max is 10, min 5. Removing one 10 would leave the max as 10, min 5. So the instability remains 5. But perhaps that's not better than other options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe removing one of the 5s: the new array's max is 10, min is 5 → same as before.\n\nSo in this case, removing a max or min doesn't help. So the minimal instability would remain 5.\n\nHmm, so the approach is to consider all possible candidates for removal, but that's O(n), which is too slow for 1e5.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the minimal instability can only come from removing the global max, global min, or possibly other elements that are in certain positions.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the best option was to remove the global max. In the second example, it's better to remove the global max or min.\n\nBut is there any scenario where removing an element that is neither the global max nor min could yield a better result?\n\nI'm trying to think of such a scenario. Let's say the array is [1,4,5,7]. Current max 7, min 1 → instability 6. If I remove 7, the array is [1,4,5], instability 4. If I remove 1, the array is [4,5,7], instability 3. So in this case, removing the min gives a better result.\n\nWait, but 4 is between 1 and 7. So the minimal instability is achieved by removing the min.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal instability comes from removing the global min.\n\nAnother test case: [2,3,5,7,9,10]. Current instability is 8. If I remove 10, the instability is 8 (since the new max is 9). If I remove 2, the new min is 3, max is 10 → 7. Which is better. So here, removing the min gives a better result.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the minimal instability can sometimes be achieved by removing either the global max or the global min.\n\nWait, but let's think of a case where the best option is to remove a non-max and non-min element.\n\nWait, maybe in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 100]. Current instability is 99. If I remove 100, the new instability is 3 (4-1=3). If I remove 1, the new min is 2, max is 100 → 98. So removing 100 is better.\n\nBut what if the array is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]. Removing any element will leave a max and min that's at least 20, but wait, no. Let's see:\n\nRemoving 50: new max is 40, min 10 → 30.\n\nRemoving 10: new min is 20, max 50 → 30.\n\nSo both give the same result.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal instability is 30, which is achieved by removing either max or min.\n\nSo perhaps, the minimal instability is always the minimum of the original instability, the instability after removing the global max, and the instability after removing the global min.\n\nWait, but is that always the case?\n\nWait, suppose the array is [5, 1, 5, 5]. The original instability is 4 (5-1). If I remove 5 (max), the array becomes [1,5,5], instability 4. If I remove 1 (min), the array becomes [5,5,5], instability 0. So that's better. So in this case, the minimal instability is achieved by removing the min.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCompute the initial instability.\n\nCompute the instability when removing the global max.\n\nCompute the instability when removing the global min.\n\nTake the minimum among these three possibilities.\n\nBut wait, what if the array has multiple max or min elements? Like [5,5,1,5,5].\n\nThe global max is 5, global min is 1.\n\nIf I remove one of the 5s, the array becomes [5,1,5,5] → max is 5, min is 1 → instability 4.\n\nIf I remove 1, the array becomes [5,5,5,5] → instability 0.\n\nSo in this case, it's better to remove the min.\n\nBut if I have an array where the global max occurs once and the global min occurs once, but removing the max gives a better result.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Find the global maximum and its count.\n\n2. Find the global minimum and its count.\n\n3. Compute the initial instability.\n\n4. Then, simulate removing the global max (if count > 1, then it's possible, else we can't remove it).\n\nWait, but if the global max occurs only once, then removing it will require checking the next max in the array.\n\nSimilarly for the global min.\n\nWait, but simulating the removal of the global max may not be straightforward because the new max could be the next highest value.\n\nSo perhaps, the approach is:\n\n- To compute the new max and min when the global max is removed, but only if it's present more than once.\n\nBut that's complicated. How can I compute the new max when the global max is removed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal instability after removal is the minimum between the initial instability, the maximum after removing the max element, and the maximum after removing the min element.\n\nWait, no, because the max and min are dependent on each other.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nThe idea is that the minimal possible instability can be obtained by either:\n\na) Removing the current max, leading to a new array where the new max is the second maximum, and the new min is the same as before.\n\nOR\n\nb) Removing the current min, leading to a new array where the new min is the second min, and the new max is the same as before.\n\nBut wait, that's not necessarily true because the second max could be higher than the second min, or something else.\n\nWait, no. When you remove the max, the new max is the previous second max. Similarly, when you remove the min, the new min is the previous second min.\n\nBut perhaps, for the purpose of calculating the instability after removal, the new max and min could be determined as follows:\n\nFor case a (removing the max):\n\n- The new max is the second_max.\n\n- The new min is the original min.\n\nSo the instability is (second_max - min).\n\nSimilarly, for case b (removing the min):\n\n- The new min is the second_min.\n\n- The new max is the original max.\n\nSo the instability is (max - second_min).\n\nBut wait, what if the array has multiple max or min? For example, if the array is [5,5,1,5,5], the max is 5, and there are multiple instances. So if you remove one 5, the new max is still 5, and the min is 1. So the instability remains 4.\n\nIn this case, removing the max (which is 5) would not change the max, since there are other 5s. So the new instability would be 5-1=4.\n\nBut if the array is [5,1], and you remove 5, the new array is [1], which has instability 0.\n\nWait, but in this case, the array must have at least two elements after removal. Oh right! Because n is >=2, and after removing one, n-1 is at least 1. Wait, no, because the input says n is >=2, so after removing one, the array is n-1 >=1.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that you have to remove exactly one element, so the resulting array is of size n-1. But for n=2, removing one element leaves one element, which has no max or min (but in reality, the array with one element has both max and min equal to that element. So for n=2, after removal, the array has size 1, which has instability 0.\n\nWait, but looking back at the examples provided:\n\nIn the second sample input, it's ['2\\n1 100000'], so the output is '0'. Because after removing either 1 or 100000, the array has one element, which has instability 0.\n\nSo, for n=2, the minimal instability is 0.\n\nSo, going back to our earlier approach.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Compute the global max and min, and their counts.\n\n2. Compute the initial instability.\n\n3. Compute the instability when the max is removed: this would involve finding the second max, and the min remains the same. So the new instability is (second_max - min).\n\nBut wait, only if the max is removed once. What if the max occurs multiple times?\n\nLike in [5,5,1,5,5], the max is 5. If I remove one 5, the array still has 5 as the max. So the new instability is 5-1=4.\n\nWhich is same as before.\n\nSo, in that case, the new instability is 4, which is same as the initial. So for such cases, it's not better.\n\nBut in the case where the max occurs only once, then removing it would make the new max the second_max.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nIf the count of max is 1:\n\n   new_max = second_max\n\nElse:\n\n   new_max remains the same.\n\nSimilarly for min.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate.\n\nWait, in the case where the max occurs multiple times, removing one occurrence doesn't change the max.\n\nSo, for the case where the max is the global max, and it appears multiple times, the new max is still the same.\n\nTherefore, when computing the instability after removing the max, we need to consider:\n\nif the max occurs more than once, then the new max is same as before.\n\nelse, the new max is the second_max.\n\nSimilarly, for the min.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute the initial instability.\n\nCompute the instability when the max is removed:\n\n   if count_max > 1:\n\n       new_max = max\n\n       new_min = min\n\n   else:\n\n       new_max = second_max\n\n       new_min = min\n\n   instability_after_removal_max = new_max - new_min\n\nSimilarly for the min:\n\n   if count_min > 1:\n\n       new_min = min\n\n       new_max = max\n\n   else:\n\n       new_min = second_min\n\n       new_max = max\n\n   instability_after_removal_min = new_max - new_min\n\nThen, the minimal instability is the minimum between initial, instability_after_removal_max, and instability_after_removal_min.\n\nWait, but wait. Are there any other possibilities besides removing the global max or min?\n\nBecause in some cases, maybe removing a different element could yield a better result.\n\nFor example, consider the array [1, 3, 4, 7]. The initial instability is 6. If I remove 7, the new max is 4, min 1 → 3. If I remove 1, the new min is 3, max 7 → 4. So the best is to remove 7.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 5, 7, 8, 10]. The initial instability is 9. Removing 10 gives 8-1=7. Removing 1 gives 10-5=5. So that's better.\n\nHmm, but according to our earlier logic, when we remove the max, which is 10, the new max is 8. So the instability is 8-1=7. When we remove the min, which is 1, the new min is 5, so instability is 10-5=5.\n\nSo the minimal is 5, which is achieved by removing the min.\n\nSo according to our approach, we would compute the initial instability (9), the max-removal (7), min-removal (5), and choose the minimal (5). So yes.\n\nSo the approach seems to cover that case.\n\nBut what about an array where the minimal is achieved by removing neither the max nor the min? Let's think.\n\nIs there any scenario where removing a middle element yields a better result than removing the max or min?\n\nFor example, let's say the array is [1, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Initial instability is 6. If I remove 7, the new max is 6, min 1 → 5. If I remove 1, new min is 4, max 7 → 3. If I remove 4, the array becomes [1,5,6,7], max 7, min 1 → 6. So worse than removing 1.\n\nSo in this case, the best option is to remove the min.\n\nAnother example: [2, 3, 5, 7, 9]. Initial instability is 7. If I remove 9: new instability is 7 (7-2=5?), wait, no. Wait, 7 is the max after removing 9? No, wait, the array becomes [2,3,5,7], max is 7, min is 2 → 5.\n\nIf I remove 2: array becomes [3,5,7,9], max 9, min 3 → 6.\n\nSo the best is to remove 9, giving 5.\n\nSo according to our approach, when we remove the max (9), the new max is 7, min is 2 → 5. When we remove the min (2), the new min is 3, max is 9 → 6. So the minimal is 5, which is correctly captured by the approach.\n\nSo it seems that the approach covers all necessary cases.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to:\n\n- Compute the initial instability.\n\n- Compute the instability when the max is removed (considering whether it's the only max).\n\n- Compute the instability when the min is removed (same logic).\n\n- Take the minimal of all these.\n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\n1. Read the array.\n\n2. Compute the initial max and min, initial_instability = max - min.\n\n3. Compute the second_max and second_min.\n\n   - second_max is the maximum of the array excluding the global max.\n\n   - But wait, how?\n\n   Hmm, but perhaps a better approach is to find all unique elements, sort them, and get the second max and min.\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the following steps:\n\nTo find the second_max:\n\n   Iterate through the array and find the maximum value that is less than or equal to the current max.\n\nSimilarly for the second_min.\n\nBut perhaps the more efficient way is to find the second_max as the maximum of the array after removing one occurrence of the max.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because if the max occurs multiple times, then even after removing one, the max remains.\n\nSo, perhaps, to compute the second_max, we can collect all elements except one occurrence of the max, and find the maximum in that.\n\nBut that's O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nSimilarly for the second_min.\n\nBut for n up to 1e5, this is manageable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute the initial max and min.\n\nCompute the second_max:\n\n   create a list of elements, but remove one occurrence of the max.\n\n   then, find the max of this list.\n\nSimilarly, compute second_min.\n\nBut wait, how do we handle cases where the max occurs multiple times? Because when we remove one, the others remain.\n\nSo, for example, in the array [5,5,5,5], the second_max is 5.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nTo compute the second_max, we can create a new list that excludes one occurrence of the max.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\ndef compute_second_max(arr):\n    if len(arr) == 0:\n        return None\n    if len(arr) == 1:\n        return None  # since after removing the max, nothing left\n    max_val = max(arr)\n    # create a copy, remove the first occurrence of max_val\n    temp = arr.copy()\n    temp.remove(max_val)\n    second_max = max(temp)\n    return second_max\n\nSimilarly for second_min.\n\nBut wait, in the case where the max occurs multiple times, temp will still have max_val, so the second_max will be same as max_val.\n\nYes, which is correct.\n\nBut for n=1e5, this function is O(n) which is acceptable.\n\nOnce we have second_max and second_min, then:\n\nCompute the instability when removing the max:\n\nif count_max > 1:\n\n   new_max = max_val\n\nelse:\n\n   new_max = second_max\n\nnew_min = min_val\n\ninstability_max_removed = new_max - new_min\n\nSimilarly, when removing the min:\n\nif count_min > 1:\n\n   new_min = min_val\n\nelse:\n\n   new_min = second_min\n\nnew_max = max_val\n\ninstability_min_removed = new_max - new_min\n\nThen, the minimal instability is the minimum of initial_instability, instability_max_removed, instability_min_removed.\n\nWait, but what about cases where removing a max that's not the global max?\n\nWait, no. Because the max is the global max, and we're considering the case where we remove it.\n\nBut perhaps, in some cases, the minimal instability is achieved by removing an element that is not the global max or min.\n\nBut according to the previous examples, that seems not to be the case.\n\nWait, but let's consider another example.\n\nArray: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Initial instability is 9.\n\nIf I remove 10: new instability is 8 (9-1=8).\n\nIf I remove 1: new instability is 9 (10-1=9, but wait, no. New min is 3, max is 10. So 10-3=7.\n\nWait, no. Wait, after removing 1, the min is 3, and the max is 10. So the instability is 7.\n\nBut according to our approach, when removing the min (1), the new min is the second min, which is 3, and new max is 10. So the instability is 7.\n\nWhich is better than removing the max.\n\nSo, the approach correctly captures that.\n\nHmm, so the approach seems to cover all necessary cases.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the array.\n\n2. Compute the initial max and min, and their counts.\n\n3. Compute second_max and second_min as described.\n\n4. Compute the instability when removing the max:\n\n   a) if count_max > 1: new_max is the same as max_val.\n\n      new_min remains min_val.\n\n   b) else: new_max is second_max, new_min is min_val.\n\n   c) instability_max = new_max - new_min.\n\n5. Compute the instability when removing the min:\n\n   a) if count_min > 1: new_min remains min_val.\n\n      new_max is same as max_val.\n\n   b) else: new_min is second_min, new_max is max_val.\n\n   c) instability_min = new_max - new_min.\n\n6. The minimal instability is the minimum of initial_instability, instability_max, instability_min.\n\nBut wait, in some cases, the array after removal could have a smaller range than both scenarios.\n\nFor example, what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 100, 101, 102]. The initial instability is 101.\n\nIf I remove 100, the new array is [1,2,3,4,101,102]. The max is 102, min is 1 → 101.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nIf I remove 1, the new array is [2,3,4,100,101,102]. Max is 102, min is 2 → 100.\n\nIf I remove 102, the new max is 101, min is 1 → 100.\n\nWait, so in this case, the best is to remove 1 or 102, giving instability 100.\n\nBut according to our approach, when removing the max (102), since count_max is 1, new_max is 101, min is 1 → instability 100.\n\nWhen removing the min (1), count_min is 1, new_min is 2, max is 102 → 100.\n\nSo both give 100, which is better than initial.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nBut let's think of a scenario where removing a non-max/min element is better.\n\nWait, for example: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]. The initial instability is 90.\n\nIf I remove 100: new max is 90, min is 10 → 80.\n\nIf I remove 10: new min is 20, max is 100 → 80.\n\nSo the approach captures that.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 4, 8]. Initial instability is 7.\n\nIf I remove 8: new instability is 4-1=3.\n\nIf I remove 1: new instability is 8-2=6.\n\nSo the minimal is 3.\n\nAccording to the approach:\n\ncount_max is 1.\n\nso when removing max, new_max is 4, min is 1 → 3.\n\nwhen removing min, new_min is 2, max is 8 → 6.\n\nSo the approach correctly chooses 3.\n\nSo, the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, in code.\n\nFirst, read n and the array.\n\nBut for n=2, after removing one element, the array has one element, which has instability 0.\n\nSo, for n=2, the minimal instability is 0.\n\nBut in code, when n=2, we can directly return 0.\n\nElse, proceed as above.\n\nWait, no. Because for n=2, the array after removal has one element, which has max and min equal to that element. So the instability is 0.\n\nSo, in code, we can handle n=2 as a special case, returning 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nIf n ==2:\n\n   print 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   Compute the initial max and min.\n\n   Compute count_max = number of times max appears.\n\n   Compute count_min = number of times min appears.\n\n   Compute second_max:\n\n      Make a copy of the array, remove one occurrence of max_val.\n\n      compute the max of this copy.\n\n   Compute second_min:\n\n      Make a copy of the array, remove one occurrence of min_val.\n\n      compute the min of this copy.\n\n   Compute instability_max_removed:\n\n      if count_max > 1:\n\n          new_max = max_val\n\n      else:\n\n          new_max = second_max\n\n      new_min = min_val\n\n      instability_max = new_max - new_min\n\n   Compute instability_min_removed:\n\n      if count_min >1:\n\n          new_min = min_val\n\n      else:\n\n          new_min = second_min\n\n      new_max = max_val\n\n      instability_min = new_max - new_min\n\n   compute the minimal between initial instability, instability_max, instability_min.\n\n   output the minimal.\n\nBut wait, in the case where after removing the max, the new array has all elements the same except one.\n\nWait, but the code handles it because it correctly computes the new_max and new_min.\n\nNow, what about when the array is sorted.\n\nIt's probably better to sort the array for easier computation of second_max and second_min.\n\nBut in code, it's more efficient to find the second_max and second_min using built-in functions.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    max_val = max(a)\n\n    min_val = min(a)\n\n    count_max = a.count(max_val)\n\n    count_min = a.count(min_val)\n\n    # Compute second_max\n\n    # Create a copy, remove one max_val\n\n    temp = a.copy()\n\n    temp.remove(max_val)\n\n    if not temp:  # impossible since n>=3 here\n\n        second_max = -1\n\n    else:\n\n        second_max = max(temp)\n\n    # Compute second_min\n\n    temp = a.copy()\n\n    temp.remove(min_val)\n\n    if not temp:\n\n        second_min = float('inf')\n\n    else:\n\n        second_min = min(temp)\n\n    # Compute initial instability\n\n    initial = max_val - min_val\n\n    # Compute instability when removing max\n\n    if count_max > 1:\n\n        inst_max = second_max - min_val\n\n        # Wait, no. Because when the max is removed once, but it's still present, the new max is same as before.\n\n        # Wait, no. Because the max_val is still present. So when we remove one occurrence, the max remains.\n\n        # So new_max is max_val.\n\n        # So the new instability is max_val - min_val.\n\n        # Wait, no. Because the max_val is still present, so the new max is same as before.\n\n        # So the new instability is same as initial.\n\n        # So, in this case, removing the max when count_max>1 does not change the max.\n\n        # So, the instability is same as initial.\n\n        # So, in code, inst_max is initial.\n\n        # That's incorrect. Because in the array [5,5,1,5,5], removing one 5 doesn't change the max.\n\n        # So, the new max is 5, min is 1 → instability 4.\n\n        # Initial instability is 4, so same as before.\n\n        # So, in that case, the best option is to remove the min, which gives 0.\n\n        # So, for count_max>1, the instability_max_removed is initial.\n\n        # So, no improvement.\n\n        # So, in code, when count_max>1, the instability_max_removed is same as initial.\n\n        # So, in that case, it's not better than initial.\n\n    else:\n\n        # new_max is second_max\n\n        # new_min is min_val\n\n        inst_max = second_max - min_val\n\n    # Compute instability when removing min\n\n    if count_min >1:\n\n        inst_min = max_val - second_min\n\n    else:\n\n        inst_min = max_val - second_min\n\n    # Wait, no.\n\n    # When count_min>1, the min remains same.\n\n    # So new_min is min_val.\n\n    # new_max is max_val.\n\n    # So instability is same as initial.\n\n    # So, when count_min>1, removing the min doesn't change the instability.\n\n    # So, for example, in array [5,5,5,1,5,5], count_min is 1.\n\n    # So, when we remove min, the new min is 5, max is 5 → instability 0.\n\n    # So, the code for inst_min needs to be:\n\n    if count_min > 1:\n\n        # removing min when count_min>1 doesn't change min.\n\n        inst_min = max_val - min_val\n\n    else:\n\n        inst_min = max_val - second_min\n\n    # Now, compute the minimal instability.\n\n    candidates = [initial, inst_max, inst_min]\n\n    minimal = min(candidates)\n\n    print(minimal)\n\nWait, no. That's not correct.\n\nWait, let's re-examine.\n\nIn the case where count_max >1:\n\nWhen you remove the max, the max remains as before, because there are other occurrences.\n\nSo, new_max is max_val.\n\nnew_min is min_val.\n\nSo, the instability is max_val - min_val, same as initial.\n\nSo, in this case, removing the max doesn't help.\n\nSimilarly, when count_min >1:\n\nremoving the min doesn't change the min, so the instability remains same as initial.\n\nSo, for cases where count_max>1, the instability_max is initial.\n\nSimilarly for count_min>1, the instability_min is initial.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCompute instability_max and instability_min as follows:\n\nif count_max > 1:\n\n   instability_max = initial\n\nelse:\n\n   instability_max = second_max - min_val\n\nSimilarly for min:\n\nif count_min >1:\n\n   instability_min = initial\n\nelse:\n\n   instability_min = max_val - second_min\n\nSo, in code:\n\n# Compute instability_max:\n\nif count_max > 1:\n\n    inst_max = initial\n\nelse:\n\n    inst_max = second_max - min_val\n\n# Compute instability_min:\n\nif count_min > 1:\n\n    inst_min = initial\n\nelse:\n\n    inst_min = max_val - second_min\n\nThen, the minimal instability is min(initial, inst_max, inst_min).\n\nSo, the code should be adjusted accordingly.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nWait, but let's see.\n\nIn the case where count_max >1:\n\nremoving the max doesn't change the max, so the new max is same as before, new min is same as before.\n\nSo, the new instability is same as initial.\n\nSimilarly, for count_min>1, removing the min doesn't change the min.\n\nSo, in code, for the cases where the max or min occurs more than once, the instability after their removal is same as initial.\n\nOnly when the max or min occurs exactly once, their removal leads to a new instability.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif count_max >1:\n\n    inst_max = initial\n\nelse:\n\n    inst_max = second_max - min_val\n\nif count_min >1:\n\n    inst_min = initial\n\nelse:\n\n    inst_min = max_val - second_min\n\ncandidates = [initial, inst_max, inst_min]\n\nminimal = min(candidates)\n\nprint(minimal)\n\nYes.\n\nSo, that's the code.\n\nTesting it with the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput: 4 1 3 3 7\n\nInitial max 7, min 1, count_max 1, count_min 1.\n\nsecond_max: after removing 7, the array is [1,3,3], max is 3.\n\nsecond_min: after removing 1, the array is [3,3,7], min is 3.\n\nSo, inst_max = 3 - 1 = 2.\n\ninst_min =7 -3=4.\n\ncandidates are initial 6, 2,4.\n\nminimum is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=2, array 1 and 100000.\n\nAfter removing one, the array has one element, so instability is 0.\n\nThird example:\n\narray [5,5,1,5,5].\n\ninitial max 5, count_max 4.\n\nsecond_max is 5 (since after removing one 5, array still has 5s).\n\nSo, inst_max = initial (5-1=4).\n\ncount_min is 1.\n\nso, inst_min is max (5) - second_min.\n\nsecond_min is 5 (after removing 1, the array is [5,5,5,5], min is 5.\n\nso inst_min is 5-5=0.\n\nSo, candidates are 4,4,0 → min is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [1, 2, 3, 4, 100].\n\ncount_max=1, count_min=1.\n\nsecond_max is 4.\n\nsecond_min is 2.\n\nso:\n\ninst_max =4 -1=3.\n\ninst_min=100-2=98.\n\ninitial is 99.\n\nso, the minimal is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [5,5,5,5].\n\ncount_max=4, count_min=4.\n\nso, inst_max = initial (0), inst_min=initial (0).\n\ncandidates are 0,0,0 → 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nWe'll need to import sys.\n\nHandle n=2.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute max_val, min_val, count_max, count_min.\n\ncompute second_max and second_min.\n\ncompute inst_max and inst_min.\n\nthen compute the minimal.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the .copy() method for lists is shallow. So, for large arrays, this is acceptable.\n\nBut for n=1e5, creating a new list each time could be memory-intensive. However, in practice, it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps, for efficiency, we can optimize.\n\nAlternative approach for computing second_max:\n\nFind the maximum of the array after removing the first occurrence of the max.\n\nBut in code:\n\nmax_val = max(a)\n\ntemp = a.copy()\n\ntemp.remove(max_val)\n\nsecond_max = max(temp)\n\nBut for n=1e5, this is O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nSame for min.\n\nSo, the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability of an array is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Read the input values and handle the special case where the array has only two elements, which results in an instability of 0 after removing one element.\n2. **Compute Initial Values**: Calculate the initial maximum and minimum values of the array and their counts.\n3. **Second Max and Min**: Compute the second highest (second_max) and second lowest (second_min) values by creating a copy of the array, removing one occurrence of the maximum or minimum value, and then finding the new maximum or minimum respectively.\n4. **Instability Calculation**: Calculate the instability when removing the global maximum and minimum, considering if they occur multiple times. If the global max or min occurs more than once, removing one occurrence doesn't change the instability.\n5. **Determine Minimum Instability**: Compare the initial instability with the instabilities obtained after removing the maximum and minimum values to find the minimum possible instability.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    max_val = max(a)\n    min_val = min(a)\n    count_max = a.count(max_val)\n    count_min = a.count(min_val)\n    \n    # Compute second_max\n    temp = a.copy()\n    temp.remove(max_val)\n    if not temp:\n        second_max = -1\n    else:\n        second_max = max(temp)\n    \n    # Compute second_min\n    temp = a.copy()\n    temp.remove(min_val)\n    if not temp:\n        second_min = float('inf')\n    else:\n        second_min = min(temp)\n    \n    # Calculate instabilities\n    initial = max_val - min_val\n    \n    if count_max > 1:\n        inst_max = initial\n    else:\n        inst_max = second_max - min_val\n    \n    if count_min > 1:\n        inst_min = initial\n    else:\n        inst_min = max_val - second_min\n    \n    minimal = min(initial, inst_max, inst_min)\n    print(minimal)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read using standard input functions. The array length and elements are parsed.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If the array has exactly two elements, the result is immediately 0 because removing either element leaves a single-element array with no instability.\n3. **Finding Extremes**: The maximum and minimum values are found, along with their counts in the array.\n4. **Second Values**: The second highest and lowest values are determined by removing one occurrence of the maximum or minimum from a copy of the array.\n5. **Instability Calculation**: Depending on whether the maximum or minimum occurs more than once, the instability after their removal is computed.\n6. **Result Determination**: The minimum instability from the initial array and the two calculated scenarios is printed as the result.",
