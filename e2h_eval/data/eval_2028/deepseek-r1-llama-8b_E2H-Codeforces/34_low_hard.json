And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Average Sleep Time.\" Hmm.\n\nThe task says that Polycarp has been keeping track of his sleep times for n days. But a week in Berland is k days long. So the doctor wants to find the average sleep time per week over all possible consecutive weeks. Oh right, like sliding windows of size k.\n\nSo the input gives me two integers, n and k, followed by a list of n integers representing each day's sleep time. My goal is to compute the average of these k-day windows.\n\nWait, how do I approach this? Well, let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to process all possible consecutive k-day windows in the array a. For each window, calculate the sum, then find the average of all those sums.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2*10^5, which is pretty big. So doing this naively with O(nk) time complexity won't work because for each window, adding k elements would be too slow. Especially since n is 2e5, the worst case would be (2e5)^2 operations, which is 4e10—way too much.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way. Oh right, using a sliding window technique with a prefix sum array would help. Because the prefix sum allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time after preprocessing.\n\nLet me outline the plan:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array. The prefix sum at index i is the sum of the first i elements. So prefix_sum[0] = 0, prefix_sum[1] = a[0], prefix_sum[2] = a[0] + a[1], and so on.\n2. For each window starting at index i (from 0 to n-k), the sum is prefix_sum[i + k] - prefix_sum[i]. Summing all these will give the total of all windows' sums.\n3. Then, divide this total by (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the steps are:\n\n- Read n and k.\n- Read the array a.\n- Compute the prefix sum.\n- Iterate through each window, compute the sum using the prefix array.\n- Sum all those values.\n- Divide by the number of windows to get the average.\n- Output with sufficient precision.\n\nWait, but how do I handle the prefix sum? Let's think about the indices.\n\nSuppose the array a has indexes from 0 to n-1. The prefix sum array will have indexes from 0 to n, where prefix_sum[0] = 0, prefix_sum[1] = a[0], etc. So for a window starting at i (0-based) and of length k, the sum is prefix_sum[i + k] - prefix_sum[i].\n\nRight. So for example, if k=2 and n=3, the windows are [0..1], [1..2], which correspond to i=0 and i=1 in the array a. Using the prefix sum, the sum for i=0 is prefix_sum[2]-prefix_sum[0], and for i=1, it's prefix_sum[3]-prefix_sum[1].\n\nThat's correct. So the algorithm would look something like:\n\nCompute the prefix sum.\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(0, n - k + 1):\n    total += (prefix_sum[i + k] - prefix_sum[i])\n\naverage = total / (n - k + 1)\n\nThen output the average with enough decimal places.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, considering the constraints, n can be up to 2e5. So computing the prefix sum is O(n), which is manageable. Then iterating through each window is O(n), which is also manageable.\n\nSo now, the next step is to code this.\n\nBut wait, what about the data types? Since the numbers can be up to 1e5 and n up to 2e5, the maximum possible sum per window is 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10. And the number of windows is up to 2e5 as well. So the total sum could be up to 2e15, which fits in a 64-bit integer, so Python's int type can handle that without issues.\n\nSo no problem with integer overflows here.\n\nNow, the implementation steps in Python:\n\nRead n and k from the input. Then read the list of a's.\n\nCompute the prefix sum:\n\nprefix = [0]\ncurrent_sum = 0\nfor num in a:\n    current_sum += num\n    prefix.append(current_sum)\n\nThen, compute the total:\n\ntotal = 0\nwindow_count = n - k + 1\nfor i in range(window_count):\n    start = i\n    end = i + k\n   ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of k days from a given list of sleep times for n days. The goal is to efficiently calculate this average using a sliding window technique.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We need to find the average sleep time over all possible windows of size k in the given list. Directly calculating each window's sum would be inefficient, especially given the constraints where n can be up to 200,000.\n2. **Efficient Calculation Using Prefix Sum**: Instead of recalculating the sum for each window, we use a prefix sum array. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time after an initial preprocessing step.\n3. **Sliding Window Technique**: By leveraging the prefix sum array, we can slide a window of size k across the list and compute the sum for each window efficiently. The total sum of all windows is then divided by the number of windows to get the average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    # Compute prefix sum\n    prefix = [0]\n    current_sum = 0\n    for num in a:\n        current_sum += num\n        prefix.append(current_sum)\n    \n    window_count = n - k + 1\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(window_count):\n        end = i + k\n        total += (prefix[end] - prefix[i])\n    \n    average = total / window_count\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into integers `n` and `k`, followed by the list of sleep times.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: We build a prefix sum array where each entry at index `i` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the sleep times list. This helps in quickly computing the sum of any subarray.\n3. **Sliding Window Sum Calculation**: Using the prefix sum array, we compute the sum of each window of size `k` efficiently. Each window's sum is calculated as the difference between two entries in the prefix sum array.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all windows is divided by the number of windows to get the average sleep time, which is then printed with sufficient precision.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the constraints effectively, providing the required result in linear time.",
