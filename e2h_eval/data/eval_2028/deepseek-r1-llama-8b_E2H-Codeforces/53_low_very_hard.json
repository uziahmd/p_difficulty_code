Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The task is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about the examples they gave. For 'abcd', the output is 0 because all substrings are unique. For 'ababa', the output is 3. Oh right, because 'aba' appears twice, overlapping in the middle. And for 'zzz', the output is 2 because 'zz' occurs twice, but not 'zzz'.\n\nSo how do I approach this? I need to check all possible substrings and find the maximum length where at least two occurrences exist.\n\nFirst, I should consider all possible substring lengths starting from the largest possible down to 1. For each length l, I check every possible substring of that length and see if it appears more than once. Once I find the maximum l where this is true, I can return it.\n\nBut wait, checking all possible substrings for each length might be time-consuming, but since the maximum string length is 100, it's manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over possible substring lengths l, starting from the maximum possible (length of string - 1) down to 1.\n2. For each l, generate all possible substrings of length l.\n3. Use a set to keep track of seen substrings. If a substring is added to the set again, we have a duplicate.\n4. As soon as for a particular l, any substring is found to appear more than once, return l as the answer.\n5. If no such l is found (which shouldn't happen because for l=0, it's always true), return 0.\n\nWait, but for l=0, the substring is empty, which technically appears infinitely many times, but the problem says the string is non-empty, so maybe the minimum is 1 or 0? Looking at the sample input, the first case returns 0, which suggests that when there are no substrings repeating, the output is 0.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For l from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n   - For each i from 0 to len(s)-l:\n      - Take the substring s[i:i+l]\n      - Check if this substring has appeared before\n      - If yes, return l\n   - If none found for this l, continue to l-1.\n\nBut wait, for l = len(s), it's just one substring. So we only start from l = len(s)-1.\n\nAlternatively, the loop can start from the maximum possible l, which is len(s)-1, and go down to 1.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently?\n\nUsing a set to track the substrings is straightforward, but for each substring of length l, adding it to the set and checking if it's already present.\n\nLet me think about the implementation in Python.\n\nThe code structure would be something like:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nmax_length = 0\nn = len(s)\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nif max_length == 0:\n    print(0)\n\nWait, no. Because in the loop, as soon as any substring is found to have been seen before, we return l. But wait, in the code above, the first occurrence of a duplicate would cause l to be printed. But perhaps there's a longer l that also satisfies the condition, but we didn't check it yet. No, because we're looping from largest l down. So the first l for which any duplicate exists is the maximum possible, so we can return immediately.\n\nWait, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa'\n\nn is 5. So l starts at 4.\n\nFor l=4, check substrings 'abab' and 'baba'. Are any duplicates? No. So move to l=3.\n\nCheck all substrings of length 3.\n\ni=0: 'aba' → add to seen.\ni=1: 'bab' → add.\ni=2: 'aba' → already in seen → return 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: 'zzz'.\n\nn=3. l starts at 2.\n\nSubstrings: 'zz' (i=0), 'zz' (i=1). When i=1, substr is 'zz', which is in seen → return 2.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about 'aaaaa'? The maximum l is 4, but wait, let's see:\n\nl=4: substrings 'aaaa', 'aaaa' → so when i=0, add to set. i=1,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Substring Lengths**: Start from the largest possible substring length down to 1. This ensures that we check for the longest valid substrings first.\n2. **Check Each Substring**: For each length, generate all possible substrings of that length and use a set to track seen substrings.\n3. **Track Substrings**: If a substring is found to appear more than once, immediately return the current length as it is the longest valid substring length.\n4. **Edge Case Handling**: If no such substring exists, return 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each possible substring length starting from the longest, ensuring that we find the solution in minimal steps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nmax_length = 0\n\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Reading**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n- **Loop Through Lengths**: We loop from the maximum possible substring length (length of the string minus one) down to 1.\n- **Substring Checking**: For each length, we generate all possible substrings and use a set to track which substrings have been seen.\n- **Early Termination**: If a substring is found to repeat, we print the current length and exit immediately, ensuring the solution is found in the shortest time possible.\n- **Edge Case Handling**: If no repeating substrings are found, we print 0, which handles cases where all substrings are unique.\n\nThis method efficiently narrows down the longest repeating substring by leveraging a set for quick lookups, ensuring optimal performance even for the maximum allowed string length.",
