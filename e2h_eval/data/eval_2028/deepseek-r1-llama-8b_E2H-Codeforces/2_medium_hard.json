Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X'. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe grid is n x n, where n is odd. The conditions for it being an 'X' are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same character.\n2. All the other squares (non-diagonal) must be the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to check the two main diagonals. For example, in a 5x5 grid, the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the other is from top-right to bottom-left.\n\nSo the steps I need to perform are:\n\n1. Read the input correctly. Each line represents a row of the grid.\n2. For each test case, check if all the diagonal elements are the same.\n3. Also, check that the other diagonal (the anti-diagonal) has the same character as the main diagonal.\n4. Then, check that all the non-diagonal elements are the same and different from the diagonal.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says both diagonals must have the same letters. So, the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal should all be the same character. And all the other cells must be the same as each other but different from the diagonal.\n\nSo first, let me think about how to extract the diagonals.\n\nIn a grid represented as a list of lists, the main diagonal consists of grid[i][i] for i from 0 to n-1. The anti-diagonal is grid[i][n-1-i] for each i.\n\nSo for each cell, we can check if it's on either diagonal.\n\nWait, but for the entire grid, the two diagonals must consist of the same character. So the main diagonal's characters must all be the same, say 'c', and the anti-diagonal's characters must also be 'c'. Then, all other cells must be the same, say 'd', which is not equal to 'c'.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Check that all elements on the main diagonal are the same.\n- Check that all elements on the anti-diagonal are the same.\n- If the main and anti-diagonals are not the same, then it's not an 'X'.\n- Then, check that all non-diagonal elements are the same, and different from the diagonal.\n\nWait, no. Because the main and anti-diagonals must be the same. So the first step is to get the value of the main diagonal, say c. Then, check that all anti-diagonal elements are c as well. Then, check that all other elements are the same as each other and not equal to c.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Extract the main diagonal: for each row i, column j=i. All these must be same as c.\n2. Extract the anti-diagonal: for each row i, column j = n-1 -i. All these must be same as c. So c must be the same for both.\n   - So first, check that all main diagonal are same. Then, check that all anti-diagonal are same, and equal to the main diagonal's value.\n3. Then, for all other cells (not on either diagonal), check that they are same as each other, and not equal to c.\n\nWait, but what if n is 3? Like the example given. Let's see:\n\nSample Input 3:\n3\nxpx\np x p?\nWait, the second sample input is:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nWhich would be:\n\nRow 0: w s w\nRow 1: s w s\nRow 2: w s w\n\nMain diagonal is grid[0][0], grid[1][1], grid[2][2], which are 'w', 'w', 'w'. So main diagonal is 'w's.\n\nAnti-diagonal is grid[0][2], grid[1][1], grid[2][0], which are 'w', 'w', 'w'. So both diagonals are same.\n\nNow, the non-diagonal cells: for a 3x3 grid, the cells are:\n\n(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nIn the sample, (0,1) is 's', (1,0) is 's', (1,2) is 's', (2,1) is 's'. So all non-diagonal cells are same and not 'w'.\n\nSo the output is 'YES'.\n\nAnother example: the third sample input is:\n\n3\nxpx\npxp\nxpe\n\nSo the main diagonal is x, p, e. So not same. So condition fails. So output is 'NO'.\n\nSo the algorithm needs to:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n\n2. Check the main diagonal:\n   a. Get all main diagonal elements.\n   b. Check if they are all the same. Let's call this c.\n\n   If not, then return NO.\n\n3. Check the anti-diagonal:\n   a. Get all anti-diagonal elements.\n   b. Check if they are all same, and equal to c.\n\n   If any of these fail, return NO.\n\n4. Now, check all non-diagonal cells:\n   a. Collect all their values.\n   b. Check if they are all same, say d.\n   c. Also, d must not be equal to c.\n\n   If any of these conditions fail, return NO.\n\nElse, return YES.\n\nSo now, I need to implement this.\n\nHow to represent the grid? As a list of strings, perhaps. Or as a list of lists, each row being a list of characters.\n\nIn Python, reading the input could be done by reading lines, stripping newlines, etc.\n\nWait, the input is given as a string, with each line separated by '\\n'. So for example, in the sample input, the first line is '5\\nxooox\\noxoxo...'.\n\nSo when reading, I can split the input into lines, and then process each line as a row.\n\nBut wait, the first line is n, then the next n lines are the grid.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input given:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', ...]\n\nSo the first element is '5', followed by the grid lines. So perhaps the code will read the first line as n, then read the next n lines as the grid.\n\nYes.\n\nSo steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line stripped of whitespace (like using .strip()) to form the grid rows.\n\nSo grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, proceed as per the algorithm.\n\nSo for each grid:\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\nmain_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n\nif len(set(main_diag)) != 1: → not same.\n\nSimilarly, anti_diag = [grid[i][n-1 -i] for i in range(n)].\n\nif set(anti_diag) != {main_diag[0]}: → because they should all be same as main_diag.\n\nWait, more precisely:\n\nall(c == main_diag[0] for c in anti_diag)\n\nIf this is not true, then condition fails.\n\nOnce that's done, then for non-diagonal cells:\n\nfor each cell (i,j), if (i !=j and i +j != n-1) → collect these cells.\n\nCollect their values into a list.\n\nIf all these are same, and not equal to main_diag[0], then condition holds.\n\nElse, condition fails.\n\nSo putting it together.\n\nNow, some edge cases to consider.\n\nCase 1: n=1. But according to the problem statement, n >=3.\n\nWait, problem says n is at least 3, since n >=3.\n\nSo no need to handle n=1.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3, and all cells except diagonals are same.\n\nE.g., grid like:\n\na b a\nb a b\na b a\n\nHere, main diagonal is a, a, a. Anti-diagonal is a, a, a. Non-diagonal are b, b, b, etc.\n\nThis should return YES.\n\nAnother case: n=3, main diagonal is a, anti-diagonal is a, but non-diagonal are a as well. So then, the non-diagonal is same as diagonal, which is invalid.\n\nSo output is NO.\n\nAnother case: n=5. Suppose main and anti-diagonal are same, but non-diagonal have varying letters. So output is NO.\n\nSo the plan seems solid.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid as list of strings.\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\nif not all same → print NO.\n\nElse, c = main_diag[0].\n\nCheck anti_diag: if not all same as c → print NO.\n\nElse, collect all non-diagonal cells.\n\nCheck if all same, and not equal to c.\n\nIf yes → print YES else NO.\n\nSo code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nmain_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\nif len(set(main_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nc = main_diag[0]\n\nanti_diag = [grid[i][n-1 -i] for i in range(n)]\nif any(cell != c for cell in anti_diag):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Now check non-diagonal cells\nnon_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n            continue\n        non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(non_diag) == 0:\n    # Only happens when n=1, but n >=3 so this won't happen.\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    d = non_diag[0]\n    if all(cell == d for cell in non_diag) and d != c:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but wait, what if all non-diagonal cells are same but same as c? Then, it's invalid.\n\nSo the condition is:\n\nall same, and d != c.\n\nSo the code above does that.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=5\n\ngrid is:\n\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nMain diagonal: x, o, o, o, x → not all same. So condition fails, output is NO.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=3\n\ngrid:\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nMain diagonal: w, w, w.\n\nAnti-diagonal: w, w, w.\n\nNon-diagonal cells: s, s, s, s → all same, and not equal to w. So output YES.\n\nSample 3:\n\nn=3\n\ngrid:\nx p x\np x p\nx p e\n\nMain diagonal: x, x, e → not same. So output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\na b a\nb a b\na b a\n\nMain diagonal: a, a, a.\n\nAnti-diagonal: a, a, a.\n\nNon-diagonal: b, b, b. So output YES.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\na a a\na a a\na a a\n\nMain diagonal: a, a, a.\n\nAnti-diagonal: a, a, a.\n\nNon-diagonal: a, a, a.\n\nSo d is a, same as c. So condition fails. Output NO.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\na b c\nb a b\nc b a\n\nMain diagonal: a, a, a.\n\nAnti-diagonal: c, a, a.\n\nWait, anti-diagonal for i=0 is grid[0][2] = c.\n\ni=1: grid[1][1] = a.\n\ni=2: grid[2][0] = c.\n\nSo anti_diag is [c, a, c]. So not all same as a. So condition fails, output NO.\n\nSo code should catch that.\n\nI think this covers all cases.\n\nPotential issues: what if n is very large, like 299? But in Python, even 299x299 is manageable.\n\nAnother point: the grid is read as a list of strings, so each row is a string. So grid[i][j] gives the j-th character of the i-th row.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think this code should work.\n",
