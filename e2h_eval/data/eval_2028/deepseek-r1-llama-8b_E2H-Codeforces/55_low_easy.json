Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string — the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Minimum Ternary String. Hmm. So, the task is to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing certain swap operations. \n\nWait, the allowed swaps are only between '0' and '1' if they are adjacent, and between '1' and '2' if they are adjacent. So, for example, you can't swap a '0' and a '2' directly because they aren't adjacent in the swap rules. Oh right, that's an important point.\n\nSo the string consists of 0s, 1s, and 2s. And we can only swap adjacent 0 and 1, or 1 and 2. The goal is to rearrange the string as much as possible using these swaps to get the lex smallest possible string.\n\nHmm. So how do I approach this? Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible relative orderings between the characters. Since swapping 0 and 1 can change their positions, but 0 cannot be swapped with 2, and 2 cannot be swapped with 0, except through other characters. Wait, no—because 1 can be swapped with 2. So, for example, a 0 can be moved past a 2 by moving the 1 between them. Like, 0,1,2: you can first swap 1 and 2 to make 0,2,1, then swap 0 and 2? No, wait, no, because 0 and 2 can't be swapped directly. Oh right, so that's not possible. So perhaps 0 can't be reordered beyond certain points.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of which characters can be moved where relative to each other.\n\nFor example, suppose I have a string like \"210\". Can I rearrange it into \"012\"? Let's see:\n\nThe initial string is \"210\".\n\nWe can swap '1' and '2' to get \"201\". Then, can we swap '0' and '2'? No, because that's not allowed. So the final string would be \"201\", which isn't the lex smallest possible.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to arrange the 0 to the front? Hmm, seems not.\n\nWait, but wait. Another approach: 0 can be moved to the left past 1s, but not past 2s. Because to move past a 2, you'd have to swap with it, which isn't allowed. So 0s can only be moved relative to 1s, but not to 2s. Similarly, 2s can be moved past 1s, but not past 0s.\n\nSo the relative ordering between 0s and 2s is fixed. Because you can't swap a 0 and 2, and you can't get around them via other swaps. So all 0s must come before 2s in the original string, but wait, no—wait, in the initial string, a 0 might be after a 2, but can I rearrange it?\n\nWait, no. Because if I have a 0 after a 2, I can't swap them directly. But maybe through some other swaps. For instance, say the string is \"20\". I can't swap 2 and 0. So the string remains \"20\". So in this case, the 0 can't move before the 2.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, one of the test cases is \"20\" and the output is \"20\". So that makes sense.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that 0s can't be moved past 2s. So any 0 that comes after a 2 in the original string will remain after that 2. Because you can't swap them. So the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed as per the original string.\n\nSimilarly, 2s can't be moved past 0s. So the order between 0s and 2s is fixed. So for example, if the string is \"021\", you can't rearrange the 0 and 2, so the 0 must stay before the 2.\n\nWait, but wait again. Let's take the example given in the problem statement. One of the examples is the string \"010210\". They show several steps, including swapping 0 and 1, and 1 and 2. But the end result is that the 0 stays in place relative to the 2s.\n\nSo, the key point is that 0s can be moved past 1s, but not past 2s. And 2s can be moved past 1s, but not past 0s. So the relative ordering between 0s and 2s is fixed. So when trying to find the lex smallest string,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing a series of allowed swaps. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1' characters, and between adjacent '1' and '2' characters. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that while '0's can be moved past '1's and '1's can be moved past '2's, '0's cannot be moved past '2's and vice versa. This means that the relative order of '0's and '2's in the original string remains fixed. Therefore, our approach involves:\n1. Sorting all '0's among themselves as much as possible.\n2. Sorting all '1's among themselves as much as possible.\n3.
