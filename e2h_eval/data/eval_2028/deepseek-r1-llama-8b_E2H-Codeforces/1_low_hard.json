    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Golden Plate,\" and from the description, I need to calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding k rings. Each ring is like a border around the plate, and each subsequent ring is two cells away from the previous one.\n\nHmm, let me think about the problem step by step. So, the plate is w rows by h columns. For each ring i (starting from 1 to k), I need to compute the perimeter of a rectangle that's getting smaller as we add more rings.\n\nWait, how does each ring get formed? Oh right, for the first ring, it's the outermost edge. The second ring is two cells in, so the rectangle becomes (w-4) x (h-4) because each side reduces by 2 (since the ring is 1 cell wide, but it's two cells in from each direction—so subtracting 2*2=4 on each dimension). Wait no, maybe not exactly. Let me clarify.\n\nEach ring i is based on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) * (h - 4*(i-1)). Because for each previous ring, the next inner ring reduces both width and height by 4 each time (subtracting 2 from each side, twice for left and right). So for the first ring, it's (w)*(h), then next is (w-4)*(h-4), and so on until k rings.\n\nBut wait, each ring's perimeter is the number of cells along the border of that rectangle. So for a rectangle of width w_i and height h_i, the perimeter would be 2*(w_i + h_i - 2). Because the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(width + height) minus 4 (since the corners are counted twice otherwise).\n\nSo for each ring i, I need to calculate this value and sum them all up.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nFor each ring from 1 to k:\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n   if current_w < 3 or current_h < 3: maybe stop? Because if the rectangle is too small, perhaps there are no more rings beyond that.\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n   add this to the total.\n\nWait, but wait. What if current_w or current_h becomes less than 3? Because the problem statement says that each ring is a border, and each ring has a width of 1 cell. So, the inner rectangle must have at least 3x3 cells to form another ring. Otherwise, you can't add more rings.\n\nSo, the maximum number of rings possible is determined by how many times you can subtract 4 from both dimensions before either becomes less than 3.\n\nBut according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's within the maximum possible rings. So we don't have to worry about cases where k is too large. So our code can safely loop through k rings, calculating each perimeter.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input: w, h, k.\n2. Initialize a total count to 0.\n3. For each i from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n   c. Compute perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n   d. Add perimeter to total.\n4. Output the total.\n\nWait, but let's test this logic with the examples provided.\n\nLooking at the first example:\nInput: 3 3 1\nSo w=3, h=3, k=1.\n\ncurrent_w = 3 - 4*(0) =3\ncurrent_h=3-4*(0)=3\nperimeter = 2*(3+3-2) = 2*(4)=8. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1.\n\ncurrent_w=7, current_h=9.\nperimeter = 2*(7+9-2) = 2*(14) =28. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird example:7 9 2.\n\nFirst ring:7*9 gives perimeter 2*(7+9-2)=28.\n\nSecond ring:7-4=3, 9-4=5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2)=2*6=12. So total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: Let's say w=5, h=5, k=2.\n\nRing 1:5x5. perimeter 2*(5+5-2)",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding k rings. Each ring is a border around the plate, and each subsequent ring is two cells away from the previous one. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is a border of a rectangle that gets smaller as more rings are added. The i-th ring is formed around a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the perimeter of the rectangle it forms is calculated using the formula 2 * (width + height - 2). This accounts for all the cells along the border of the rectangle.\n3. **Summing Up**: Sum the perimeters of all k rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers w, h, and k. These represent the number of rows, columns, and rings respectively.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the dimensions of the rectangle it forms by subtracting 4 from both width and height for each subsequent ring.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each rectangle, calculate the perimeter and add it to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total count of gilded cells after processing all rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring accurate and optimal computation.",
