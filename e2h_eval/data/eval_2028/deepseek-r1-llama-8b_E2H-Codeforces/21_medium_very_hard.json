The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Neko Finds Grapes.\" Hmm, sounds interesting. So, Neko found some treasure chests and keys. Each chest has a number a_i, each key has b_j. The goal is to open as many chests as possible using the keys.\n\nThe condition is that a key can unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd. Oh right, because a_i + b_j ≡ 1 mod 2. So, for each pair, one must be even and the other odd.\n\nSo, the first thing I think is that we need to categorize the chests into even and odd based on their a_i values. Similarly for the keys, we need to split them into even and odd based on b_j.\n\nWait, but how? Because each key can be used once, and each chest can be opened once. So, the maximum number of chests we can open depends on how well the keys match the chests in terms of parity.\n\nLet me think: For a chest to be unlocked by any key, the key must have the opposite parity of the chest's a_i. So, for example, if a chest's a_i is even, we need an odd key to unlock it. Conversely, if a_i is odd, we need an even key.\n\nSo, the approach is probably to count how many even and odd chests there are. Then, count how many even and odd keys we have. Then, the maximum number of chests we can open is the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of even keys, plus the minimum between the odd chests and the odd keys.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's clarify:\n\nSuppose we have two types of chests: type A (a_i even) and type B (a_i odd). We also have two types of keys: type C (b_j even) and type D (b_j odd).\n\nTo unlock a type A chest, we need a key of type D (since even + odd = odd). To unlock a type B chest, we need a key of type C (odd + even = odd).\n\nSo, the maximum number of chests is the sum of the minimum between the number of type A chests and type D keys, plus the minimum between the number of type B chests and type C keys.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the plan is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd a_i's.\n2. Count the number of even and odd b_j's.\n3. The answer is min(even_a, even_b) + min(odd_a, odd_b).\n\nWait, wait. No, wait. Because type A chests require type D keys, which are the odd keys. Type B require type C, which are the even keys.\n\nSo, for the first part, the number of type A chests that can be unlocked is the minimum between the number of even_a chests and the number of odd_b keys.\n\nSimilarly, the number of type B chests that can be unlocked is the minimum between the number of odd_a chests and the number of even_b keys.\n\nSo, the total is the sum of these two minima.\n\nThat makes sense. So the steps are:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the list a, compute counts of even and odd in a.\n- Read the list b, compute counts of even and odd in b.\n- Calculate the sum of min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n- Output that sum.\n\nBut wait, let me test this logic with the examples given.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput:\n5 4\n9 14 6 2 11\n8 4 7 20\n\nSo a is [9,14,6,2,11]. Let's count even and odd:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd.\nSo even_a = 3, odd_a = 2.\n\nb is [8,4,7,20]. Even_b: 8,4,20 → 3. Odd_b:7 →1.\n\nSo, min(even_a, odd_b) = min(3,1) =1. min(odd_a, even_b) = min(2,3)=2. So total is 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example:\n\nInput:\n5 1\n2 4 6 8 10\n5\n\na is all even. So even_a=5, odd_a=0.\n\nb has one element, 5 which is odd. So even_b=0, odd_b=1.\n\nmin(even_a, odd_b) = min(5,1)=1. min(odd_a, even_b)=0. So total is 1, which matches the sample.\n\nThird example:\n\nInput:\n1 4\n10\n20 30 40 50\n\na has 10 which is even. So even_a=1, odd_a=0.\n\nb has all even. So even_b=4, odd_b=0.\n\nSo min(even_a, odd_b) is min(1,0) =0. min(odd_a, even_b)=0. So total is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nNow, considering edge cases. What if there are zero keys or zero chests?\n\nFor example, if m=0, then no chests can be opened. Similarly, if n=0.\n\nAnother case: when a has both even and odd, and b has both.\n\nLike a has 2 evens and 2 odds. b has 3 evens and 1 odd.\n\nThen, even_a=2, odd_a=2.\n\neven_b=3, odd_b=1.\n\nSo min(2,1)=1 (type A needs odd keys), min(2,3)=2 (type B needs even keys). Total 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the plan is solid.\n\nSo now, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read a's as a list, read b's as another list.\n\nCompute:\n\neven_a = number of elements in a where a_i % 2 ==0.\n\nodd_a = n - even_a.\n\nSimilarly for even_b and odd_b.\n\nThen, calculate min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nPrint the result.\n\nNow, handling the input correctly is important.\n\nIn the input, the second line is the a's, third line is the b's.\n\nWait, looking at the input example:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\nWait, perhaps the actual input is three lines: the first line is n and m, the second is a's, the third is b's.\n\nWait, the way the sample is written, the first line is '5 4\\n9 14 ...' which suggests that the entire input is three separate lines.\n\nWait, no. Looking back, the problem statement shows the input as:\n\nThe first line contains n and m.\n\nThe second line contains a_1...a_n.\n\nThe third line contains b_1...b_m.\n\nSo, for each test case, the input consists of three lines.\n\nSo, in code, we can read the first line as n and m.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nThen read the third line as another list.\n\nSo, in Python, something like:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen compute even_a = sum(1 for x in a if x %2 ==0)\n\nSame for even_b.\n\nThen calculate the answer.\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nTesting this logic.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, m=3.\n\na = [1,2,3] → even_a=1, odd_a=2.\n\nb = [4,5,6] → even_b=2, odd_b=1.\n\nSo, min(1,1) =1, min(2,2)=2. Total 3.\n\nWhich is correct, because each key can be matched accordingly.\n\nWhat about when m is larger than n? Or vice versa.\n\nLike n=2, m=100.\n\nIf a has 1 even and 1 odd.\n\nb has 50 even, 50 odd.\n\nThen, min(1,50) =1, min(1,50)=1. Total 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the plan is solid.\n\nNow, write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the available keys. The key insight is that each key can only unlock a chest if their numbers have opposite parity (one even and one odd).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parity**: First, count the number of even and odd values in both the chests and the keys. This helps us understand how many chests require even or odd keys to be unlocked.\n2. **Match Keys and Chests**: For each type of chest (even or odd), determine how many keys are needed to unlock them. Specifically:\n   - Even-numbered chests require odd-numbered keys.\n   - Odd-numbered chests require even-numbered keys.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Opened Chests**: Use the counts from the previous step to compute the maximum number of chests that can be opened. This is done by taking the minimum of the required keys for each type of chest.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_a = n - even_a\n\neven_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_b = m - even_b\n\nmax_chests = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\nprint(max_chests)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of chests `n` and keys `m`, followed by the values on the chests and keys.\n- **Counting Parity**: It counts how many chests have even and odd values. Similarly, it counts the even and odd values among the keys.\n- **Matching Keys and Chests**: Using the counts, it calculates the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked by matching the required key types to the available keys.\n- **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution by leveraging simple counting and matching, ensuring it handles all edge cases within the problem constraints.",
