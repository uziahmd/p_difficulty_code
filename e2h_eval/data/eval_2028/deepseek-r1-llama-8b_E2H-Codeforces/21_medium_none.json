    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Neko Finds Grapes.\" Hmm, sounds interesting. So, Neko found some treasure chests and keys. The goal is to open as many chests as possible using the keys.\n\nLet me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, each chest has a number a_i and each key has b_j. A key can unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd. That means either one is even and the other is odd because even + odd = odd. Oh right, but wait, no: wait, 1+2=3 which is odd. Yes. So for the sum to be odd, one must be even and the other odd.\n\nWait, but how do we determine that? For a given key j, it can unlock a chest i if a_i is even when b_j is odd, or a_i is odd when b_j is even.\n\nSo, the idea is to match the keys and chests in such a way that as many pairs as possible satisfy this condition.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the maximum number of chests that can be opened, using each key once at most on a single chest.\n\nHmm. So the approach is probably to count how many keys are even and odd, and similarly for the chests, then figure out how to pair them optimally.\n\nWait, let's think about it. Let's separate the chests into two groups: those with even a_i and those with odd a_i. Similarly for the keys: count how many are even and odd.\n\nBecause for a key to unlock a chest, their parity (even/odd) must differ.\n\nSo, for example, if a key is even, it can only unlock chests with odd a_i. And if a key is odd, it can unlock chests with even a_i.\n\nSo, the maximum number of chests we can open depends on how we pair these.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nLet:\n- E_a = number of chests with even a_i\n- O_a = number of chests with odd a_i\n- E_b = number of keys with even b_j\n- O_b = number of keys with odd b_j\n\nNow, for each key of parity p (even or odd), we can use it to unlock chests of opposite parity.\n\nSo, the maximum possible pairs would be the minimum of the available keys of one parity and the available chests of the opposite parity.\n\nWait, maybe not exactly. Because we have to choose which way to go. For instance, perhaps it's better to use all even keys on the even chests, but that's not possible since they need to have opposite parity.\n\nWait no. Wait, the key must have opposite parity to the chest. So, if a key is even, it can only unlock an odd chest. If a key is odd, it can only unlock an even chest.\n\nSo, the number of pairs between even keys and odd chests is min(E_b, O_a).\n\nSimilarly, the number of pairs between odd keys and even chests is min(O_b, E_a).\n\nBut wait, that's not all. Because we can choose which keys to use for which chests. So the total maximum is the sum of these two minima, but we have to make sure that the sum doesn't exceed the minimum of the total chests and the total keys.\n\nWait, no. Because each key can be used only once, and each chest can be used once.\n\nSo, the process is to find all possible pairs where a key's parity matches a chest's opposite parity.\n\nSo, the maximum number of chests is the sum of the two minima: min(E_b, O_a) + min(O_b, E_a). But wait, is that correct?\n\nNo, wait. Because if you have E_b even keys and O_a odd chests, the maximum you can pair them is the minimum of E_b and O_a.\n\nSimilarly, the maximum pairs between odd keys and even chests is min(O_b, E_a).\n\nSo the total maximum is the sum of these two.\n\nBut wait, what if after pairing some, the remaining keys or chests can't be paired anymore?\n\nBut perhaps the initial approach is correct because each key is used in one pairing, and each chest is used in zero or one pairing.\n\nSo, the optimal strategy is to compute the sum of min(E_b, O_a) and min(O_b, E_a), but also ensure that the total does not exceed the minimum of n and m, since you can't open more chests than you have.\n\nWait, no. Because the total number of possible pairs is min(E_b + O_b, E_a + O_a). Because each key can be used once, and each chest can be used once.\n\nBut our approach is to pair even keys with odd chests, and odd keys with even chests. So the sum of those two minima could potentially be larger than the minimum of n and m. But actually, the sum cannot be larger than the minimum of n and m because each pair uses one key and one chest.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nIf you have 5 keys and 5 chests. Suppose E_b=3, O_b=2. E_a=4, O_a=1.\n\nSo, min(E_b, O_a) is min(3,1)=1. min(O_b, E_a) is min(2,4)=2. Sum is 3. Which is less than 5. So no problem.\n\nAnother example: E_b=10, O_b=0. E_a=5, O_a=5. Then min(E_b, O_a) is 5, min(O_b, E_a) is 0. Sum is 5, which is equal to n=5.\n\nSo, the sum can be up to min(n,m), but sometimes it's less.\n\nThus, the maximum number of chests is the sum of the two minima, but we can't exceed min(n,m) because each pair uses a key and a chest, and the total can't be more than the minimum of the two.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum of the two minima could be larger than min(n, m). For example:\n\nSuppose n=3, m=3.\n\nE_b=2, O_b=1.\n\nE_a=2, O_a=1.\n\nThen, min(E_b, O_a) is 1 (since E_b=2, O_a=1). min(O_b, E_a)=1.\n\nSum is 2. Which is less than min(3,3)=3.\n\nSo in that case, sum is 2, which is okay.\n\nAnother case:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\nE_b=3, O_b=0.\n\nE_a=3, O_a=0.\n\nThen, min(E_b, O_a)=0, min(O_b, E_a)=0. Sum is 0. But that's not right because all keys are even, and all chests are even. So no pairs can be formed. So that's correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5, m=4.\n\nChests: a_i = [9,14,6,2,11]. So a values are 9 (odd),14 (even),6 (even),2 (even),11 (odd).\n\nSo E_a is 3 (14,6,2), O_a is 2 (9,11).\n\nKeys: [8,4,7,20]. Let's compute their parity. 8 is even,4 even,7 odd,20 even. So E_b=3, O_b=1.\n\nSo E_b=3, O_b=1.\n\nWe can pair even keys (3) with O_a=2 chests: min(3,2)=2.\n\nAnd odd keys (1) with E_a=3: min(1,3)=1.\n\nTotal is 3. Which matches the first example's output of 3.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Count E_a, O_a (number of even and odd a_i).\n2. Count E_b, O_b (number of even and odd b_j).\n3. Compute the number of pairs as min(E_b, O_a) + min(O_b, E_a).\n4. However, the maximum possible is the minimum of n and m, but the sum from step 3 might be higher than that. Wait no, because each pair uses one key and one chest. So the sum can't be larger than min(n, m). Because for each pair, you consume one key and one chest. So the maximum possible is min(n, m). Therefore, the result should be the minimum between the sum computed in step 3 and min(n, m).\n\nWait, no. Because the sum of the two minima could be larger than min(n, m). Let me think: for example, suppose n=100, m=100. E_b=50, O_b=50. E_a=60, O_a=40.\n\nThen, min(E_b, O_a) is min(50,40)=40. min(O_b, E_a) is min(50,60)=50. Sum is 90. Which is less than 100. So no problem.\n\nAnother example: E_b=99, O_b=1. E_a=100, O_a=1.\n\nmin(E_b, O_a)=1 (since O_a is 1). min(O_b, E_a)= min(1,100)=1. Sum is 2, which is way less than min(100,100)=100.\n\nBut what if E_b=100, O_b=100. E_a=100, O_a=100.\n\nmin(E_b, O_a)=100, min(O_b, E_a)=100. Sum is 200. But min(n,m) is 100. So the actual maximum is 100, because you can't have more than 100 pairs (since you have 100 keys and 100 chests).\n\nSo, in this case, the sum would be 200, but the actual maximum is 100.\n\nAh, right! So the maximum possible is the minimum between the sum and the minimum of n and m.\n\nWait, but in our previous examples, like the first sample, the sum is 3, which is less than min(5,4)=4. So the answer is 3.\n\nSo, the correct formula is: the maximum number of chests is the minimum of (min(E_b, O_a) + min(O_b, E_a)) and min(n, m).\n\nWait, no. Because in the case where the sum is larger than min(n,m), the maximum is min(n,m). Otherwise, it's the sum.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the steps are:\n\n- Count E_a and O_a: E_a is the number of even a_i, O_a is the number of odd a_i.\n- Count E_b and O_b: same for b_j.\n- Compute possible_pairs = min(E_b, O_a) + min(O_b, E_a)\n- The result is the minimum between possible_pairs and min(n, m).\n\nWait, no. Because in cases where possible_pairs exceeds min(n, m), we can't take more than min(n, m) because each pair uses one key and one chest, so the maximum is limited by the smaller of the two.\n\nFor example, if you have 100 keys and 100 chests, but possible_pairs is 150, you can only open 100 chests.\n\nSo yes, the final result is min(possible_pairs, min(n, m)).\n\nBut wait, in the first sample:\n\nn=5, m=4.\n\npossible_pairs is 3, which is less than 4. So the result is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nIn another scenario where n=3, m=3.\n\nE_b=2, O_b=1.\n\nE_a=2, O_a=1.\n\npossible_pairs = 1+1=2.\n\nmin(n,m)=3.\n\nSo, result is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother scenario: n=100, m=100.\n\nE_b=100, O_b=100.\n\nE_a=100, O_a=100.\n\npossible_pairs = 100+100=200. min(n,m)=100. So result is 100.\n\nSo, yes, the formula holds.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Read the list of a_i, count how many are even and odd.\n\n3. Read the list of b_j, count how many are even and odd.\n\n4. Compute possible_pairs = min(E_b, O_a) + min(O_b, E_a).\n\n5. The result is the minimum between possible_pairs and min(n, m).\n\n6. Output that result.\n\nSo, now, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nThe input is given as three lines. Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the input is:\n\nFirst line: n and m.\n\nSecond line: n integers, a_1 ... a_n.\n\nThird line: m integers, b_1 ... b_m.\n\nWait, in the sample input provided, it's written as:\n\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\nWhich seems to represent three test cases. Or is it one test case with multiple parts? Probably, the problem is for a single test case, but perhaps the way the input is presented is a bit unclear.\n\nWait, looking back: the problem says, the input is:\n\nFirst line: n and m.\n\nSecond line: n integers.\n\nThird line: m integers.\n\nSo, the sample input is three lines, but it's likely a formatting issue. Because in the problem statement, the sample input is written as a string with three parts, but in reality, the code will read from standard input, which is three lines.\n\nSo, in code, it's:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nRead the second line as a list of n integers.\n\nRead the third line as a list of m integers.\n\nSo, the code structure is straightforward.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead a list.\n\nCompute E_a and O_a.\n\nE_a = number of elements in a where a_i % 2 == 0.\n\nO_a = n - E_a.\n\nRead b list.\n\nE_b = number of elements in b where b_j % 2 == 0.\n\nO_b = m - E_b.\n\nCompute possible_pairs = min(E_b, O_a) + min(O_b, E_a).\n\nresult = min(possible_pairs, min(n, m)).\n\nPrint result.\n\nThat's it.\n\nTesting this with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=5, m=4.\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\n\nE_a: 14,6,2 → 3 even.\n\nO_a: 2.\n\nb = [8,4,7,20]\n\nE_b: 8,4,20 → 3.\n\nO_b:7 → 1.\n\npossible_pairs: min(3, 2) + min(1,3) = 2 + 1 =3.\n\nmin(n,m)=4. So result is 3.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\na = [2,4,6,8,10] → all even. E_a=5, O_a=0.\n\nb = [5] → odd. E_b=0, O_b=1.\n\npossible_pairs: min(0,0) + min(1,5) → 0 +1=1.\n\nmin(n,m)=5. So result is 1.\n\nSample 3:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\na=[10] → even. E_a=1, O_a=0.\n\nb = [20,30,40,50] → all even. E_b=4, O_b=0.\n\npossible_pairs: min(4,0) + min(0,1) → 0 +0=0.\n\nSo result is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case where the sum is larger than min(n,m):\n\nn=100, m=100.\n\na has 100 even, 0 odd.\n\nb has 100 even, 0 odd.\n\npossible_pairs: min(100,0) + min(0,100) → 0+0=0.\n\nSo result is 0.\n\nAnother case:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\na: [1,3,5] → O_a=3.\n\nb: [2,4,6] → E_b=3.\n\npossible_pairs: min(3,0) + min(0,3) → 0+0=0.\n\nSo result is 0.\n\nAnother case:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\na: [2,4,6] → E_a=3.\n\nb: [1,3,5] → O_b=3.\n\npossible_pairs: min(0,3) + min(3,3) → 0 +3=3. Which is min(3,3)=3. So result is 3.\n\nSo all tests seem to work.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, write the Python code.\n\nThe code needs to read from stdin, compute, and output the result.\n\nHandle large inputs, but since it's O(n + m), which is acceptable for n and m up to 1e5.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead the first line as n, m.\n\nRead the second line as a list of integers.\n\nRead the third line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute E_a and O_a.\n\nCompute E_b and O_b.\n\nCompute possible_pairs.\n\nCompute result.\n\nPrint result as a string.\n\nSo, code:\n\nRead n, m.\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nE_a = a.count(0 if x %2 ==0 else 1 for x in a) → Wait, no. Wait, for x in a, if x is even, add 1 to E_a.\n\nWait, better to compute as:\n\nE_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 ==0)\n\nSimilarly for O_a = len(a) - E_a.\n\nSame for E_b and O_b.\n\nSo:\n\nE_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nO_a = n - E_a\n\nE_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nO_b = m - E_b\n\npossible_pairs = min(E_b, O_a) + min(O_b, E_a)\n\nmax_c = min(possible_pairs, min(n, m))\n\nprint(max_c)\n\nYes, that's the code.\n\nTesting with sample 1:\n\nE_a=3, O_a=2.\n\nE_b=3, O_b=1.\n\npossible_pairs=2+1=3. min(n,m)=4. So output 3.\n\nSample 2:\n\nE_a=5, O_a=0.\n\nE_b=0, O_b=1.\n\npossible_pairs=0 + min(1,5)=1. min(n,m)=5. Output 1.\n\nSample3:\n\nE_a=1, O_a=0.\n\nE_b=4, O_b=0.\n\npossible_pairs = min(4,0)=0 + min(0,1)=0. Output 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, m=3, a is all even, b all odd.\n\nE_a=3, O_a=0.\n\nE_b=0, O_b=3.\n\npossible_pairs=0 + min(3,3)=3. min(3,3)=3. So output 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=100, m=100, a has 50 even, 50 odd. b has 50 even, 50 odd.\n\nE_a=50, O_a=50.\n\nE_b=50, O_b=50.\n\npossible_pairs= min(50,50) + min(50,50) →50+50=100. min(100,100)=100. So output is 100.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, code.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the keys. Each key can unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd, which means one must be even and the other must be odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parity**: First, count how many chests have even and odd numbers. Similarly, count how many keys have even and odd numbers.\n2. **Calculate Pairs**: Determine the maximum number of pairs where a key and a chest can be used together. This is done by pairing even keys with odd chests and odd keys with even chests.\n3. **Compute Result**: The result is the minimum of the total possible pairs and the minimum of the number of chests and keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nE_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nO_a = n - E_a\n\nE_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nO_b = m - E_b\n\npossible_pairs = min(E_b, O_a) + min(O_b, E_a)\nmax_c = min(possible_pairs, min(n, m))\n\nprint(max_c)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of chests `n` and keys `m`, followed by two lists representing the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Numbers**: We count how many chests have even numbers (`E_a`) and how many have odd numbers (`O_a`). Similarly, we count the even and odd keys (`E_b` and `O_b`).\n3. **Calculating Possible Pairs**: We calculate the maximum number of pairs by considering both possible valid pairings (even keys with odd chests and odd keys with even chests).\n4. **Determine Maximum Chests**: The result is the minimum of the calculated pairs and the smaller of the number of chests or keys, ensuring we do not exceed the available resources.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of chests that can be opened by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
