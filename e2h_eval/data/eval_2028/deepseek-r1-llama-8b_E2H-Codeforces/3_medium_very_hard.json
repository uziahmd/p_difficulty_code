Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Lanterns.\" Hmm.\n\nSo, the setup is that Vanya is walking along a straight street of length l. There are n lanterns placed along this street. Each lantern can light all points within a distance d from it. The goal is to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nWait, right. So, the street goes from 0 to l on a number line. Each lantern is at some position ai, and when they light up with radius d, their coverage is [ai - d, ai + d]. But since the street is bounded by 0 and l, any part beyond those points doesn't count. So for each lantern, the effective coverage is the intersection of [ai -d, ai +d] with [0, l].\n\nWe need to choose d such that the union of all these intervals covers the entire [0, l]. And we want the smallest possible d.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Let's think about the steps needed.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The input gives n and l, then a list of ai's. So, for example, in the sample input, n=7, l=15, and the ai's are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0.\n\nThe output is the minimal d. For the first sample, it's 2.5, and for the second sample (where both lanterns are at 2 and 5), it's 2.\n\nI remember that in such problems, binary search is often useful because we're looking for a minimal value that satisfies a condition. So, perhaps I can perform a binary search on d, checking for each candidate whether it's sufficient to cover the entire street.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the plan is:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because if two lanterns are close together, their combined coverage might overlap, but if they're far apart, their individual coverages must overlap sufficiently.\n\nWait, actually, maybe not. But sorting would help in determining where the gaps are between consecutive lanterns.\n\nWait, but wait: the minimal d would be determined by the maximum distance between certain points. For instance, if the lanterns are sorted, the largest gap between two consecutive lanterns' coverage after considering their d's would determine the required d. Because the street must be fully covered, the furthest point from any lantern must be covered.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think is that for the entire street to be covered, every point x in [0, l] must be within d of at least one lantern. So the maximum distance from any point in [0,l] to the nearest lantern is the minimal d required.\n\nBut that's only if the lanterns are optimally placed. Wait, no, in this problem, the lanterns are fixed; we can't move them. We have to find the minimal d such that all points are covered.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal d is the minimal value where the union of all intervals [ai -d, ai +d] covers [0, l].\n\nTo compute this, the binary search approach seems feasible.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Sort the list of lantern positions.\n\n- Binary search over possible d values. The lower bound is 0, the upper bound is l (since in the worst case, you have a single lantern at one end, so d would be l).\n\nFor each mid d in binary search:\n\n- Check whether all points in [0, l] are covered by the union of the intervals [ai -d, ai +d], clipped to [0, l].\n\nIf yes, try to find a smaller d. If no, increase d.\n\nBut how to efficiently check if the entire street is covered?\n\nHmm. Let's think about the sorted lanterns.\n\nOnce the lanterns are sorted, the street is divided into segments between them. For each segment between consecutive lanterns, the required coverage is that the distance between them must be <= 2d. Because if two lanterns are at positions a and b, with b > a, then their coverage intervals [a-d, a+d] and [b-d, b+d] must overlap or at least meet. So the maximum of (b - a) must be <= 2d. Otherwise, there's a gap between the two.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, if two lanterns are at a and b, with a < b. Then the first can cover up to a + d, the second starts at b - d. To have no gap, a + d >= b - d. So 2d >= b - a.\n\nBut wait, what about the endpoints? Like, the first lantern's coverage ends at a + d, the next starts at b - d. So if a + d >= b -d, then the two intervals meet or overlap. So yes, the distance between the two must be <= 2d.\n\nBut also, the first lantern may start before 0, but since the street starts at 0, the effective coverage is max(0, a -d) to min(l, a +d). Similarly for the last lantern, it can extend beyond l, but we clip it.\n\nWait, but if the lanterns are sorted, and we consider the coverage for each pair of consecutive lanterns, then the maximal distance between consecutive lanterns is the critical factor. Because for the entire street to be covered, each such pair must have a distance <= 2d.\n\nWait, but what about the edges? Like, the first lantern's leftmost coverage is 0, but maybe a lantern further away could cover that. Or the last lantern's rightmost coverage is l.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal d is the maximum between:\n\n- The maximum of (distance between consecutive lanterns) / 2\n\n- The distance from the first lantern to 0, divided by 2.\n\n- The distance from the last lantern to l, divided by 2.\n\nBecause, for example, the first lantern needs to cover up to 0. So its left coverage is a1 -d must be <=0. So d >= a1 -0 = a1. Wait, no: because [a1 -d, a1 +d] must include 0. So a1 -d <=0 and a1 +d >=0. But since a1 is >=0, a1 -d <=0 implies d >= a1. But that can't be right because in the sample input, the first lantern is at 15, and d is 2.5. 15 -2.5 is 12.5, which is greater than 0. So that can't be.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first lantern is at 15, and d is 2.5. So its coverage is 15 -2.5=12.5 to 15+2.5=17.5. But since the street ends at 15, the coverage is 12.5 to 15. So 0 is not covered by this lantern. So the lanterns must cover 0 and l as well.\n\nAh, right. So the first lantern's coverage must reach 0, and the last must reach l.\n\nWait, but the first lantern is at a1, so to cover 0, we need a1 -d <=0. So d >= a1.\n\nSimilarly, the last lantern is at an, and to cover l, an +d >=l, so d >= l - an.\n\nBut wait, that's only if the first lantern is the only one covering 0, or something like that. Because other lanterns might be closer to 0 and cover it.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because if the first lantern is at a1, then to cover 0, either a1 -d <=0, or another lantern's coverage includes 0.\n\nSo the minimal d must satisfy that either:\n\n- a1 -d <=0 (so d >=a1)\n\nOR\n\n- some lantern's a_i +d >=0 (but since a_i >=0, that's always true)\n\nWait, no. Because if a_i is less than d, then a_i -d could be negative, but the coverage is from a_i -d to a_i +d, but we take the maximum with 0 and the minimum with l. So, for 0 to be covered, it must be included in at least one of the lantern's intervals.\n\nSo, for 0 to be covered, there must exist a lantern a_i such that a_i -d <=0, or another condition.\n\nWait, no: 0 must lie within [a_i -d, a_i +d]. So for 0, the condition is a_i -d <=0 and a_i +d >=0. But since a_i is >=0, a_i +d is always >=0, so the condition is just a_i -d <=0, i.e., d >=a_i.\n\nWait, no. Wait, suppose a lantern is at a_i =5, d=3. Its coverage is 2 to 8. 0 is not covered because 2>0.\n\nSo, to cover 0, at least one lantern must have a_i -d <=0. So d >=a_i.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lantern is at a_i=0, then d can be zero, but since d is positive, perhaps not.\n\nWait, no. Because in the problem statement, d is a positive number. So in any case, if 0 is not covered by any lantern's left side, then another lantern must cover it from the right.\n\nWait, no. Because if a lantern is at a_i, then to cover 0, either a_i -d <=0, or another lantern's a_j +d >=0, but since a_j >=0, a_j +d is >=a_j, which is >=0. So a_j +d is >=0 is always true. So to cover 0, we need at least one lantern whose a_i -d <=0.\n\nOtherwise, 0 is not covered by any lantern's left side, but maybe by someone's right side?\n\nNo, because a_i is >=0, so a_i -d could be <=0, but a_i +d is >=0. So for 0 to be in [a_i -d, a_i +d], it's necessary that a_i -d <=0 <=a_i +d.\n\nWhich is equivalent to 0 being in [max(a_i -d, 0), min(a_i +d, l)].\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as follows: The entire street [0, l] must be covered by the union of the intervals [a_i -d, a_i +d], but clipped to [0, l]. So for each lantern, its contribution is [max(0, a_i -d), min(l, a_i +d)].\n\nThe union of all these intervals must be [0, l].\n\nSo, to model this, perhaps the following steps:\n\n1. Sort the lanterns' positions.\n\n2. Compute the required d such that:\n\n   a. The first lantern's interval starts at max(0, a_1 -d). To cover 0, this must be <=0. So a_1 -d <=0 => d >= a_1.\n\n   b. The last lantern's interval ends at min(l, a_n +d). To cover l, this must be >=l. So a_n +d >=l => d >= l - a_n.\n\n   c. Between consecutive lanterns, the intervals must overlap. So for each i from 1 to n-1, the right end of a_i's interval must be >= the left end of a_{i+1}'s interval.\n\nWait, but the intervals are [max(0, a_i -d), min(l, a_i +d)]. So the right end of a_i's interval is min(l, a_i +d), and the left end of a_{i+1}'s interval is max(0, a_{i+1} -d).\n\nFor the intervals to overlap, the right end of a_i's interval must be >= the left end of a_{i+1}'s interval.\n\nWait, but what if a_i's interval ends before a_{i+1}'s begins? Then there's a gap.\n\nSo for each i, we need min(l, a_i +d) >= max(0, a_{i+1} -d).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nd must satisfy:\n\n- d >= a_1 (to cover 0)\n- d >= (l - a_n) (to cover l)\n- For each i from 1 to n-1, a_i +d >= a_{i+1} -d => 2d >= a_{i+1} - a_i.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So for each consecutive pair, 2d must be >= the distance between them. Because a_i +d >= a_{i+1} -d → rearranged, 2d ≥ a_{i+1} - a_i.\n\nSo combining all these conditions, the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- a_1\n- (l - a_n)\n- max( (a_{i+1} - a_i) ) / 2 for all i from 1 to n-1 )\n\nWait, but wait. What if the street is covered without all these conditions being met? For example, suppose n=1, and the lantern is at position 0. Then d must be at least l, because the lantern's coverage is [0 -d, 0 +d], but the street is [0, l]. So to cover l, d must be >= l.\n\nIn this case, the formula above would give a_1 =0, (l -a_n)=l, and since there are no other lanterns, the max is l. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: in the sample input 2, the two lanterns are at 2 and 5. So a_1=2, a_2=5. The distance between them is 3, so 3/2=1.5. Also, a_1=2, and (l - a_n) is 5 -5=0. So the max is max(2, 0, 1.5) → 2. Which is correct.\n\nIn the first sample, let's see:\n\nThe lanterns are at 0,3,5,7,9,14,15. So sorted.\n\nCompute the differences between consecutive lanterns:\n\n0-0 (no, wait, 0 to 3 is 3 units apart.\n\nWait, the sorted list is 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nSo the distances are 3, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1.\n\nSo the maximum difference is 5. So 5/2=2.5.\n\nThen, a_1 is 0, (l -a_n)=15-15=0. So the maximum is 2.5.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in non-decreasing order.\n\n2. Compute the maximum of:\n\n   a. The first lantern's position (a[0]).\n\n   b. The last lantern's position subtracted from l (l - a[-1]).\n\n   c. The maximum of (a[i+1] - a[i]) for all i, divided by 2.\n\n3. The minimal d is the maximum of these three values.\n\nWait, but what about cases where the lanterns are not in the middle of the street? For example, multiple lanterns, but the first is at 0 and the last at l. Then, a_1 is 0, l - a_n is 0. The maximum difference between consecutive lanterns could be larger, but perhaps it's covered by the first and last.\n\nWait, but if the first is at 0 and last at l, then the maximum difference between consecutive lanterns is l -0, but the first condition already requires d >=0, and the last condition d >= l - l=0. So the main constraint comes from the maximum consecutive difference divided by 2.\n\nWait, but perhaps not. Let's see: suppose n=2, a_1=0, a_2=l. Then the distance between them is l. So d must be >= l/2. Because (a_2 -a_1)/2 = l/2. So the minimal d is l/2.\n\nBut does that cover the entire street?\n\nYes: the first lantern covers from 0 to d, the second from l -d to l. So the coverage is 0 to d and l -d to l. So for the entire street to be covered, d >= l/2.\n\nBecause if d is l/2, the coverage is 0 to l/2 and l - l/2 = l/2 to l. So combined, the entire street is covered.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a=[0, 10, 20], l=20.\n\nThe differences are 10 and 10. So max difference is 10 → 5.\n\na_1 is 0, l -a_n is 0. So d must be 5.\n\nDoes that cover the street?\n\nEach lantern's coverage with d=5 is:\n\n0: 0-5= -5 (clipped to 0) to 5.\n\n10: 5 to 15.\n\n20: 15 to 25 (clipped to 20).\n\nSo the union is 0 to 5, 5 to 15, 15 to 20. So the entire street is covered.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nSo the steps for the code are:\n\n1. Read n and l.\n\n2. Read the list of a_i's.\n\n3. Sort the a_i's.\n\n4. Compute the initial maximum d_candidate as the maximum of:\n\n   a. a[0]\n\n   b. l - a[-1]\n\n   c. (max_gap) / 2, where max_gap is the maximum of a[i+1] - a[i] for i in 0..n-2.\n\n5. Output d_candidate.\n\nWait, but wait: what if n=1? Then, the lantern is at a[0]. To cover 0 and l, the coverage must be from 0 to l.\n\nSo a[0] -d <=0 → d >=a[0].\n\nAnd a[0]+d >=l → d >= l -a[0].\n\nSo the minimal d is max(a[0], l -a[0]).\n\nBut according to our algorithm, for n=1:\n\nmax_gap is 0 (since there are no consecutive pairs). So step 4c is 0.\n\nSo the maximum of a[0], l -a[0], 0 is max(a[0], l -a[0]).\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: all lanterns are at 0.\n\nn=3, a=[0,0,0], l=10.\n\nThen:\n\na[0] is 0.\n\nl -a[-1] is 10.\n\nmax_gap is 0.\n\nSo d is max(0,10,0) → 10.\n\nWhich is correct, because the lanterns can't cover beyond their position, so d must be 10.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nAnother edge case: all lanterns are at l.\n\nn=3, a=[15,15,15], l=15.\n\na[0]=15.\n\nl -a[-1]=0.\n\nmax_gap=0.\n\nSo d is max(15, 0, 0) →15. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, a=[5, 10], l=10.\n\nmax_gap is 5 → 2.5.\n\na[0]=5, l -a[-1] = 0.\n\nSo d is max(5, 0, 2.5) →5.\n\nWait, but with d=5, the first lantern covers 0 to 10, the second covers 5 to 15 (clipped to 10). So the entire street is covered. So correct.\n\nBut what if we have n=2, a=[5, 12], l=15.\n\nmax_gap is 7 → 3.5.\n\na[0]=5, l -a[-1]=3.\n\nSo d is max(5,3,3.5) →5.\n\nCheck coverage: first lantern at 5, d=5: covers 0-10.\n\nSecond lantern at 12, d=5: covers 7-17 → clipped to 7-15.\n\nSo union is 0-10 and 7-15 → 0-15. So covered.\n\nBut what if d was 3.5? Then:\n\nFirst lantern covers 1.5 to 8.5.\n\nSecond covers 8.5 to 16 → clipped to 8.5-15.\n\nSo the union is 1.5-8.5 and 8.5-15 → covered. So d=3.5 would also suffice.\n\nBut according to our algorithm, it's choosing 5 because a[0]=5 is larger.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, so in this case, our algorithm returns d=5, but a valid d exists at 3.5.\n\nSo what's wrong here?\n\nWait, the algorithm is computing the maximum of a[0], l - a[-1], and the max_gap / 2.\n\nIn this case:\n\na[0] =5\n\nl -a[-1] =15 -12=3\n\nmax_gap is 7 (12-5=7), so 7/2=3.5.\n\nSo the maximum is 5. But d=3.5 works.\n\nSo the algorithm is incorrect.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So why is that happening?\n\nWait, what's happening here: the first lantern's coverage is from 5-3.5=1.5 to 5+3.5=8.5. The second is from 12-3.5=8.5 to 12+3.5=15.5, clipped to 15.\n\nSo the two intervals meet exactly at 8.5, so the entire street is covered.\n\nBut according to the algorithm, the first condition is a[0]=5, which is larger than 3.5, so it's taking 5 as the minimal d.\n\nBut 3.5 is sufficient, so the algorithm is incorrect.\n\nThis indicates that the approach is flawed.\n\nWait, but why? Because in the scenario where the first lantern is at a[0] and the last is at a[-1], perhaps the minimal d is determined by the maximum of the three conditions, but sometimes, a lower d can suffice if the first and last lanterns are far enough apart.\n\nWait, but in this case, the first lantern is at 5, and the last is at 12. So the distance between them is 7. So d must be at least 3.5. But the first condition is d >=5, which is more than 3.5.\n\nWait, but in reality, with d=3.5, the first lantern covers 5-3.5=1.5 to 8.5. The second covers 8.5 to 15.5. So 0 is covered by the first lantern, 15 is covered by the second. But wait, the first lantern's coverage is from 1.5 to 8.5, so 0 is not covered by the first. Is there another lantern that covers 0?\n\nNo, because the second lantern is at 12, and d=3.5, so 12-3.5=8.5. So the second's coverage starts at 8.5. So 0 is not covered by any lantern.\n\nWait, that's the problem. So with d=3.5, 0 is not covered.\n\nSo why did I think earlier that d=3.5 would suffice? Because I thought that the first lantern's coverage starts at 1.5, but 0 is not covered.\n\nSo my mistake: in this case, the first lantern is at 5. So with d=3.5, it covers up to 8.5, but 0 is not covered. So the entire street isn't covered, hence d=3.5 is invalid.\n\nThus, the algorithm's approach is correct, because in this case, the minimal d is 5.\n\nWait, but what about adding a third lantern at 0? Then, with d=3.5, the coverage would include 0. So in that case, the algorithm would have to account for that.\n\nWait, so the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo perhaps my earlier reasoning was wrong. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn the test case I thought of:\n\nn=2, a=[5,12], l=15.\n\nWith d=3.5:\n\n- First lantern: 5-3.5=1.5 to 5+3.5=8.5.\n\n- Second lantern: 12-3.5=8.5 to 12+3.5=15.5 → clipped to 8.5 to15.\n\nSo the union is 1.5-8.5 and 8.5-15 → the entire street from 1.5 to 15 is covered. But 0 is not covered.\n\nThus, the street is not entirely covered, so d=3.5 is insufficient.\n\nSo the algorithm correctly returns d=5, which ensures that the first lantern covers 0.\n\nSo in this case, the algorithm is correct.\n\nWait, but how about if there's a third lantern at 0?\n\nThen, the algorithm would have a sorted list [0,5,12], l=15.\n\na[0] is 0, l -a[-1] is 15-12=3.\n\nmax_gap is max(5-0=5, 12-5=7) →7, so 3.5.\n\nThus, the maximum is max(0,3,3.5) →3.5.\n\nSo d=3.5 would suffice.\n\nIndeed, with d=3.5:\n\n- Lantern at 0 covers 0-3.5 to 3.5.\n\n- Lantern at5 covers 1.5 to 8.5.\n\n- Lantern at12 covers 8.5 to15.\n\nSo the entire street is covered.\n\nSo the algorithm now correctly computes d=3.5.\n\nSo the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo the problem arises only when the first lantern is not at 0, but the algorithm correctly requires that d is at least a[0], ensuring that the first lantern covers 0.\n\nThus, the approach is correct.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nSort the list of a_i.\n\nCompute:\n\nmax1 = a[0]\n\nmax2 = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = max( a[i+1] - a[i] for i in range(n-1) )\n\nmax_gap_div_2 = max_gap / 2\n\nd = max( max1, max2, max_gap_div_2 )\n\nPrint d with 10 decimal places.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, handling the input:\n\nWe need to read n and l from the first line.\n\nThen read the next line, split into n integers.\n\nSort them.\n\nCompute the max_gap as the maximum difference between consecutive elements.\n\nCompute the three maxima, then take the maximum of them.\n\nSo the code in Python would look like this:\n\nRead n and l.\n\na = list of integers.\n\nsort a.\n\nif n ==0: impossible, but constraints say n>=1.\n\nmax1 = a[0]\n\nmax2 = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    diff = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n    if diff > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = diff\n\nmax_gap_div_2 = max_gap / 2\n\nd = max( max1, max2, max_gap_div_2 )\n\nprint(d with 10 decimals)\n\nWait, but wait: what if n=1?\n\nLike n=1, a = [5], l=10.\n\nmax1 =5.\n\nmax2=10 -5=5.\n\nmax_gap is 0.\n\nso d=5.\n\nWhich is correct: coverage is 0 to10.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n['2 5\\n2 5']\n\nn=2, l=5.\n\na after sorting is [2,5].\n\nmax1=2.\n\nmax2=5 -5=0.\n\nmax_gap=3.\n\nmax_gap_div_2=1.5.\n\nso d= max(2, 0, 1.5) →2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, a = [0, 10, 20], l=20.\n\nmax1=0.\n\nmax2=20-20=0.\n\nmax_gap=10, so 5.\n\nd=5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nThus, the Python code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns on a street can illuminate the entire street from 0 to \\( l \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to find the smallest radius \\( d \\) such that every point on the street is within \\( d \\) units of at least one lantern. Each lantern's coverage is an interval around its position, clipped to the street boundaries [0, l].\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The minimal \\( d \\) must satisfy three conditions:\n   - The first lantern must cover the start of the street (0).\n   - The last lantern must cover the end of the street (l).\n   - Consecutive lanterns must be close enough such that their combined intervals overlap sufficiently.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Sort the positions of the lanterns.\n   - Compute the maximum distance between consecutive lanterns, which determines the required \\( d \\) for their coverage to overlap.\n   - Ensure the first lantern covers 0 and the last lantern covers \\( l \\).\n   - Use these values to determine the minimal \\( d \\) via the maximum of these constraints.\n\n4. **Complexity**: Sorting the lantern positions takes \\( O(n \\log n) \\). Calculating the necessary values is linear, so overall complexity is \\( O(n \\log n) \\), which is efficient for \\( n \\leq 1000 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = float(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        max1 = a[0]\n        max2 = l - a[0]\n        max_gap = 0\n    else:\n        max1 = a[0]\n        max2 = l - a[-1]\n        max_gap = 0\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            diff = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            if diff > max_gap:\n                max_gap = diff\n    \n    max_gap_div_2 = max_gap / 2\n    d = max(max1, max2, max_gap_div_2)\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of lanterns \\( n \\) and the street length \\( l \\), followed by the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The positions are sorted to facilitate checking consecutive distances.\n3. **Computing Constraints**: The code calculates the maximum distance from the start and end of the street, the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and the required \\( d \\) for each constraint.\n4. **Determining \\( d \\)**: The minimal \\( d \\) is the maximum value derived from the constraints, ensuring complete coverage of the street.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the minimal \\( d \\) using sorting and linear checks, ensuring correctness and performance.",
