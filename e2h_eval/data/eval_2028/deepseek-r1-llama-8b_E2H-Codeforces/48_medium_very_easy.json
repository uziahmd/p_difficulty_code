He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about converting a number from one base to another, but with some Roman numeral rules involved. Oh right, and the bases can be up to 25, which is manageable.\n\nThe input gives me two integers a and b. Wait, but b could be 'R', which indicates that the target base uses Roman numerals. Interesting. Then, there's a string c which is in base a. My task is to convert this into base b, but using Roman numerals if needed.\n\nLet me break this down. So first, I need to parse the input correctly. The first line has a and b, but b might be R. The second line is the number c in base a.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Read a and b. If b is R, then the output should be in Roman numerals. Otherwise, it's in base b as a decimal string.\n\n2. Convert the number c from base a to an integer (in base 10).\n\n3. Then, convert that integer to the target base (either as a decimal string or as Roman numerals if b is R).\n\nWait, but wait—no, because for cases where b is not R, the output is just the number in base b as a string without leading zeros. For example, if a is 10, b is 2, and c is 1, then the output is '1'. But if c is 16 in base 10 and b is 2, it's 10000.\n\nBut when b is R, we have to represent the number as a Roman numeral according to the rules.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Parse a and b: determine whether the output is in base b digits or Roman numerals.\n\n- Convert c from base a to a decimal integer.\n\n- Then, based on b, either:\n\n   a. Output the decimal integer in base b as a string (without leading zeros).\n\n   b. Convert the decimal integer to a Roman numeral string.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle the conversion of the decimal integer to Roman numerals? I remember that Roman numerals have specific representations for numbers. So I need a helper function to do that.\n\nAlso, for the base conversion part, I'll need functions to convert from a given base to a decimal, and then from decimal to another base.\n\nLet me think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read the inputs. So, the first line is a and b. The second line is the string c in base a.\n\nFor example, in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nWhich means a=10, b=2, c is '1' in base 10. So the output is '1' in base 2, which is '1'.\n\nAnother example is:\n\n5 R\n\n4\n\nHere, a=5, b is R (so output in Roman). c is '4' in base 5, which is 4 in decimal. So the output is 'IV'.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read a and b. Check if b is 'R'.\n\n2. Read the string c in base a.\n\n3. Convert c from base a to decimal.\n\n4. If b is not 'R', convert the decimal number to base b as a string, omitting leading zeros.\n\n5. Else, convert the decimal to a Roman numeral string.\n\nNow, let's tackle each part.\n\nFirst, reading the inputs. The first line is two integers, but b can be 'R'. So in code, I'll read the first line as split into parts, and assign a and b accordingly. But since b is either an integer or 'R', I need to check if the second element is 'R'.\n\nThen, the second line is the string c in base a. So, I need to process this string as a base-a number.\n\nNow, converting c from base a to decimal. Let's write a helper function for that. The function will take the string and the base, return the decimal value.\n\nWait, but what if the string is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, the number is non-zero, so c can't be empty.\n\nSo, for the base conversion from a to decimal:\n\nInitialize result = 0.\n\nLoop through each character in c:\n\n   result = result * a + value_of_char\n\nEach character's value is its digit value in base a. For example, in base 10, '1' is 1, 'A' is 10, etc., but wait no—if a is 10, then A would be 10 only if the target base is higher than 10. Wait, no, in the problem statement, c is in base a, which can be any base from 2 to 25.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, c is a string in base a, which may contain digits beyond 9. For example, if a is 16, c can have letters A-F representing 10-15.\n\nSo, to correctly compute the decimal value, I need to map each character to its corresponding value.\n\nHmm, but how? For example, in base 16, 'A' represents 10, 'B' 11, etc. So for any base a, the digits are 0-9 and then letters A-Z (but only up to a certain point, depending on a). Wait, but a is at least 2, and can be up to 25. So, for a base a, the maximum digit is min(9, a-1). Letters are used for values 10 and above.\n\nWait, no. In standard numbering systems, each digit is represented by a unique symbol. So, for base a, digits go from 0 to a-1. So for a=2, digits are 0 and 1; for a=16, digits are 0-9 and A-F (representing 10-15). So, for any a, the digits are 0-9, followed by A (10), B (11), etc., up to a-1.\n\nWait, but what about when a is less than 10? Like a=5. Then digits are 0-4, which are represented as 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nSo, to get the value of each character, I need to map each character to its corresponding integer value.\n\nIn Python, I can create a dictionary that maps characters to their values. So for a given character, its value is:\n\nif the character is a digit, then int(char).\n\nelse, if it's uppercase, value is 10 + (ord(c) - ord('A')).\n\nBut wait, lowercase letters aren't allowed in the problem statement. Because in the problem description, the examples show 'A' as a possible character.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"c is a single non-negative integer in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103.\" So, the string can have digits and letters (uppercase?), but in the examples, like 'A' is present.\n\nSo, perhaps the input c can have both uppercase and lowercase letters, but in the problem statement, it's unclear. But looking at the sample input, the last example is 'A', which is in uppercase.\n\nWait, in the note, it says that in bases greater than 10, we use A for 10, B for 11, etc. So, I think the input c will have uppercase letters, and I should treat them as such.\n\nSo, my helper function for converting a character to its value is:\n\ndef char_to_value(c, base):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        # assume uppercase\n        return 10 + ord(c) - ord('A')\n\nBut wait, what if the base is less than the value of the character? For example, if the base is 5, and a character is 'A' (10), that's invalid. So in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that c is a valid number in base a, so this won't happen.\n\nSo, during the conversion from c to decimal, I can safely process each character.\n\nOnce I have the decimal value, I need to process it based on the target base.\n\nCase 1: target base is not R. So, I need to convert the decimal to base b as a string, without leading zeros.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nWell, for base conversion, the standard method is to repeatedly divide the number by the base and collect the remainders.\n\nBut since we don't want leading zeros, we can start from the least significant digit and then reverse the list, omitting any leading zeros.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the output shouldn't have leading zeros. So, for example, if the decimal is zero, but the problem says c is non-zero, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input c is non-zero. So, in our case, the decimal number is at least 1.\n\nSo, for the base b conversion:\n\nWe can proceed by:\n\nnumber = decimal_value\n\nif number == 0:\n\n   return '0'\n\nelse:\n\n   create a list to hold the digits.\n\n   while number > 0:\n\n       remainder = number % b\n\n       digits.append(remainder)\n\n       number = number // b\n\n   digits are collected in reverse order.\n\n   then, convert each digit to the corresponding character.\n\n   if the first digit is zero, skip leading zeros.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the output must not have leading zeros. So, for example, if the number is 0, but according to the problem, c can't be zero, so we don't need to handle that.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n\n    if n == 0:\n\n        return '0'\n\n    digits = []\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        rem = n % base\n\n        digits.append(rem)\n\n        n = n // base\n\n    # Now, digits are in reverse order.\n\n    # Convert each digit to the corresponding character.\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for d in reversed(digits):\n\n        if d < 10:\n\n            res += str(d)\n\n        else:\n\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\n    # Remove leading zeros? Wait, no: for example, if digits are [1], it's '1'.\n\n    return res\n\nWait, but wait: when the digits are processed, they are in reverse order. For example, if the number is 5 in base 2: 101, so the digits list after division is [1,0,1], but when reversed, it's 101, which is correct.\n\nWait, no: the digits list is collected as the remainders, starting from the least significant digit. So, for 5 in base 2: 5 // 2 is 2, rem 1 → digits [1], 2 //2 is 1, rem 0 → [1,0], 1//2 is 0, rem 1 → [1,0,1]. So digits list is [1,0,1], which when reversed becomes 101.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each digit in the reversed list, we add the corresponding character.\n\nBut wait, for digits >=10: when base is larger than 10, but the digit can be up to base-1. For example, if base is 16 and the digit is 15, it's 'F'.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the other case is when the target base is R. Then, we need to convert the decimal number into a Roman numeral.\n\nSo, for that, I need a function that takes a decimal number and returns the Roman numeral string according to the rules.\n\nRoman numerals have specific patterns. The rules are:\n\n- Numbers 0 and above are handled as follows:\n\n   0 is not allowed (since the input c is non-zero).\n\n   I is 1, V is 5, X is 10, L is 50, C is 100, D is 500, M is 1000.\n\n   The subtractive notation is used for 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD), 900 (CM).\n\n   For numbers above 1000, we use overlines, but in this problem, the maximum number is 101510, which is under 300010. Wait, wait, the problem says that the number is guaranteed to be <= 300010 when considering Roman numerals, but otherwise, it's <=101510.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a typo in the problem statement. Anyway, for the purposes of the function, we need to handle numbers up to at least 300010.\n\nSo, how to create a function to convert a decimal to Roman numerals.\n\nOne approach is to use a list of tuples that represent the values and their corresponding Roman symbols, ordered from highest to lowest, including the subtractive cases.\n\nFor example:\n\nroman_numerals = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each value in roman_numerals, subtract as many times as possible from the number and append the corresponding symbols.\n\nSo, the function would look like this:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'), (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'), (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res += r\n            n -= i\n\n    return res\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nRead c_str, the string in base a.\n\nConvert c_str to decimal: decimal_val.\n\nIf b is 'R':\n\n   output = decimal_to_roman(decimal_val)\n\nElse:\n\n   output = decimal_to_base(decimal_val, b)\n\nPrint output.\n\nWait, but what if b is 1? No, the problem constraints say 2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25. So, b can't be 1.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\na, b = ... ?\n\nWait, the first line of input is two integers, but the second can be 'R'. So, in code:\n\nline1 = input().split()\na = int(line1[0])\nb = line1[1] if line1[1] != 'R' else None  # Or, perhaps, set a flag.\n\nWait, no, better to have a variable indicating whether the output is in Roman.\n\nSo:\n\nline1 = input().strip().split()\n\na = int(line1[0])\ntarget_base_is_roman = False\n\nif len(line1) == 2:\n    b_str = line1[1]\n    if b_str == 'R':\n        target_base_is_roman = True\n    else:\n        b = int(b_str)\nelse:\n    # Wait, but line1 should have two elements. Because the problem statement says the first line has two integers.\n    # So, perhaps, in code, we can read the first line, split into parts, and process.\n\nSo, assuming line1 has exactly two elements.\n\nThen, for c_str:\n\nline2 = input().strip()\n\nNow, process c_str:\n\ndecimal_val = 0\n\nfor ch in c_str:\n\n    decimal_val = decimal_val * a + char_to_value(ch, a)\n\nWait, yes.\n\nBut wait, what about leading zeros? The problem says that the output shouldn't have leading zeros, but the input can have leading zeros. So, for example, if c_str is '00123', that's fine as long as the output is correct.\n\nOnce the decimal_val is obtained, proceed.\n\nNow, if target_base_is_roman is True:\n\n    output = decimal_to_roman(decimal_val)\n\nelse:\n\n    output = decimal_to_base(decimal_val, b)\n\nThen, print(output)\n\nWait, but for the decimal_to_base function, when the base is larger than 10, the digits are represented as letters.\n\nSo, the function should handle that.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWait, no, the actual input is via stdin, but the sample shows that the outputs are as follows.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nThe first line is '10 2', so a=10, b=2 (not R).\n\nSecond line is '1' → c in base 10 is 1.\n\nSo, decimal_val is 1.\n\nTarget base is 2, so output is '1'.\n\nSecond test case: '16 R' is the first line. So a=16, b='R'.\n\nc_str is '5' in base 16 → decimal_val is 5.\n\nSo, output is 'V'.\n\nThird test case: a=5, b=R.\n\nc_str is '4' → 4 in base 5 is 4 → output 'IV'.\n\nFourth test case: a=2, b=2.\n\nc_str is '1111001' in base 2 → let's calculate:\n\n1111001 in binary is:\n\nFrom left to right:\n\n1*(2^7) + 1*(2^6) + 1*(2^5) + 1*(2^4) + 0*(2^3) + 0*(2^2) + 1*(2^0)\n\n= 128 +64 +32 +16 +1 = 128+64=192+32=224+16=240+1=241.\n\nSo, output is '1111001' (base 2), which is 241 in decimal.\n\nWait, but why is the output 241 in base 2, which is 1111001, same as the input. So, when a equals b, the output is the same as c, except without leading zeros.\n\nWait, but in this case, the input is '1111001' which is 241 in base 2. So, the output is '1111001' because it's already in base 2 without leading zeros.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, the fourth case's output is '1111001', which is correct.\n\nThe fifth case: a=12, b=13.\n\nc_str is 'A' in base 12 → A is 10 in base 12, so decimal_val is 10.\n\nTarget base is 13, which is a decimal representation.\n\nSo, 10 in base 13 is 'A' as well.\n\nSo, the output is 'A'.\n\nSo, all these make sense.\n\nNow, handling the case where the target base is not R.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=2, c=16.\n\nc is '16' in base 10 → decimal_val is 16.\n\nConverting to base 2: 16 in binary is 10000.\n\nSo, the output is '10000'.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nWhat about when the decimal value is zero? Well, the problem states that the input c is non-zero, so we don't need to handle that case.\n\nNow, thinking about the helper functions.\n\nImplementing char_to_value(c, base):\n\nBut in Python, perhaps using a function.\n\nBut perhaps, precompute a mapping for all possible characters (digits 0-9, A-Z, etc.) to their respective values.\n\nWait, but in the problem, c is given in base a, which can be up to 25.\n\nSo, for a given base a, each digit in c must be less than a.\n\nThus, when processing each character in c_str, the value should be between 0 and a-1.\n\nSo, in the helper function, for a character c:\n\nif c is '0'-'9', value is int(c).\n\nelse, it's a letter. Since a can be up to 25, the letters go up to 'P' (since 25-10=15, which is 'F'? Wait, no: 10 is 'A', 11 'B', ..., 25 is 'P' (because A is 10, B 11, ..., P is 25-10=15? Wait, no: 10 is 'A', 11 'B', ..., 25 is 'P' (since 25-10=15 letters after 'A', which is 0-based: A is 0, B is 1, ..., O is 14, P is 15? Wait, no: ord('A') is 65. So, for a digit 'A', ord(c) - ord('A') is 0 → 10 + 0 =10.\n\nSimilarly, 'B' is 1 → 11, up to 'P' is 15 → 25.\n\nSo, for a base a, the letters represent 10 to a-1.\n\nSo, the helper function is correct.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nImplementing all this.\n\nFirst, read a and b.\n\nThen, read c_str.\n\nThen, compute decimal_val.\n\nThen, decide whether to output in base b or Roman.\n\nImplementing the functions.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling uppercase vs lowercase letters in c_str. But according to the problem statement, c_str is in base a, which implies that it uses the correct case. So, in the code, we can assume that letters are uppercase. But if a user inputs lowercase, the code will not work. But the problem statement says that the input c is a non-negative integer in base a, so perhaps it's safe to assume uppercase.\n\nAlternatively, the code can be case-insensitive, but the problem statement probably expects uppercase letters.\n\nSo, in the code, the helper function will treat the character as uppercase.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\ndef char_to_value(c, base):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        return 10 + (ord(c.upper()) - ord('A'))\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input is given as the string c, which may contain letters. So, perhaps, it's better to process the letters as uppercase.\n\nBut in the sample input, the last example is 'A', which is uppercase.\n\nSo, the helper function can be written as above.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nRead c_str.\n\nCompute decimal_val.\n\nIf b is 'R', then convert to Roman.\n\nElse, convert to base b.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nline1 = input().strip().split()\na = int(line1[0])\nb_str = line1[1]\n\nif b_str == 'R':\n    target_base_is_roman = True\nelse:\n    b = int(b_str)\n    target_base_is_roman = False\n\nc_str = input().strip()\n\n# Function to convert a string in base a to decimal\ndef char_to_value(c, base):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        return 10 + (ord(c.upper()) - ord('A'))\n\ndecimal_val = 0\nfor ch in c_str:\n    val = char_to_value(ch, a)\n    decimal_val = decimal_val * a + val\n\nif target_base_is_roman:\n    def decimal_to_roman(n):\n        val = [\n            (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'),\n            (400, 'CD'), (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'),\n            (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'), (10, 'X'),\n            (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n            (1, 'I')\n        ]\n        res = ''\n        for (i, r) in val:\n            while n >= i:\n                res += r\n                n -= i\n        return res\n    print(decimal_to_roman(decimal_val))\nelse:\n    def decimal_to_base(n, base):\n        if n == 0:\n            return '0'\n        digits = []\n        while n > 0:\n            rem = n % base\n            digits.append(rem)\n            n = n // base\n        res = ''\n        for d in reversed(digits):\n            if d < 10:\n                res += str(d)\n            else:\n                res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n        return res\n    print(decimal_to_base(decimal_val, b))\n\nWait, but wait: in the else clause, the function decimal_to_base is defined inside the else. That's okay, but perhaps it's better to have the functions defined outside.\n\nBut in Python, functions can be defined inside other functions, but for efficiency, it's better to define them once.\n\nAlternatively, move the helper functions outside.\n\nBut for code submission, it's acceptable.\n\nTesting this code against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe first case:\n\nInput line 1: '10 2'\n\nc_str: '1'\n\nProcessing:\n\na=10, b=2, target_base_is_roman=False.\n\nc_str is '1' → decimal_val is 1.\n\ndecimal_to_base(1,2) → 1 → '1'.\n\nOutput is '1'.\n\nSecond case:\n\nLine1: '16 R'\n\nLine2: '5' → in base 16 → 5.\n\ntarget_base is R → output is 'V'.\n\nThird case:\n\nLine1: '5 R'\n\nc_str: '4' → 4 in base 5 is 4 → output 'IV'.\n\nFourth case:\n\nLine1: '2 2'\n\nc_str: '1111001' → binary 1111001 is 241.\n\ntarget_base is 2 → output '1111001'.\n\nFifth case:\n\nLine1: '12 13'\n\nc_str: 'A' → in base 12, A is 10 → decimal_val is 10.\n\ntarget_base is 13 → output 'A'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=2, c=16 → 16 in base 2 is 10000 → output '10000'.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=10, c='IV' → IV in base 5 is 4*5 +4 =24 → decimal_val=24.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, 'IV' is in base 5? No, wait, no: in base 5, 'IV' would be an invalid digit because I is 1, V is 5? No, wait, no. Wait, in base 5, the digits are 0-4. So, 'I' is 1, 'V' is 5 which is invalid for base 5. So, the input c is 'IV' in base 5, but that's invalid. But the problem says that the input is valid, so this scenario won't occur.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The helper functions are defined inside the else clause, but that's okay.\n\n- What about when the decimal_val is zero? Well, the problem states that c is non-zero, so the code doesn't need to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=3, c= '10' → which is 3 in base 3. So decimal_val is 3.\n\ntarget_base is 3 → output '10'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: a=16, b=16, c='FF' → FF in hex is 255 → output 'FF'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: a=25, b=25, c='P' → P is 25-10=15 → 15 in decimal.\n\nOutput is 'P'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, I think this should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another. The target base can be a standard numeral system or the Roman numeral system. The conversion involves parsing the input, converting from the given base to a decimal (base 10) number, and then converting the decimal number to the target base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the two integers `a` and `b`, where `a` is the source base and `b` is the target base. If `b` is 'R', the target is Roman numerals; otherwise, it's a standard base.\n2. **Convert to Decimal**: Convert the given number from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**:\n   - If the target base is a standard base, convert the decimal number to this base as a string.\n   - If the target base is Roman numerals, convert the decimal number to a Roman numeral string using specific rules.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef char_to_value(c, base):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        return 10 + (ord(c.upper()) - ord('A'))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'), (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'), (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res += r\n            n -= i\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    res = ''\n    for d in reversed(digits):\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\n# Read input\nline1 = input().strip().split()\na = int(line1[0])\nb_str = line1[1]\n\nc_str = input().strip()\n\n# Determine target base type\ntarget_base_is_roman = False\nif b_str == 'R':\n    target_base_is_roman = True\nelse:\n    b = int(b_str)\n    target_base_is_roman = False\n\n# Convert c_str to decimal\ndecimal_val = 0\nfor ch in c_str:\n    decimal_val = decimal_val * a + char_to_value(ch, a)\n\nif target_base_is_roman:\n    print(decimal_to_roman(decimal_val))\nelse:\n    print(decimal_to_base(decimal_val, b))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line contains the source base `a` and the target base `b`. The second line contains the number in base `a`.\n2. **Character to Value Conversion**: Converts each character of the input number to its corresponding integer value based on the source base.\n3. **Decimal Conversion**: Converts the entire input number from the source base to a decimal (base 10) integer.\n4. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: Converts the decimal number to a Roman numeral string using predefined rules for thousands, hundreds, tens, and units.\n5. **Base Conversion**: Converts the decimal number to the target base as a string, ensuring no leading zeros.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both standard base conversions and Roman numeral conversions, ensuring correctness and handling all edge cases within the problem constraints.",
