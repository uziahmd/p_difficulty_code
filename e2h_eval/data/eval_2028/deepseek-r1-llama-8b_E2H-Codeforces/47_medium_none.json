    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Neko does Maths\" and the task involves finding a non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple (LCM) of a+k and b+k is as small as possible. If there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest one.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, the problem gives two integers a and b. We need to find k ≥ 0 that minimizes the LCM of (a + k) and (b + k). Also, since LCM is involved, perhaps the difference between a and b plays a role here.\n\nWait, wait. Let's denote x = a + k and y = b + k. Then, x - y = a - b, which is a fixed value because a and b are given. So, for any k, x and y differ by the same amount. That means x and y have a fixed difference, but their values vary based on k.\n\nThe LCM of x and y can be expressed as (x * y) / GCD(x, y). So, to minimize the LCM, we need to maximize the GCD of x and y, because higher GCD leads to lower LCM for the same product.\n\nSo, our goal is to choose x and y such that their GCD is as large as possible. Since x = a + k and y = b + k, their difference is d = |a - b|. So, the maximum possible GCD of x and y is d, provided that d divides both x and y. Wait, no. Because x and y are a fixed distance apart, their GCD must divide their difference. So, the GCD of x and y must divide d, where d is the absolute difference between a and b.\n\nRight, so if d is zero, meaning a equals b, then x and y are equal for all k, so the LCM is x = y. So in that case, k can be zero. But that's a special case.\n\nSo, when d is not zero, let's think about how to maximize the GCD of x and y. Because the GCD has to divide d, the optimal scenario is when the GCD is as large as possible, preferably a divisor of d.\n\nSo, to find the best k, we can try all possible divisors of d, compute x and y for each, and see which one gives the minimal LCM. But wait, d could be up to 1e9, right? So trying all divisors might not be efficient enough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal k is related to the greatest common divisor of a and b. Hmm, maybe not directly. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother approach: Since x = a + k and y = b + k, their difference is d = |a - b|. So, x = y + d or y = x + d, depending on which is larger. Let's say d is positive, so a > b, then x = a +k, y = b +k. So, x = y + d.\n\nWe want to maximize the GCD of x and y. Since x and y differ by d, the GCD of x and y must divide d. So, to maximize GCD(x, y), we should make it as large as possible, which would be the largest possible divisor of d.\n\nWait, but how do we find the k that makes x and y share a large GCD. Let's think about it.\n\nSuppose d is the difference. Let's denote g = GCD(d, x). But since x = y + d, then GCD(x, y) must divide d. So, the maximum possible GCD of x and y is the maximum divisor of d such that x and y are multiples of that divisor.\n\nSo, the plan is to find the maximum possible g that divides d, and then find a k such that x and y are both multiples of g. Then, among all such g's, find the one that gives the minimal LCM.\n\nWait, but perhaps the optimal g is the largest possible, but sometimes choosing a slightly smaller g could lead to a better overall LCM. Hmm, maybe not. Because a larger g would imply a larger GCD, leading to a smaller LCM for the same product. So, perhaps the maximum possible g is the way to go.\n\nBut how do we find the correct k?\n\nLet me try to model this. For a given g that divides d, we can set up equations:\n\ny = b + k\nx = y + d = b + k + d\n\nSince x and y must be multiples of g, we have:\ny ≡ 0 mod g → b + k ≡ 0 mod g → k ≡ (-b) mod g\nSimilarly, x = y + d must also be divisible by g. Since d is a multiple of g (because g divides d), then x = y + d will be congruent to 0 + 0 mod g, so it's already a multiple of g.\n\nTherefore, for each possible g (divisor of d), we can compute the required k as (g - (b % g)) % g. Because k needs to be the smallest non-negative integer that satisfies b + k ≡ 0 mod g.\n\nOnce we have that k, we can compute x and y, and then their LCM. We need to find the g that gives the minimal LCM.\n\nWait, but why consider all possible divisors of d? Because the maximum possible g is d itself, but that's only possible if both x and y are multiples of d. But x = y + d, so if y is a multiple of d, then x would be as well. So, for example, if d=6, then if y is 6m, x is 6(m+1), so both are multiples of 6. So the GCD is at least 6.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|. If d is zero, return k=0.\n\n2. Find all divisors of d.\n\n3. For each divisor g of d, compute the required k such that (b +k) mod g == 0 and (a +k) mod g ==0 (since x = a +k and y = b +k, and x = y +d. Since g divides d, once x is a multiple of g, y is too.)\n\n4. For each such g, compute the k, then compute the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k). Keep track of the minimal LCM and the corresponding k.\n\n5. After considering all possible divisors, the minimal LCM is found, and the corresponding smallest k is selected.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where d is zero? Like when a = b. Then, for any k, the LCM is a +k. So the minimal is achieved when k is zero. So, in that case, output 0.\n\nBut for other cases, we need to proceed with the divisors.\n\nNow, the challenge is to generate all the divisors of d, including 1 and d itself. For each divisor, calculate k, compute the LCM, and track the minimum.\n\nBut for very large d, like 1e9, the number of divisors can be up to around 1000, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the steps for the code would be:\n\n- Read a and b.\n\n- Compute d = abs(a - b). If d is zero, output 0.\n\n- Else, find all divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g in the divisors, sorted in some order (like from largest to smallest), compute the required k.\n\n- For each g, compute k = (g - (b % g)) % g. Because (b + k) must be divisible by g.\n\n- Then, compute x = a +k, y = b +k. Compute their GCD, then the LCM.\n\n- Keep track of the minimal LCM and the corresponding k. If multiple k's give the same LCM, pick the smallest.\n\nWait, but wait: For each g, we have a certain k. But when g is a divisor, the k is uniquely determined. So, for each possible g, we can compute x and y, then their LCM.\n\nBut how do we know whether considering all possible g's will cover all possible k's that could lead to a minimal LCM? Because perhaps, the minimal LCM is achieved at some k that doesn't correspond to a divisor of d. But I think that's not the case. Because the maximum possible GCD is when g is as large as possible, which would be when g is the maximum divisor of d. So, perhaps the optimal k is determined by the maximum possible g.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, perhaps a certain smaller g could yield a better LCM because even though the GCD is smaller, the product x*y is much smaller.\n\nHmm, that complicates things. So, perhaps the approach of trying all possible g's and computing the corresponding k is the way to go, even if it's computationally feasible.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps again:\n\nCompute d = |a - b|\n\nIf d is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, collect all the divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g in the list of divisors:\n\n   compute k = (g - (b % g)) % g\n\n   compute x = a +k, y = b +k\n\n   compute current_gcd = gcd(x, y)\n\n   current_lcm = x * y // current_gcd\n\n   keep track of the minimal current_lcm and the corresponding k.\n\nOnce all divisors are processed, output the k with the smallest current_lcm. If multiple k's have the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where k is chosen such that x and y are as small as possible, but their GCD is not a divisor of d? Or perhaps, the minimal LCM occurs when x and y are co-prime, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, but for example, if a=6 and b=10, d=4. The divisors are 1, 2,4.\n\nFor each g:\n\ng=4: k = (4 - (10 mod4 )) mod4 = (4-2)=2 mod4 → 2.\n\nx=8, y=12. GCD is 4, LCM is (8*12)/4=24.\n\ng=2: k= (2 - (10 mod2)) mod2 = (2-0) mod2=0.\n\nx=6, y=10. GCD is 2, LCM is 30.\n\ng=1: k= (1 - (10 mod1)) mod1=0. x=7, y=11. GCD is 1, LCM=77.\n\nSo, the minimal is 24 with k=2.\n\nWhich matches the sample input.\n\nSo, in this case, the maximum g gives the best result.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=10. d=5.\n\nDivisors are 1,5.\n\nFor g=5: k = (5 - (10 mod5)) mod5 → 5-0=5 mod5=0.\n\nx=5, y=10. GCD is 5, LCM is 10.\n\nFor g=1: k= (1 - (10 mod1)) mod1=0. x=5, y=10. Same as above.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the output was 0. Oh right, because in that case, adding k=0 gives the minimal LCM of 10.\n\nSo, the approach seems to work.\n\nAnother sample input: 21 and 31. d=10.\n\nDivisors of 10: 1,2,5,10.\n\nFor each g:\n\ng=10:\n\nk = (10 - (31 mod10)) mod10 → 10-1=9 mod10=9.\n\nx=30, y=40. GCD is 10. LCM is (30*40)/10=120.\n\ng=5:\n\nk = (5 - (31 mod5)) → 5-1=4. mod5=4.\n\nx=25, y=35. GCD is 5. LCM is (25*35)/5=175.\n\ng=2:\n\nk=(2 - (31 mod2)) → 2-1=1 mod2=1.\n\nx=22, y=32. GCD is 2. LCM= (22*32)/2=352.\n\ng=1:\n\nk=0. x=21, y=31. GCD is 1. LCM=651.\n\nSo, the minimal is 120 when g=10, k=9. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the approach seems solid.\n\nBut wait, what about when d is 0? For example, a=5, b=5. Then, d=0. So, for any k, x=y. So the LCM is x. So, the minimal is achieved when x is as small as possible, which is when k=0. So output 0.\n\nAnother edge case: a=2, b=3. d=1.\n\nDivisors: 1.\n\nFor g=1: k= (1 - (3 mod1)) mod1 → 0.\n\nx=2, y=3. LCM=6.\n\nIs there a better k? Let's see. If k=0: LCM is 6. k=1: x=3, y=4. LCM is 12. So yes, 6 is the minimal.\n\nAnother case: a=4, b=6. d=2.\n\nDivisors: 1,2.\n\ng=2: k= (2 - (6 mod2)) mod2 → (2-0) mod2=0.\n\nx=4, y=6. GCD is 2. LCM is 12.\n\ng=1: k=0. x=4, y=6. Same as above.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nWhat about a=9, b=15. d=6.\n\nDivisors: 1,2,3,6.\n\nFor g=6: k = (6 - (15 mod6)) mod6 → 6-3=3 mod6=3.\n\nx=12, y=18. LCM=36.\n\ng=3: k= (3 - (15 mod3)) mod3 → 3-0=3 mod3=0.\n\nx=9, y=15. LCM=45.\n\ng=2: k= (2 - (15 mod2)) → 2-1=1 mod2=1.\n\nx=10, y=16. GCD is 2. LCM is (10*16)/2=80.\n\ng=1: k=0. x=9, y=15. LCM=45.\n\nSo, the minimal is 36 when g=6, k=3.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\n1. Read a and b.\n\n2. Compute d = abs(a - b). If d is zero, output 0.\n\n3. Else, find all the divisors of d.\n\n4. For each divisor g in the divisors, compute k as (g - (b % g)) % g.\n\n5. Compute x = a +k, y = b +k.\n\n6. Compute current_gcd = gcd(x, y). Since x and y are a+k and b+k, which differ by d, which is a multiple of g. So, the GCD will be at least g. Wait, no. Because when you compute the GCD of x and y, which is a+k and b +k, their difference is d, which is a multiple of g. So, the GCD will be a divisor of d, which is a multiple of g. So, the GCD is at least g.\n\nWait, no. Because x and y could have a higher GCD than g. For example, if d is 4, and g is 2, then x and y could be 6 and 10, which have a GCD of 2. Or, if x is 8 and y is 12, GCD is 4, which is larger than g.\n\nWait, but in that case, the GCD is a multiple of g. So, for the purpose of calculating the current_gcd, we can compute it using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nBut in code, it's easier to compute the GCD of x and y, then the LCM is x*y//current_gcd.\n\nSo, for each g, compute k, then compute x and y, then compute current_gcd and current_lcm.\n\nThen, among all possible g's, select the one with the smallest current_lcm. If multiple g's have the same minimal current_lcm, choose the smallest k.\n\nWait, but what if for a smaller g, the current_lcm is smaller? For example, suppose d is 12, and for g=12, the current_lcm is 360, but for g=6, the current_lcm is 180. Then, even though g=6 is a divisor, it might give a better result.\n\nSo, the approach of iterating through all possible divisors and computing the current_lcm is correct.\n\nNow, the key is to efficiently compute all the divisors of d.\n\nHow to compute all the divisors of a number?\n\nWell, we can factorize d into its prime factors, then generate all possible products of these factors.\n\nBut for d up to 1e9, this is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each i from 1 to sqrt(d), check if i divides d. If yes, add i and d/i to the list of divisors, making sure to avoid duplicates when d is a square.\n\nYes, that's manageable.\n\nSo, in code, function to get all divisors:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n\n        if n % i == 0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nWait, but for n=0? Well, in our problem, d is non-zero only when a != b, so n is >=1.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(d):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(d)) + 1):\n\n        if d % i == 0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(d // i)\n\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nWait, but in Python 3.8+, math.isqrt is available, which returns the integer square root.\n\nSo, that's good.\n\nOnce we have the divisors, for each g in the list, compute k.\n\nBut wait, for each g, the computed k is (g - (b % g)) % g.\n\nBecause we want (b +k) mod g == 0.\n\nSo, let's compute k as follows:\n\nk = (g - (b % g)) % g\n\nBecause if b mod g is zero, then (g - 0) mod g is zero.\n\nBut wait, let's test:\n\nFor example, b=10, g=4.\n\nb mod g is 2. So, k = 4 - 2 = 2 mod4 → 2.\n\nWhich is correct, because 10 + 2 =12, which is divisible by 4.\n\nAnother example: b=31, g=10.\n\n31 mod10 is 1. So, k=10-1=9 mod10→9. 31+9=40, divisible by 10.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, that formula is correct.\n\nOnce we have k, x = a +k, y = b +k.\n\nCompute current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n\ncurrent_lcm = x * y // current_gcd.\n\nThen, compare current_lcm with the minimal found so far.\n\nNow, the issue is that for each g, we're considering a specific k, but perhaps there exists a different k that leads to a smaller LCM, but isn't derived from any divisor of d.\n\nWait, but earlier reasoning suggests that the maximum possible GCD is limited by the divisors of d. So, the minimal LCM may be found via these g's.\n\nBut what if the minimal LCM is achieved when x and y are coprime (GCD 1)? Then, the g would be 1.\n\nIn that case, we have to compute that as well.\n\nSo, the approach of trying all g's, including 1, covers that possibility.\n\nThus, the code should handle all possible scenarios.\n\nNow, the next thing is to manage the case where multiple g's give the same minimal LCM. We need to pick the smallest k among them.\n\nSo, during the iteration, for each g, compute the current_lcm and k, and keep track of the minimal lcm and the smallest k that achieves it.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nInitialize min_lcm to a very large number, say infinity, and min_k to None.\n\nFor each g in sorted_divisors:\n\n    compute k = (g - (b % g)) % g\n\n    x = a +k\n\n    y = b +k\n\n    current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n\n    current_lcm = x * y // current_gcd\n\n    if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n\n        min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n        min_k = k\n\n    elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n\n        if k < min_k:\n\n            min_k = k\n\nAfter processing all g's, output min_k.\n\nWait, but what about the case where d is 0? We have to handle that separately.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nLet's write the code:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nd = abs(a - b)\n\nif d ==0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n\n    min_k = None\n\n    for g in divisors:\n\n        k = (g - (b % g)) % g\n\n        x = a + k\n\n        y = b + k\n\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n            min_k = k\n\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n\n            if k < min_k:\n\n                min_k = k\n\n    print(min_k)\n\nWait, but in the case where a = b, we have d=0, so the code correctly outputs 0.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 6 10 → d=4.\n\ndivisors are 1,2,4.\n\nFor g=4: k=2 → x=8, y=12 → GCD=4 → LCM=24.\n\ng=2: k=0 → x=6, y=10 → GCD=2 → LCM=30.\n\ng=1: k=0 → x=6, y=10 → LCM=30.\n\nSo, the minimal is 24, k=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 21 31 → d=10.\n\ndivisors are 1,2,5,10.\n\ng=10: k=9 → x=30, y=40 → LCM=120.\n\ng=5: k=4 → x=25, y=35 → LCM=175.\n\ng=2: k=1 → x=22, y=32 → LCM=352.\n\ng=1: k=0 → x=21, y=31 → LCM=651.\n\nSo, minimal is 120, k=9.\n\nSample Input 3:5 10 → d=5.\n\ndivisors are 1,5.\n\ng=5: k=0 → x=5, y=10 → LCM=10.\n\ng=1: k=0 → same as above.\n\nSo, min_lcm is 10, and min_k is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: a=2, b=3. d=1.\n\ndivisors: 1.\n\nk= (1 - (3%1))%1=0.\n\nx=2, y=3 → LCM=6.\n\nNo other options, so output 0.\n\nAnother test case: a=4, b=6. d=2.\n\ndivisors:1,2.\n\ng=2: k=0 → x=4, y=6 → LCM=12.\n\ng=1: k=0 → same as above.\n\nSo, output 0.\n\nAnother test case: a=9, b=15. d=6.\n\ndivisors:1,2,3,6.\n\ng=6: k=3 → x=12, y=18 → LCM=36.\n\ng=3: k=0 → x=9, y=15 → LCM=45.\n\ng=2: k=1 → x=10, y=16 → LCM=80.\n\ng=1: k=0 → same as g=3.\n\nSo, the minimal is 36, k=3.\n\nSo, code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what about when a is less than b?\n\nLike a=10, b=6. d=4.\n\nSame as first sample, but a and b swapped.\n\nWait, no, because d is absolute difference. So, a=10, b=6. d=4.\n\ndivisors are same as before.\n\nFor each g:\n\ng=4: k = (4 - (6%4)) mod4 → 4-2=2 mod4=2.\n\nx=12, y=8 → same as before.\n\nSo, the code handles it.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=7. d=4.\n\ndivisors:1,2,4.\n\ng=4: k= (4 - (7%4)) mod4 →7 mod4 is3. 4-3=1 mod4=1.\n\nx=4, y=8 → GCD=4 → LCM= 32.\n\ng=2: k= (2 - (7 mod2)) mod2 → 7 mod2 is 1. 2-1=1 mod2=1.\n\nx=4, y=8 → same as above.\n\ng=1: k=0 → x=3, y=7 → LCM=21.\n\nSo, minimal is 32, k=1.\n\nWait, but what if k=1 is the minimal. Is there a better k?\n\nWhat's the LCM for k=1: 4 and 8 → LCM 8.\n\nWait, no, 4 and 8 have LCM 8, not 32. Wait, what did I compute earlier?\n\nWait, x=3+1=4, y=7+1=8.\n\nTheir GCD is 4, because 4 and 8 have GCD 4.\n\nSo, LCM is 4*8 /4 = 8.\n\nWhich is better than 32.\n\nSo, what's wrong here? Did I make a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAh, right! So, for g=4, the k is 1, x=4, y=8. Their GCD is 4, so LCM is 8.\n\nWhich is better than the other g's.\n\nWait, then for this case, the code would output k=1.\n\nBut according to the code, when g=4, k is 1, and current_lcm is 8.\n\nWhen g=2, k is 1, x=4, y=8. So, same as above.\n\nSo, for g=4, the current_lcm is 8. For g=2, current_lcm is also 8.\n\nWait, but for g=4, the code computes current_lcm as 8.\n\nFor g=2, the code computes current_lcm as 8.\n\nSo, the minimal is 8, and the k is 1.\n\nSo, the code correctly picks k=1.\n\nSo, in the code, when comparing the current_lcm, 8 is the minimal.\n\nSo, the code should correctly output k=1.\n\nWait, but in my previous thinking, when g=4, the current_lcm is 8, and when g=2, it's also 8. So, the code would compare and choose the smaller k between 1 (for g=4) and 1 (for g=2). So, the min_k remains 1.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nCase where a=1e9, b=1e9. Then, d=0. Output is 0.\n\nCase where a=1e9, b=1e9 +1. d=1.\n\ndivisors:1.\n\nk= (1 - (b mod1)) mod1=0.\n\nx=1e9, y=1e9+1. GCD is 1. LCM is 1e9*(1e9+1).\n\nWhich is the minimal possible.\n\nAnother case: a=1, b=2. d=1.\n\nOnly g=1.\n\nk=0. LCM=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find a non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - Given two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), we need to find \\( k \\) such that the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is as small as possible.\n   - The difference \\( d = |a - b| \\) plays a crucial role because the LCM of two numbers is influenced by their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - The optimal \\( k \\) can be determined by considering the divisors of \\( d \\). For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), we can compute \\( k \\) such that both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) are multiples of \\( g \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute the absolute difference \\( d \\) between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n   - Generate all divisors of \\( d \\).\n   - For each divisor \\( g \\), compute the corresponding \\( k \\) and check the resulting LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\).\n   - Track the smallest LCM and the corresponding \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Considerations**:\n   - Generating divisors of \\( d \\) involves checking up to \\( \\sqrt{d} \\), which is efficient for large \\( d \\) (up to \\( 10^9 \\)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(d):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(d)) + 1):\n        if d % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(d // i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\ndef find_min_k(a, b):\n    d = abs(a - b)\n    if d == 0:\n        return 0\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    min_k = None\n    for g in divisors:\n        k = (g - (b % g)) % g\n        x = a + k\n        y = b + k\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            min_k = k\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n            if k < min_k:\n                min_k = k\n    return min_k\n\n# Read input\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(find_min_k(a, b))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n- **Difference Calculation**: It computes the absolute difference \\( d \\) between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n- **Divisors Generation**: It generates all divisors of \\( d \\) to consider potential values of \\( g \\).\n- **Iterating Over Divisors**: For each divisor \\( g \\), it calculates the corresponding \\( k \\) and computes the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\).\n- **Tracking Minimum LCM**: It keeps track of the smallest LCM and the corresponding \\( k \\), ensuring the smallest \\( k \\) is chosen if there are ties.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the optimal \\( k \\) by leveraging the properties of divisors and the relationship between LCM and GCD.",
