Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Valera and X\". Hmm. Valera has a square piece of paper with n x n squares, each containing a letter. We need to determine if the letters form an \"X\" according to certain conditions.\n\nWait, what's the condition for forming an \"X\"? Oh right, the teacher said that the letters on the square form an \"X\" if:\n\n1. Both diagonals have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) contain the same letter, which is different from the ones on the diagonals.\n\nSo my task is to read the grid and check these conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input. The first line is n, an odd integer. Then there are n lines, each with n characters, representing the grid.\n\nHmm, so for each grid, I need to check two main things:\n\nA. Check if both diagonals consist of the same character.\nB. Check if all non-diagonal cells have the same character, which is different from the diagonal's character.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Read the input correctly. Since the input is given as strings with newlines, I'll need to split them properly. Each row is a string, but perhaps I should process each row into a list of characters.\n\nWait, in Python, reading the input can be a bit tricky because sometimes the input is given as a single string with '\\n' separators. So I should read all lines at once, then split them accordingly.\n\nFor example, if the input is like '5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', then splitting by '\\n' would give me five lines (since n=5). Wait, no, wait, the first line is n, which is 5, then the next five lines are the grid. So in code, I can read all lines, then take the first line as n, and the next n lines as the grid.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the example input provided:\n\nThe sample input has three test cases. Each test case starts with a line of n, followed by n lines of the grid. So the overall input is structured such that each test case is a block starting with n, then n lines.\n\nSo in code, I should read all the input at once, split into lines, then process each test case.\n\nBut since this is a competitive programming problem, I think the input will be given via standard input as a series of lines, possibly with multiple test cases. Or maybe it's just one test case? No, the problem says the first line is n, followed by n lines of the grid. So each test case is independent.\n\nSo for each test case, I need to:\n\n- Read n.\n- Read the next n lines as the grid.\n\nOnce I have the grid, perform the checks.\n\nNow, how to represent the grid. Maybe as a list of lists, where each sublist is a row, and each element is a character.\n\nSo for each grid, I can extract the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal.\n\nMain diagonal consists of cells (i,i) for i from 0 to n-1.\nAnti-diagonal consists of cells (i, n-1 -i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nWait, wait, let's clarify the indices. If the grid is stored as a list of rows, each row being a string, then the cell at row r and column c is grid[r][c].\n\nSo for the main diagonal, r == c. For the anti-diagonal, r + c = n-1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for each grid, first, check if all cells on the main diagonal are the same character. Let's call this char_dia.\n\nThen, check if all cells on the anti-diagonal are also char_dia.\n\nIf both diagonals are the same, proceed. Otherwise, it's not an X.\n\nOnce that's confirmed, we need to check the rest of the cells. All non-diagonal cells must be the same character, which is different from char_dia.\n\nWait, but what if the non-diagonal cells have varying characters? Then it's invalid.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. For the given grid:\n   a. Extract main diagonal and anti-diagonal.\n   b. Check if all elements in both diagonals are equal. Let's call this common_char.\n   c. If the two diagonals are not the same, then it's NO.\n\n2. Now, collect all the non-diagonal cells and check:\n   a. Are they all the same? Let's say this is other_char.\n   b. Also, other_char must be different from common_char.\n\nIf both conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but wait. Suppose the non-diagonal cells have the same character, but it's the same as the diagonal. Then it's not an X. Because the condition says that the non-diagonals must be a different letter than the diagonals.\n\nSo both conditions must hold: diagonals same, non-diagonals same and different.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor each test case:\n   read n\n   read grid (n x n)\n   diag1 = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n   diag2 = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n   # check if diag1 and diag2 are all same\n   if diag1[0] != diag1[-1]:\n       print NO\n       continue\n   if diag2[0] != diag2[-1]:\n       print NO\n       continue\n   if diag1[0] != diag2[0]:\n       print NO\n       continue\n   common_char = diag1[0]\n   # now check the rest\n   # collect all non-diagonal cells\n   others = []\n   for i in range(n):\n       for j in range(n):\n           if i != j and i + j != n-1:\n               others.append(grid[i][j])\n   # check if others is all same and not equal to common_char\n   if len(others) == 0:\n       # only happens when n=1, but n is >=3 as per input constraints\n       # but in our case, n is >=3\n       pass\n   else:\n       if all(c == others[0] for c in others):\n           if others[0] != common_char:\n               print YES\n           else:\n               print NO\n       else:\n           print NO\n\nWait, but what if n is 3? Then the non-diagonal cells are the four corners except the four on the diagonals. Wait, no. Let's calculate for n=3:\n\nIndices are 0,1,2.\n\nMain diagonal is (0,0), (1,1), (2,2).\n\nAnti-diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0).\n\nSo for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,0)? Wait, no, let me see.\n\nWait, for each cell (i,j):\n\nif i != j and i + j != n-1, then it's non-diagonal.\n\nFor n=3:\n\ni=0, j=0: diagonal → include\ni=0, j=1: not → include\ni=0, j=2: anti → include\ni=1, j=0: not → include\ni=1, j=1: diagonal → exclude\ni=1, j=2: not → include\ni=2, j=0: anti → include\ni=2, j=1: not → include\ni=2, j=2: diagonal → exclude.\n\nSo for n=3, there are 6 non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo in code, for each i and j, check whether (i == j) or (i + j == n-1). If not, collect the cell.\n\nNow, the question is: what about when n is larger?\n\nSame approach applies.\n\nSo the code structure seems solid.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nTest Case 1: n=3.\n\nInput:\n\n3\nxpx\np xp\nxpe\n\nWait, no, perhaps better to refer to the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe third test case is:\n\n3\nxpx\npxp\nxpe\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nWhich corresponds to three test cases.\n\nLooking at the second test case:\n\nn=3, grid is:\n\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nSo the main diagonal is w, s, w.\n\nAnti-diagonal is w, s, w.\n\nSo both diagonals are 'w's and 's's? Wait no.\n\nWait main diagonal for this grid is:\n\nRow 0, column 0: 'w'\nRow 1, column 1: 's'\nRow 2, column 2: 'w'\n\nSo diag1 is ['w', 's', 'w'].\n\ndiag2 is:\n\nRow 0, column 2: 'w'\nRow 1, column 1: 's'\nRow 2, column 0: 'w'\n\nSo diag2 is also ['w', 's', 'w'].\n\nSo the diagonals are not all the same. Therefore, it's not an X.\n\nWait, but according to the sample output, the second test case outputs 'YES'. Wait wait, no.\n\nWait, wait no. Let me re-examine the sample input.\n\nWait, the second test case is:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\nRow 1: s w s\nRow 2: w s w\n\nWait, wait no. Wait, the second test case's input is:\n\n'3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw'\n\nSo after splitting, the grid is:\n\nLine 1: 'wsw' → row 0\nLine 2: 'sws' → row 1\nLine 3: 'wsw' → row 2\n\nSo the main diagonal is grid[0][0] = 'w', grid[1][1] = 'w', grid[2][2] = 'w'.\n\nAh! So diag1 is all 'w's.\n\nAnti-diagonal is grid[0][2] = 'w', grid[1][1] = 'w', grid[2][0] = 'w'.\n\nSo both diagonals are 'w's. So common_char is 'w'.\n\nNow, the non-diagonal cells: all must be 's's and not 'w's.\n\nLet's list them:\n\ni=0, j=1: s\ni=0, j=1 is included.\ni=1, j=0: s\ni=1, j=2: s\ni=2, j=1: s\n\nWait, wait, for i=0, j=1: yes, because i != j and i + j = 1 ≠ 2 (n=3, n-1=2). So it's included.\n\nSimilarly, i=1, j=0: same.\n\ni=1, j=2: i + j = 3, which is greater than 2, so yes.\n\ni=2, j=1: same.\n\nSo the non-diagonal cells are all 's's.\n\nSo it's a valid 'X'. So the output is YES, which aligns with the sample.\n\nSo the code should handle that correctly.\n\nAnother test case: the first sample input, n=5.\n\nThe grid is:\n\nx o o o x\n\no x o o x\n\ns o x o o\n\no x o o x\n\no o x o x\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly, but the code needs to process it correctly.\n\nWait, regardless, the code would extract the main and anti-diagonals, check their uniformity, then check the non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, the plan is solid.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling the grid correctly when n is odd.\n\n- Making sure that the code correctly reads all the test cases.\n\nWait, but the problem description says that the input is a series of test cases. So the code must process each test case as a block.\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines at once, then process each test case.\n\nBut when using input(), it might read until EOF, but for programming competitions, sometimes the code may have multiple test cases.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead all lines at once.\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nn_cases = ?\n\nWait, no, the problem says that each test case is a block, starting with n, followed by n lines of the grid.\n\nSo the code can process each test case sequentially.\n\nIn code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor each test case:\n    read n from the current line\n    read the next n lines as the grid\n    process the grid\n    output YES or NO\n\nSo in code:\n\nlines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\nptr = 0\nwhile ptr < len(lines):\n    n = int(lines[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        grid.append(lines[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n    # process grid\n    # ... do the checks ...\n    # print YES or NO\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nImplementing the checks:\n\nFunction to check if a list is all same:\n\ndef all_same(lst):\n    if not lst:\n        return False  # but in our case, lst won't be empty\n    first = lst[0]\n    for c in lst:\n        if c != first:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nBut wait, in our case, for the diagonals, the function should return True if all elements are same.\n\nSo for the main diagonal and anti-diagonal, we can check this.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndiag1 = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\nif not all_same(diag1):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    continue\ndiag2 = [grid[i][n-1 -i] for i in range(n)]\nif not all_same(diag2):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    continue\nif diag1[0] != diag2[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    continue\ncommon_char = diag1[0]\n\nThen, collect the non-diagonal cells.\n\nothers = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n            continue\n        others.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif not others:\n    # impossible since n >=3, so non-diagonal cells exist\n    # but for n=1, but n is odd >=3, so others can't be empty\n    # So no need to handle this case.\n    pass\n\nif all(c == others[0] for c in others) and others[0] != common_char:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in the sample input where n=3, the others list has four cells. Wait, let me recount for n=3.\n\nNo, for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 6 in total. Because:\n\nFor each row i, the columns j that are not on the diagonals.\n\ni=0: j can be 1, 2? No, j=0 is diagonal, j=1 and j=2?\n\nWait, for i=0, j can be 0 (diagonal), 1, 2.\n\nWait, but j=2 is anti-diagonal for i=0 (0+2=2 = n-1).\n\nSo for i=0, j=1 is non-diagonal.\n\ni=1, j can be 0, 1, 2. j=1 is diagonal, so j=0 and 2 are non-diagonal.\n\ni=2, j=0 is anti-diagonal, so j=1 is non-diagonal.\n\nSo total non-diagonal cells: 1 (i=0,j=1) + 2 (i=1,j=0 and 2) + 1 (i=2,j=1) → 4? Wait no, that's 4? But earlier thought was 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me list all (i,j) pairs for n=3:\n\ni=0:\n\nj=0 → diagonal → excluded.\n\nj=1 → not.\n\nj=2 → anti-diagonal → excluded.\n\nSo only j=1 is non-diagonal → 1 cell.\n\ni=1:\n\nj=0 → not.\n\nj=1 → diagonal → excluded.\n\nj=2 → not.\n\nSo 2 cells.\n\ni=2:\n\nj=0 → anti-diagonal → excluded.\n\nj=1 → not.\n\nj=2 → diagonal → excluded.\n\nSo 1 cell.\n\nTotal non-diagonal cells: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.\n\nWait, so earlier thinking was wrong. So for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo why in the sample input where n=3, the others list had 6 cells? Because in the second test case, the grid was:\n\nw s w\n\ns w s\n\nw s w\n\nWhich has for non-diagonal:\n\ni=0, j=1 → s\n\ni=1, j=0 → s\n\ni=1, j=2 → s\n\ni=2, j=1 → s\n\nThat's 4 cells. So in that case, others has length 4, all 's's.\n\nSo why in the sample input the second test case is considered YES.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 4.\n\nSo the code correctly collects them.\n\nAnother possible edge case is when n is 1, but the problem states n is odd and >=3, so no problem.\n\nAnother case: n=5.\n\nThe diagonals are 5 cells each.\n\nThe non-diagonal cells are 5*5 - 10 = 15 cells.\n\nThese 15 must all be the same, different from the diagonals.\n\nSo code handles that.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Off-by-one errors in checking the diagonals.\n\nWait, for i in range(n), j = n-1 -i. So for i=0, j is n-1. For i=1, j is n-2, etc. So for n=3, i=0 → j=2, i=1→j=1, i=2→j=0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother issue: when the grid is read as strings, but each row is a single string. So in code, grid[i][j] is the j-th character of the i-th row.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about if n is 1? Well, the problem says n is >=3, so no.\n\nWhat about if the diagonals are all same, but the non-diagonal cells have mixed characters.\n\nE.g., n=3.\n\nGrid:\n\na b a\n\nb a b\n\na b a\n\nDiagonals: a, a, a.\n\nNon-diagonal: all b's.\n\nSo it's a YES.\n\nBut if non-diagonal has a mix, like:\n\na b c\n\nd a e\n\nf g h\n\nThen the non-diagonal cells are not all same, so it's NO.\n\nSo code correctly handles this.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\nDiagonals are all 'x'.\n\nNon-diagonal cells are all 'o's. → YES.\n\nIf non-diagonal has a mix, like some 'o's and 't's → NO.\n\nSo code should be correct.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo grid is 5x5.\n\nMain diagonal is:\n\nrow 0, col 0: x\n\nrow 1, col 1: x\n\nrow 2, col 2: x\n\nrow 3, col3: x\n\nrow4, col4: x\n\nSo diag1 is all x's.\n\nAnti-diagonal is:\n\nrow0, col4: x\n\nrow1, col3: x\n\nrow2, col2: x\n\nrow3, col1: x\n\nrow4, col0: x\n\nSo diag2 is all x's.\n\nThus, common_char is 'x'.\n\nNow, the non-diagonal cells:\n\nWe need to check if all are same and different from 'x'.\n\nLet's look at the grid:\n\nRow0: x o o o x → non-diagonal cells are o, o, o.\n\nRow1: o x o o x → non-diagonal cells are o, o.\n\nRow2: s o x o o → non-diagonal cells are s, o, o.\n\nRow3: o x o o x → non-diagonal cells are o, o.\n\nRow4: x o o o x → non-diagonal cells are o, o, o.\n\nWait, wait no.\n\nWait, for each cell, if it's on the main or anti-diagonal, it's excluded.\n\nSo for each cell (i,j), if i==j or i+j ==4 (since n=5, n-1=4), it's excluded.\n\nSo for i=0, j=0: included in diag1.\n\nj=1: i !=j, i+j=1 !=4 → included.\n\nj=2: i+j=2 !=4 → included.\n\nj=3: i+j=3 !=4 → included.\n\nj=4: anti-diagonal → included.\n\nSo non-diagonal cells are j=1,2,3.\n\nFor i=0: cells (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) → 'o','o','o'.\n\ni=1:\n\ncells (1,0): j=0 → i+j=1 !=4 → included.\n\ncells (1,2): j=2 → i+j=3 !=4 → included.\n\ncells (1,3): j=3 → i+j=4 → included → anti-diagonal, so excluded.\n\ncells (1,4): j=4 → included in anti-diagonal.\n\nSo for i=1, non-diagonal cells are (1,0) 'o', (1,2) 'o'.\n\ni=2:\n\ncells (2,0): included.\n\ncells (2,1): included.\n\ncells (2,3): i+j=5 !=4 → included.\n\ncells (2,4): included.\n\nSo non-diagonal cells for i=2: (2,1) 'o', (2,3) 'o'.\n\ni=3:\n\ncells (3,0): included.\n\ncells (3,1): included.\n\ncells (3,2): included.\n\ncells (3,4): included.\n\nSo non-diagonal cells: (3,1) 'x'? Wait, no, original grid:\n\nLooking back, the third row is 'soxoo'.\n\nSo grid[2][0] is 's', grid[2][1] is 'o', grid[2][2] is 'x', grid[2][3] is 'o', grid[2][4] is 'o'.\n\nWait, for i=2, j runs 0-4.\n\nFor j=0: i+j=2 !=4 → included.\n\nj=1: 3 !=4 → included.\n\nj=3: 5 !=4 → included.\n\nSo non-diagonal cells: (2,0) 's', (2,1) 'o', (2,3) 'o'.\n\nSo, in the first test case, the non-diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,1) 'o', (0,2) 'o', (0,3) 'o',\n\n(1,0) 'o', (1,2) 'o',\n\n(2,0) 's', (2,1) 'o', (2,3) 'o',\n\n(3,0) 'o', (3,1) 'x', (3,2) 'o',\n\n(4,0) 'x' → wait no, because for i=4, j=0: i == j? No, i=4, j=0: 4 !=0. i+j=4 → yes, so it's on the anti-diagonal. So (4,0) is part of the anti-diagonal → excluded.\n\nWait, for i=4, j=0: i +j=4, which equals n-1 (n=5 → 4). So it's on the anti-diagonal, thus excluded.\n\nSo for i=4, j=0 is excluded.\n\nSo, for i=4, j can be 1,2,3.\n\nBecause j=0 is anti-diagonal, j=4 is main diagonal.\n\nSo for i=4:\n\nj=0: anti-diagonal → excluded.\n\nj=1: 4+1=5>4 → included.\n\nj=2: 6>4 → included.\n\nj=3:7>4 → included.\n\nj=4: main → excluded.\n\nSo for i=4, non-diagonal cells are (4,1) 'o', (4,2) 'o', (4,3) 'o'.\n\nSo, the non-diagonal cells for n=5:\n\nFrom each row:\n\ni=0: j=1,2,3 → 'o','o','o'\n\ni=1: j=0,2 → 'o','o'\n\ni=2: j=0,1,3 → 's','o','o'\n\ni=3: j=0,1,2 → 'o','x','o' → Wait, what is grid[3][1]? Looking back, grid for third test case is the third row in the sample input.\n\nWait, sample input's first test case:\n\nLines after n=5 are:\n\nxooox → row0: 'x','o','o','o','x'\n\noxoxo → row1: 'o','x','o','o','x'\n\nsoxoo → row2: 's','o','x','o','o'\n\noxoxo → row3: 'o','x','o','o','x'\n\nxooox → row4: 'x','o','o','o','x'\n\nSo for i=3 (row3), j=0: 'o'\n\nj=1: 'x'\n\nj=2: 'o'\n\nSo for i=3, j=0: included (non-diagonal)\n\nj=1: included.\n\nj=2: included.\n\nSo for i=3, non-diagonal cells are (3,0) 'o', (3,1) 'x', (3,2) 'o'.\n\nThus, in the first test case, the non-diagonal cells are:\n\nFrom row0: o, o, o.\n\nRow1: o, o.\n\nRow2: s, o, o.\n\nRow3: o, x, o.\n\nRow4: o, o, o.\n\nSo the collected others list is:\n\no, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, s, o, o, o, x, o, o, o, o, o, o, o.\n\nWait, that's a lot. But in reality, the others list for the first test case includes all non-diagonal cells, which are 5*5 - 10 = 15 cells.\n\nWait, wait: 5 rows, each with varying numbers of non-diagonal cells.\n\nWait, for n=5, each row contributes 5-2=3 non-diagonal cells? Or not?\n\nWait, no, for each row, the number of non-diagonal cells is (n-2) per row.\n\nBecause in each row, two cells are on the diagonals (assuming n is odd). For example, in row i, j can be i (main) and n-1-i (anti). So for each row, two cells are on the diagonals, thus the number of non-diagonal cells per row is n-2.\n\nSo for n=5, 5-2=3 per row → 5 rows ×3=15 cells.\n\nSo in the first test case, the non-diagonal cells have 15 cells.\n\nBut in the first test case, the non-diagonal cells include 'o's, 's', and 'x's.\n\nSo the others list will have mixed characters, hence the code will output NO.\n\nWhich aligns with the sample output.\n\nSo the code should correctly identify that.\n\nSo now, the code structure is correct.\n\nPotential optimizations:\n\nSince n can be up to 300, the maximum grid size is 300x300=90,000. Processing each cell is manageable.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases efficiently.\n\nNow, implement the code.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nImport necessary modules: sys for reading input.\n\nRead all lines.\n\nProcess each test case:\n\nRead n, then read n lines as the grid.\n\nCheck the diagonals.\n\nCollect non-diagonal cells.\n\nCheck if all non-diagonal are same and different from common_char.\n\nPrint YES or NO accordingly.\n\nThus, the code in Python:\n\nRead all lines into a list.\n\nThen, for each test case, process as described.\n\nHere's the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef all_same(lst):\n    if not lst:\n        return False\n    first = lst[0]\n    for c in lst[1:]:\n        if c != first:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nlines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\nptr = 0\nn_tests = 0\nwhile ptr < len(lines):\n    n = int(lines[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        grid.append(lines[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n    # Check diagonals\n    diag1 = []\n    diag2 = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        diag1.append(grid[i][i])\n        diag2.append(grid[i][n-1 -i])\n    if not all_same(diag1):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    if not all_same(diag2):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    if diag1[0] != diag2[0]:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    common_char = diag1[0]\n    # Collect non-diagonal cells\n    others = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n                continue\n            others.append(grid[i][j])\n    if not others:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        continue\n    if all(c == others[0] for c in others) and others[0] != common_char:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nTesting this code against the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nAfter processing:\n\nFirst test case:\n\nn=5, grid is as above.\n\nDiagonals are all x's. Non-diagonal cells include 'o's, 's', 'x's. So others are not all same → output NO.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nn=3, grid is:\n\nw s w\n\ns w s\n\nw s w\n\nDiagonals are all 'w's. Non-diagonal cells are all 's's. So output YES.\n\nThird test case:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nx p x\n\np x p\n\nx p x\n\nWait, no, third test case is '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe'\n\nWait, no, the third test case's grid is:\n\nx p x\n\np x p\n\nx p e\n\nWait, no, because the third test case's input is:\n\n'3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe'\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow0: 'x', 'p', 'x'\n\nRow1: 'p', 'x', 'p'\n\nRow2: 'x', 'p', 'e'\n\nSo diag1 is grid[0][0]='x', grid[1][1]='x', grid[2][2]='e' → diag1 is ['x','x','e'] → not all same. So output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nThus, the code works for the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all non-diagonal same as diag.\n\nE.g., grid:\n\na b a\n\nb a b\n\na b a\n\nDiag1: a,a,a.\n\nDiag2: a,a,a.\n\nNon-diagonal: b,b,b,b → all same as each other and different from a.\n\nSo output is YES.\n\nAnother test case: diag1 and diag2 same, but non-diagonal have a mix.\n\nE.g., n=3, grid:\n\na a a\n\na b a\n\na a a\n\nDiag1: a,a,a.\n\nDiag2: a,a,a.\n\nNon-diagonal: cells (0,1)=a, (1,0)=a, (1,2)=a, (2,1)=a → all a's. So same as diag → output NO.\n\nBecause the non-diagonal must be different.\n\nThus, code correctly returns NO.\n\nSo I think the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given n x n grid of letters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The letter \"X\" is defined such that both diagonals of the grid must contain the same letter, and all other cells (not on the diagonals) must contain the same letter, which is different from the letter on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the input values, including the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Check Diagonals:** Extract the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal from the grid. Check if all elements in both diagonals are the same.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells:** Collect all cells that are not on the diagonals and check if they all contain the same letter, which must be different from the letter on the diagonals.\n4. **Output Result:** Based on the checks, determine if the grid forms the letter \"X\" and print \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef all_same(lst):\n    if not lst:\n        return False\n    first = lst[0]\n    for c in lst[1:]:\n        if c != first:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nlines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\nptr = 0\nwhile ptr < len(lines):\n    n = int(lines[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        grid.append(lines[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n    diag1 = []\n    diag2 = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        diag1.append(grid[i][i])\n        diag2.append(grid[i][n-1 - i])\n    if not all_same(diag1):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    if not all_same(diag2):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    if diag1[0] != diag2[0]:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    common_char = diag1[0]\n    others = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            others.append(grid[i][j])\n    if not others:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        continue\n    if all(c == others[0] for c in others) and others[0] != common_char:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The code reads all input lines at once and processes each test case individually.\n2. **Diagonals Check:** For each grid, the main diagonal and anti-diagonal are extracted. These diagonals are checked to ensure all their elements are the same.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check:** All cells not on the diagonals are collected into a list. This list is checked to ensure all elements are the same and different from the diagonal elements.\n4. **Result Determination:** Based on the checks, the result is printed as \"YES\" if the grid meets the criteria for forming an \"X\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution efficiently handles the constraints and correctly identifies whether the grid forms the letter \"X\".",
