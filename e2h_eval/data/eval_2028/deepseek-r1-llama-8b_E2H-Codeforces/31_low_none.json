Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Cards.\" Hmm. Let me read the description carefully.\n\nSo, Vanya has some cards with numbers on them. Each number can be positive, negative, or zero, but their absolute value doesn't exceed x. Natasha hid all his cards, but he found n of them. He wants the sum of all the found cards to be zero. But right now, the sum isn't zero. So, he needs to find some more cards (from the infinite supply) to make the total sum zero. Our task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nWait, the initial set of found cards is n, but we can add any number of other cards (with values between -x and x) as needed. We need to find the smallest number of such cards that, when added, make the total sum zero.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Let's think.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this S. Then, we need to find a way to add some cards (each with value in [-x, x]) such that the new sum becomes zero. The minimal number of cards would be the smallest k where adding k cards can adjust the sum by exactly -S (since S + (sum of added cards) = 0).\n\nBut wait, how do the added cards contribute to this? Each added card can contribute up to x (if positive) or down to -x (if negative). So, for each added card, the maximum possible contribution towards reducing the sum is x (if we choose -x), but maybe it's better to think in terms of the required change.\n\nLet me rephrase: the current sum is S. We need to make the total sum zero, so the sum of the additional cards must be -S. Let me denote the required sum of the additional cards as T = -S.\n\nNow, each additional card can contribute at most x towards T. Because each card's value is at most x in absolute value. So, the minimal number of cards needed is the minimal k such that |T| <= k * x.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because each card can contribute any value between -x and x, but the sum of all added cards must be T. So, the minimal k is the ceiling of |T| divided by x.\n\nBut wait, since each card can contribute up to x towards the sum (in absolute terms), the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |T| / x.\n\nWait, no. Because if T is positive, each card can contribute up to x, so the minimal k is T / x, rounded up. Similarly for negative.\n\nFor example, if T is 5 and x is 2. Then, 5/2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards: 2+2+1=5.\n\nYes. So, the minimal k is the smallest integer such that k >= |T| / x. Since k must be an integer, we take the ceiling of (|T| / x).\n\nBut wait, is there any case where even if |T| is less than or equal to k*x, but the individual card values can't sum up to T? No, because we can have any combination. For example, if T is 4 and x is 3. Then, 4 /3 is 1.333, so k=2. 3 +1=4. So yes.\n\nSo, the minimal k is the ceiling of |T| / x.\n\nWait, but wait. What if T is zero? Then, no additional cards are needed.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute S, the sum of the found cards.\n2. Compute T = -S.\n3. If T is zero, output 0.\n4. Else, compute the minimal k where k is the smallest integer such that k >= |T| / x. That is, k = ceil(|T| / x).\n\nBut wait, let's test this against the examples given.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2\n\nThe sum S is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. So T is -2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the sum S is 2. So to get the total sum to zero, the additional cards must sum to -2.\n\nSo T = -2.\n\n|T| is 2. x is 2.\n\nSo 2 / 2 = 1. So k=1.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2\n\nSum S is (-2) + (-2) = -4. So T is 4.\n\nx is 3.\n\n4 /3 is approximately 1.333. So we need 2 cards",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his found cards (including the new ones) equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: Compute the sum of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Required Adjustment**: The target is to make the total sum zero. Therefore, the sum of the additional cards must be equal to the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Compute the Minimum Number of Cards**: Each additional card can contribute at most x towards reducing the required adjustment. Thus, the minimum number of additional cards needed is the ceiling of the absolute value of the required adjustment divided by x.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\ntarget = -s\n\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Calculate the minimal number of cards needed\n    k = abs(target) // x\n    if k * x < abs(target):\n        k += 1\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of any card), followed by `n` integers representing the values on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the found cards to determine the current imbalance.\n3. **Target Adjustment**: Calculate the required adjustment to make the total sum zero. If the current sum is positive, we need a negative adjustment; if negative, a positive adjustment.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: Use integer division and ceiling logic to determine the minimum number of cards needed. This ensures each card contributes as much as possible towards the required adjustment, minimizing the total number of cards needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging basic arithmetic operations and integer handling to ensure optimal performance.",
