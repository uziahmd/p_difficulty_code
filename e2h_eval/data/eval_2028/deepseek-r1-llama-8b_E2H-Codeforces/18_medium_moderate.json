The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Frog Jumping.\" Hmm. Let me read the description carefully.\n\nThe frog starts at position 0 on a number line. It can jump either +a or -b each time. For each x, f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach without stepping outside [0, x]. We need to compute the sum of f(i) from i=0 to m.\n\nWait, so for each i from 0 to m, we calculate f(i), which counts how many positions the frog can reach without going beyond i (or maybe exactly up to i). Then sum all these f(i)s.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the sample input first to get some intuition.\n\nIn the first example, m=7, a=5, b=3.\n\nFor x=0: the frog can't move, so only 0 is reachable. So f(0)=1.\n\nx=1: same as above, because any jump would take it out of [0,1]. So f(1)=1.\n\nSimilarly, for x=2,3,4, same as before. So f(4)=1.\n\nAt x=5: Now, the frog can make a jump of +5 to reach 5. So now the positions are 0 and 5. Wait no, wait—wait, the frog can also make multiple jumps. So from 0, it can jump +5 to 5. From 5, it can't jump back because that would be 5-3=2, which is within [0,5], but then from 2, maybe more jumps. Wait, let me think.\n\nWait, for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, and perhaps 2 (from 5-3). But wait, does that mean 2 is reachable? Because starting at 0, jumping +5 gets to 5. Then, from 5, jumping -3 gets to 2. So yes, 2 is reachable. And from 2, can we do anything else? Like, jump +5 again to 7, but 7 is beyond x=5, so that's not allowed. So for x=5, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5. So f(5)=3.\n\nSimilarly, when x increases beyond 5, like x=6, the frog can reach 0,2,5,6. Because from 5, adding 5 gives 10, which is beyond 6, but adding 3 gives 8, also beyond. But subtracting 3 from 5 gives 2, which we already have. So adding 1 (the next x) would allow 6, but how? Wait, maybe the frog can reach 6 by making two jumps: 0 →5 →2 →5 →... Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the frog can jump +5 from 0 to 5, and then from 5, jump +1? No, because a is 5 and b is 3. So the frog can only add a or subtract b each time.\n\nWait, no, the frog's options are fixed: from any position k, it can only jump to k+a or k-b. So the possible positions depend on the steps taken, but each step must stay within [0, x].\n\nSo for x=6:\n\nPossible positions include 0,5,2, but also from 2, can we jump +5? That would be 7, which is beyond 6, so no. Alternatively, from 2, subtract 3 to get -1, which is invalid. So 2 is the last position reachable from 5 in x=6?\n\nWait, but wait—what about from 5, can you jump -3 to 2, then from 2, can you jump +5 to 7 (which is beyond x=6, so no). Or from 5, can you jump +3? Wait, no, the frog can only choose between +a and -b each time. So in this case, a=5 and b=3. So from 5, the only options are +5 (to 10) or -3 (to 2).\n\nSo for x=6, the reachable positions are 0,2,5. Wait, but 5 is <=6, and 2 is <=6. Wait, but could there be other ways? Like 0 →5 →2 → ... nothing else. So f(6) would be 3? But the sample says f(6)=3. Then for x=7, f(7)=8.\n\nWait, why is f(7)=8? Let's think.\n\nAt x=7, the frog can jump +5 from 0 to 5, then from 5, it can jump +5 to 10 (which is beyond 7, so not allowed). Or, from 5, subtract 3 to get 2. From 2, subtract 3 gives -1, which is invalid. From 2, adding 5 gives 7, which is allowed. So 2 can reach 7. So now, the reachable positions are 0,2,5,7.\n\nWait, but that's four positions. Or maybe more. Wait, perhaps the frog can make multiple jumps to reach more points.\n\nLet me try enumerating all possibilities for x=7.\n\nStart at 0.\n\nPossible first jumps: +5 →5, or -3→-3 (invalid). So only 5.\n\nFrom 5: +5→10 (invalid), or -3→2.\n\nFrom 2: +5→7 (valid), or -3→-1 (invalid).\n\nFrom 7: +5→12 (invalid), or -3→4.\n\nFrom 4: +5→9 (invalid), or -3→1.\n\nFrom 1: +5→6, or -3→-2 (invalid). So 6 is now reachable.\n\nFrom 6: +5→11 (invalid), or -3→3.\n\nFrom 3: +5→8 (invalid), or -3→0.\n\nSo the reachable positions are 0,5,2,7,4,1,6,3.\n\nThat's 8 positions, hence f(7)=8.\n\nSo the sum is 1+1+1+1+1+3+3+8 = 19.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the challenge is to find, for each x from 0 to m, the number of reachable positions, and sum them all.\n\nBut with m up to 1e9, and a and b up to 1e5, we can't compute f(x) for each x individually. We need an O(1) approach or find a pattern.\n\nLet's think about the properties of the frog's movement.\n\nEach jump is either +a or -b. So the frog's reachable positions form a set that depends on the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b.\n\nWait, the key observation here is that the minimal step that can be achieved is d = gcd(a, b). Because each jump changes the position by a or -b, so the differences between reachable positions must be multiples of d.\n\nMoreover, since a and b are positive, the frog can only reach positions that are congruent to 0 modulo d. Because each step adds a or subtracts b, both multiples of d.\n\nSo for any x, the reachable positions are those numbers <=x, which are congruent to 0 mod d, and satisfy certain conditions.\n\nWait, but what's the structure of the reachable positions beyond the modulo condition?\n\nLet me think: the frog can reach 0, then from 0 can reach a and -b (but -b is invalid if negative). So from 0, the reachable positions are 0, a, 2a, etc., but also considering the possibility of moving backward via -b steps.\n\nWait, but the frog can combine jumps. For example, from 0, jump +a to a, then jump -b to a - b. Then from a - b, jump +a to 2a - b, and so on.\n\nThis suggests that the reachable positions form an arithmetic progression, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable positions are all numbers of the form k * d, where d = gcd(a, b), and they lie in some interval.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nAnother approach: consider that the frog can perform any number of +a and -b jumps. So the reachable positions are all numbers of the form s*a - t*b, where s and t are non-negative integers, such that the position is >=0 and <=x.\n\nWait, but s and t must be chosen such that the total steps don't take the frog outside [0, x].\n\nBut perhaps it's better to model the frog's movement as steps that can reach certain positions based on the combination of a and b.\n\nGiven that d = gcd(a, b), the minimal step is d. So all reachable positions must be multiples of d.\n\nSo the reachable positions are multiples of d, up to x, but only those that can be expressed as s*a - t*b, and such that s and t are non-negative integers, and the position is non-negative.\n\nBut how do we model the maximum reachable position for a given x?\n\nHmm. Let me think of it as the maximal position the frog can reach within x, considering all possible jumps.\n\nWait, but perhaps the key is to find the earliest positions the frog can reach, and determine the maximum reachable position, and then model how the count grows as x increases.\n\nWait, another thought: the frog can reach any position that is a linear combination of a and b, but considering that each jump can only be made once in each direction. Hmm, perhaps not exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps the frog's reachable positions form an additive subgroup of the integers, modulo d. So the positions are all multiples of d, and their count up to x is floor(x/d) plus some function based on whether x is large enough.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any position of the form k*d, where k is a non-negative integer, provided that it's reachable via some combination of a and b steps.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nWait, for example, in the first sample, a=5, b=3, d=1. So all positions are reachable, but only up to 7, but according to the sample, f(7)=8. Wait, no, in the sample, the positions are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Wait, that's 8 positions, but according to earlier analysis, the frog can't reach 1,3,4,6, etc. Wait, that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the frog can't reach all positions, even if they're multiples of d.\n\nWait, in the first sample, a=5, b=3, so d=1. So the frog can, in theory, reach every position, but due to the constraints of the jumps, it's not possible. So the initial reasoning that all multiples of d are reachable is incorrect.\n\nSo perhaps the frog can reach positions that are in a certain additive subgroup, but the exact structure depends on a and b.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's think differently.\n\nLet’s model the frog’s movement as a graph, where each node is a position, and edges represent possible jumps. The frog starts at 0 and can jump to k+a or k-b, but must stay within [0, x]. So for each x, the reachable positions are the nodes in the subgraph induced by [0, x].\n\nBut for m up to 1e9, it's impossible to model this for each x.\n\nWe need a mathematical approach.\n\nAlternative approach: for each x, the set S(x) is the set of reachable positions. We need to compute |S(x)| for each x and sum over 0<=x<=m.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the frog's movement can be modeled as a state that can be represented by its current position and the number of times it has jumped forward or backward. But again, this might not help directly.\n\nAlternative idea: For a given x, the reachable positions can be determined by the minimal steps needed to reach certain points, and the maximum reachable point.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum reachable point for x is the maximum k such that k = s*a - t*b, with s and t being non-negative integers, and k <=x.\n\nBut finding this for each x is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into cases based on whether a and b are such that the frog can reach certain positions beyond x, or not.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Since each jump is either +a or -b, the positions form a set of numbers that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b.\n\nBut since a and b are positive, and the frog cannot make negative jumps, the positions are limited to those that can be reached through some number of +a and -b steps, without ever going below zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find the minimal set of positions that can be reached, and then model how adding each new x affects the count.\n\nWait, but perhaps for a given x, the number of reachable positions is equal to the number of multiples of d up to x, adjusted by certain factors.\n\nWait, considering the sample where a=5, b=3, d=1. So for x=7, the frog can reach 0,2,5,7, etc. But according to the sample, it's 8 positions. Wait, but 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 are 8 positions. So in that case, for x=7, the frog can reach all positions up to 7.\n\nBut why? Because the frog can make jumps that effectively allow it to reach any position in that range.\n\nWait, perhaps when d=1, the frog can reach any position up to the maximum reachable point. So for x=7, the maximum is 7, and all positions from 0 to 7 are reachable. Hence, f(7)=8.\n\nBut in the sample, the frog can reach all positions up to 7.\n\nSo perhaps the number of reachable positions is x+1, but only up to a certain x_max, after which it remains constant.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, for x=5, the frog can reach 0,2,5 →3 positions. But 5 is larger than 5, but the positions are less than 5. Wait, no: 5 is included.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternative approach: For each x, the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, but also satisfies certain inequalities.\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is less than or equal to x, and greater than or equal to some minimal value.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of reachable positions for x is the number of integers k*d where k is in some range.\n\nWhat's the minimal and maximal k?\n\nWait, for a and b, the frog can make jumps that increase or decrease the position. So the minimal position is 0 (since the frog can't go negative), and the maximal is the maximum s*a - t*b <=x.\n\nBut how to find the maximal position?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum reachable position for x is the minimal between x and the maximum reachable via any combination of a and b steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum reachable position is the maximum s*a - t*b <=x, with s and t non-negative integers, and s*a - t*b >=0.\n\nBut finding this for each x is difficult.\n\nAn alternative idea: For a given x, the set of reachable positions is the same as the set of numbers that can be written as k*d, where k is a non-negative integer, and k is <= x/d plus some offset.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the second sample:\n\nInput: m=1e9, a=1, b=2019.\n\nSince a=1, the frog can reach any position by jumping +1 repeatedly. So for any x, f(x) is x+1, since all positions from 0 to x are reachable.\n\nThus, the sum is the sum of (x+1) from x=0 to m, which is (m+1)(m+2)/2.\n\nWhich explains the sample output.\n\nSo in this case, the answer is straightforward.\n\nAnother sample: m=100, a=1e5, b=1.\n\nHere, a is much larger than b. So the frog can jump +1e5, which is way beyond x=100, so it can't make that jump. So the frog can only make -1 jumps, but that would take it below 0, which isn't allowed. So the frog can't move at all. So f(x) is 1 for all x up to 100, leading to a sum of 101.\n\nWait, but the sample output is 101, which matches.\n\nSo the problem seems to have different cases based on the relationship between a and b and x.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to find for each x, the reachable positions, which depends on whether the frog can make a jump forward and backward, and how that affects the reachable positions.\n\nLet me think about the general case.\n\nLet d = gcd(a, b).\n\nThe frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and can be expressed as s*a - t*b, with s, t >=0, and the position >=0.\n\nBut how does this translate to the number of reachable positions for a given x?\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable positions are all the numbers of the form k * (a + b)/d, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem in terms of the minimal steps required to reach certain positions.\n\nWait, let me consider the minimal number of steps to reach a certain position.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find the minimal x_min such that beyond x_min, the number of reachable positions stops increasing.\n\nWait, perhaps for x < x_0, the number of reachable positions increases, and for x >=x_0, it stabilizes.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of reachable positions for x is equal to the number of integers k where k >=0, k <=x, and k is reachable.\n\nBut again, how to compute this.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of reachable positions for x is the number of integers k in [0, x] that are congruent to 0 mod d, and also satisfy k >= (a - b) * t for some t.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and is within the interval [max(0, x - (some function of a and b)), x].\n\nWait, perhaps the reachable positions start from 0 and can go up to a certain maximum.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's model the problem as a state where the frog can reach positions that are in the additive closure of a and b, but constrained within [0, x].\n\nThe additive closure is the set of all numbers that can be expressed as s*a - t*b, where s and t are non-negative integers.\n\nBut since a and b are positive, the frog can't make jumps that take it below 0.\n\nSo the reachable positions are the set { s*a - t*b | s, t >=0, s*a - t*b >=0, s*a - t*b <=x }.\n\nBut how to count the size of this set for each x.\n\nHmm. This seems challenging.\n\nPerhaps, instead of trying to model the reachable positions directly, we can find the minimal x where the reachable positions stabilize, and then compute the sum accordingly.\n\nLet me think about the maximum reachable position as x increases.\n\nSuppose the frog can reach a certain maximum position M. Once x is >= M, adding more x doesn't increase the reachable positions.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Because for x=M+1, the frog may be able to reach M+1, thus increasing the count.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum reachable position is unbounded as x increases. But in reality, for a given x, the maximum is min(some value, x).\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum reachable position is the minimal s such that s*a - t*b >=0 and s*a - t*b <=x.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nAlternative idea: Find the period after which the reachable positions repeat their pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, the number of reachable positions can be determined by the minimal steps required to reach certain points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each x, the number of reachable positions is the number of integers in the interval [0, x] that are congruent to certain residues modulo d.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for patterns in the sample.\n\nIn the first sample, the sum is 19, which is the sum of 1 (for x=0), then 1 for x=1, etc., until x=4, then jumps to 3, 3, and 8.\n\nSo the function f(x) increases until a certain point, then plateaus.\n\nHmm, perhaps the function f(x) increases until x reaches a certain value, and then becomes a linear function.\n\nWait, in the second sample, f(x) is x+1, which is linear.\n\nIn the third sample, f(x) is 1 for all x.\n\nSo perhaps the function f(x) is piecewise linear, with certain breakpoints where the slope changes.\n\nThus, the sum can be computed by finding all the breakpoints and computing the area under the curve.\n\nBut how to find these breakpoints.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think about the general case.\n\nLet d = gcd(a, b).\n\nThe frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and is >=0, and can be written as s*a - t*b for s, t >=0.\n\nSo the minimal step is d.\n\nNow, the frog's movement is such that each step changes the position by a multiple of d.\n\nSo, for a given x, the reachable positions are all the multiples of d that are <=x and can be expressed as s*a - t*b.\n\nWait, but how to count these.\n\nAnother approach: The frog can reach any position k*d such that k is in some set K.\n\nSo the number of reachable positions is |K ∩ [0, x]|.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the size of K up to x.\n\nBut what is K?\n\nWell, K is the set of all integers k such that k = s*a/d - t*b/d, for s, t >=0.\n\nBecause d divides both a and b, we can write a = d * a', b = d * b'.\n\nThen, the equation becomes k = s*a' - t*b'.\n\nSo K is the set of all non-negative integers s*a' - t*b', with s, t >=0.\n\nBut what's the structure of K?\n\nIt's the additive monoid generated by a' and -b'.\n\nBut since a' and b' are coprime (because d was the gcd), this forms the set of all integers that can be expressed as combinations of a' and -b' with non-negative coefficients.\n\nWait, but since s and t are non-negative, the expression s*a' - t*b' can only be non-negative if s >= t*(b'/a').\n\nBut this depends on a' and b'.\n\nHmm, perhaps the set K is all integers >=0 that can be expressed as s*a' - t*b', for s, t >=0, and s*a' >= t*b'.\n\nBut this is getting too abstract.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the minimal positive element in K is a' - b', but only if a' > b'.\n\nWait, no, because a' and b' are coprimes.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal positive element is 1 when a' and b' are coprimes.\n\nWait, but that's only if a' and b' are such that a' - b' is positive and can be achieved.\n\nWait, perhaps not. For example, a'=3, b'=2. Then 3-2=1, which is positive. So the minimal positive element is 1.\n\nIn that case, K includes all positive integers >=1, and 0.\n\nSo, for any x >=0, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut in the first sample, d=1, a'=5, b'=3.\n\nSo for x=5, the reachable positions are 0,2,5, which is 3 positions. Which is 5/d +1 =6, which doesn't match. So that suggests that this approach is wrong.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal positive element is not 1 always.\n\nWait, for a'=4, b'=5.\n\nThen, the minimal positive element would be 4-5 = -1, which is invalid. So the minimal positive element is 4 +5 - (something) ?\n\nNo, I'm getting stuck.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the minimal steps required to reach certain positions.\n\nThe frog can reach 0.\n\nFrom 0, it can jump +a to a, or -b (but that's negative, so invalid).\n\nSo the first reachable positions are 0 and a.\n\nWait, but if a >x, then 0 and a are both beyond x.\n\nWait, for x=0, only 0.\n\nFor x= a-1, only 0 and a are beyond x, so only 0 is reachable.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, a=5, b=3, x=4: only 0 is reachable.\n\nWait, but when x=5, 0 and 5 are reachable. Also, from 5, the frog can jump back to 2, which is within x=5.\n\nSo for x=5, the reachable positions are 0,2,5: three positions.\n\nSo the count increases from 1 (x=4) to 3 (x=5).\n\nSo, the count doesn't just depend on x, but on how the frog can navigate within x.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the problem using BFS.\n\nBut since m can be up to 1e9, BFS is not feasible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the reachable positions form a periodic pattern beyond a certain x.\n\nSo perhaps the number of reachable positions stops increasing after a certain x, say x0, and remains constant for all x >=x0.\n\nIf that's the case, then for x >=x0, f(x) is a fixed value, and we can compute the sum by adding the initial part and the fixed part multiplied by the number of terms.\n\nBut how to find x0.\n\nWait, x0 is the minimal x such that adding x doesn't allow any new positions to be reached.\n\nAlternatively, x0 is the maximal position that the frog can reach beyond which, adding any larger x doesn't give any new positions.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of reachable positions increases until x reaches a certain value, then it becomes a linear function.\n\nWait, for the second sample, f(x) =x+1, which is linear.\n\nFor the third sample, f(x)=1.\n\nSo perhaps the function f(x) is linear beyond a certain x.\n\nThus, the sum can be computed by breaking it into two parts: the part where f(x) is increasing, and the part where it's linear.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Find all the x where the number of reachable positions increases.\n\n2. For each such x, compute the contribution to the sum.\n\n3. After a certain x_max, f(x) becomes a linear function, say f(x) = c + k*x.\n\n4. Sum the contributions before x_max, and add the sum of the linear function from x_max to m.\n\nBut how to find x_max.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of reachable positions increases until x reaches the maximum possible position that can be reached, beyond which f(x) increases by 1 for each increment of x.\n\nWait, but that's only possible if the frog can reach every position beyond x_max.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's consider the maximum reachable position as x increases.\n\nInitially, the frog can reach 0.\n\nThen, when x >=a, it can reach a.\n\nWhen x >=a + b, it can reach a -b (if a >=b).\n\nBut wait, if a >=b, then from a, the frog can jump back to a -b.\n\nSo for x >=a, the frog can reach a.\n\nFor x >=a -b, the frog can reach a -b.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's model the problem using the concept of the \"base\" of the frog's movement.\n\nThe base is the minimal distance that can be achieved beyond which the frog can reach any position in increments of 1.\n\nWait, in the second sample, the base is 1, so the frog can reach any position >=0.\n\nIn the first sample, the base is 1, but the frog can't reach all positions up to 7.\n\nWait, no, in the first sample, the frog can reach all positions up to 7.\n\nSo perhaps the base is 1, meaning that once x is large enough, the frog can reach any position up to x.\n\nBut why in the first sample, for x=5, the frog can reach 0,2,5, but not all positions in between.\n\nAh, because the frog can't make jumps smaller than 1, but in the first sample, a=5, b=3, so the frog can make jumps of +5 or -3. So the base is 1, but the frog's movement allows it to reach any position beyond a certain x.\n\nWait, perhaps the base is the minimal step size, d.\n\nOnce x is at least d * k, where k is the maximal possible steps, the frog can reach all positions up to x.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's find the minimal x such that the frog can reach every position from 0 to x.\n\nThis x is called x_base.\n\nBeyond x_base, f(x) =x+1.\n\nBut when x <x_base, f(x) is less than x+1.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding x_base, then compute the sum up to x_base, and then compute the sum from x_base+1 to m as (m -x_base) * (x_base +1).\n\nBut how to find x_base.\n\nWait, in the first sample, x_base is 7, because beyond x=7, the frog can reach all positions up to 7.\n\nBut in the sample, for x=5, the frog can't reach all positions.\n\nWait, no. Because for x=7, the frog can reach 7, and from 7, it can reach 4, and from 4, it can reach 1, etc., allowing it to reach all positions up to 7.\n\nThus, x_base=7.\n\nSo, for x >=x_base, f(x)=x+1.\n\nSo for x=7, f(x)=8.\n\nThus, for the sum, the approach would be:\n\nCompute the sum from x=0 to x_base-1, where f(x) is calculated for each x, then compute the sum from x=x_base to m, which is (m -x_base +1) * (x_base+1).\n\nBut how to find x_base.\n\nx_base is the maximum reachable position that the frog can reach, beyond which adding any more x allows the frog to reach all positions up to x.\n\nBut how to find x_base.\n\nWait, x_base is the minimal x such that the frog can reach x, and for any x >=x_base, the frog can reach all positions up to x.\n\nSo, x_base is the minimal x where the frog can reach every position from 0 to x.\n\nBut how to find this x.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps x_base is the minimal x such that x is the maximum reachable position, and the frog can reach any position up to x.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x_base is the minimal x such that x is a multiple of d, and the frog can reach any position in [0, x].\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the first sample.\n\nx_base is 7, which is the maximum reachable position.\n\nThe frog can reach all positions from 0 to 7.\n\nSo, for x >=7, the frog can reach any position up to x.\n\nThus, for x >=7, f(x) =x+1.\n\nIn the second sample, x_base is 0, because the frog can reach any position as soon as x >=0.\n\nIn the third sample, x_base is 0, because the frog can't move beyond 0.\n\nSo, the general approach would be:\n\n- Compute x_base, which is the maximum reachable position beyond which, for x >=x_base, f(x) =x+1.\n\n- Compute the sum up to x_base, and then compute the sum for x >x_base as (m -x_base) * (x_base +1).\n\nBut how to compute x_base.\n\nWait, x_base is the maximum reachable position, and the frog can reach all positions up to x_base.\n\nThus, x_base is the maximum s where s can be reached, and for any k <=x_base, the frog can reach k.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps x_base is the maximal s such that s = s0 + t*(a + b), for some s0 and t >=0.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x_base is the maximum reachable position, which is the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and any x beyond that can be fully covered.\n\nBut again, I'm not making progress.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's model the maximum reachable position as a function of x.\n\nThe maximum reachable position M(x) is the maximum s such that s = s0 + t*(a + b), for some s0 and t >=0.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum reachable position M(x) is the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and then for any x' >=x, the frog can reach x'.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps M(x) is the maximum reachable position for x, and M(x) is the minimal x such that the frog can reach x, and for any x' >=M(x), the frog can reach x'.\n\nBut this seems recursive.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is as follows:\n\n1. For each x, the maximum reachable position is the maximum between the previous maximum and x.\n\nBut that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps for x=0, M=0.\n\nFor x= a, M= a.\n\nFor x= a -b (if a >=b), M= a -b.\n\nWait, no, because from a, the frog can jump back to a -b.\n\nSo for x= a -b, the maximum reachable is a -b.\n\nBut then, from a -b, the frog can jump back further if possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum reachable position oscillates as x increases.\n\nBut again, I'm stuck.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the maximum reachable position M(x) as the minimal x such that the frog can reach x, and from x, the frog can reach any position up to x.\n\nWait, perhaps this is the same as x being the maximal reachable position.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: The frog can reach any position beyond a certain point if the sum of a and b is such that it can cover all positions.\n\nWait, perhaps when a and b are such that a >b, then the frog can reach any position beyond a certain point.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, a=5, b=3.\n\nSo, 5>3.\n\nSo, perhaps after a certain point, the frog can reach any position.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, perhaps when the frog can reach x, and can reach x+1, then it can reach any position beyond x.\n\nBut this requires that the frog can make a +1 jump.\n\nBut the frog can only jump +a or -b.\n\nSo, unless a=1, the frog can't make +1 jumps.\n\nSo, perhaps the only way for the frog to reach all positions beyond a certain x is when a=1.\n\nWhich explains the second sample.\n\nWait, so perhaps the only case where the frog can reach all positions beyond a certain x is when a=1.\n\nBecause then, the frog can make +1 jumps, thus covering all positions beyond a certain point.\n\nIn all other cases, the frog can't reach every position beyond x.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, a=5>1, but the frog can reach all positions up to 7.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause in that case, the frog can reach 7, and then from 7, it can reach 4, 1, etc., thereby covering all positions.\n\nSo, perhaps in this case, the frog can reach all positions up to x.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can reach all positions up to x if the maximum reachable position is x, and the frog can reach x -b, x - 2b, etc., down to 0.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nHmm.\n\nI think I'm stuck, so perhaps it's time to look for hints or similar problems.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to the coin problem, where the frog can reach any amount beyond a certain point.\n\nIn the coin problem, the largest non-reachable number is known as the Frobenius number, which is (a*b -a -b) when a and b are coprime.\n\nBut in our case, the frog can also make negative jumps (subtract b), which complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the reachable positions are all numbers >=0 that can be expressed as s*a - t*b, with s and t non-negative.\n\nBut the maximum such s and t are constrained by s*a - t*b <=x.\n\nSo, for a given x, the number of such s and t pairs that satisfy s*a - t*b <=x and s*a - t*b >=0.\n\nBut solving this for each x is computationally expensive.\n\nBut perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be derived.\n\nWait, perhaps for a fixed x, the number of reachable positions is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the sum of the number of distinct positions a frog can reach on a number line for each position from 0 to m. The frog can jump either +a or -b from any position k, and it must stay within the interval [0, x] when considering each position x.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the frog's movement forms a periodic pattern based on the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. The positions the frog can reach are multiples of this gcd. Beyond a certain point, the frog can reach every position up to x, making the function f(x) linear.\n\n1. **Identify the Base Point**: The base point is the maximum position beyond which the frog can reach every position up to x. This is determined by the gcd of a and b.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: For positions up to the base point, compute the sum of reachable positions incrementally. Beyond the base point, the reachable positions form a linear sequence, allowing us to compute the sum using arithmetic series.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    m, a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    # If a is 0, but since a is positive, no need.\n    \n    if a == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Case 1: a < b\n    if a < b:\n        max_reachable = 0\n        steps = []\n        for step in range(m+1):\n            if step >=0:\n                steps.append(step)\n            else:\n                break\n        total = sum(steps)\n        print(total)\n        return\n    \n    # Case 2: a >= b\n    # We need to find all reachable positions up to x.\n    \n    # Compute the minimal step after which positions repeat.\n    # But this is complicated, so instead, we model the reachable positions as follows:\n    \n    # Let's compute the maximum reachable position M such that M is the maximum s*a - t*b <=x.\n    # However, this is not feasible for large x, so we find the pattern.\n    \n    # Instead, we'll consider that beyond a certain x, the frog can reach every position up to x.\n    # So, let's find the maximal reachable position where the frog can't reach every position.\n    # But perhaps the problem is easier by noting that when a=1, the frog can reach every position.\n    \n    # Now, the plan is:\n    \n    # For each x, the reachable positions are the numbers congruent to 0 mod d, and also satisfy certain conditions.\n    \n    # Wait, but I'm stuck.
