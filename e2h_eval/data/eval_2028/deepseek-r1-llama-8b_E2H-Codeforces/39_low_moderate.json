Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about arranging numbers on an N x N chessboard such that when a rook and a queen move according to specific rules, the rook ends up paying strictly fewer vuns than the queen.\n\nWait, let me break it down. The board has each cell numbered uniquely from 1 to N². The movement is determined by the rules: each step, the piece (either rook or queen) moves to the smallest possible unvisited cell that it can reach in one move. For the rook, it's moving in straight lines—so rows and columns. For the queen, it's any direction, including diagonals.\n\nThe process continues until all cells are visited. The number of times the rook has to teleport (which happens when all possible moves are already visited, but there's still at least one cell left) contributes to its vuns. Each teleportation adds 1 vun. The same applies to the queen as well.\n\nOur goal is to create a board where the total vuns for the rook is strictly less than that of the queen. If it's not possible, we output -1.\n\nHmm, so how do I approach this? Let's think about the movement patterns of the rook and queen.\n\nFor the rook, since it moves along rows and columns, the order in which it visits cells is going to be row-wise or column-wise, but with the minimal next cell selection. So the rook's path would tend to visit cells in a way that explores entire rows and columns step by step.\n\nOn the other hand, the queen can move more freely, including diagonally. So her path might cover cells that are more spread out, possibly visiting distant cells quickly.\n\nI need to model the movement of both pieces and count the number of teleportations each makes.\n\nWait, but for large N (up to 500), simulating this directly for each possible board arrangement isn't feasible. So I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the minimal case first. For N=1, the only cell is 1. Both rook and queen don't move, so their vuns are zero. But the problem says strictly less, so N=1 is a solution since 0 < 0 is false. Wait, no. Because 0 is not strictly less than 0. So maybe N=1 is not a valid solution? Or perhaps the problem allows it. Wait, the sample input given includes N=1, but the output is -1. Let me check the note.\n\nIn the note, the second sample is for N=4. Oh, wait, the first line says for N=1, both rook and queen can't pay any fees. So their vuns are zero each. So the rook's vuns are not strictly less than the queen's; it's equal. So for N=1, output is -1.\n\nSo, for N=1, the output is -1.\n\nWhat about N=2? Let's see. Let's try to arrange the numbers in such a way that the rook's teleportations are fewer than the queen's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to have the rook's path require fewer teleportations than the queen's. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to make the rook's movement as efficient as possible, minimizing the number of teleportations, while making the queen's path have more teleportations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps arrange the numbers such that the queen's path requires more teleportations than the rook's.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the problem is to find a numbering where the rook's total teleportations are strictly less than the queen's. So, how can the rook's teleport count be less than the queen's?\n\nMaybe if the rook's movement covers the grid without needing many teleports, and the queen's movement requires more.\n\nBut I'm not exactly sure how to model this. Maybe I should think about the structure of the board.\n\nAn alternative approach: perhaps arrange the numbers such that the rook can visit the entire board without teleporting too often, but the queen has to teleport more times.\n\nWait, but what's a teleportation step? It's when all accessible cells are already visited, but some cells remain. So the piece must jump to the smallest available cell, which adds a vun.\n\nSo, the number of teleportations is the number of times the piece has to make such jumps.\n\nSo, for the rook:\n\n- The initial position is cell 1.\n- From 1, it can move to any cell in the same row or column, choosing the smallest possible.\n- Suppose it's in row 1, column 1 (cell 1). Then, the next cell is the smallest unvisited cell in row 1 or column 1. So cell 2, which is either (1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to arrange numbers on an N x N chessboard such that a rook pays strictly fewer vuns than a queen during their respective movements. The solution involves understanding the movement patterns of both chess pieces and constructing the board in a way that minimizes the rook's teleportations while maximizing the queen's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - The rook moves along rows and columns, visiting cells in a step-by-step manner.\n   - The queen can move diagonally as well, which might lead to more complex paths.\n   - The goal is to arrange the board such that the rook's total teleportations are fewer than the queen's.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - For larger boards (N > 1), it's possible to construct the board such that the rook's path is efficient, minimizing teleportations, while the queen's path requires more teleportations.\n\n3. **Construction**:\n   - Place the number 1 at the top-left corner.\n   - Arrange the numbers in a way that the rook can traverse rows and columns efficiently.\n   - Ensure the queen's path is forced to take more detours, leading to more teleportations.\n\n4. **Special Case Handling**:\n   - For N=1, both pieces cannot move, resulting in equal vuns, so output -1.\n   - For N>1, construct the board to meet the required conditions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    N = int(input[0])\n    if N == 1:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n\n    # We will create a board where the rook's vuns are less than the queen's.\n    # One possible approach is to have the rook follow a row-wise traversal, while the queen's path is more convoluted.\n\n    # Initialize the board with 1 at (0,0)\n    board = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for __ in range(N)]\n    board[0][0] = 1\n    current = 1\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(1)\n\n    # Fill the first row and column in a way that allows minimal teleports for the rook\n    for i in range(1, N):\n        board[0][i] = current\n        current += 1\n        visited.add(current)\n    for j in range(1, N):\n        board[j][0] = current\n        current += 1\n        visited.add(current)\n\n    # Now fill the rest of the board in a way that the queen has to make more teleports\n    # We'll use a spiral-like pattern starting from the second row and column\n    row = 1\n    col = 1\n    direction = 0  # 0: right, 1: down, 2: left, 3: up\n    steps = [0, 1, 0, -1]\n    while current < N*N:\n        # Move as far as possible in the current direction\n        max_step = N -
