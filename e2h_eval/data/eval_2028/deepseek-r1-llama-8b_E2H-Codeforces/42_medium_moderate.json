    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Копирование файлов I\", which translates to something like \"File Copying I\". Hmm, the description says that we're dealing with two progress bars when copying files.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step. We have n files to copy in a specific order. Each file has a certain size. As we copy each byte, two progress bars update: one shows the percentage of the current file being copied, and the other shows the overall percentage across all files.\n\nThe goal is to find all integers from 0 to 100 (inclusive) that are shown on both progress bars at the same time during the copying process. Then, we need to output these numbers in increasing order.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is model how these percentages change as each byte is copied. Let's break down the problem.\n\nEach time a byte is copied, say the x-th byte from the i-th file, the first progress bar for that file will show floor(100 * x / a_i) percent. For the second progress bar, it's based on the total bytes copied so far divided by the sum of all file sizes. So, after x bytes have been copied in total (from all files), the overall percentage is floor(100 * (total_copied) / total_size).\n\nWait, but wait. Because the files are copied one after another, and within each file, every byte is copied sequentially. So, for example, if we're copying file 1, then file 2, etc., the order matters because the overall progress depends on the cumulative bytes.\n\nHmm, okay. So for each moment when a byte is copied, I need to compute both percentages and check if they are equal. But since the problem allows any moment, including between bytes, perhaps I can model this by considering each possible point where a byte is added and see what the percentages are.\n\nBut how do I model all possible points? Because between bytes, the percentages could change, but since the progress bars only update after each byte, the state changes at discrete steps.\n\nSo, the approach is to simulate the copying process step by step, tracking the current state of both progress bars, and record all the times when they are equal.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the input: n, then the list of file sizes.\n2. Compute the total size of all files.\n3. Simulate the copying process step by step:\n   a. For each file i in order.\n   b. For each byte x in the file (from 1 to a_i).\n      i. Calculate the current progress for the current file: (x / a_i) * 100, floored.\n      ii. Update the total_copied variable (sum of x's up to this point).\n      iii. Calculate the overall progress: (total_copied / total_size) * 100, floored.\n      iv. If the two percentages are equal, add it to the result set.\n4. After all steps, collect all unique percentages found, sort them, and output each followed by a newline.\n\nWait, but wait. The initial state is 0% for both. Then, as each byte is copied, the progress changes. So for each byte, we need to compute the two percentages and see if they match.\n\nBut also, when multiple bytes are added in a single file, like when a_i is larger than 1, each byte adds to the progress. So for a file of size 6, after 1 byte, the progress is 16%, after 2 bytes, it's 33%, etc.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, let's think about the variables I'll need:\n\n- total_copied: starts at 0, increments by 1 for each byte.\n- current_file_progress: for each file, as we copy each byte, it's (x / a_i)*100, floored.\n- global_progress: (total_copied / total_size)*100, floored.\n\nAt each step, after adding a byte, we calculate both and check for equality.\n\nNow, the challenge is to simulate this efficiently without exceeding time limits, given that n can be up to 100 and each a_i up to 1000. So, the maximum number of steps is sum(a_i) which can be up to 100*1000=10^5. That's manageable.\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, no: for each a_i, the number of bytes is a_i, so for each a_i, we loop a_i times. So for n=100 and a_i=1000 each, the total steps are 1e5, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the plan is feasible.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is given as a string, with the first line being n, and the second line being the a_i's separated by spaces.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nn = int(input().strip())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nassert len(a) == n\n\nCompute the total_size:\n\ntotal_size = sum(a)\n\nInitialize:\n\ntotal_copied = 0\nresult_set = set()\n\nThen, for each file in a:\n\nfor file_size in a:\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n        # Compute current progress for this file\n        current_file = (100 * x) // file_size\n        # Compute global progress\n        global = (100 * total_copied) // total_size\n        # Check if they are equal\n        if current_file == global:\n            result_set.add(current_file)\n        # Increment total_copied\n        total_copied += 1\n\nWait, but wait. Because for each x, the total_copied increases by 1. But wait, when you process the next file, the total_copied is already higher.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose I'm processing file i, which has size a_i. For each x from 1 to a_i, the total_copied increases by 1. So yes, inside the inner loop, after computing the current_file and global, I add 1 to total_copied.\n\nWait, but wait. The way the problem is described, each time a byte is copied, the progress bars update. So, for each byte, the total_copied increases by 1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the code inside the loop is correct.\n\nBut wait, when you process a file, the first byte is x=1, then x=2, etc. Each time, the current_file is 100*x//file_size, and the global is 100*(current_total)/total_size.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, but wait: the global is based on the sum of all previously copied bytes plus x. Because x is the current byte being processed. So, yes, the code correctly reflects that.\n\nSo, for each x in 1..file_size, we do:\n\ncurrent_file = 100 * x // file_size\nglobal = 100 * total_copied // total_size\nif equal, add to result.\n\nThen, total_copied += 1.\n\nWait, but when x is 1, total_copied was 0 before, so after processing x=1, total_copied becomes 1.\n\nWait, no. Because before processing x=1, the total_copied is whatever it was before entering this file. For the first file, it's 0. Then, for x=1, the global is 0. Then, after processing x=1, total_copied becomes 1.\n\nSo, for the first byte, the global would be 0, and the current_file would be 100*1//a_1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nOnce all steps are processed, collect all elements in the result_set, sort them, and print each on its own line.\n\nWait, but looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\nWait, each line in the output corresponds to a test case. Oh right, the input is multiple test cases, but the user probably made a mistake in the input format. Or maybe the input is a single line with multiple test cases separated somehow.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: the input is in the form of the following lines:\n\nIn the first line, n.\n\nSecond line, a_1 ... a_n.\n\nSo, for the sample, each test case is given as a separate input. So, in the sample input provided, there are four test cases.\n\nWait, but in the example, the input is written as ['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', ...], which suggests that the actual input is four separate test cases.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single line for n and the second line for the a_i's. Wait, no, looking back: the input is given as:\n\nIn the first line, n.\n\nIn the second line, the a_i's.\n\nSo, the sample input as written may not be accurate. Perhaps it's a typo, and the actual sample input is four lines, each starting with n, then the a_i's.\n\nBut in any case, our code should read n, then read the next line as a list of a_i's.\n\nSo, the code structure is correct.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement's sample input, it's given as a list of strings, each representing a test case. So perhaps the actual input is four test cases, each on separate lines.\n\nSo, the code will read each test case separately.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement's note, it says that the output is a list of strings, each being a test case's result.\n\nSo, the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem statement says that the input is:\n\nIn the first line, n.\n\nIn the second line, the a_i's.\n\nWait, no, no. Looking back:\n\n\"Input\n\nВ первой строке задано одно целое число n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — число копируемых файлов.\n\nВо второй строке заданы n целых числа a_1, a_2, ..., a_n — размеры файлов в байтах в том порядке, в котором они будут копироваться.\"\n\nSo, the input is a single n, then a single line of a_i's.\n\nSo, the sample input given in the problem is perhaps a representation of four test cases, but perhaps it's a formatting issue.\n\nWait, the sample input is written as:\n\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\nWhich implies four test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single n and a single line of a_i's.\n\nAh, I think that's a mistake in the problem statement's example. Because the sample output is four lines, each line being a test case's result.\n\nSo, perhaps the actual problem expects that the input consists of multiple test cases, each being a separate n and a line of a_i's.\n\nBut the problem statement says, \"the following is a competitive programming problem,\" which suggests that it's a single problem, not multiple.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem has multiple test cases, and the input is given as multiple lines, each containing an n followed by a list of a_i's.\n\nSo, for the sample input, there are four test cases.\n\nSo, in our code, we need to read each test case, process it, and output the result.\n\nThus, the code structure should be:\n\nRead lines until EOF.\n\nFor each line:\n\n   Read n.\n\n   Read the next line as a list of a_i's.\n\n   Process this test case.\n\n   Compute and output the result.\n\nSo, in Python, we can read all lines, filter out empty lines, and process each pair of n and a list.\n\nBut perhaps the code can read until there's no more input.\n\nAlternatively, for the purposes of handling the sample input correctly, perhaps the code should process each test case in the input, regardless of how it's structured.\n\nWait, but the problem statement's sample input shows four test cases, each with their own n and a_i's. So, the code should process each such case.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nRead n from the input.\n\nRead the next line, split into a_i's.\n\nProcess this test case.\n\nPrint the output for this test case.\n\nThen, read the next n and a_i's, and so on.\n\nBut in practice, in programming competitions, sometimes the input is read all at once, and then processed.\n\nSo, in Python, perhaps the code can read all lines, ignoring any empty ones, and process each pair of n and a_i's.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nidx = 0\n\nresults = []\n\nwhile idx < len(lines):\n\n    n = int(lines[idx])\n\n    idx +=1\n\n    a_str = lines[idx]\n\n    a = list(map(int, a_str.split()))\n\n    idx +=1\n\n    # process the test case\n\n    # compute and add to results\n\n    # then, output the required percentages\n\nSo, for each test case, after processing, we collect the output string, which is the sorted list of percentages, each followed by a newline.\n\nWait, but the output in the sample shows each test case's output as a line, but in the sample input, each test case is on a separate line.\n\nWait, no, the sample input is four test cases, each as a separate line in the input. So, the output is four lines, each being the result for a test case.\n\nSo, the code must process each test case, outputting each result on a separate line.\n\nSo, the code is correct as outlined.\n\nNow, let's think about the simulation again.\n\nLet me consider the first sample input, which is:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=1, a=[6]\n\nSo, the total size is 6.\n\nWe process the file of size 6.\n\nx runs from 1 to 6.\n\nEach step:\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_file = (100*1)//6 = 16\n\nglobal = (1)//6 *100 = 0\n\nso, 16 !=0 → not added.\n\nx=2:\n\ncurrent_file = 33\n\nglobal= (2//6)*100=33?\n\nWait, 2/6 is 0.333..., multiplied by 100 is 33.333... so floored to 33.\n\nSo, current_file is 33, global is 33 → add 33.\n\nSimilarly, for x=3: current_file is 50, global is 50 (3/6 is 0.5 → 50%).\n\nSo, 50 is added.\n\nx=4: 66 vs 66.\n\nx=5: 83 vs 83.\n\nx=6: 100 vs 100.\n\nSo, the result for this test case is 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nBut wait, in the simulation, the initial state is 0% for both. So, at the very beginning, before any copying, both are 0.\n\nSo, 0 is included.\n\nSo, the output for this test case is 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nWhich matches the first line of the sample output.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=2, a=[100,500]\n\nTotal size is 600.\n\nProcessing first file, 100 bytes.\n\nx runs 1-100.\n\nAfter each x:\n\ncurrent_file is 100*x//100 = x.\n\nglobal is 100*(x)/600 = (x*100)/600 = x/6 → floored.\n\nSo, for x=1: current_file 1, global 0 → not equal.\n\nx=6: current 6, global 6/6*100=100 → 6 vs 100? No.\n\nWait, wait:\n\nWait, when processing the first file, each x is from 1 to 100.\n\nFor each x, the global is (x) / 600 * 100 → x*100/600 = (x/6) → floored.\n\nSo, for x=6: 6/600 *100 = 1 → 1%.\n\ncurrent_file is 6 → 6% ≠ 1% → no.\n\nWhen does current_file equal global?\n\nLooking for x where x == floor( (x * 100) / 600 )\n\nHmm, but x is from 1 to 100.\n\nWait, let's think about when x equals floor( (x*100)/600 )\n\nWait, for x=0, yes.\n\nWait, when x=0, both are 0.\n\nBut during the first file, x starts at 1.\n\nWait, when does x equal floor(x * 100 / 600)?\n\nLet's compute for x=95:\n\nfloor(95 * 100 /600 ) = 15.833 → 15.\n\nIs 95 ==15? No.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps in the second test case, the output is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nHow?\n\nWait, perhaps after the first file is completely copied, the global is 100%, so both progress bars are 100.\n\nBut during the second file's copying, as we copy each byte, the global progress increases beyond 100.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the progress bars are updated after each byte. So, when the first file is done, the global is 100%, and the second file's progress is zero.\n\nSo, during the second file's copying, each byte adds 1 to the total_copied (but wait, no, because total_copied is the sum of all bytes processed so far, including both files. So, after the first file, total_copied is 100, then during the second file, x runs from 1 to 500, adding 500 to total_copied, making it 600.\n\nWait, no. Because total_copied is incremented each time a byte is processed, regardless of which file.\n\nSo, for the first file, after 100 bytes, total_copied is 100.\n\nThen, for the second file, each byte adds 1 to total_copied, making it 101, 102, etc., up to 600.\n\nSo, when processing the second file, the global is 100*(total_copied)/600.\n\nSo, during the second file's processing:\n\nx=1: total_copied=101.\n\nglobal = 101*100 /600 = 16.833 → 16.\n\ncurrent_file is 1*100/500=0.2 → 0.\n\nSo, 0 vs 16: not equal.\n\nx=95: total_copied=100 + 95 = 195.\n\nglobal = 195*100/600=32.5 → 32.\n\ncurrent_file is 95*100/500=19 → 19. So, 19 !=32.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps during the second file's processing, the global is 100 * (100 + x) /600.\n\nBecause the first file contributes 100 bytes, and the second contributes x bytes.\n\nSo, for x in 1..500:\n\nglobal = (100 + x) * 100 /600.\n\nWhich is (100 +x)*100 /600.\n\nWe can compute for which x, current_file (x*100/500) equals this value.\n\nSo, current_file is (x * 100)/500 = x/5.\n\nWe need x/5 == floor( (100 +x)*100 /600 ).\n\nLet me compute:\n\n(100 +x)*100 /600 = (100 +x)* (5/3) → 500/3 + (5x)/3 → approximately 166.666 + 1.666x.\n\nWait, but we have to take the floor of this.\n\nSo, for x in 1..500:\n\nx/5 = floor( (100 +x)*100 /600 )\n\nLet me see when this holds.\n\nLet me compute for x=95:\n\ncurrent_file = 95/5=19.\n\nglobal = (195)*100/600 = 32.5 → 32.\n\n19 !=32.\n\nx=96:\n\ncurrent_file=96/5=19.2 → 19.\n\nglobal=(196*100)/600 = 32.666 →32.\n\nStill not equal.\n\nx=97: 97/5=19.4 →19.\n\nglobal=(197*100)/600=32.833→32.\n\nNo.\n\nx=98: 98/5=19.6 →19.\n\nglobal=198*100/600=33.\n\nSo, 19 vs33: no.\n\nx=99: 99/5=19.8 →19.\n\nglobal=199*100/600=33.166→33.\n\nNo.\n\nx=100: 100/5=20.\n\nglobal=200*100/600=33.333→33.\n\n20 !=33.\n\nx=101: 101/5=20.2→20.\n\nglobal=201*100/600=33.5→33.\n\nNo.\n\nx=132: 132/5=26.4→26.\n\nglobal=232*100/600=38.666→38.\n\nNo.\n\nx=150: 150/5=30.\n\nglobal=250*100/600=41.666→41.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the only times when both are equal are when the global is 95, 96, 97, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps when the second file is being processed, and the global reaches 95% or higher, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output comes from the second file's processing when the global is 95, 96, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps when the second file is being processed, the global is 95, but the current_file is 0.\n\nNo, because current_file is x/5, which for x=5 is 1, for x=10 is 2, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps when the global is 95, the current_file is 19 (x=95), but 19 is not equal to 95.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let's look at the sample output for this test case: 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nSo, 0 is present, and then 95,96, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps during the second file's processing, when the global is 95, but the current_file is 0. Or maybe during some other time.\n\nWait, perhaps when the second file is being processed, and the global is 95, the current_file is 0, but that's not equal.\n\nBut perhaps when the global is 95, the current_file is also 95.\n\nBut x is 95 → current_file is 19, which is not 95.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that the first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file, which is the x-th byte of the i-th file. It's calculated as floor(100 * x / a_i).\n\nThe second progress bar is the overall percentage, which is floor(100 * (sum of all bytes copied so far) / total_size).\n\nSo, during the processing of the second file, each byte x adds to the sum, thus affecting the global.\n\nSo, the question is, for each x in the second file, whether the current_file (x/5) equals the global (100*(100 +x)/600, floored).\n\nWe need to find x where x/5 == floor( (100 +x)*100 /600 )\n\nLet's compute for x=95:\n\nx/5 = 19.\n\n(100+95)*100 /600 = 195*100/600= 195000/600= 325 → 325/100=3.25, wait no, wait: 195*100 is 19500, divided by 600 is 32.5 → floor is 32.\n\nSo, 19 !=32.\n\nx=96:\n\n96/5=19.2 →19.\n\n(196)*100/600= 19600/600= 32.666 →32.\n\nNo.\n\nx=97: 97/5=19.4→19.\n\n197*100=19700/600=32.833→32.\n\nNo.\n\nx=98: 98/5=19.6→19.\n\n198*100=19800/600=33 →33.\n\nSo, 19 vs33: no.\n\nx=99: 99/5=19.8→19.\n\n199*100=19900/600=33.166→33.\n\nNo.\n\nx=100: 20.\n\n200*100=20000/600=33.333→33.\n\nNo.\n\nx=101: 20.2→20.\n\n201*100=20100/600=33.5→33.\n\nNo.\n\nx=105: 21.\n\n205*100=20500/600=34.166→34.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps when the global is 95%, which is 95.\n\nSo, 100*(sum) /600 =95.\n\nsum = (95 * 600)/100 = 570.\n\nSo, sum is 570 bytes.\n\nBut sum is 100 (from first file) + x (from second file) =570 →x=470.\n\nSo, for x=470:\n\ncurrent_file =470/5=94 →94.\n\nglobal: (100+470)*100 /600 =570*100/600=95 →95.\n\nSo, 94 !=95.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, but maybe when the global is 95, the current_file is 95.\n\nBut x=475: 475/5=95.\n\nsum = 100 +475=575.\n\nglobal=575*100/600=95.833→95.\n\nSo, current_file is 95, global is95 → yes.\n\nSo, at x=475, current_file is 95, global is95.\n\nSo, 95 is added.\n\nSimilarly, when x=476:\n\nsum=576.\n\nglobal=576*100/600=96 →96.\n\ncurrent_file=476/5=95.2→95.\n\nNo.\n\nx=477: sum=577 →577*100/600=96.166→96.\n\ncurrent_file=95.4→95.\n\nNo.\n\nx=478: sum=578 →578*100/600=96.333→96.\n\ncurrent_file=95.6→95.\n\nNo.\n\nx=479: sum=579 →579*100/600=96.5→96.\n\ncurrent_file=95.8→95.\n\nNo.\n\nx=480: sum=580 →580*100/600=96.666→96.\n\ncurrent_file=480/5=96.\n\nSo, current_file is 96, global is96 → yes.\n\nSo, 96 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for x=481: current_file=96.2→96, global=581*100/600=96.833→96.\n\n96=96 → added.\n\nAnd so on, until x=485: sum=585 →585*100/600=97.5→97.\n\ncurrent_file=485/5=97.\n\nSo, 97 is added.\n\nThis continues until x=495: sum=595 →595*100/600=99.166→99.\n\ncurrent_file=495/5=99.\n\nSo, 99 is added.\n\nx=496: sum=596 →596*100/600=99.333→99.\n\ncurrent_file=99.2→99.\n\nAdded.\n\nx=497: sum=597 →597*100/600=99.5→99.\n\ncurrent_file=99.4→99.\n\nAdded.\n\nx=498: sum=598 →598*100/600=99.666→99.\n\ncurrent_file=99.6→99.\n\nAdded.\n\nx=499: sum=599 →599*100/600=99.833→99.\n\ncurrent_file=99.8→99.\n\nAdded.\n\nx=500: sum=600 →600*100/600=100.\n\ncurrent_file=500/5=100.\n\nSo, 100 is added.\n\nSo, in this test case, the result is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo, the code correctly captures these cases.\n\nTherefore, the code needs to simulate each byte, calculate the two progress bars, and record when they match.\n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: n=1, a=[1]. So, one file of 1 byte.\n\nSimulate:\n\nx=1: current_file=100, global=100.\n\nSo, 100 is added.\n\nBut also, 0 is present initially.\n\nSo, output is 0,100.\n\nWait, but according to the code, 0 is added because it's the initial state. So, the output will have 0 and 100.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, a=[1000]. So, the progress bar for the file increases each byte, and the global also increases.\n\nAt each step, current_file = 100 * x / 1000.\n\nGlobal = 100 * x / 1000.\n\nSo, for all x, current_file == global.\n\nSo, all percentages from 0 to 100 will be present, except perhaps some in between.\n\nWait, but wait: when x is 0, both are 0. Then, after x=1, 0.1% → 0.\n\nWait, because floor(0.1) is 0.\n\nSo, for x=1, current_file is 0, global is 0.\n\nSo, 0 is added again, but it's the same as the initial state.\n\nWait, but in the code, for x=1, current_file is 0 (since 100*1//1000=0), global is 0 (since 1*100/1000=0.1 → floor is 0). So, 0 is added again.\n\nBut in the result_set, duplicates are ignored because it's a set.\n\nSo, in the end, all percentages that are achievable during the process will be in the set.\n\nWait, but for a single file of 1000 bytes, the code will process x=1 to 1000.\n\nEach x will have current_file = x*100//1000 and global = x*100//1000.\n\nSo, for x=1, current_file is 0, global is 0 → added.\n\nx=2: 0 vs0.\n\nx=3:0 vs0.\n\n...\n\nx=999: 99.9 →99, global 99.9→99.\n\nx=1000:100, global 100.\n\nSo, in this case, all percentages from 0 to 100 are covered.\n\nSo, the output is 0,1,2,...,100.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the code doesn't capture every integer.\n\nWait, no, because for x=1, the current_file is 0, same as global. So, 0 is added.\n\nx=2:0, same as above.\n\nWait, but in reality, the current_file and global will only change when x is a multiple of 10.\n\nBecause 100 *x /1000 = 10x → when x increases by 1, current_file increases by 1 only when x is a multiple of 10.\n\nWait, no. For x=1, 100*1/1000=0.1 →0.\n\nx=10: 100*10/1000=10 →10.\n\nx=11: 11.\n\nSo, for x=1, 0; x=2, 0; ... x=10 →10.\n\nSo, for x=1 to 9, current_file is 0; x=10, current is10.\n\nSo, the global progresses as x increases.\n\nWait, but the global is x*100/1000 = x/10 → e.g., x=1: 0.1 →0.\n\nx=10:10.\n\nSo, for x=1: current 0, global 0 → add 0.\n\nx=2: same.\n\n...\n\nx=10: current 10, global 10 → add 10.\n\nx=11: current 11, global 11 → add 11.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThus, for this case, every x will have current_file equal to global, so every integer from 0 to 100 will be added.\n\nSo, the output is 0,1,2,...,100.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, a=[1,1].\n\nTotal size is 2.\n\nProcessing first file, x=1:\n\ncurrent_file=100, global=50 →50.\n\nSo, 100 !=50.\n\nProcessing second file, x=1:\n\ncurrent_file=100, global= (2)*100/2=100 →100.\n\nSo, 100 is added.\n\nSo, the result includes 0,100.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a=[1,1,1]. Total size 3.\n\nAfter each byte:\n\nx=1 (first file): current 100, global 33 →33.\n\nx=2 (second file): current 0, global 66 →66.\n\nx=3 (third file): current 0, global 100 →100.\n\nSo, the result is 0,33,66,100.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nWhen processing the first file, x=1: current 100, global 33.\n\nNo match.\n\nx=2 (second file): current 0, global 66.\n\nNo match.\n\nx=3 (third file): current 0, global 100.\n\nNo match.\n\nWait, but what about the global after processing the second file's x=1:\n\nsum is 2 → global is 66.666 →66.\n\ncurrent_file is 100 → no match.\n\nOnly when the third file's x=1 is processed, sum is 3 → global 100.\n\ncurrent_file is 100.\n\nSo, 100 is added.\n\nSo, the result is 0,100.\n\nWait, but what about during the processing of the second file's x=1:\n\nsum is 2 → global 66.666 →66.\n\ncurrent_file is 0.\n\n66 !=0.\n\nSo, no.\n\nSo, the output is 0 and 100.\n\nHmm, but perhaps during the processing of the first file's x=1, the global is 33, current is 100.\n\nNo match.\n\nSo, the only times when the two progress bars are equal are at 0 and 100.\n\nThus, the output is 0 and 100.\n\nSo, the code correctly handles this.\n\nNow, let's proceed to implement the code.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling large n and a_i, but as discussed earlier, it's manageable.\n\n- Correctly handling the initial 0.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead each test case.\n\nInitialize total_copied =0.\n\nresult_set = set()\n\nfor each a_i in a:\n\n   for x in 1..a_i:\n\n       current_file = (100 * x) // a_i\n\n       global = (100 * total_copied) // total_size\n\n       if current_file == global:\n\n           result_set.add(current_file)\n\n       total_copied +=1\n\nOnce done, collect the sorted list of elements in result_set, and print each followed by a newline.\n\nWait, but the initial state is 0 for both. So, 0 is added to the result_set.\n\nBut in the code, 0 is only added when during the processing, the current_file and global are 0.\n\nBut in the initial state, before any processing, both are 0. So, 0 should be included.\n\nBut in the code, during the first iteration, for x=1, the global is (1 * 100)/total_size.\n\nSo, for n=1, a=[1], total_size=1.\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_file=100.\n\nglobal=100*1/1=100.\n\nSo, 100 is added.\n\nBut 0 is not added unless during processing, the current_file and global are 0.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial state is before any processing. So, 0 is present at time 0, but the code only checks after each byte.\n\nSo, 0 is not captured in the code as it is.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nBecause the problem states that we have to include all such numbers that exist at some moment.\n\nIncluding the initial 0.\n\nSo, the code as written misses 0 unless during the processing, the current_file and global are 0.\n\nWhich may not happen in some cases.\n\nLike in the first test case where n=1, a=[6], the initial 0 is included because during processing x=1, the global is 0, but the current_file is 16, so 0 is not added.\n\nBut in the sample, 0 is part of the output.\n\nSo, the code needs to explicitly add 0 to the result_set.\n\nBecause the initial state is 0,0.\n\nThus, the code should initialize the result_set with 0.\n\nSo, the corrected code is:\n\nresult_set.add(0)\n\nthen, during processing, add any other matching values.\n\nAlternatively, in the code, after all processing, if 0 is not in the set, add it.\n\nBut it's better to add it explicitly.\n\nSo, the code should start with result_set = {0}.\n\nThen, during the simulation, add any other values.\n\nYes, that's necessary.\n\nOtherwise, for cases where the initial 0 is not matched during any step, it's not included.\n\nSo, the code should be modified accordingly.\n\nThus, in the code:\n\nresult_set = {0}\n\nThen, during the simulation, add any other matching values.\n\nThus, in the code:\n\nresult_set = {0}\n\nfor each test case:\n\n   process each file:\n\n       for each x:\n\n           compute current_file and global.\n\n           if equal, add to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentages at which two progress bars show the same value during the copying of files. The first progress bar shows the percentage of a specific file being copied, while the second shows the overall percentage of all files copied so far.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Initialization:** Calculate the total size of all files. Initialize a set to keep track of the percentages where both progress bars match.\n3. **Simulation:** For each file, simulate the copying process byte by byte.
