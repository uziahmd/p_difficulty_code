And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Average Sleep Time.\" Hmm.\n\nThe task says that Polycarp has been keeping track of his sleep times for n days. But a week in Berland is k days long. So the doctor wants to find the average sleep time per week over all possible consecutive weeks. Oh right, like sliding windows of size k.\n\nSo the input gives me two integers, n and k, followed by a list of n integers representing each day's sleep time. My goal is to compute the average of these k-day windows.\n\nWait, how do I approach this? Well, let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to process all possible consecutive k-day windows in the array a. For each window, calculate the sum, then find the average of all those sums.\n\nLet me think about the example they gave. Like when n=3, k=2, and a = [3,4,7], the windows are [3,4] and [4,7]. Their sums are 7 and 11, so the average is (7+11)/2 = 9. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n, k.\n2. Read the list of a's.\n3. For each i from 0 to n-k:\n   a. Take the subarray from i to i+k-1 (inclusive)\n   b. Sum those elements\n4. Sum all the individual sums from step 3.\n5. Divide by the number of windows, which is (n - k + 1), to get the average.\n6. Output this average with at least 6 decimal digits, ensuring precision.\n\nNow, thinking about efficiency. Since n can be up to 2e5, which is 200,000, a naive approach where we compute each window by iterating through k elements each time would result in O(nk) time complexity. That's 200,000 * 200,000 = 4e10 operations, which is way too slow for Python; it won't finish in time.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way to compute the sums of all windows.\n\nOh right, the sliding window technique! We can compute the sum of the first window, then for each subsequent window, subtract the element leaving the window and add the new element entering.\n\nLet's outline this:\n\n- Compute the initial sum for the first window (from index 0 to k-1).\n- Add this sum to a total variable.\n- Then, for each next window starting at i (from 1 to n-k):\n   - Subtract the element leaving the window (a[i-1])\n   - Add the new element entering the window (a[i + k - 1])\n   - Add this new sum to the total.\n- Finally, divide the total by (n - k + 1).\n\nThis way, each step is O(1), leading to an overall O(n) time complexity, which is acceptable for n=2e5.\n\nSo now, the plan is solid. Now, how to implement this in Python.\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nRead n and k: straightforward, using input().split() and converting to integers.\n\nThen read the list a: again, using list(map(int, ... )).\n\nCompute the initial sum: sum(a[0:k]).\n\nAdd this to total.\n\nThen loop from i=1 to i=(n -k). Because the last window starts at i = (n -k). For example, if n=3, k=2, the last window starts at i=1.\n\nIn each iteration, subtract a[i-1], add a[i +k -1], then add to total.\n\nWait, but wait: indexes can be tricky here. Let's see:\n\nSuppose current window starts at i. The elements are a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[i + k-1].\n\nWhen moving to i+1, the new window starts at i+1, includes a[i+1], ..., a[i +k].\n\nSo the element being removed is a[i], and the element being added is a[i +k].\n\nYes, so in code:\n\nfor i in range(1, n - k + 1):\n    total += (sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1])\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial sum is sum = sum of a[0..k-1]. Then for each i starting from 1, the window is a[i..i+k-1], so the new sum is previous sum minus a[i-1] (the element that's now excluded) plus a[i +k -1] (the new element included).\n\nSo, yes, the code inside the loop is sum -= a[i-1]; sum += a[i +k -1]; then add to total.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the loop, each new window's sum is the previous sum minus the element leaving (a[i-1]) and adding the new element (a[i + k -1]). So the code should be:\n\nsum = sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\nThen, add this sum to the total.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial sum is for the first window. Then, for each next window, we compute the new sum as the previous sum minus a[i-1] plus a[i +k -1], and then add this new sum to the total.\n\nSo the loop would be:\n\ntotal = initial_sum\nfor i in range(1, n - k + 1):\n    sum = sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n    total += sum\n\nBut wait, the loop runs from i=1 to i = (n -k). Because for i in 1, 2, ..., (n -k), the window is a[i ... i +k -1], which is valid because i +k -1 = (n -k) + k -1 = n-1.\n\nSo the loop runs (n -k) times, but since the initial sum is added before the loop, the total will have (n -k +1) sums.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nNumber of windows: m = n -k +1.\n\nInitial sum is added once.\n\nLoop runs for (m-1) times, adding each new sum.\n\nSo total is initial_sum + sum1 + sum2 + ... + sum(m-1) = sum of all m windows.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo in code:\n\nCompute initial_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n\ntotal = initial_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, (n -k +1)):\n\n    # the new window starts at i, ends at i +k-1\n\n    # subtract a[i-1], add a[i +k -1]\n\n    sum = sum - a[i-1] + a[i +k -1]\n\n    total += sum\n\nThen, average = total / m\n\nWhere m = n -k +1.\n\nThat's the plan.\n\nNow, handling the data.\n\nIn Python, the list is zero-based. So for a list a, a[0:k] is the first window.\n\nWait, but for i=1, the new window starts at 1, and includes up to 1 +k-1 = k.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nif k ==0 or k >n:\n\n    # but constraints say 1<=k <=n, so this isn't needed.\n\ninitial_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\ntotal = initial_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, (n -k +1)):\n\n    # i is the starting index of the new window.\n\n    # the element to remove is a[i-1]\n\n    # the element to add is a[i +k -1]\n\n    # because i can be up to (n -k), so i +k -1 = n -k +k -1 = n-1.\n\n    # which is valid.\n\n    sum -= a[i-1]\n\n    sum += a[i + k -1]\n\n    total += sum\n\naverage = total / (n -k +1)\n\nThen, print the average with enough decimal digits.\n\nNow, for the output, the problem says to print the average with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\nIn Python, printing it directly may not suffice because sometimes it might not show enough decimals. So perhaps we can format it as a float with 10 decimal digits, to be safe.\n\nLike, using something like \"{:.10f}\".format(average)\n\nBut also, considering that sometimes the average could be an integer, like 10.0, as in the second sample input.\n\nWait, in the second sample input, n=2, k=1, so the windows are just each element. So the average is (1+1)/2=1.0, but wait no—wait the sample input is '1 1\\n10' — wait, wait, the second sample input is:\n\nInput line 2 is '1 1\\n10' — wait no, looking back:\n\nWait the user provided some sample inputs, like:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\nWait, the second case: n=2, k=1.\n\nSo n=2, k=1, a=[1,10].\n\nSo the number of windows is 2 -1 +1= 2.\n\nEach window is [1] and [10], sums are 1 and 10. Average is (1+10)/2= 5.5. But the sample output is 10.0000000000.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, wait, looking back at the note:\n\nIn the third example, there are n-k+1=7 weeks, so the answer is the sum divided by 7.\n\nWait, but for the second sample input: n=2, k=1.\n\nSo the number of weeks is 2 -1 +1 =2.\n\nWait, but the sample output is 10.0000000000. So the average must be 10. So that suggests that the sum is 20, divided by 2, giving 10.\n\nBut according to the input, it's '1 1\\n10' — perhaps I misread the sample input.\n\nWait, the second sample input is:\n\n['1 1\\n10'] — perhaps it's n=2, k=1, and a = [1,10].\n\nWait, that would make the sum 1+10=11, average 11/2=5.5.\n\nBut the sample output is 10. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement says that the weeks are consecutive days, but perhaps the sample input was different.\n\nWait, the problem statement's note says that in the third example, the output is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. So perhaps the second sample's input is n=2, k=1, and the list is [10], but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the sample input.\n\nWait, the sample input lines are:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nSo the second case is n=1, k=1. So the list is [10], so the average is 10.\n\nAh, okay, that makes sense. So in that case, the number of windows is 1 (since n=k=1).\n\nSo for that case, the initial_sum is 10, and the loop doesn't run, so total is 10, average is 10.\n\nSo that explains the sample output.\n\nSo the code correctly handles the cases.\n\nNow, for the output formatting.\n\nIn Python, when you print a floating point number, sometimes it doesn't show all the required decimal places, especially if the number is an integer.\n\nTo ensure that exactly six decimal places are shown, perhaps using string formatting to always display 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo, something like:\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWhich would show up as 9.0000000000, etc.\n\nBut wait, what if the average is something like 5.5, which is 5.5000000000 when printed with 10 decimal places.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the precision. The problem allows for an absolute or relative error of up to 1e-6. So if the computed average is accurate enough, it's acceptable.\n\nBut since we're using floating-point arithmetic, which may have some precision errors, but given that the constraints are up to 2e5 and each ai up to 1e5, the sum could be up to 2e10, which is within the precision of Python's floats (which have about 15-17 decimal digits of precision). So no issues here.\n\nSo now, putting it all together.\n\nImplement the code as follows:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead a as a list of integers.\n\nIf k is larger than n, but according to the problem statement, k is ≤ n, so no need to handle that.\n\nCompute the initial sum as sum(a[0:k]).\n\nInitialize total as initial_sum.\n\nLoop from i=1 to i = (n -k):\n\n   sum = sum - a[i-1] + a[i +k -1]\n\n   add this sum to total.\n\nCompute average as total / (n -k +1).\n\nPrint the average with 10 decimal digits.\n\nWait, but in the loop, the range in Python is exclusive on the upper end. So for i in range(1, m), where m is n -k +1.\n\nBecause when i runs from 1 to (n -k), inclusive.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nif n ==0 or k ==0:\n    # Not possible per problem constraints\n    pass\n\ninitial_sum = sum(a[:k])\ntotal = initial_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, n - k +1):\n    # The new element is a[i +k -1]\n    # The element to remove is a[i-1]\n    initial_sum -= a[i-1]\n    initial_sum += a[i + k -1]\n    total += initial_sum\n\naverage = total / (n - k +1)\n\n# Now print with 10 decimal places\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but wait: in the loop, the initial_sum is modified each time. Because the code is:\n\nsum = sum - a[i-1] + a[i +k -1]\n\nWait, no, in the code above, I used initial_sum, but perhaps it's better to use a variable called current_sum.\n\nWait, in the code, the variable 'sum' is being reassigned each time. Wait, perhaps in the code above, the variable is named 'initial_sum', but that's a problem because after the first step, it's no longer the initial sum.\n\nWait, no, in the code I wrote earlier, the variable is named 'sum', which is a problem because 'sum' is a built-in function in Python. Assigning to it is allowed, but perhaps it's better to name it differently.\n\nWait, in the code I wrote, I had:\n\ninitial_sum = sum(a[:k])\ntotal = initial_sum\n\nfor i in ...:\n    sum = sum - a[i-1] + a[i +k -1]\n    total += sum\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect because 'sum' is the initial_sum, and then it gets overwritten. So that's a bug.\n\nWait no, in the code I wrote earlier, the variable is named 'sum', but in the initial step, it's assigned to the initial sum. Then in the loop, it's modified.\n\nBut in the code, after the initial_sum is assigned to total, the variable 'sum' is the same as initial_sum.\n\nWait, no, in the code I wrote earlier, the variable is named 'sum', but in the loop, I'm modifying it. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should rename 'sum' to 'current_sum' to avoid confusion.\n\nBecause in Python, 'sum' is a built-in function, and assigning to it is possible, but it's not recommended.\n\nSo perhaps better to rename the variable.\n\nLet me adjust the code.\n\nChange the variable name:\n\nCompute current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\nThen, in the loop:\n\ncurrent_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i +k -1]\n\nSo, the code becomes:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\ntotal = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, n - k +1):\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i +k -1]\n    total += current_sum\n\naverage = total / (n - k +1)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nTesting this code against the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 3 2, a = [3,4,7]\n\ncurrent_sum is 3+4=7.\n\ntotal is 7.\n\nLoop runs for i from 1 to 2 (since n-k+1 is 3-2+1=2, so range(1,2) is i=1.\n\ncurrent_sum =7 - a[0]=3 + a[2]=7 → 7-3=4 +7=11.\n\ntotal becomes 7+11=18.\n\nAverage is 18/(3-2+1)=18/2=9. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput: 1 1, a = [10].\n\ncurrent_sum is 10, total is 10.\n\nNo loop runs.\n\nAverage is 10/1=10. Correct.\n\nSample 3:\n\nInput: 8 2, a is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\nn=8, k=2 → windows: 7.\n\nThe sum of each window:\n\n[1,2] →3\n\n[2,4] →6\n\n[4,1e5] →100001\n\n[1e5,123] → 100123\n\n[123,456] →579\n\n[456,789] →1245\n\n[789,1] →790\n\nTotal sum: 3+6=9; +100001=100010; +100123=200133; +579=200712; +1245=201957; +790=202747.\n\nWait, let me compute all the sums:\n\nWait, the list a is [1,2,4,1e5, 123,456,789,1].\n\nSo the windows are:\n\nIndices 0-1: 1+2=3.\n\nIndices 1-2: 2+4=6.\n\nIndices 2-3:4+1e5=100004.\n\nWait, wait 4 + 100000 is 100004.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, the average is 28964.2857142857.\n\nWait, summing all the windows:\n\nLet me recompute.\n\nWait, the windows are 7 in total.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. [1,2] →3.\n\n2. [2,4] →6.\n\n3. [4, 100000] →100004.\n\n4. [100000,123] →100123.\n\n5. [123,456] →579.\n\n6. [456,789] →1245.\n\n7. [789, 1] →790.\n\nSum all these: 3 +6=9; +100004=100013; +100123=200136; +579=200715; +1245=202, 202 +1245 is 201, 200715 +1245= 201, 201, no, 200715+1245= 201, 201, no, 200,715 + 1,245 is 201, 201, 200,715 +1,245 is 201,960?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum via code.\n\nBut regardless, the code should handle it correctly.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nI think this should handle all test cases, including edge cases like when k=n (so only one window, the entire array).\n\nAlso, when k=1, each element is a window, and the sum is the sum of all elements.\n\nSo, the code looks solid.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of size k from a given list of sleep times for n days. The goal is to efficiently calculate this average using a sliding window technique to handle large input sizes within acceptable time limits.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given a list of sleep times for n days and need to find the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of k days each. This involves calculating the sum of each k-day window and then finding the average of these sums.\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Instead of recalculating the sum of each window from scratch, we use a sliding window approach. This allows us to efficiently update the sum of each new window by subtracting the element that slides out and adding the new element that slides in.\n3. **Initial Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the first window (from day 0 to day k-1).\n4. **Iterate Through Windows**: For each subsequent window, update the sum by removing the outgoing element and adding the incoming element, then keep a running total of all window sums.\n5. **Compute Average**: Finally, divide the total sum of all windows by the number of windows to get the average sleep time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\ntotal = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, n - k + 1):\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i - 1] + a[i + k - 1]\n    total += current_sum\n\naverage = total / (n - k + 1)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the integers n and k, followed by the list of sleep times for n days.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first window (first k elements) is computed and stored in `current_sum`.\n3. **Sliding Window Update**: For each subsequent window starting from index 1, the sum is updated by subtracting the element that just exited the window and adding the new element that entered. This updated sum is added to the total sum.\n4. **Average Calculation**: After processing all windows, the total sum is divided by the number of windows to find the average sleep time, which is then printed with 10 decimal places to ensure precision.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution runs efficiently in O(n) time complexity, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 200,000 days.",
