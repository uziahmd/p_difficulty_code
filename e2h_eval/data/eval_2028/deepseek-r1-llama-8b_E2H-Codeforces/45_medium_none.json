There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a tennis tournament where players are eliminated in each game, and the tournament grid isn't fixed yet. But there's a specific rule: two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. My task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in.\n\nHmm, right. So the winner needs to play as many games as possible, but each time he plays, the opponent must have a similar number of prior games. Let's think about how the tournament can be structured to maximize this.\n\nLet's start with small examples. For n=2, there's only one game. So the answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. Like, first he plays someone (so he has 1 game), then he plays another person who also has at most 1 game difference. Wait, no, because after the first game, the winner has 1 game. The second game would require the opponent to have either 0 or 2 games. But since the opponent just came from their own previous game, which was a win, they have 1 game as well. Oh wait, no—wait, the opponent could have come from a game that required them to have 0 or 1 games before. Hmm, maybe not. Maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a binary tree. Because in a knockout tournament, each loss eliminates a player, and each game is between two winners of their previous games. So the structure is a binary tree, with each node representing a game. The winner of each game proceeds to the next round.\n\nBut the problem here is that the way the initial matchups are arranged affects how many games the winner can play. Because each matchup depends on the number of games each player has played before.\n\nSo for example, in n=4, the optimal arrangement is to have the winner play two games. How? Like, the first game is between the winner and someone else. Then, the other three players are arranged in such a way that the next opponent comes from a group that has played 0 games, so the winner can play again. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, the note says that in the third sample with n=4, the answer is 2. So the maximum is 2 games. So how is that arranged? They pair 1-2 and 3-4. Then in the final, 1 and 3 play. Wait, but 1 has played one game, and 3 has also played one game, so that's allowed. So 1 wins both, totaling two games.\n\nAh, right. So the maximum number of games is determined by the structure of the tournament, ensuring that each step allows the winner to have opponents with games differing by at most one.\n\nSo the question is, given n players, arrange the tournament so that the winner plays as many times as possible, following the rule.\n\nI think the approach is to model this as building a Fibonacci sequence. Because each game the winner plays requires that the opponent has played either k-1 or k games, where k is the current count for the winner.\n\nWait, let's see. Suppose the winner has played k games. The next game must be against someone who has played either k-1 or k-0 games. Wait, no—the condition is that the two players' previous game counts differ by at most one. So when the winner has played k games, his next opponent must have played either k-1 or k games.\n\nWait, but for the next game, the opponent must have played a number of games that's either equal to or one less than the winner's current count. Because the winner has already played k games, so the opponent could have played k-1 (so the difference is 1) or k (difference 0).\n\nBut wait, the opponent could have played k-1, which would mean the difference is 1. Or k, which is 0 difference. So the next opponent can have either.\n\nBut wait, each time the winner plays a game, he must eliminate another player. So each new game adds one more to his count.\n\nSo for the winner to have m games, he must have m opponents, each of whom has played either m-1 or m games.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each of the m games, the opponent must have a number of games that is either equal to or one less than the number of games the winner had before that game.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model this as a Fibonacci-like problem. Because each time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have a certain number of games, leading to a recursive structure.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the maximum number of games m such that the sum of the series up to m is less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. For the winner to have m games, the number of players needed is the sum of the minimal required players for each step.\n\nAt each step i (where i is the number of games played so far), the opponent in that round must have i-1 or i games played before.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's try to model it.\n\nLet f(m) be the minimum number of players required for the winner to have m games.\n\nFor m=1, the winner plays once. So they need at least one opponent. So f(1)=2.\n\nFor m=2: the winner plays two games. The first game requires one opponent. Then, for the second game, the opponent must have played either 1 or 2 games. But wait, after the first game, the winner has 1 game. The opponent in the second game must have either 0 or 1 games. But wait, no—the opponent in the second game can only have played a number of games that is either equal to or one less than the winner's current count. So in the second game, the winner has 1 game. So the opponent can have 0 or 1.\n\nBut in the first case, the opponent hasn't played any games yet, which means they were a leaf in the initial bracket. So for the second game, the opponent could be someone who has 0 games, meaning they were added in the second round.\n\nWait, maybe for the second game, the opponent must have played 0 or 1 games. If they have 0, that's easy—they are a new player. If they have 1, then they were the winner of their own previous game.\n\nSo for m=2, the total number of players needed is f(1) + 1 (since the second opponent can be a new player). Wait, no. Let's think: for m=2, the winner has two games.\n\nFirst game: opponent A, who has 0 games.\n\nSecond game: opponent B, who could have 0 or 1 games.\n\nIf B has 0 games, that's easy. So total players needed are 2 (A and B) plus the original 1, but wait, no—n is the total players.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model f(m) as the minimal number of players required for the winner to reach m games.\n\nLet's see:\n\nf(1) = 2: two players play each other.\n\nf(2): The winner plays two games. The first game is against someone (say A). The second game is against someone else (B). B could have played 0 or 1 game. If B has 0, then the minimal players are 2 (A and B) plus the original winner. So total players 3.\n\nBut wait, in the case where B has 1 game, that would require that B has won their own game. But for that, B must have had a prior game. So that would require adding another player C. So B beats C in the first round, then B can play against the original winner in the second round. So for m=2, f(2) is 3 players (original winner, A, C). Or wait, no: in that case, the winner plays A, then plays B, who has beaten C. So the total players are 3.\n\nWait, but when n=3, the maximum games is 2. So for n=3, the minimal players required is 3, which matches f(2)=3.\n\nSo for m=2, f(2)=3.\n\nWhat about m=3? Let's see.\n\nThe winner plays three games. Each time, the opponent must have a number of games differing by at most 1.\n\nSo for the third game, the winner has played 2 games. The opponent must have played 1 or 2 games.\n\nIf the opponent has played 2 games, that means they have themselves played two games. So for that, we need f(2) players for that opponent.\n\nSo f(3) = f(2) + 1 = 3 + 1 =4? Or wait, perhaps more precisely, f(3) = f(2) + f(1).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of Fibonacci numbers. Because each step m requires the sum of the previous two steps.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nm=1: 2 players.\n\nm=2: 3 players.\n\nm=3: ?\n\nWait, for m=3, the third game's opponent must have played 2 games, which requires that they themselves have won twice. So for each such opponent, we need f(2) players. So the total players needed is f(2) * 1 (for the third game's opponent) plus the others.\n\nWait, perhaps f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2).\n\nBecause for each additional game, you need a player who has played m-1 games, which requires f(m-1) players, and a player who has played m-2 games, requiring f(m-2) players. Or maybe it's similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait, let's compute f(m) for some m:\n\nm=1: 2.\n\nm=2: 3.\n\nm=3: f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 =5.\n\nm=4: f(4) = f(3)+f(2)=5+3=8.\n\nWait, does that hold?\n\nLet's test for m=3:\n\nThe winner plays 3 games. The first two games are against players who have 0 and 1 games respectively. The third game's opponent must have 2 games, which requires that they have played two games. So for each opponent in the third game, you need f(2) players. Since the third game is the third game for the winner, the opponent must have played 2 games, so their bracket must have f(2) players. So the total players required for the third game is f(2) (for the opponent) plus all the other players needed for the earlier rounds.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps each new game adds the sum of the previous two steps.\n\nSo for m=3, the total players required are f(2) + f(1) =3+2=5. Which would mean that for m=3, you need 5 players.\n\nLet's see: if n=5, can the winner play 3 games?\n\nYes. Let's see:\n\nRound 1: 5 players. The winner (let's say A) plays against E, who has 0 games. A wins, now A has 1.\n\nRound 2: A plays against D, who has 0 games. A wins, now A has 2.\n\nRound 3: A plays against B, who has played 1 game (they beat C in the first round). So yes, A can play 3 games.\n\nSo for n=5, the answer is 3.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, f(3)=5. So when n=5, the maximum m is 3.\n\nSimilarly, for m=4, f(4)=8. So when n=8, the maximum is 4.\n\nSo the approach is to find the largest m where f(m) <= n, where f(m) follows the Fibonacci-like recurrence.\n\nBut wait, what is the base cases?\n\nm=1: f(1)=2\n\nm=2: f(2)=3\n\nm=3: f(3)=5\n\nm=4: f(4)=8\n\nm=5: f(5)=13\n\nYes, that seems to fit.\n\nSo, our goal is to find the maximum m such that f(m) <=n, where f(m) is defined as:\n\nf(1)=2, f(2)=3, and for m>2, f(m) = f(m-1)+f(m-2).\n\nOnce we find m_max, that's the maximum number of games.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute f(m) until f(m) exceeds n.\n\n2. Find the maximum m where f(m) <=n.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where n is not exactly equal to f(m), but less than f(m)?\n\nFor example, n=4.\n\nAccording to the sample, the maximum is 2.\n\nf(2)=3, which is <=4.\n\nf(3)=5>4.\n\nSo m_max is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example, n=10.\n\nLooking for f(m):\n\nf(1)=2\n\nf(2)=3\n\nf(3)=5\n\nf(4)=8\n\nf(5)=13>10.\n\nSo the maximum m is 4, as per the sample.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nSo the steps for the code would be:\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Compute the Fibonacci-like sequence starting from f(1)=2, f(2)=3.\n\n- Keep computing until f(m) exceeds n.\n\n- The maximum m is the largest m where f(m)<=n.\n\nSo the code can be structured as follows:\n\nInitialize a list or variables for f_prev_prev, f_prev, etc.\n\nCompute each step until f exceeds n.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nWe can represent it with a loop:\n\nWe'll start with a=2 (f(1)), b=3 (f(2)).\n\nThen, for each next step, c = a + b.\n\nCompare c with n.\n\nIf c <=n, set a =b, b=c, and continue.\n\nElse, break.\n\nAfter the loop, the maximum m is the number of steps taken.\n\nWait, but let's see.\n\nWait, for n=2:\n\nLoop starts with a=2, b=3.\n\nCheck if a <=n: 2<=2 → yes.\n\nIncrement m by 1.\n\nNext, c=2+3=5>2 → stop.\n\nSo m is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\na=2<=3 → m=1.\n\nc=2+3=5>3 → stop.\n\nBut wait, wait: no. Because initially, a is 2, which is f(1), and b is 3, which is f(2). So for n=3, the maximum m is 2.\n\nWait, the way the code is structured, when n is 3, the initial a is 2 (f(1)), and b is3 (f(2)). So a <=n, so m increments by 1, then a becomes 3, b becomes 5. Now, check if a (3) <=n (3): yes. m increments to 2. Then compute c=3+5=8>3 → stop. So m is 2.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo the approach is to initialize a and b as 2 and 3. Then, while a <=n, increment m by 1, set a, b = b, a + b.\n\nWait, but let me think of the steps for n=5:\n\nInitial a=2, b=3.\n\na<=5: yes, m=1.\n\nnew a=3, b=5.\n\na=3<=5: yes, m=2.\n\nnew a=5, b=8.\n\na=5<=5: yes, m=3.\n\nnew a=8, b=13.\n\na=8>5: stop.\n\nSo m is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code logic is:\n\nRead n.\n\nif n <2: handle edge case? But n>=2.\n\nInitialize a=2, b=3, m=2 (since a=2 is m=1, b=3 is m=2).\n\nWait, no. Because when a=2, m=1, then when a=3, m=2.\n\nSo the initial m is 1 (since a=2 is for m=1), but in the loop, we check if a <=n.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can be:\n\nm = 1\n\nwhile True:\n\n    current = a\n\n    if current > n:\n\n        break\n\n    m +=1\n\n    # prepare for next iteration\n\n    a, b = b, a + b\n\nSo for n=2:\n\nloop:\n\ncurrent =2 → <=2 → m=1.\n\na becomes 3, b=5.\n\nnext loop: current=3>2 → break.\n\nso m=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\nloop:\n\ncurrent=2 <=3 → m=2.\n\na becomes3, b=5.\n\ncurrent=3 <=3 → m=3.\n\na becomes5, b=8.\n\ncurrent=5>3 → break.\n\nWait, but that's wrong because m=3 is larger than the actual maximum.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because for n=3, the maximum m is 2.\n\nWait, that suggests that my code is incorrect.\n\nWait, why? Because for n=3, according to the sample input, the output is 2.\n\nSo the code's logic is giving m=2 for n=3.\n\nBut according to the code I wrote:\n\ninitial a=2, b=3.\n\nm=1.\n\nloop:\n\ncurrent=2 <=3 → m=2.\n\na becomes 3, b=5.\n\ncurrent=3 <=3 → m=3.\n\na becomes5, b=8.\n\ncurrent=5>3 → break.\n\nSo m=3.\n\nBut that's wrong because for n=3, the maximum is 2.\n\nSo the code is overcounting m.\n\nAh, I see the mistake.\n\nBecause the code is considering that a=3 is part of the condition, but in reality, a=3 corresponds to m=2.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial setup is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the loop differently. Let's think about the sequence.\n\nThe f(m) is:\n\nm | f(m)\n\n1 | 2\n\n2 |3 \n\n3 |5 \n\n4 |8 \n\nand so on.\n\nSo for n=3, the maximum m is 2 because f(2)=3<=3.\n\nSo in the code, when a=2 (m=1), it's allowed, and a=3 (m=2) is also allowed.\n\nThen, when a=5 (m=3) is considered, which is larger than 3.\n\nSo in the code, m should be incremented after checking if a is <=n.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial a is 2 (m=1), and the loop continues while a <=n, but after each iteration, m is incremented.\n\nWait, no, that might complicate things.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can precompute all possible f(m) until it exceeds n, and find the maximum m where f(m) <=n.\n\nSo let's compute the f(m) values step by step until f(m) >n, then take the maximum m.\n\nSo the code can be:\n\nCompute the sequence f(m) starting from m=1.\n\nFor each m, compute f(m) and check if it's <=n.\n\nThe maximum m for which this holds is the answer.\n\nSo in code:\n\nmax_games = 0\n\na, b = 2, 3\n\nfor m in range(1, ...):\n\n    if a <=n:\n\n        max_games = m\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\n    a, b = b, a + b\n\nWait, but this doesn't account for the fact that after each step, a is updated to the next f(m).\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to keep track of the current maximum m and the current a and b.\n\nInitialize m=1, a=2, b=3.\n\nThen, in each iteration, check if a <=n → if yes, m increases by 1.\n\nThen, compute next a and b.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nm = 0\n\ncurrent_a = 2\n\ncurrent_b = 3\n\nwhile True:\n\n    if current_a <=n:\n\n        m +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\n    # Prepare next step\n\n    next_a = current_b\n\n    next_b = current_a + current_b\n\n    if next_a > n:\n\n        break\n\n    current_a, current_b = next_a, next_b\n\nSo for n=3:\n\nInitial current_a=2 <=3 → m becomes 1.\n\nnext_a=3, next_b=5.\n\nCheck if next_a (3) <=3 → yes.\n\ncurrent_a=3, current_b=5.\n\nCheck current_a (3) <=3 → yes → m becomes 2.\n\nnext_a=5, next_b=8.\n\nCheck next_a (5) >3 → break.\n\nSo m is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\ncurrent_a=2 <=5 → m=1.\n\nnext_a=3, next_b=5.\n\nCheck next_a=3 <=5 → yes.\n\ncurrent_a=3, current_b=5.\n\nCheck 3 <=5 → m=2.\n\nnext_a=5, next_b=8.\n\nCheck 5 <=5 → yes.\n\nm=3.\n\nnext_a=8, next_b=13.\n\n8>5 → break.\n\nSo m=3, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=8.\n\nLoop steps:\n\ncurrent_a=2 <=8 → m=1.\n\nnext_a=3, next_b=5.\n\n3<=8 → m=2.\n\nnext_a=5, next_b=8.\n\n5<=8 → m=3.\n\nnext_a=8, next_b=13.\n\n8<=8 → m=4.\n\nnext_a=13>8 → break.\n\nSo m=4.\n\nWhich is correct, as f(4)=8.\n\nSo the code logic is:\n\nInitialize m=0, current_a=2, current_b=3.\n\nWhile current_a <=n:\n\n   m +=1\n\n   compute next_a and next_b.\n\n   if next_a >n: break.\n\n   current_a, current_b = next_a, next_b.\n\nWait, but in the code above, after incrementing m, we need to check if next_a is within n.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to structure it as:\n\nm = 0\n\na = 2\n\nb = 3\n\nwhile a <= n:\n\n    m +=1\n\n    # Check if the next step is possible.\n\n    # Next a is b, next b is a + b.\n\n    # If next a is beyond n, break.\n\n    if b > n:\n\n        break\n\n    a, b = b, a + b\n\nSo for n=3:\n\nLoop:\n\na=2 <=3 → m=1.\n\nCheck if b=3>3? No.\n\nSo a=3, b=5.\n\nLoop again:\n\na=3 <=3 → m=2.\n\nCheck if b=5>3? Yes → break.\n\nSo m=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\nLoop:\n\na=2 <=5 → m=1.\n\nb=3 <=5.\n\na=3, b=5.\n\nLoop: a=3 <=5 → m=2.\n\nb=5 <=5.\n\na=5, b=8.\n\nLoop: a=5 <=5 → m=3.\n\nb=8>5 → break.\n\nSo m=3.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test case: n=8.\n\nLoop:\n\na=2 → m=1.\n\nb=3 → next step a=3, b=5.\n\na=3 → m=2.\n\nb=5 → a=5, b=8.\n\na=5 → m=3.\n\nb=8 → a=8, b=13.\n\na=8 → m=4.\n\nb=13>8 → break.\n\nSo m=4.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test case: n=4.\n\nLoop:\n\na=2 → m=1.\n\nb=3 → a=3, b=5.\n\na=3 <=4 → m=2.\n\nb=5>4 → break.\n\nSo m=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n.\n\nInitialize a=2, b=3, m=0.\n\nLoop:\n\n   if a >n: break.\n\n   m +=1.\n\n   if b >n: break.\n\n   a, b = b, a+b.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n ==1:\n\n    print(0)  # though n is >=2.\n\nelse:\n\n    a, b = 2,3\n\n    m=0\n\n    while True:\n\n        if a >n:\n\n            break\n\n        m +=1\n\n        if b >n:\n\n            break\n\n        a, b = b, a + b\n\n    print(m)\n\nWait, but wait for n=2:\n\nLoop:\n\na=2 <=2 → m=1.\n\nCheck b=3>2 → break.\n\nSo m=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=6.\n\nf(3)=5<=6.\n\nf(4)=8>6.\n\nSo maximum m is3.\n\nTesting code:\n\nLoop:\n\na=2 → m=1.\n\nb=3.\n\na=3 → m=2.\n\nb=5.\n\na=5 → m=3.\n\nb=8>6 → break.\n\nSo m=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nRead n.\n\nHandle the case where n=2, which gives m=1.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nn = int(input())\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    a, b = 2, 3\n    m = 0\n    while a <= n:\n        m += 1\n        if b > n:\n            break\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    print(m)\n\nWait, but wait for n=3:\n\nThe code would process a=2 → m=1.\n\nThen a=3, which is <=3 → m=2.\n\nThen, check b=5>3 → break.\n\nSo m=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=10.\n\nThe code processes:\n\na=2 → m=1.\n\nb=3 → a=3, b=5.\n\na=3 → m=2.\n\nb=5 → a=5, b=8.\n\na=5 → m=3.\n\nb=8 → a=8, b=13.\n\na=8 <=10 → m=4.\n\nb=13>10 → break.\n\nSo m=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2 → output 1.\n\nn=3 → 2.\n\nn=4 →2.\n\nn=5→3.\n\nn=6→3.\n\nn=7→3.\n\nn=8→4.\n\nn=9→4.\n\nn=10→4.\n\nn=11→4.\n\nn=12→4.\n\nn=13→5.\n\nSo the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given that each game is a knockout round and two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the structure of the tournament can be modeled using a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Each game the winner plays requires opponents who have either played the same number of games or one fewer game than the winner. This leads us to define a function `f(m)` which represents the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `m` games.\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the base cases where the winner can play 1 game (with 2 players) and 2 games (with 3 players).\n2. **Fibonacci-like Sequence**: For each subsequent number of games `m`, the minimum number of players required, `f(m)`, is the sum of the minimum players required for `m-1` and `m-2` games.\n3. **Iterative Check**: Compute the sequence iteratively until the required number of players exceeds the given number `n`. The maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest `m` for which `f(m) <= n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    a, b = 2, 3\n    m = 0\n    while a <= n:\n        m += 1\n        if b > n:\n            break\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    print(m)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start with `a = 2` (for 1 game) and `b = 3` (for 2 games).\n- **Loop**: In each iteration, we check if the current number of players `a` is within the limit `n`. If it is, we increment the game count `m`. We then update `a` and `b` to the next values in the sequence.\n- **Termination**: The loop terminates when `a` exceeds `n`, ensuring we find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using an iterative method similar to generating Fibonacci numbers, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of `n = 1018`.",
