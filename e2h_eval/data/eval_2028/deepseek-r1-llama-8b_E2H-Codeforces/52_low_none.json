Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Vasily has some candles and can make new ones from the stubs. The goal is to find out how many hours he can keep the room lit. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nHmm, the problem says that each candle burns for one hour before going out. Then, b gone candles can make a new one. So the process is: burn all the initial candles, then collect the stubs, exchange them for new candles, burn those, collect again, and so on until you can't make any more.\n\nWait, but the order might matter. Maybe it's better to not burn all the initial candles at once because you get more stubs earlier to make more candles. Or maybe not—since each time you make a new candle, it's an additional hour of light.\n\nLet me try to model this. Suppose we have 'a' initial candles. Each burns for 1 hour, so initially, they contribute a hours. Then, after burning, we have a stubs. But since b stubs can make a new candle, the number of new candles is a // b. So each time, we add (number of new candles) to the total hours, and also calculate how many new stubs we get from those new candles.\n\nWait, no. Because each new candle when burned adds another hour, and then produces a stub. So the process is:\n\n- Burn initial candles: add a hours. Stubs = a.\n- Then, as long as stubs >= b:\n   - Make new candles: new_candles = stubs // b.\n   - Add new_candles to the total.\n   - Stubs becomes (stubs % b) + new_candles (because each new candle makes one stub when burned).\n- Repeat until stubs < b.\n\nSo the algorithm could be something like:\n\ntotal = a\ncurrent_stubs = a\nwhile current_stubs >= b:\n    new = current_stubs // b\n    total += new\n    current_stubs = (current_stubs % b) + new\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me test this with the sample input.\n\nFirst sample: a=4, b=2.\n\nInitial total =4, stubs=4.\n\nLoop:\n4 >=2 → new=2, total=6. stubs now 0 + 2=2.\nAgain, 2>=2 → new=1, total=7. stubs=0+1=1. Now 1<2 → stop. So total is 7, which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample: a=6, b=3.\n\nInitial total=6, stubs=6.\n\n6/3=2, total=8. Stubs =0+2=2. 2<3 → stop. So output is 8, which matches.\n\nAnother test case: what if a=5, b=5?\n\nBurn 5 → stubs 5 → make 1. Total is 6. Stubs becomes 1. So total is 6.\n\nWhat about a=7, b=3.\n\nInitial:7 → stubs 7. Make 7//3=2, total becomes 9. Stubs:7%3=1 +2=3.\n\nNow, 3>=3 → make 1. total=10. stubs:0+1=1 → done.\n\nSo total is 10.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nSo now, I need to write a Python function that reads a and b from input, computes this, and outputs the result.\n\nThe input is two integers on the same line. So in Python, I can read the input using input().split(), convert them into integers.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nInitialize total = a\n\ncurrent_stubs = a\n\nloop while current_stubs >=b:\n\n   new = current_stubs //b\n\n   total += new\n\n   current_stubs = (current_stubs %b) + new\n\nOnce loop ends, print total.\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nTesting edge cases: like when a is 0? Wait, no, the problem states 1<=a<=1000. So no need to handle a=0.\n\nWhat about when b is larger than a? Like a=3, b=5. Then total is 3, since you can't make any new candles. So that's handled correctly.\n\nAnother test: a=10, b=4.\n\nInitial:10 → stubs 10 → new=2, total 12 → stubs 10%4=2 +2=4.\n\nThen new=1, total 13 → stubs=0+1=1 <4 → done. So total is 13.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo the code should work for all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has. Each candle burns for exactly one hour before going out, and Vasily can create new candles by collecting the stubs from burned-out candles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`, which will burn for `a` hours.\n2. **Collect Stubs**: After burning all initial candles, collect the stubs. Each burned candle leaves a stub.\n3. **Recycle Stubs**: Use the collected stubs to create new candles. For every `b` stubs, you can create one new candle. This process continues as long as you have enough stubs to create at least one new candle.\n4. **Update Counters**: Each time a new candle is created, it adds an additional hour to the total count. Also, each new candle, when burned, will leave another stub.\n5. **Termination Condition**: Stop the process when there are not enough stubs left to create a new candle.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the total hours by iteratively converting stubs into new candles until no more conversions are possible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\ncurrent_stubs = a\n\nwhile current_stubs >= b:\n    new_candles = current_stubs // b\n    total += new_candles\n    current_stubs = (current_stubs % b) + new_candles\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads two integers, `a` and `b`, representing the initial number of candles and the number of stubs needed to create a new candle, respectively.\n- **Initial Burn**: The initial number of candles `a` gives `a` hours of light.\n- **Stub Collection and Conversion**: Using a loop, the code repeatedly converts stubs into new candles. Each iteration calculates how many new candles can be made, updates the total hours, and adjusts the count of stubs accordingly.\n- **Termination**: The loop exits when there are not enough stubs to make another candle, ensuring optimal use of all available resources.\n\nThis method ensures that we maximize the number of hours the room is illuminated by efficiently reusing stubs to create new candles whenever possible.",
