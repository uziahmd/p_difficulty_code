Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about finding two vouchers that don't overlap, their durations add up exactly to x, and the total cost is as minimal as possible. If no such pair exists, we return -1.\n\nLet me break down the problem. We have n vouchers. Each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost costi. The duration of each voucher is ri - li + 1. We need to choose two different vouchers i and j. These two must not intersect, meaning either the end of i is before the start of j or vice versa. Also, the sum of their durations should be exactly x. And among all such possible pairs, we need the one with the smallest total cost.\n\nHmm, okay. So the approach is to find all possible pairs of vouchers where their durations add up to x and they don't overlap. Then, among those pairs, find the one with the minimum cost.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2e5. So a naive O(n^2) approach would be way too slow. We need a more efficient method.\n\nSo how do we do this efficiently?\n\nLet's think about the constraints for two vouchers. Let's say voucher A has duration d1, voucher B has duration d2. So d1 + d2 = x. And their time intervals don't overlap.\n\nWait, but the sum of durations must be exactly x. So for each voucher, maybe we can look for another voucher whose duration is x minus the current one's duration.\n\nSo first, for each voucher, compute its duration. Then, for each voucher, we can look for another voucher with duration x - d, and check if they can be non-overlapping.\n\nBut even then, considering all vouchers, this might still be O(n^2), which is not feasible for n=2e5.\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: group the vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, we'll have a list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each voucher in a group of duration d, we can look for vouchers in the group of duration (x - d), and check whether any of them are non-overlapping.\n\nBut even this might not be efficient enough because for each voucher, we might have to scan through a lot of other vouchers.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can pre-process the vouchers in a way that allows us to quickly find the minimal cost pair that meets the conditions.\n\nAnother thought: since the vouchers must not overlap, their intervals must be either completely before or after each other. So for each voucher, we can consider two cases:\n\n1. Find a voucher that ends before the current voucher starts.\n2. Find a voucher that starts after the current voucher ends.\n\nSo for each voucher i, we can look for vouchers j in the appropriate groups (d = x - di) that are either entirely before or after i.\n\nBut again, doing this naively for each voucher is expensive.\n\nWait, maybe we can sort the vouchers based on their end times and start times, allowing us to use binary search to find suitable candidates.\n\nAlternatively, for each duration d, we can keep track of the earliest ending vouchers and the latest starting ones, so that when looking for a voucher with duration x - d, we can efficiently find the best candidates.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this.\n\nFor example, for each voucher, we can categorize it into two groups: those that end before it starts (so the j comes before i) and those that start after it ends (so j comes after i).\n\nWait, but the vouchers are in the same group if their durations are complementary (d1 + d2 = x). So for each voucher i with duration d, we look into the group of vouchers with duration x - d.\n\nWithin that group, we need to find vouchers that either end before i starts or start after i ends.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute for each voucher its duration and store them grouped by duration.\n\n- For each voucher i in group d, look into group (x - d) and find all vouchers j that are compatible (non-overlapping) with i.\n\n- Among all such j, find the one with the minimal cost and compute the sum with i's cost.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find the minimal cost j in the group (x-d) that doesn't overlap with i.\n\nAn alternative approach is to pre-sort the vouchers in each group by their end times and start times.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For each group d, we can create two lists:\n\n1. Sorted by end time in ascending order. So for any voucher j in this group, j ends early. This would be useful when looking for vouchers that end before some voucher i starts.\n\n2. Sorted by start time in descending order. So for any voucher j in this group, j starts late. This would be useful when looking for vouchers that start after some voucher i ends.\n\nThen, for each voucher i, we can:\n\n- Check the group (x - d_i) for vouchers that end before i's start. For this, we can perform a binary search on the sorted end list of (x-d_i) group to find all j's where j_end < i_start.\n\n- Similarly, check for vouchers that start after i_end. For this, we can perform a binary search on the sorted start list of (x-d_i) group to find all j's where j_start > i_end.\n\nOnce we have these lists, we can find the minimal cost in each subset and calculate the total cost with i's cost. Then, keep track of the global minimal.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Precompute the duration for each voucher. Group the vouchers by their duration.\n\n2. For each group d, create two sorted lists:\n\n   a. SortedEnds: list of vouchers in this group sorted by their end time in ascending order.\n\n   b. SortedStarts: list of vouchers in this group sorted by their start time in descending order.\n\n3. For each voucher i:\n\n   a. Compute d_i = duration of i.\n\n   b. Compute required_d = x - d_i.\n\n   c. If required_d is not present in the groups, skip.\n\n   d. Else, for group required_d:\n\n      i. Check for vouchers j where j ends before i starts. So j_end < i_li.\n\n         - Use binary search on SortedEnds of required_d group to find all j with j_end <= i_li - 1.\n\n         - Among these, find the one with minimal cost.\n\n      ii. Check for vouchers j where j starts after i ends. So j_li > i_ri.\n\n         - Use binary search on SortedStarts of required_d group to find all j with j_li >= i_ri + 1.\n\n         - Among these, find the one with minimal cost.\n\n   e. For each of the above cases, if there are any valid j's, compute the sum of costs and update the global minimum if necessary.\n\n4. After processing all vouchers, if any valid pair is found, output the minimal cost. Otherwise, output -1.\n\nNow, the question is: How to represent the groups and efficiently retrieve the minimal cost for the required conditions.\n\nEach group will have a list of vouchers. For each group, we can pre-sort the vouchers in two ways: by end time and by start time.\n\nAdditionally, for each group, we can precompute two prefix minima:\n\n- For the sortedEnds list, we can precompute a list where each element is the minimal cost up to that point.\n\n- For the sortedStarts list, we can precompute a suffix minimum, where each element is the minimal cost from that position onwards.\n\nWait, that's a good idea. Because for the sortedEnds list, when we're looking for j's that end before i's start, the earliest j's (those that end earlier) may have higher or lower costs. So, if we have a prefix minimum array, for any index k in the sortedEnds list, the minimal cost is known. When we find all j's with j_end <= i_li - 1, the minimal cost among them is the prefix_min[k].\n\nSimilarly, for the sortedStarts list, which is sorted in descending order of start time, we can have a suffix_min array. Because as we go from the beginning of the list to the end, the start time decreases. So, for any i, j's that start after i's end would be a subset of the sortedStarts list. But to find the minimal cost, a suffix_min array would allow us to get the minimal cost from a certain point onward.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\n- sortedEnds is sorted by j_end in ascending order. So for a given i_li, any j in sortedEnds up to a certain index have j_end <= i_li -1.\n\n- So for the sortedEnds list, we can compute a prefix_min array where prefix_min[k] is the minimal cost among the first k+1 elements (from 0 to k). Then, for a given i_li, we can binary search to find the maximum index where j_end <= i_li -1. If such j's exist, the minimal cost is prefix_min[k].\n\nFor the sortedStarts list, which is sorted by j_li in descending order. For a given i_ri, we need j's where j_li > i_ri. Since the list is in descending order, all j's from some index onwards have j_li > i_ri. To find the minimal cost in this subset, a suffix_min array would be useful. For each index k in the sortedStarts list, suffix_min[k] is the minimal cost from k to the end. So, when we find the starting index where j_li > i_ri, we can take the suffix_min from that index.\n\nSo, for each group, we can precompute:\n\n- sortedEnds: sorted by j_end. Compute a prefix_min array.\n\n- sortedStarts: sorted by j_li in descending order. Compute a suffix_min array.\n\nThis way, when we query for j's in the required group, we can quickly find the minimal cost.\n\nSo, the steps for each group are:\n\n1. For group d, collect all vouchers.\n\n2. Sort them by end time in ascending order to form sortedEnds.\n\n   - Create prefix_min: for each index k, prefix_min[k] is min of the costs from 0 to k.\n\n3. Sort them by start time in descending order to form sortedStarts.\n\n   - Create suffix_min: for each index k, suffix_min[k] is min of costs from k to the end.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher i, we can:\n\n- Look for required_d = x - d_i.\n\n- If required_d is not present, continue.\n\n- Else, get the sortedEnds and prefix_min of required_d group.\n\n   - Binary search in sortedEnds to find the largest j_end <= i_li -1.\n\n   - If any j exists (k >=0), then the minimal cost in this subset is prefix_min[k]. Add i's cost to this and see if it's better than the global min.\n\n- Similarly, get the sortedStarts and suffix_min of required_d group.\n\n   - Binary search in sortedStarts to find the first j where j_li > i_ri.\n\n   - From that index onwards, if any j exists (k < len), the minimal cost is suffix_min[k]. Add i's cost to this and see.\n\nThis way, for each voucher, we can efficiently find the minimal possible cost for both cases.\n\nNow, the implementation plan.\n\nFirst, read all the vouchers.\n\nCompute their durations.\n\nGroup the vouchers by duration.\n\nFor each group, prepare the sortedEnds and sortedStarts, along with prefix_min and suffix_min.\n\nThen, for each voucher, process as described.\n\nNow, the data structures.\n\nIn Python, for each group, we can have a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a tuple of (sortedEnds, prefix_min, sortedStarts, suffix_min).\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute for each group the necessary arrays.\n\nLet me outline the code structure.\n\nRead n and x.\n\nvouchers = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    l, r, c = map(int, input().split())\n    duration = r - l + 1\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, c, duration) )\n\nThen, group the vouchers by duration.\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_groups = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor v in vouchers:\n    d = v[3]\n    duration_groups[d].append(v)\n\nNow, for each duration d in duration_groups, process the group.\n\npreprocess each group:\n\nprocessed_groups = {}\n\nfor d in duration_groups:\n    # process the group for duration d\n    group = duration_groups[d]\n    # sort by end time to make sortedEnds\n    sortedEnds = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    # compute prefix_min for sortedEnds\n    prefix_min = []\n    current_min = float('inf')\n    for v in sortedEnds:\n        current_min = min(current_min, v[2])\n        prefix_min.append(current_min)\n    \n    # sort by start time in descending order for sortedStarts\n    sortedStarts = sorted(group, key=lambda x: (-x[0], x[2]))\n    # compute suffix_min for sortedStarts\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(sortedStarts)\n    current_min = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(sortedStarts)-1, -1, -1):\n        current_min = min(current_min, sortedStarts[i][2])\n        suffix_min[i] = current_min\n    \n    processed_groups[d] = {\n        'sortedEnds': sortedEnds,\n        'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n        'sortedStarts': sortedStarts,\n        'suffix_min': suffix_min\n    }\n\nWait, but in the sortedStarts, the key is (-x[0], x[2]), because when multiple vouchers have the same start time, we can take the one with minimal cost? Or perhaps just the start time in descending order, regardless of cost. Because in the suffix_min, we take the minimal cost from that point onwards.\n\nYes, so the sortedStarts is sorted in descending order of start time. So for the same start time, the order may vary, but during the suffix_min computation, we just take the minimal cost from that point.\n\nSo, the code for sortedStarts is correct.\n\nNow, for each voucher i in vouchers:\n\nli, ri, costi, di = v\n\nrequired_d = x - di\n\nif required_d not in processed_groups:\n    continue\n\ngroup_info = processed_groups[required_d]\n\n# case 1: j ends before i starts\n# in group_info.sortedEnds, find all j where j_end <= li -1\n# binary search on end times.\n\nlow = 0\nhigh = len(group_info['sortedEnds']) -1\nbest = -1\nwhile low <= high:\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n    j_end = group_info['sortedEnds'][mid][1]\n    if j_end <= li -1:\n        best = mid\n        low = mid +1\n    else:\n        high = mid -1\n\nif best != -1:\n    min_cost_case1 = group_info['prefix_min'][best]\n    total = costi + min_cost_case1\n    if total < global_min:\n        global_min = total\n\n# case 2: j starts after i ends\n# in group_info['sortedStarts'], find the first j where j_start > ri\n# binary search for li in group_info['sortedStarts'].\n\nstart_times = [v[0] for v in group_info['sortedStarts']]\n\nlow = 0\nhigh = len(start_times) -1\nbest = len(start_times)\nwhile low <= high:\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n    j_start = start_times[mid]\n    if j_start > ri:\n        best = mid\n        high = mid -1\n    else:\n        low = mid +1\n\nif best < len(start_times):\n    # there are j's starting after i ends\n    min_cost_case2 = group_info['suffix_min'][best]\n    total = costi + min_cost_case2\n    if total < global_min:\n        global_min = total\n\nWait, but for the second case, the j's in the sortedStarts are in descending order of start times. So, the j's after index 'best' have j_start > i_ri.\n\nSo, for the suffix_min, group_info['suffix_min'][best] gives the minimal cost from best onwards.\n\nSo, in the code, for the second case, if best is less than len(sortedStarts), then we can take the suffix_min.\n\nBut wait, what if the entire group is empty? Like, if no j satisfies j_start > i_ri, then best would be equal to len(sortedStarts), and thus best >= len(sortedStarts), so the condition best < len(...) is false.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, initialize the global_min as infinity.\n\nAfter processing all vouchers, if global_min is still infinity, output -1. Else, output the minimal cost.\n\nWait, but what about when the same voucher is considered for both cases? Like, when i and j are the same voucher, but that's impossible since i and j must be different. But in our code, since we are iterating over each voucher i, and for each i, we look for j in another group (unless x is even and the voucher's duration is x/2, then j could be another voucher in the same group), so in the code, it's handled.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2\n\nSo, group 3 has one voucher, group 2 has three vouchers.\n\nFor the first sample, the solution is to pick the first voucher (duration 3) and third voucher (duration 2). 3+2=5. They don't overlap because the first ends at 3, the third starts at 5.\n\nSo, when processing the first voucher (li=1, ri=3, cost=4, duration 3):\n\nrequired_d =5-3=2.\n\nLooking into group 2.\n\nCase 1: j ends before 1.\n\nIn sortedEnds of group 2, the vouchers are sorted by end time.\n\nThe group 2 vouchers are:\n\n1-2, cost 5; 5-6, cost 1; 1-2, cost4.\n\nWait, wait, the initial grouping is:\n\nThe vouchers for duration 2 are:\n\nv1: l=1, r=2, c=5\n\nv3: l=5, r=6, c=1\n\nv4: l=1, r=2, c=4\n\nSo, when sortedEnds are sorted by r:\n\nv1 has r=2, v4 r=2, v3 r=6.\n\nWait, no: sortedEnds is sorted by end time, so for group 2:\n\nthe vouchers are:\n\nv1 (r=2), v4 (r=2), v3 (r=6).\n\nWhen sortedEnds is sorted by end time, they are in the order: v1, v4, v3.\n\nThe prefix_min for this group is:\n\nv1's cost is5 → prefix_min[0]=5.\n\nv4's cost is4 → min(5,4)=4 → prefix_min[1]=4.\n\nv3's cost is1 → min(4,1)=1 → prefix_min[2]=1.\n\nNow, for the first voucher (i), li=1. So j_end must be <= 0 (since i_li is 1, li-1=0).\n\nLooking in sortedEnds for j_end <=0: none. So case1 yields nothing.\n\nCase2: j starts after i ends (i_ri is 3). So j_li must be >3.\n\nIn group2's sortedStarts:\n\nsortedStarts is sorted in descending order of start time.\n\nLooking at the vouchers:\n\nv3 starts at 5.\n\nv1 starts at1, v4 at1.\n\nSo sortedStarts would be [v3, v1, v4], since their start times are 5,1,1. Wait, no: in the code, we sort by (-x[0], x[2]).\n\nWait, no: in the code, group is sorted by (-x[0], x[2]). So, for group2, the vouchers are:\n\nv3: (5,6,1)\n\nv1: (1,2,5)\n\nv4: (1,2,4)\n\nSo, when sorted by (-l, c), the order is:\n\nv3 (l=5) comes first.\n\nThen, between v1 and v4, since l is 1 for both, but v4 has c=4 which is less than v1's c=5. So, in sortedStarts, v4 comes after v1? Wait, no: because the key is (-l, x[2]). So for v1 and v4, both have l=1, so their keys are (-1,5) and (-1,4). Since 5>4, v1 comes before v4.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when we sort using a key, tuples are compared lexicographically. So for (-1,5) and (-1,4), the first is larger than the second, so in the sorted list, (-1,4) comes before (-1,5). Because when comparing the two tuples, (-1,5) is larger than (-1,4), so when sorted in ascending order, the smaller comes first.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: in Python, when you sort a list of tuples, it compares the first elements. If they are equal, it compares the next elements, and so on.\n\nSo, for two elements a and b, a comes before b if a is \"smaller\" than b.\n\nSo, for the key (-l, c), when l is the same, the one with smaller c comes first.\n\nSo, for group2, the sortedStarts is:\n\nv3 (l=5) → first.\n\nThen, between v1 (c=5) and v4 (c=4): since (-1,5) is larger than (-1,4), so in the sorted list, v4 comes before v1.\n\nWait, no: wait, sorted in ascending order.\n\nSo, (-1,4) is less than (-1,5), so in the sorted list, v4 comes before v1.\n\nSo, the sortedStarts list for group2 is [v3, v4, v1].\n\nWait, no: when we sort the group, the key is (-l, c). So for v1 and v4, their keys are (-1,5) and (-1,4). When sorted in ascending order, (-1,4) comes before (-1,5), so in the sortedStarts list, v4 comes before v1.\n\nThus, the sortedStarts list for group2 is:\n\nv3 (start=5), v4 (start=1), v1 (start=1).\n\nWait, no: no, because for group2, the three vouchers are:\n\nv3: l=5, r=6, c=1.\n\nv1: l=1, r=2, c=5.\n\nv4: l=1, r=2, c=4.\n\nSo when sorted by (-l, c), the order is:\n\nv3 (since l=5 is the highest) first.\n\nThen, among v1 and v4, since l=1 for both, we compare c: v4 has c=4, which is less than v1's 5. So in the sortedStarts list, v4 comes before v1.\n\nSo the sortedStarts list is [v3, v4, v1].\n\nThe suffix_min array is computed for this list.\n\nCompute suffix_min:\n\nstart from the end.\n\nv1's cost is5: suffix_min[2] =5.\n\nv4's cost is4: min(4,5) →4: suffix_min[1]=4.\n\nv3's cost is1: min(1,4) →1: suffix_min[0]=1.\n\nSo, suffix_min = [1,4,5].\n\nNow, for the first voucher i (li=1, ri=3, costi=4, di=3).\n\nrequired_d is5-3=2.\n\nIn group2, we look for j's that start after i ends, which is 3.\n\nSo, in sortedStarts of group2, we need j_li >3.\n\nLooking for j_start >3.\n\nIn the sortedStarts list [v3, v4, v1], v3 starts at5, which is >3. v4 starts at1, which is <=3. v1 starts at1, also <=3.\n\nSo, binary search in the start times [5,1,1] for the first j_start >3.\n\nWait, the sortedStarts list is [v3, v4, v1]. Their start times are 5,1,1.\n\nWe need to find the first j_start >3.\n\nSince the list is [5,1,1], the first element is5>3. So, the index is0.\n\nSo, in the suffix_min array, the minimal cost is suffix_min[0]=1.\n\nSo, the total cost is4+1=5.\n\nWhich is the sample's answer.\n\nSimilarly, when processing the third voucher (v3: l=5, r=6, costi=1, di=2).\n\nrequired_d=5-2=3.\n\nCheck group3, which has one voucher.\n\nCase1: j ends before5.\n\nIn group3, the only voucher ends at3. So j_end=3 <=5-1=4.\n\nSo, case1: j exists. The cost is4 (from group3's prefix_min[0]=4). So total is1+4=5.\n\nWait, but group3's sortedEnds has only one voucher, so case1 is applicable. So the minimal cost is4.\n\nSo, adding to the global_min.\n\nBut since the first case already gives 5, which is the minimal.\n\nSo, the code correctly finds the minimal cost.\n\nAnother test case: the second sample.\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\nEach voucher has duration 3. So for each voucher, required_d=2-3=-1, which is invalid. So no pairs possible. Output is -1.\n\nSo, the code correctly returns -1.\n\nNow, what about edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: All vouchers have duration x/2.\n\nBut they don't overlap. So for each i, j is in the same group (x/2) and non-overlapping. So, the code should find the pair with the minimal cost.\n\nEdge Case 2: Some vouchers are completely before others, some after.\n\nBut the code should handle that via binary search.\n\nAnother Edge Case: Vouchers with same start and end times.\n\nNo, but the code should still handle them.\n\nPotential Issues:\n\n- Overflow: but in Python, integers are unbounded.\n\n- Time constraints: since for each voucher, two binary searches are performed, each taking O(log n) time, and n is up to 2e5, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nWait, in the code, for each group, the sortedStarts are stored as a list of vouchers, but in the binary search, I'm using the start times. So perhaps it's better to precompute a separate list of start times for each group, to avoid having to extract the l each time.\n\nYes, that's a good optimization.\n\nSo, during preprocessing:\n\nFor each group:\n\n- sortedEnds: list of vouchers, sorted by r.\n\n- prefix_min: list of min costs.\n\n- sortedStarts: list of vouchers, sorted by (-l, c).\n\n- suffix_min: list of min costs.\n\nAlso, for each group, precompute a list of start times.\n\nSimilarly, for sortedEnds, a list of end times.\n\nSo, during preprocessing:\n\nsortedEnds = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\nend_times = [v[1] for v in sortedEnds]\n\nprefix_min = ...\n\nSimilarly, for sortedStarts:\n\nstart_times = [v[0] for v in sortedStarts]\n\nSo, in the code, during the binary search, instead of looping through the vouchers each time, we can directly use the precomputed end_times and start_times.\n\nThat's more efficient.\n\nSo, modifying the preprocessing step.\n\nRewriting the preprocessing:\n\nfor d in duration_groups:\n    group = duration_groups[d]\n    # sortedEnds: sorted by end time\n    sortedEnds = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    end_times = [v[1] for v in sortedEnds]\n    # compute prefix_min\n    prefix_min = []\n    current_min = float('inf')\n    for v in sortedEnds:\n        current_min = min(current_min, v[2])\n        prefix_min.append(current_min)\n    \n    # sortedStarts: sorted by (-l, c)\n    sortedStarts = sorted(group, key=lambda x: (-x[0], x[2]))\n    start_times = [v[0] for v in sortedStarts]\n    # compute suffix_min\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(sortedStarts)\n    current_min = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(sortedStarts)-1, -1, -1):\n        current_min = min(current_min, sortedStarts[i][2])\n        suffix_min[i] = current_min\n    \n    # store in processed_groups\n    processed_groups[d] = {\n        'end_times': end_times,\n        'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n        'start_times': start_times,\n        'suffix_min': suffix_min\n    }\n\nNow, during the binary search for case1:\n\nWe can directly use end_times and perform a binary search for li-1.\n\nSimilarly, for case2, we can use start_times and perform a binary search for ri.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nfor each voucher i:\n\nli, ri, costi, di = v\n\nrequired_d = x - di\n\nif required_d not in processed_groups:\n    continue\n\ngroup_info = processed_groups[required_d]\n\n# case1: j ends before i starts\ntarget_end = li -1\nleft = 0\nright = len(group_info['end_times']) -1\nbest = -1\nwhile left <= right:\n    mid = (left + right) //2\n    if group_info['end_times'][mid] <= target_end:\n        best = mid\n        left = mid +1\n    else:\n        right = mid -1\n\nif best != -1:\n    min_cost_case1 = group_info['prefix_min'][best]\n    total = costi + min_cost_case1\n    if total < global_min:\n        global_min = total\n\n# case2: j starts after i ends\ntarget_start = ri +1\nleft =0\nright = len(group_info['start_times']) -1\nbest = len(group_info['start_times'])\nwhile left <= right:\n    mid = (left + right) //2\n    if group_info['start_times'][mid] >= target_start:\n        best = mid\n        right = mid -1\n    else:\n        left = mid +1\n\nif best < len(group_info['start_times']):\n    min_cost_case2 = group_info['suffix_min'][best]\n    total = costi + min_cost_case2\n    if total < global_min:\n        global_min = total\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo, now, putting it all together.\n\nImplementing the code.\n\nTesting the code.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when required_d is 0 or negative. Because x can be 0, but according to the problem statement, x is at least 2, because n is at least 2 and x is at least 2.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: n and x are given as 2<=n, x <= 2e5. So x is at least 2.\n\nSo, required_d can't be zero, because di can be at least 1 (since li<=ri, so duration is at least 1). So x - di can be as small as x- (2e5). But in code, we can proceed as is.\n\nAnother point: the same voucher can't be chosen twice. But in our code, since i and j are two different vouchers, and j is in a different group unless required_d is equal to di.\n\nWait, for example, if di is x/2, then required_d is x/2. So, j can be in the same group as i. But in that case, the code allows j to be any voucher in the same group, including itself. But since the code is processing each voucher as i, and j is another voucher in the same group, but in the code, j is allowed to be the same as i only if i and j are different.\n\nWait, no: because when i is processed, j can't be i. Because group is built for all vouchers, including i.\n\nWait, suppose group is d, and i is in group d. When processing i, required_d is x - di, which is also d. So, j can be in the same group as i. But j can be i itself, leading to the same voucher being considered, which is invalid.\n\nSo, the code needs to ensure that j is not i.\n\nHow can this happen?\n\nSuppose x=4, di=2, so required_d=2.\n\nIf the group has two vouchers, i and j, both with duration 2, and they are non-overlapping.\n\nBut in the code, when i is processed, j is considered, and when j is processed, i is considered.\n\nBut in the code, when i is processed, j is another voucher in the same group. But j can be i, which is invalid.\n\nSo, in the code, when required_d is equal to di, we need to ensure that j is not i.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, no. Because i is in the group of required_d, but j must be a different voucher. So, in the code, when required_d is equal to di, and the group includes i, when we process case1 and case2, j could be i.\n\nThus, the code will incorrectly count i and i as a valid pair.\n\nThis is a bug.\n\nSo, how to fix this.\n\nSolution: when required_d == di, and the group is the same as i's group, when processing i, we need to exclude i itself when looking for j.\n\nSo, for case1 and case2, when the group is the same as i's group, we have to make sure that j is not i.\n\nBut how?\n\nHmm, perhaps during the binary search, we can check whether the voucher at the found index is the same as i.\n\nAlternatively, when the group is the same as i's group, we can split the group into two parts: vouchers before i and after i.\n\nBut that complicates things.\n\nAlternative approach: when required_d == di, during case1 and case2, when j is in the same group as i, we need to ensure that j is not i.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nHmm, perhaps when required_d == di, when processing i, for case1 and case2, we can modify the binary search to exclude i.\n\nBut this seems tricky.\n\nAlternative approach: when required_d is x, but when the vouchers are non-overlapping, the sum of their durations must be x, but the durations must be x, and the sum is x.\n\nWait, perhaps the code doesn't allow choosing the same voucher twice, but according to the problem statement, the two vouchers must be different.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is that the code allows choosing the same voucher twice. So, the code should be modified to ensure that the two vouchers are different.\n\nWait, the problem says: choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i≠j). So, the two vouchers must be different.\n\nSo, the code as is currently allows selecting the same voucher twice, but in the problem, that is not allowed. So, in the code, for each pair i and j, it's allowed to select the same voucher twice, but that's incorrect.\n\nWait, the problem states: choose two different vouchers. So, the two vouchers must be different.\n\nSo, in the code, when considering vouchers j, we need to ensure that i and j are different.\n\nSo, when required_d == di and the vouchers are non-overlapping, but i and j are same, that is, the same voucher.\n\nSo, the code as is may include cases where i and j are the same voucher, leading to a situation where the two vouchers are the same, which is invalid.\n\nSo, how to handle that.\n\nThus, in the code, when selecting j, we must ensure that i and j are different.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's specified that the two vouchers must be different. So, i and j must be different.\n\nThus, the code needs to consider that.\n\nBut in the code, when i and j are the same voucher, but same voucher, but it's impossible to choose two.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the two vouchers must be different.\n\nSo, in the code, for each pair of i and j, i and j must be different.\n\nSo, the problem is to find two distinct vouchers.\n\nWait, but in the code, the vouchers are being considered as per the input. So, for each voucher i, we process j's in the required_d group.\n\nBut when required_d equals di, j's are in the same group as i.\n\nThus, when required_d == di, and the group is the same as i's group, j can be i itself, which is invalid.\n\nSo, to avoid that, perhaps during the case when required_d == di, we need to process j's in the group, but exclude i.\n\nBut that's difficult.\n\nAlternative idea: when required_d == di, and during case1 and case2, when j is found, ensure that j is not i.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, when required_d == di, the group is the same as i's group, so when processing j's, we can check if j is i.\n\nBut during the binary search, it",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers such that their total duration equals the given vacation duration and their combined cost is minimal. The solution involves efficiently searching for these vouchers using preprocessing and binary search techniques.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Preprocessing Vouchers**: Each voucher is categorized by its duration. For each duration group, we preprocess the vouchers to quickly find the minimum cost for non-overlapping pairs.\n2. **Sorting and Precomputing Minima**: For each duration group, we sort the vouchers by their end times and start times. We also precompute prefix and suffix minima arrays to quickly determine the minimum cost for valid pairs.\n3. **Binary Search for Non-Overlapping Pairs**: For each voucher, we use binary search to find compatible vouchers in the required duration group that either end before the current voucher starts or start after the current voucher ends.
