He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Rudolf and Snowflakes, hard version. Hmm. From the description, it says that a snowflake is an undirected graph constructed in a specific way. \n\nLet me try to understand the structure of a snowflake. The initial step is one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to it, where k must be greater than 1. So after this first step, we have 1 + k vertices. Then, for each vertex that has only one edge (so these are the leaves from the initial step), we connect them to k new vertices. And importantly, this second step must be done at least once.\n\nWait, so the process is: start with 1 node. Add k children, making it 1 + k. Then, for each of those k nodes, add k children each. But wait, no—because in the next step, each node that has only one edge (i.e., the leaves) must add k new children. So the second step is applied to all the leaves from the first step. So the third step would apply to the leaves added in the second step, and so on?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. The initial step creates a root connected to k children. So those k nodes have degree 1. Then, each of them must add k new children. So in the second step, each of the k nodes adds k children, making each of them have k+1 edges (one to the root, k to their own children). Now, those new nodes are leaves. So the next step would require each of them to add k children as well. But wait, the problem statement says that the second step is done at least once. So the minimal snowflake requires the second step, but perhaps more steps are allowed.\n\nSo the snowflake can have multiple layers beyond the second step. For example, in the minimal case, it's just two steps: root, then its children, then their children. Wait, no—no, because the second step is the addition of children to the initial k nodes. So the minimal snowflake has the root, k children, and each of those children has k children. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k*k.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, when n=9, the output is NO. Let's see: if k=2, the minimal would be 1+2+4=7. If k=3, 1+3+9=13. Wait, but 9 is not 1+2+4, which is 7, but 9 is 1+2+6? No, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-calculate. The initial step is 1 node. Then, step 1: add k children. So now, 1 +k nodes. Then, step 2: each of these k nodes adds k children. So that's adding k*k nodes. So total nodes after step 2: 1 +k +k^2. But the problem says that step 2 must be done at least once. So the minimal case is step 1 and step 2.\n\nWait, but then the minimal for k=2 would be 1+2+4=7 nodes. So for n=7, the answer would be YES. But in the sample input, when n=9, the output is NO. Let's see why.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Because the problem allows for the snowflake to have more steps beyond the second. So for example, if after step 2, each of the new nodes also adds k children, that's another step. So the total number of nodes would be 1 +k +k² +k³ + ... up to some m steps.\n\nWait, but how many steps can there be? Because each step doubles the number of leaves. So for a given k, the number of nodes after m steps is 1 +k*( (k^m -1)/(k-1) ) ). Or maybe I should model the total as follows:\n\nEach time, the number of new nodes added is multiplied by k. So the total is 1 + k + k² + k³ + ... +k^m, where m is the number of steps beyond the initial. Wait, no. Because the initial step is 1 node. Then, step 1: add k, total 1+k. Step 2: each of the k nodes adds k, so add k^2, total 1 +k +k². Step 3: each of the k² nodes adds k, so add k³, total 1 +k +k² +k³. And so on.\n\nBut the problem says that step 2 (the second step) must be done at least once. So the minimal is 1 +k +k².\n\nWait, but the sample input includes n=6. The output is NO. Let's see: for k=2, 1+2+4=7. So 6 is less than 7, so no. For k=3, 1+3+9=13. So 6 is not possible. So yes, output is NO.\n\nSo the approach is: for a given n, check if there exists some k>1 and some m≥1 steps such that n = 1 +k*(k^m -1)/(k-1). Because m is the number of steps after the initial.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the formula for the sum 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for the snowflake, the number of nodes is equal to 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m is the number of steps beyond the initial. Because the initial is step 0: 1 node. Then step 1 adds k nodes, step 2 adds k², etc.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial is 1 node. Step 1 adds k nodes, making it 1+k. Step 2 adds k² nodes, total 1 +k +k². Step 3 adds k³, and so on. So for the snowflake, the number of nodes is 1 +k*(1 +k +k² +...+k^{m-1}), where m is the number of steps after the initial step 1.\n\nAlternatively, the number of nodes is 1 +k*( (k^m -1)/(k-1) ), where m is the number of times we've added the next layer. Because step 1 is adding k, step 2 is adding k², step m is adding k^m.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as the sum S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^t, where t is the number of steps. Since step 1 adds k, step 2 adds k², etc. So the total is S = (k^{t+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut for the snowflake to exist, the process must have at least two steps. Because the problem states that step 2 must be done at least once. So t must be ≥2.\n\nWait, no. Let me read the problem statement again. The process is: initially, the graph has one vertex. Then, the initial vertex is connected to k new ones (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected by only one edge (i.e., the leaves) is connected to k new ones. This step is done at least once. So the minimal snowflake has the initial step (adding k), and then the step of adding k children to each of the k nodes. So that's two steps. So t=2, because the sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for any n that can be written as 1 +k +k² + ... +k^t, where t≥2, then the answer is YES.\n\nWait, but wait. After the second step, do we stop? Or can we have more steps? For example, after the second step, each of the new leaves (k² nodes) can also add k children. So that's a third step. So t can be 3, 4, etc.\n\nSo the general form is n = 1 +k*(1 +k +k² + ... +k^{t-1}), where t is the number of steps beyond the initial step. Or perhaps it's better to model it as n = 1 + k*( (k^t -1)/(k-1) ), where t is the number of steps after the initial.\n\nWait, maybe the correct formula is n = 1 + k * s, where s is the sum of a geometric series. Let's think about it step by step.\n\nInitial step: 1 node. So count is 1.\n\nStep 1: add k nodes. Now count is 1 +k.\n\nStep 2: each of the k nodes adds k children. So add k². Count is 1 +k +k².\n\nStep 3: each of the k² nodes adds k children. Add k³. Count is 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nAnd so on. So the total is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^t, where t is the number of steps, including step 1, 2, etc.\n\nBut the problem says that step 2 must be done at least once. So t must be at least 2. So for t=2, the sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for each n, we need to check whether n can be written as 1 +k +k² + ... +k^t, where t≥2, and k>1.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, when n=255, the output is YES. Let's see: 255 is 256-1, which is 2^8 -1. So 255=1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128. That's 8 terms. So t=8, but for k=2, t=8. So it's acceptable because t is at least 2.\n\nWait, but wait: 255 is 1 + 2 +4 + ... + 128. So the sum is 255, which is 2^8 -1. So the sum is 1 + 2*(2^7 -1)/(2-1) = 1 + 2*127 = 255. So yes, n=255 is 1 +2*(2^7), but wait, no, because 2^7 is 128. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.\n\nAlternatively, 255 = 1 +2 +4 +8 +16 +32 +64 +128. So the sum is 1 + sum_{i=1}^8 2^{i-1} = 1 + (2^8 -1)/(2-1) - 1? Wait, no. Because sum from i=0 to t of 2^i is 2^{t+1} -1. So sum from i=1 to t of 2^i is 2^{t+1} -1 -1 = 2^{t+1}-2. So 1 + (2^{t+1} -2) = 2^{t+1} -1. So for t=7 steps (since step 1 is adding 2, step 2 adds 4, etc.), the sum is 2^8 -1 = 255.\n\nSo in this case, t=7 steps. Which is >=2. So yes.\n\nSo the task is to determine, for a given n, whether there exists a k>1 and t>=2 such that n = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^t.\n\nSo the approach is: for each n, find if there exists a k>1 and t>=2 where n equals the sum above.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this efficiently for large n (up to 1e18). So for each test case, we need to check for possible k and t.\n\nWhat are the possible values of k? Well, k must be at least 2, and for each possible k, we can compute whether n can be represented as the sum.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need an efficient way.\n\nAnother observation: for each k, the sum S(t) = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^t.\n\nWe can precompute for various k's whether n is achievable.\n\nBut considering that k can be up to sqrt(n), which is up to 1e9 for n=1e18, iterating through all possible k's for each n is not feasible for t up to 1e4 test cases.\n\nWait, but for each n, the maximum possible k is when t=2. So for t=2, S=1 +k +k² = n. So solving for k: k² +k +1 =n. So k^2 ≈n. So for each n, we can check for t=2, t=3, etc., but up to some limit.\n\nWait, but even for t=60, the sum could be larger than 1e18, so for each n, we can iterate over possible t's and see if for any t, there's a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut for each t, we can binary search for k.\n\nWait, here's an idea: for each possible t (starting from 2 upwards), compute the maximum possible k for which the sum S(t) <= n, and see if any of these sums equal n.\n\nBut how high can t be? Because for t=60, k=2 gives sum around 2^61, which is way larger than 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, t can't be larger than about 60.\n\nSo for each n, iterate t from 2 up to log_2(n), and for each t, check if there's a k>1 such that 1 +k +k² + ... +k^t =n.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nFor a given t, the sum S(t) is (k^{t+1} -1)/(k-1). So for fixed t, we can write this equation and solve for k.\n\nBut solving for k in integers may be tricky. Alternatively, for each t, perform a binary search on k to see if S(t) equals n.\n\nWait, but for each t, the minimal possible k is 2, and the maximum possible k is such that S(t) <=n.\n\nSo for each t from 2 up to max_t (say, 60), we can perform a binary search for k in [2, ... , upper_bound], where upper_bound is such that S(t) <=n.\n\nBut how to compute S(t) for a given k and t? For large t, k^t can be very big, but since n is up to 1e18, for t up to 60, even for k=2, 2^60 is about 1e18, which is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- If n < 3: return NO, since the minimal is 1+2+4=7.\n\nWait, n=3: 1+2=3. But wait, no—the initial step is 1 node, then step 1 adds 2, making 3. But according to the problem statement, step 2 must be done at least once. So n=3 is 1+2=3, but that's only after step 1. So step 2 isn't done. So n=3 is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, n=4: 1+2+4=7 is too big, but 1+2=3 is step 1 only, so invalid.\n\nSo for n < 7, it's impossible except for n=1, which is trivial but step 1 hasn't been done.\n\nWait, let's see the minimal possible n: it's 1 +k +k². For k=2, it's 7. So any n <7 is automatically NO.\n\nSo for the code:\n\nLoop through each test case:\n\nif n <7: output NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for t in 2 to 60:\n\n       compute the sum S(t) for some k.\n\n       find if there's a k>1 such that S(t) =n.\n\n       if found, return YES.\n\n   after all t, if none found, return NO.\n\nBut how to compute for each t and k.\n\nSo for each t, perform a binary search on k between 2 and some upper limit.\n\nThe sum S(t) is (k^(t+1) -1)/(k-1). We can compute this for given k and t, but for large exponents, this might cause overflow. So in code, we can compute it iteratively and check if it exceeds n.\n\nWait, but for a given k and t, the sum S(t) can be computed as:\n\nsum =1\n\ncurrent =1\n\nfor i in 1 to t:\n\n    current *=k\n\n    sum += current\n\nSo for each step i, we multiply current by k and add to sum.\n\nBut if during this computation sum exceeds n, we can break early and return that for this k and t, S(t) >n.\n\nThis way, we can avoid computing very large numbers.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each n:\n\nif n <7: output NO.\n\nElse:\n\n   for t from 2 to 60:\n\n       low =2, high= ?\n\n       while low <=high:\n\n           mid = (low+high)//2\n\n           compute s=1 + mid + mid^2 + ... +mid^t\n\n           if s ==n: return YES.\n\n           elif s <n: try higher k.\n\n               low=mid+1.\n\n           else: try lower k.\n\n               high=mid-1.\n\n   if none found, output NO.\n\nWait, but for each t, we can compute the maximum possible k for which S(t) <=n. So for each t, the maximum k is such that S(t) =1 +k +k² + ... +k^t <=n.\n\nSo for each t, binary search k in [2, ... ,k_max], where k_max is such that S(t) <=n.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nif n <7: output NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for t in 2 to 60:\n\n       compute the maximum possible k for this t.\n\n       if for any k, S(t) ==n: output YES.\n\n   after checking all t, output NO.\n\nSo the key is to implement the function that, given t and k, computes S(t) efficiently without overflowing.\n\nSo in Python, for each t and mid=k, compute the sum step by step:\n\nsum_val =1\n\ncurrent =1\n\nfor i in range(1, t+1):\n\n    current *=mid\n\n    sum_val += current\n\n    if sum_val >n:\n\n        break\n\nif sum_val ==n: return True.\n\nElse, adjust binary search accordingly.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nLet's see:\n\nFor n=13:\n\nCheck t=2: S(t)=1 +k +k²=13.\n\nSolve k² +k +1=13 → k² +k -12=0 → k=(sqrt(49)-1)/2= (7-1)/2=3. So k=3. So yes, t=2, k=3. So output YES.\n\nFor n=15:\n\nt=2: 1 +k +k² =15 →k² +k -14=0 →k=(sqrt(57)-1)/2≈3.274. Not integer.\n\nt=3: 1 +k +k² +k^3=15.\n\nTry k=2: 1+2+4+8=15. Yes! So t=3, k=2. So output YES.\n\nn=255: t=7, k=2.\n\nAs discussed earlier.\n\nn=10101: Let's see.\n\nCheck t=2: 1 +k +k² =10101 →k² +k -10100=0 → discriminant is 1+40400=40401 → sqrt(40401)=201. So k=(201-1)/2=100. So k=100. So yes, t=2.\n\nWait, 100² is 10000, plus 100 is 10100, plus 1 is 10101. So yes.\n\nSo output is YES.\n\nn=1e18:\n\nCheck t=2: 1 +k +k²=1e18 →k² +k -1e18 +1=0 → discriminant is 1 +4*(1e18-1) = 4e18-3. Square root is about 2e9. So k=(sqrt(discriminant)-1)/2 → which is (2e9-1)/2 ~1e9-0.5. So k is around 1e9. Check if 1 +k +k² =1e18.\n\nBut k² is 1e18, so k is about 1e9. So 1 +1e9 +1e18 = 1e18 + 1e9 +1. Which is larger than 1e18. So no.\n\nCheck t=3: 1 +k +k² +k^3 =1e18.\n\nBut for k=999999, let's compute:\n\nk=999999:\n\nk^3 is 999999^3 = approx 1e18, but 999,999^3 is 999997000002999 (I think), which is just under 1e18.\n\nBut 1 +999999 +999999² +999999^3 = 1 +999999 + 999998000001 + 999999^3. Hmm, this is way larger than 1e18. So probably t=3 won't work.\n\nWait, perhaps for larger t.\n\nWait, but for each t, the maximum possible sum for k=2 is 2^{t+1} -1. So for t=60, 2^61 is about 2e18, which is larger than 1e18.\n\nSo for t=59: 2^60 is about 1e18. So 2^60 -1 is about 1e18. So 1 +2 +4 +... +2^59 = 2^60 -1 =1,152,921,504,606,846,975, which is larger than 1e18.\n\nSo for n=1e18, perhaps it's not possible.\n\nBut let's see: for t=2, the equation is 1 +k +k² =1e18. As before, k is about 316227766. So compute 316227766^2 is (approx) 1e11. Wait, no—wait, 316227766 squared is about (3.16e8)^2 = 1e17, which is much less than 1e18. So 1 +k +k² would be about 1e17, which is way less than 1e18. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps for larger t.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps n=1e18 is not representable as any S(t) for t>=2.\n\nThus, the output is NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle the sample correctly.\n\nNow, what about other test cases.\n\nFor n=7: it's 1+2+4=7. So t=2, k=2. So output YES.\n\nn=13: as before.\n\nn=255: yes.\n\nn=15: yes.\n\nn=10101: yes.\n\nn=1000000000000000000: no.\n\nSo, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, the code needs to loop for t from 2 up to 60 or so. For each t, perform a binary search on k in [2, ... , some upper bound]. For each k in the binary search, compute S(t) step by step, adding each term until it exceeds n, then break and compare.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each test case:\n\n   n = int(input())\n\n   if n < 7:\n\n       print(\"NO\")\n\n   else:\n\n       found = False\n\n       for t in range(2, 60+1):  # t from 2 to 60.\n\n           # Binary search for k.\n\n           low =2\n\n           high = n-1  # because k must be at least 2, and for t=2, k^2 +k +1 <=n.\n\n           while low <= high:\n\n               mid = (low + high) //2\n\n               s =1\n\n               current =1\n\n               for i in range(1, t+1):\n\n                   current *= mid\n\n                   s += current\n\n                   if s >n:\n\n                       break\n\n               if s ==n:\n\n                   found =True\n\n                   break\n\n               elif s <n:\n\n                   low = mid +1\n\n               else:\n\n                   high = mid -1\n\n           if found:\n\n               break\n\n       print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n\nWait, but for t=60, the loop inside the binary search will run 60 times, which is manageable.\n\nBut for n=1e18, t can be up to 60, and for each t, the binary search may take up to log2(1e9) steps, which is about 30. So per test case, 60 *30 *60 = 108,000 operations. For t=1e4 test cases, it's about 1e9 operations, which is too much.\n\nWait, but 1e4 *60*30*60 is 108,000,000 operations. Which is manageable in Python.\n\nWait, no: 1e4 is 10,000 test cases. Each test case may have 60 t's, each requiring 30 binary search steps, each with 60 steps in the sum calculation. So 10,000 *60*30*60 = 10,000 *108,000= 1,080,000,000 operations. That's about a billion operations. Which may be too slow for Python.\n\nHmm. So perhaps we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative approach: precompute all possible t and k where S(t) could be up to 1e18, and store all possible S(t). Then, for each n, check if it's present in the set.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, but for t up to 60 and k up to 2e9, the number of possible S(t) is huge. So it's not feasible to precompute all.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible t, compute the maximum possible k that could be tried. Since for each t, the sum increases with k, perhaps we can find an upper bound for k quickly.\n\nWait, for a given t, the minimal sum is when k=2: S(t) =2^{t+1} -1.\n\nSo for S(t) <=n, 2^{t+1} -1 <=n → t+1 <= log2(n+1) → t <= log2(n+1) -1.\n\nThus, for a given n, the maximum t to consider is up to log2(n+1) -1. For n=1e18, log2 is about 60, so t can go up to 60.\n\nWhich is what the code does.\n\nBut perhaps the binary search can be optimized.\n\nWait, but for each t, the binary search for k can be limited.\n\nBecause for each t, the sum S(t) increases as k increases. So for a given t, the maximum possible k is such that 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^t <=n.\n\nBut even so, the binary search is O(log(max_k)), which is about 30 steps.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother optimization: for each t, the maximum possible k is bounded by the condition that k^t <=n.\n\nBecause S(t) =1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^t <=1 +k*(k^t) [since k^2 + ... +k^t =k(k^t -1)/(k-1) <=k^t when k>=2].\n\nSo 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^t <=1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^t <=1 +k*(k^t).\n\nWe can set this <=n → k^t <=n.\n\nThus, for each t, the maximum possible k is floor(n^(1/t)).\n\nBut for t=2, it's sqrt(n). For t=60, it's n^(1/60), which is small.\n\nSo for each t, the binary search for k can be limited to up to min(n, n^(1/t)). But even so, for t=2, the binary search could be up to 1e9, which is 30 steps.\n\nWait, but for each t, the maximum possible k is such that k^t <=n. So for t=2, k can be up to sqrt(n), but for t=3, cube root, etc.\n\nSo perhaps for each t, compute the upper bound as the integer part of n^(1/t), and set high as that.\n\nThis can significantly reduce the number of steps in binary search for each t.\n\nFor example, for t=2, high is sqrt(n) which is up to 1e9 for n=1e18. But for t=20, n^(1/20) is about 3 for 1e18, since 3^20 is ~3.48e9, which is less than 1e18. Wait, no: 3^20 is 3,486,784,401 which is about 3.5e9. So 3^20 is less than 1e18. So for t=20, the upper bound is about 1e9^(1/20) is about 3. So high can be set to 3, which reduces the binary search steps.\n\nSo for each t, compute the upper bound as the integer part of (n)^(1/t), and set high to that.\n\nThus, in code, for each t, compute the maximum possible k as:\n\nmax_k = int(n ** (1.0 / t)) + 2  # Adding 2 to account for possible rounding errors.\n\nThen, high = max_k.\n\nSo, in the code, for each t:\n\nlow =2\n\nhigh = max_k\n\nBut how to compute max_k accurately?\n\nIn Python, using the ** operator may have precision issues for large t. Alternatively, use binary search to find the maximum k where k^t <=n.\n\nBut that would take O(log(max_k)) time for each t, which is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each t, compute the maximum k via binary search.\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated. Perhaps for the purposes of this problem, it's better to proceed with the initial approach, as the code is manageable.\n\nBut wait, for n=1e18 and t=2, the binary search for k would have high=1e9, leading to 30 steps. For t=60, high is about 3, so 2 steps.\n\nThus, the average number of steps per t is manageable.\n\nTesting the code for the sample input, as per the code outline, seems to work.\n\nNow, let's think about some edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=7 → YES.\n\nCase 2: n=8 → 1+2+4=7, next step adds 8 (step 2: each of 2 nodes adds 2 children: 2*2=4, 7+4=11. So for n=8, can it be achieved?\n\nWait, 8 is not equal to 1+2+4=7, nor 1+2+4+8=15. So for n=8, no.\n\nWait, but 8 can be written as 1 +3 +3²=1+3+9=13, which is larger than 8. So no.\n\nThus, n=8 is NO.\n\nAnother case: n=15.\n\nAs before, t=3, k=2: 1+2+4+8=15. So YES.\n\nAnother case: n=31.\n\nCheck t=2: 1 +k +k²=31 →k² +k -30=0 →k=5, since 5²+5=30. So 1+5+25=31. So YES.\n\nAnother case: n= 1 +2 +4 +8 +16 +32 +64 +128= 255. So YES.\n\nn= 1 +2 +4 +8 +16 +32 +64 +128 +256=511. So t=8, k=2: YES.\n\nn= 1 +3 +9 +27 +81 +243 +729 +2187 +6561 +19683= ?\n\nWait, for t=9 steps (including step 1), sum is 1+3+9+...+3^9 = (3^10 -1)/(3-1) = (59049-1)/2=29524. So 29524 is the sum for t=9, k=3. So n=29524: YES.\n\nThus, the code should find this.\n\nNow, let's implement the code.\n\nBut in Python, handling big exponents could be an issue. However, in the code, during the sum computation, we break early if the sum exceeds n.\n\nThus, the code should be safe.\n\nSo the code will look like this:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\nif n <7: print NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for t in 2 to 60:\n\n       low=2, high=?\n\n       perform binary search for k.\n\n       compute sum for k and t.\n\n       if sum equals n, return YES.\n\nAfter all t's, return NO.\n\nNow, implementing this.\n\nWait, but for t=2, the maximum possible k is sqrt(n-1) because 1 +k +k² <=n →k² +k <=n-1. So the maximum k is roughly sqrt(n-1). So in the code, for each t, compute high as the integer part of (n)^(1/t) plus 1.\n\nBut perhaps for each t, compute high as the maximum possible k that could possibly satisfy S(t) =n.\n\nAlternatively, for each t, set high to n-1, because for k=n-1 and t=2, 1 +k +k² would be way larger than n.\n\nBut for the sake of speed, perhaps setting high as min(n, n^(1/t) +1) is better.\n\nBut in practice, the binary search may not take that long.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as written.\n\nAnother thing to note: for each t, if t is such that 2^{t+1} -1 >n, then for k=2, the sum is larger than n, so no need to check for larger t.\n\nWait, for example, n=15.\n\nt=2: 2^3-1=7<=15: so check.\n\nt=3: 2^4-1=15<=15: check.\n\nt=4: 2^5-1=31>15: no need to check for t=4, because for k=2, S(4)=31>15.\n\nThus, in the code, for each t, if 2^{t+1} -1 >n, then for k=2, S(t) is already larger than n, so no possible k can make S(t) =n. So we can skip such t's.\n\nThus, the code can precompute for each t whether 2^{t+1} -1 <=n. If not, skip.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor t in 2 to 60:\n\n   if (2**(t+1) -1) >n:\n\n       continue\n\n   else:\n\n       proceed with binary search.\n\nThis can save some iterations for larger t's.\n\nThus, the code can be optimized by adding this condition.\n\nSo the modified code:\n\nfor each t in 2..60:\n\n   if (2^(t+1) -1) >n: continue.\n\n   else: binary search for k.\n\nThus, this will save some cycles.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe Python code:\n\nRead t.\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = int(input().strip())\n\n    if n <7:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        continue\n\n    found = False\n\n    for t_val in range(2, 61):\n\n        # Compute whether 2^(t_val+1) -1 >n.\n\n        if ( (1 << (t_val+1)) ) -1 >n:\n\n            continue\n\n        # Binary search for k.\n\n        low =2\n\n        high = n-1\n\n        while low <= high:\n\n            mid = (low + high) //2\n\n            s =1\n\n            current =1\n\n            for i in range(1, t_val+1):\n\n                current *= mid\n\n                s += current\n\n                if s >n:\n\n                    break\n\n            if s ==n:\n\n                found =True\n\n                break\n\n            elif s <n:\n\n                low = mid +1\n\n            else:\n\n                high = mid -1\n\n        if found:\n\n            break\n\n    print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n\nWait, but for t_val=2, 2^(3)-1=7. So for n=7, 2^3-1=7<=7, so proceed.\n\nBut for n=7, the code will find k=2.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting for n=7:\n\nt_val=2:\n\nbinary search for k:\n\nlow=2, high=6.\n\nmid=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with exactly `n` vertices can exist. A snowflake graph is defined by specific rules for adding vertices and edges, which must be followed strictly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - A snowflake graph starts with one vertex.\n   - It then adds `k` new vertices connected to the initial vertex.\n   - Each of these `k` vertices must then add `k` new vertices in the next step, and this process continues at least once.\n   - The total number of vertices after `t` steps (including the initial vertex) is given by the sum of a geometric series: \\(1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t\\).\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - For a given `n`, we need to check if there exists an integer `k > 1` and an integer `t >= 2` such that \\(n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t\\).\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each test case, iterate over possible values of `t` from 2 up to a reasonable upper limit (we use 60 as it covers all possible values for `n` up to \\(10^{18}\\)).\n   - For each `t`, perform a binary search on possible values of `k` to check if the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n\n4. **Optimization**:\n   - For each `t`, compute the maximum possible value of `k` using the condition that the sum of the series must not exceed `n`.
