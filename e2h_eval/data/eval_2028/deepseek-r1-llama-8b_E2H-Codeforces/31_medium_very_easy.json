Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Cards.\" Hmm. Let me read the description carefully.\n\nSo, Vanya has some cards with numbers on them. Each number can be positive, negative, or zero, but their absolute value doesn't exceed x. Natasha hid all his cards, but he found n of them. He wants the sum of all the found cards to be zero. But right now, the sum isn't zero. So, he needs to find some more cards (from the infinite supply of -x to x) to add to the found ones so that the total sum is zero. Our task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nWait, but how do we determine which cards to add? Because each card can have any value as long as it's within [-x, x], but in such a way that the sum becomes zero with as few cards as possible.\n\nLet me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. We need to make the total sum zero by adding some cards. So, the required sum for the added cards is -S.\n\nNow, the question is: what's the smallest number of cards needed to reach exactly -S when each card contributes at most x (in absolute value) to the sum.\n\nWait, no. Wait, each card can contribute up to x in absolute value. So, each card can add or subtract from the sum up to x. So, for example, if the required sum is 5, each card can add up to x, say x=3. Then, 5 / 3 is 1.666, so you need at least 2 cards (3 + 3 = 6, which is more than 5). Or wait, maybe not exactly. Let's think.\n\nWait, the sum of the additional cards must be equal to -S. Let's denote the required additional sum as T = -S. So, the minimal number of cards is the minimal k such that |T| ≤ k * x. Because each card can contribute at most x towards T, but in either direction. So, the minimal k is ceiling of |T| / x. Because if |T| is exactly divisible by x, then k is |T|/x. Otherwise, it's |T|/x rounded up.\n\nWait, let me test with examples.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nThe sum S is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T = -2. So |T| is 2. x is 2. So 2/2=1. So one card is enough. Which matches the sample.\n\nIn the second sample:\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nSum S is -4. So T = 4. x is 3. 4 divided by 3 is 1.333. So we need 2 cards because 3*1=3 <4, so two cards would give 6, which covers 4. So the answer is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: Suppose S is 5, x is 3. Then T is -5. So |T|=5. 5/3 is ~1.666. So ceil(5/3) is 2. So two cards: 3+2=5? Wait, but wait, each card can contribute up to 3. So yes, two cards could do 3+2=5, but wait, no, each card can be either +x or -x. Oh wait, no, each card can be any integer between -x and x. So for the sum, each card can contribute any value between -x and x. So, the maximum per card is x, the minimum is -x.\n\nSo to reach T, the minimal number of cards is the minimal k where |T| <= k * x. Because if k is the number of cards, each can contribute up to x towards T, whether positive or negative. So the sum of the added cards can be as high as k*x and as low as -k*x.\n\nWait, but if T is 5 and x is 3, then the sum of added cards can be 3+2=5, but wait, each card can only be integers, but the problem allows for any integer in [-x, x]. So 2 is allowed as a card. So yes, two cards can sum to 5 (3+2), but wait, 2 is less than x (3), so that's fine.\n\nWait, but what if T is 4, x is 3. Then 4 can be achieved with 3 + 1, but each card can only contribute up to 3. So two cards: 3 +1=4. But 1 is allowed, as it's within x.\n\nSo the key is: the minimal k is the ceiling of |T| / x.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. For example, if T is 3 and x is 3. Then k is 1. If T is 4 and x is 3, then 4/3 is 1.333, so ceil(4/3) is 2. Because two cards can contribute 3+1=4. But each card can be any integer, including 1.\n\nWait, but 1 is allowed, yes. So in this case, two cards are needed.\n\nBut wait, another way to think: the maximum sum achievable with k cards is k*x (if all are x). The minimum is -k*x. So any T within that range is possible.\n\nSo to find the minimal k such that |T| ≤ k * x.\n\nBecause if T is within that, you can choose the right combination of cards to reach T.\n\nSo the minimal k is the smallest integer k where k >= |T| / x. Since k must be an integer, it's the ceiling of |T| / x.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nIf |T| is exactly divisible by x, then k = |T| /x.\n\nOtherwise, it's the next integer.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n\n2. Compute T = -S.\n\n3. Compute |T|.\n\n4. Compute k = ceil(|T| / x).\n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? Then no additional cards are needed.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCompute S.\n\nIf S is zero: output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute T = -S.\n\nabs_T = abs(T)\n\nk = (abs_T + x -1 ) // x  # This is equivalent to ceiling division.\n\nOutput k.\n\nWait, let's test with the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, x=2\n\ncards: -1,1,2 → sum is 2.\n\nT = -2. abs_T=2.\n\nx=2.\n\n(2 + 2-1)/2 = (3)/2=1.5 → integer division gives 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, x=3\n\ncards: -2,-2 → sum is -4.\n\nT=4. abs_T=4.\n\n(4 +3-1)/3 → (6)/3=2 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: T=5, x=3.\n\nabs_T=5.\n\n(5 +3-1)/3 →7/3=2.333 → integer division is 2. So k=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWhat if T is 0? Then k is 0.\n\nWhat if T is 1 and x is 1? Then k=1.\n\nWhat if T is 0 and x is something? Output 0.\n\nAnother test case: T=0, x=100. Output is 0.\n\nWhat about when T is 0, but x is 0? Wait, but according to the problem statement, x is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read n and x.\n\n- Read the list of n integers.\n\n- Compute the sum S.\n\n- If S is zero, output 0.\n\n- Else, compute T = -S.\n\n- Compute abs_T = absolute value of T.\n\n- Compute k = (abs_T + x -1) // x.\n\n- Output k.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the output is given as a list of strings, each being a number. So for each test case, the output is a single number.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as two lines: the first line has n and x, the second line has the n numbers. So the input is just one test case, not multiple.\n\nWait, the problem shows sample inputs as two separate cases, but perhaps that's just an example. Looking at the input format:\n\nThe first line contains two integers: n and x.\n\nThe second line contains n space-separated integers.\n\nSo, it's a single test case. So, the output should be a single number.\n\nSo in code, the steps are:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of numbers.\n\nCompute S = sum of the list.\n\nIf S == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    T = -S\n\n    abs_T = abs(T)\n\n    k = (abs_T + x -1) // x\n\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says that the found cards have numbers not exceeding x in absolute value. So the initial sum S can be anything, but after adding the new cards, the total sum must be zero.\n\nSo, our approach is correct.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nIn Python, we can read the input as follows.\n\nRead the first line as n, x.\n\nThen, read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the sum.\n\nHandle the cases.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the second line is given as '3 2\\n-1 1 2' which is a string. So, in the code, we can read the entire line, split into parts, convert each to int.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_cards = sum(cards)\nif sum_cards == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    required = -sum_cards\n    abs_required = abs(required)\n    k = (abs_required + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nThat's the code.\n\nTesting it against the samples:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2\n\nsum is 2.\n\nrequired is -2 → absolute is 2.\n\nk = (2 + 2-1) //2 → 3//2=1 → output 1.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2\n\nsum is -4.\n\nrequired is 4.\n\nk = (4 +3-1)/3 →6/3=2 → output 2.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x=3.\n\nrequired is -5 → absolute 5.\n\nk=(5+3-1)/3=7/3=2.333 → floor division is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 0 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 1, x=1 → required is -1 → absolute 1 → (1+1-1)//1 =1//1=1 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 10, x=3. required is -10 → abs 10. 10/3 is 3.333 → ceil is 4. (10+3-1)=12 → 12//3=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his found cards (including the new ones) equals zero. Each card can have a number between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: Compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Required Sum**: The target sum needed from the additional cards is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Calculate Minimum Cards**: To find the minimum number of additional cards required, use the ceiling of the absolute value of the required sum divided by x. This ensures that each card contributes up to x towards the required sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent_sum = sum(cards)\n\nif current_sum == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    required = -current_sum\n    abs_required = abs(required)\n    k = (abs_required + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of found cards `n` and the maximum absolute value `x` of the numbers on the cards. It then reads the list of integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed.\n3. **Check for Zero Sum**: If the current sum is zero, no additional cards are needed, so the result is 0.\n4. **Required Sum Calculation**: If the current sum is not zero, the required sum from the additional cards is the negative of the current sum.\n5. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: The minimum number of cards is determined by dividing the absolute value of the required sum by x and taking the ceiling of this division. This is efficiently computed using integer arithmetic as `(abs_required + x - 1) // x`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the minimum number of cards efficiently and correctly.",
