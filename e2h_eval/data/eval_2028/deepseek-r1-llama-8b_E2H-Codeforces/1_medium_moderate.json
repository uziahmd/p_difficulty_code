    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem called \"Golden Plate\". Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have a rectangular plate divided into w x h cells. We need to add gilded rings, and there are k of them. The first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away from the edge, and so on. Each ring has a width of one cell. \n\nFormally, the i-th ring consists of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, why 4? Because for each ring, both the width and height decrease by 4. Oh right, because each ring adds a border around, which subtracts 2 from each side (left and right, top and bottom). So for each ring, the width and height each go down by 4, but only as long as possible.\n\nMy task is to compute the total number of cells to be gilded after adding k rings.\n\nHmm, okay. So for each ring i (from 1 to k), I need to calculate how many cells it contributes, then sum all those up.\n\nHow do I calculate the cells for each ring?\n\nLet's think about the first ring. The plate is w x h. The perimeter is 2*(w + h) - 4. Because for a rectangle, the perimeter is 2*(width + height) but since the four corners are counted twice, we subtract 4.\n\nWait, no, wait. For a grid, the number of cells in the perimeter is 2*(w + h - 2). Because for each row, there are h cells, but the top and bottom rows contribute fully, but the middle rows contribute only the first and last column. So the total is 2*w + 2*h - 4. Which simplifies to 2*(w + h - 2).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for the first ring, the number of cells is 2*(w + h - 2).\n\nWhat about the second ring? It's two cells away from the edge. So the inner rectangle becomes (w-4) x (h-4). So the perimeter would be 2*((w-4) + (h-4)) - 4 = 2*(w + h - 8) -4? Wait, no, let's compute it properly.\n\nWait, the formula for the perimeter is 2*(width + height) - 4. So for the i-th ring, the width is w - 4*(i-1), and similarly for height. So the perimeter is 2*( (w - 4*(i-1)) + (h -4*(i-1)) ) -4.\n\nWait, yes. So for each ring i, the cells added are 2 * ( (current_w + current_h) - 2 ), where current_w = w -4*(i-1), current_h = h -4*(i-1).\n\nSo the formula for each ring i is 2*( (w -4*(i-1) + h -4*(i-1)) - 2 ). Simplifying this: 2*(w + h - 8*(i-1) - 2) = 2*(w + h - 2 -8(i-1)).\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's recalculate:\n\ncurrent_w = w -4*(i-1)\ncurrent_h = h -4*(i-1)\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n= 2*( (w -4*(i-1)) + (h -4*(i-1)) - 2 )\n= 2*(w + h - 8*(i-1) -2 )\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo for each i from 1 to k, we calculate this value and sum them all.\n\nBut wait, what if i is such that current_w or current_h becomes less than 3? Because if current_w is 3, then next ring would require current_w=3-4= -1, which is invalid. So the loop should run only while current_w >=3 and current_h >=3, but since k is given as per the constraints, perhaps it's ensured that we don't go beyond that.\n\nLooking back at the input constraints: k is at most floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). Hmm, let's see. So for example, if min(w,h) is 5, then (5+1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can't be larger than that. But wait, the way the rings are formed, each ring requires subtracting 4 from both dimensions. So the maximum number of rings possible is when the current_w and current_h are at least 3, because otherwise the perimeter would be zero or invalid.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: the initial ring is 1, then 2, etc. For example, if w=3 and h=3, then k can be 1 only. Because for i=2, current_w=3-4= -1, which is invalid.\n\nSo the problem's constraints for k ensure that it doesn't go beyond what's possible. So in our code, we don't need to worry about i being too large.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read w, h, k.\n\n- For each ring from 1 to k:\n\n   - current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   - compute perimeter as 2*(current_w + current_h -2)\n\n   - add this to the total.\n\n- Sum all these perimeters and output the total.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the perimeter formula is 2*(current_w + current_h - 2). So for each ring i, it's 2*(current_w + current_h - 2) cells.\n\nSo, for example, let's take the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1.\n\ncurrent_w = 3, current_h=3.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input: 7 9 2.\n\nFirst ring: 7 and 9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2)= 2*14=28.\n\nSecond ring: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total 28+12=40. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: 7 9 1. Output is 28.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nSo the steps are straightforward.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nWe'll read the input as three integers.\n\nThen, loop from i=1 to i=k:\n\n   compute current_w = w -4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   add to the total.\n\nFinally, print the total.\n\nWait, but what if current_w or current_h becomes less than 3? Because for a ring to exist, the inner rectangle must have at least 3x3 cells, right? Because otherwise, the perimeter is not defined as a rectangle.\n\nBut according to the problem's constraints, k is chosen such that it's allowed. So the code doesn't need to handle cases where current_w or current_h is less than 3. So we can proceed safely.\n\nSo now, coding.\n\nRead the input line: split into w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total =0\n\nFor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n   cw = w -4*(i-1)\n\n   ch = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(cw + ch - 2)\n\n   total += perimeter\n\nPrint(total)\n\nThat's it.\n\nTesting with the samples:\n\nTest case 1: 3 3 1 → 8.\n\nTest case 2: 7 9 1 → 28.\n\nTest case 3: 7 9 2 → 28 + (3+5-2)*2= 28+12=40.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case: w=5, h=5, k=1.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16.\n\nk=2: 5-4=1, which is less than 3. So second ring is not allowed. So the code will compute 16 + 2*(1+1-2) → 16 + 0? Wait, no: 1+1-2 is 0, multiplied by 2 is 0.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the rings are formed as long as the inner rectangle is valid. So perhaps for i=2, current_w=1 and current_h=1, which is less than 3, so the perimeter is 2*(1+1-2)=0. So in that case, the second ring contributes 0 cells.\n\nBut according to the problem's constraints, the k is bounded such that you don't go beyond the allowed rings.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊ (min(n,m)+1)/4 ⌋\"\n\nWait, min(n,m) is 5. So (5+1)/4= 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can't be 2 in this case. So the code is safe.\n\nThus, the code correctly handles all cases within the constraints.\n\nSo the code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells that will be gilded on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is formed by the perimeter of an inner rectangle, and each subsequent ring is indented by two cells from the previous one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: Each ring is formed by the perimeter of a rectangle. The first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells inward, and so on. Each ring reduces both the width and height of the rectangle by 4 cells (2 cells from each side).\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the perimeter of the current rectangle can be calculated using the formula `2 * (width + height - 2)`. This formula accounts for the top, bottom, left, and right edges, subtracting 2 to avoid double-counting the corners.\n3. **Iterate for Each Ring**: Loop through each of the k rings, compute the perimeter for each, and sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: the width (w), height (h) of the plate, and the number of rings (k).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, calculate the current width and height by subtracting 4*(i-1) from the original dimensions.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each ring, compute the perimeter using the formula and add it to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells after processing all k rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring that each step is computed in constant time. The overall complexity is O(k), which is efficient given the constraints.",
