            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about converting a number from one base to another, but with some Roman numeral rules involved. Oh right, and the bases can be up to 25, which is manageable.\n\nThe input gives me two integers a and b. Wait, but b could be 'R', which indicates that the target base uses Roman numerals. Interesting. Then, there's a string c which is in base a. My task is to convert this into base b, but using Roman numerals if needed.\n\nLet me break this down. So first, I need to parse the input correctly. The first line has a and b, but b might be R. The second line is the number c in base a.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Read a and b. If b is R, then the output should be in Roman numerals. Otherwise, it's in base b as a decimal string.\n\n2. Convert the number c from base a to an integer (in base 10).\n\n3. Then, convert that integer to the target base (either as a decimal string or as Roman numerals if b is R).\n\nWait, but wait—no, because for cases where b is not R, the output is just the number in base b as a string without leading zeros. For example, if a is 10, b is 2, and c is 5, then 5 in base 2 is 101, so the output is '101'.\n\nBut when b is R, the output is the Roman numeral equivalent of the integer value of c.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read a and b: if b is R, then we'll process the output as Roman numerals. Else, process it as a regular number in base b.\n\nThen, read c, which is a string representing a number in base a. We need to convert this to a decimal integer.\n\nOnce we have the decimal integer, we can proceed to convert it to the target base.\n\nSo, let's think about how to handle each part.\n\nFirst, converting c from base a to a decimal integer. That's straightforward. Each digit is multiplied by a^(position) and summed up.\n\nBut wait, the digits in c can be letters? No, because the problem says that c is a non-negative integer in base a. So each character in c is a digit in base a. But wait, wait—the note says that the number won't be 0, but leading zeros are allowed. So, for example, c could be '0001' in base 10, which is 1 in decimal.\n\nSo, to convert c from base a to a decimal:\n\nLoop through each character in c, starting from the left (most significant digit). For each character, check its value as a digit in base a. Sum digit * a^power, where power starts at len(c)-1 - i for each position i.\n\nWait, but wait: no, because the leftmost digit is the most significant. So for c = \"123\" in base 10, it's 1*100 + 2*10 + 3*1 = 123.\n\nYes, so the loop would go from 0 to len(c)-1, and for each position i, the digit is multiplied by a^(len(c)-i-1).\n\nWait, no—wait, for example, for c = \"16\" in base 10, the digits are 1 and 6. The first digit (1) is at position 0, and represents 10^(1), the second digit is 6 at position 1, 10^0.\n\nSo, for i in range(len(c)), the exponent is len(c)-i-1.\n\nSo, the code for converting c to decimal would be something like:\n\ndecimal_value = 0\nfor i in range(len(c_str)):\n    digit_char = c_str[i]\n    digit = int(digit_char)\n    decimal_value += digit * (a ** (len(c_str) - i - 1))\n\nWait, but wait—what if a is larger than 10? Because in such cases, the digits can be letters, like A for 10, B for 11, etc. But in the problem statement, the input for c is given as a string, so each character is either a digit or a letter. So for example, if a is 16, then c could be 'G' which is 16 in base 10. Wait, no: wait, wait, no—wait, no, because in base a, each digit must be less than a. So, for example, if a is 16, the digits can be 0-15, which are represented as 0,1,2,...,9,A,B.\n\nSo, when a is larger than 10, each character in c can be a letter, which needs to be converted to its corresponding value.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input for c is a single non-negative integer in base a, which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. So, for each character in c, I need to determine its numerical value in base a.\n\nSo, for each character in c, whether it's a digit or a letter, we need to get its value as a base a digit.\n\nHmm. So, for example, in base 16, 'A' represents 10, 'B' 11, up to 'F' for 15.\n\nSo, the function to get the value of a character in a given base a is needed.\n\nHow do I do that?\n\nWell, for each character, if it's a digit, its value is int(char). Otherwise, if it's a letter, its value is ord(char.upper()) - ord('A') + 10.\n\nWait, but wait: in the problem statement, the example input includes 'A' as a possible digit. So yes, letters are allowed, but only for bases >=11.\n\nSo, the helper function to convert a character to its value in base a is needed.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\ndef char_to_value(c, base):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        return 10 + ord(c.upper()) - ord('A')\n\nWait, but wait: what about lowercase letters? The problem statement says the input is a string, but it's unclear. However, the sample input shows 'A' being used, and the output expects 'A' as well. So probably, the input can have uppercase letters only, but to be safe, perhaps we should convert to uppercase.\n\nSo, in the code, when processing each character in c, we can do:\n\ndigit = int(c_char) if c_char.isdigit() else (10 + ord(c_char.upper()) - ord('A'))\n\nWait, but wait: for example, in base 16, 'G' is invalid. But the problem states that the input is correct, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nSo, in the code, after reading c, for each character in c, we compute its value in base a.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, the next step is to convert it to the target base (b or R).\n\nSo, if b is not R, then we need to convert the decimal value to base b as a string.\n\nBut if b is R, then we need to convert the decimal value into Roman numerals.\n\nSo, let's think about the two cases.\n\nCase 1: b is not R. Then, we need to write the number in base b as a string, without leading zeros.\n\nCase 2: b is R. Then, we need to write the number as a Roman numeral.\n\nSo, the main steps are:\n\n1. Read a and b.\n\n2. Read c.\n\n3. Convert c to decimal value.\n\n4. Convert the decimal value to base b or Roman numerals.\n\nSo, the functions needed are:\n\n- convert_base10_to_decimal(c, a)\n\nBut wait, that's already done as above.\n\nNow, for the second step: converting the decimal value to base b or to Roman numerals.\n\nLet's tackle each case.\n\nCase 1: Base conversion.\n\nWe need to convert a decimal number to base b as a string, without leading zeros.\n\nHow to do that:\n\nWe can repeatedly divide the number by b, collecting the remainders. But the digits are collected in reverse order, so we need to reverse them at the end.\n\nFor example:\n\nnumber = 5, base = 2.\n\n5 /2= 2 rem 1\n\n2/2=1 rem 0\n\n1/2=0 rem 1\n\nDigits are [1,0,1], reversed gives 101.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, how to handle zero? Well, the problem states that the number is non-zero, so we don't have to worry about that.\n\nSo, the code for base conversion would be something like:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        digits.append(str(remainder))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nWait, but wait: if base is greater than 10, then the digits are numbers from 0 to base-1. So, for example, base 16, the digits are 0-9, A-F.\n\nSo, when appending to digits, the values are 0-9, then 10 is 'A', etc.\n\nSo, in the function, for each remainder r, if r <10, append str(r). Else, append the corresponding letter.\n\nWait, no. Because in the function above, it appends the remainder as a string, which for 10 would be '10', which is incorrect.\n\nAh, right! So, we need to convert the remainder to the appropriate character if it's >=10.\n\nSo, the function should be modified:\n\ndigits = []\nwhile n > 0:\n    remainder = n % base\n    if remainder < 10:\n        digits.append(str(remainder))\n    else:\n        digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n    n = n // base\n\nWait, but wait: for example, remainder 10: 'A', 11: 'B', etc.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for example, 10 in base 16 is 'A'.\n\nSo, the function would correctly build the string.\n\nBut then, what about when the base is 2? It works as well, since all remainders are 0 or 1, so it appends '0' or '1'.\n\nSo, the function seems correct.\n\nCase 2: Converting to Roman numerals.\n\nThis is more complicated because of the subtractive notation for certain values.\n\nSo, the standard Roman numerals use the following rules:\n\n- I = 1\n\n- V =5\n\n- X =10\n\n- L=50\n\n- C=100\n\n- D=500\n\n- M=1000\n\nEach symbol can be placed before another to indicate subtraction. For example, IV is 4 (5-1), IX is 9 (10-1), XL is 40 (50-10), etc.\n\nBut also, for numbers beyond 1000, we have multiple Ms: MMMCMXCIX is 3999.\n\nSo, the approach to convert a number to Roman numerals is to create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the value and the corresponding Roman numeral, including those that are subtracted (like 4=IV, 9=IX, etc.). The list should be ordered from highest to lowest.\n\nSo, the standard list is:\n\n[\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nWait, but wait—this includes all the special cases.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nWhile the number is greater than zero, for each value in the list, subtract as much as possible, appending the corresponding Roman numerals each time.\n\nFor example, for 1999:\n\n1999 >= 1000 → subtract 1000, add 'M', remaining 999.\n\n999 >= 900 → subtract 900, add 'CM', remaining 99.\n\n99 >= 90 → subtract 90, add 'XC', remaining 9.\n\n9 >=9 → subtract 9, add 'IX', remaining 0.\n\nSo the result is 'MCMXCIX'.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\nroman_numerals = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    res = ''\n    for value, numeral in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += numeral\n            n -= value\n        if n == 0:\n            break\n    return res\n\nWait, but wait—what about numbers like 355, which is CD.\n\nSo, the code would process 355 as follows:\n\nCheck 1000: no.\n\n900: no.\n\n500: subtract once, add D. Remaining 855.\n\nThen 400: no.\n\n100: no.\n\n90: no.\n\n50: subtract 50, add L. Remaining 805.\n\nWait, no—wait, the list is ordered from high to low. So for 355:\n\nStart with 1000: no.\n\n900: no.\n\n500: subtract once (355-500 is negative, so no. So move to next.)\n\nWait, no, 355 is less than 500. So next is 400: no.\n\nNext is 100: 355 >=100. So subtract 100 once: res becomes 'C', n is 255.\n\nNext is 90: 255 >=90 → subtract 90 once, res 'CXC', n 165.\n\nNext is 50: 165 >=50 → subtract once, res 'CXC L', n 115.\n\nWait, but 165-50=115.\n\nWait, but 165 is 50+115? No, 50*3=150, which is less than 165.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is incorrect here. Because 355 is 300 + 50 +5 → CDLV.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nn=355.\n\n1000: no.\n\n900: no.\n\n500: no.\n\n400: no.\n\n100: yes.\n\nSubtract 100, n=255. res='C'.\n\nNext, 90: 255>=90 → subtract 90, res='CXC', n=165.\n\nNext, 50: 165 >=50 → subtract 50, res='CXC L', n=115.\n\nNext, 40: 115 >=40 → subtract 40, res='CXC L XL', n=75.\n\nNext, 10: 75 >=10 → subtract 10, res='CXC L XL X', n=65.\n\nAgain, 10: subtract, res ... and so on. This will take many steps.\n\nBut that's inefficient. So, perhaps the code should process higher values first, but the way it's written, it will process each possible value step by step.\n\nWait, but wait: the code for 355 would process:\n\nAfter 100: subtract once, 255.\n\nThen 90: subtract once, 165.\n\nThen 50: subtract once, 115.\n\nThen 40: subtract once, 75.\n\nThen 10: subtract 7 times, adding 'X' each time, but that's 7 steps, which is not efficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can process each value once per iteration, but that's not the case.\n\nBut for the problem constraints, the maximum number is 300010 (if using Roman numerals), which is about 300 thousand, which is manageable.\n\nSo the code as written should work, but perhaps it's not the most efficient.\n\nBut for the problem's constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nSo, in the code, the function decimal_to_roman will take the decimal number and return the corresponding Roman numeral string.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nSo, steps for the code:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nIf the second line is empty, read it properly.\n\nWait, the input is given as lines, each line being a string. For example, the sample input is:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSo, each line is a string that may contain '\\n' as a separator.\n\nSo, the first line is '10 2\\n1', which is a=10, b=2, c='1'.\n\nSo, the code needs to split the first line into a and b.\n\nSimilarly, the second line is the c string.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nRead the first line, split into a and b.\n\nRead the second line, split into c.\n\nWait, but the second line is the c string, which may contain spaces? No, the problem says the second line is a single non-negative integer in base a. So, perhaps the second line is the entire c string, which may include letters.\n\nWait, the problem says: the second line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. So, the entire second line is the c string.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nline1 = input().strip()\n\na, b = map(int, line1.split())\n\nWait, but wait: if the second element is 'R', which is a string, not a number. So, perhaps we should read the entire line as a string, then split into parts.\n\nWait, no: the first line is two integers a and b, but the second element can be R.\n\nSo, for example, the first line is '10 2', which splits into a=10, b=2.\n\nAnother example is the sample input, which has '2 2\\n1111001', which is a=2, b=2, c='1111001'.\n\nWait, so the first line is two tokens, possibly with a being any number, and b is either a number or R.\n\nSo, perhaps, in code:\n\nline1 = input().split()\na = int(line1[0])\nb = line1[1] if line1[1] != 'R' else 'R'\n\nWait, no—because line1[1] could be a string, like '2' or 'R'. So, perhaps:\n\nparts = input().split()\na = int(parts[0])\nb = parts[1]\n\nBut wait, for the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1'—no, wait, no. The sample input is a list of lines, but in actual code, each line is read as a separate line.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\n\nThen, first line is lines[0], which is something like '10 2\\n1'?\n\nNo, wait, no. Because the first line is '10 2' followed by a newline, and then the second line is '16 R' etc. So, in code, reading via input() would give us each line as a separate string, but with the trailing \\n stripped.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can be:\n\na_b_line = input().strip()\nc_line = input().strip()\n\nThen, process a_b_line into a and b.\n\nBut a_b_line could be something like '10 2' or '16 R'.\n\nSo, in code:\n\na_str, b_str = a_b_line.split()\na = int(a_str)\nif b_str == 'R':\n    b_is_roman = True\nelse:\n    b = int(b_str)\n    b_is_roman = False\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1'? Or wait, perhaps the first line is '10 2' and the second line is '1'?\n\nNo, looking back, the sample input is given as:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWhich suggests that each line is a combination of the parameters, with the first line being '10 2\\n1'—which is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps each line is a string that represents both the a and b, and the c. Like, for example, the first line is '10 2\\n1' which is a=10, b=2, c='1'.\n\nSo, in code, perhaps:\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\na_b_c_line = lines[0].split()\na = int(a_b_c_line[0])\nb_str = a_b_c_line[1]\nc = a_b_c_line[2] if len(a_b_c_line) > 2 else ''\n\nWait, but that may not be correct, because the line could have more than two parts if c has spaces in it. But the problem states that the second line is a single non-negative integer c in base a. So, the second line is a single token, which can consist of letters and digits.\n\nThus, perhaps the code should read the first line as the a and b, and the second line as c.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfirst_line = input().strip()\na, b_part = first_line.split()\na = int(a)\nif b_part == 'R':\n    target_is_roman = True\nelse:\n    b = int(b_part)\n    target_is_roman = False\n\nc = input().strip()\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, now, processing c.\n\nWe need to convert c from base a to decimal.\n\nAs discussed earlier, for each character in c:\n\nif it's a digit, its value is int(c_char).\n\nif it's a letter, its value is 10 + (ord(c_char.upper()) - ord('A')).\n\nSo, the code for converting c to decimal:\n\ndecimal_value = 0\nfor i in range(len(c)):\n    c_char = c[i]\n    if c_char.isdigit():\n        digit = int(c_char)\n    else:\n        digit = 10 + (ord(c_char.upper()) - ord('A'))\n    # Ensure that digit is less than a\n    # But the problem says the input is correct, so we don't have to check.\n    exponent = len(c) - i -1\n    decimal_value += digit * (a ** exponent)\n\nWait, but wait: what about a=16 and c='G'? Then G is 16 in base 10, which is equal to a. So, is that allowed? Because in base 16, each digit must be less than 16. So 'G' is 16, which is equal to the base, which is invalid.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be correct. So, the code doesn't have to handle that.\n\nSo, assuming that c is a valid number in base a.\n\nOnce we have decimal_value, we need to convert it to the target base or to Roman numerals.\n\nSo, if target_is_roman is True:\n\nresult = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n\nElse:\n\nif b == 0: impossible, because b is at least 2.\n\nresult = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, b)\n\nWait, but wait: in the sample input, when a is 10 and b is 2, c is 5, which is 5 in base 10. So, converting to base 2 gives 101.\n\nAnother sample: when a is 5 and b is R, c is 4. So, 4 in base 5 is 4 in decimal, which is IV in Roman numerals.\n\nWait, no: wait, the input is 4 in base 5, which is 4 in decimal, which is IV.\n\nYes, that matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: '1111001' in base 2 is 1*(2^6) + 1*(2^5) + 1*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) + 0 + 0 +1 = 64 +32 +16 +8 +1 = 121. So, output is '121' in base 2.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, it's '1111001' as the input, and the output is '1111001', which is same as c.\n\nBecause a and b are both 2, so the number remains the same.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother sample: 'A' in base 13 is 10 in decimal. Output is 'A' in base 13.\n\nSo, the code correctly handles that.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nImplement the helper functions:\n\n- char_to_value(c_char, base): returns the integer value of the character in the given base.\n\nBut since we're handling a as the base for c, perhaps it's better to implement this within the loop.\n\nWait, perhaps during the c to decimal conversion, we can compute the value as follows:\n\ndecimal_value = 0\nfor i in range(len(c)):\n    c_char = c[i]\n    if c_char.isdigit():\n        digit = int(c_char)\n    else:\n        digit = 10 + (ord(c_char.upper()) - ord('A'))\n    exponent = len(c) - i -1\n    decimal_value += digit * (a ** exponent)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nBut wait, what about leading zeros in c?\n\nFor example, c is '0001' in base 10. The decimal value is 1.\n\nWhen converting to base 2, it should output '1'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code correctly ignores leading zeros because when building the result, it's based on the decimal_value, not the original c.\n\nNow, implementing the code.\n\nSo, the overall code structure:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nRead c.\n\nConvert c to decimal.\n\nIf b is R:\n\n   Convert decimal to Roman numerals.\n\nElse:\n\n   Convert decimal to base b as a string.\n\nPrint the result.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nBut wait, what about when a is larger than 10 and c has letters beyond a's capacity? But the problem states that the input is correct, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nFirst, import necessary modules:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res += r\n            n -= i\n        if n ==0:\n            break\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem -10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\n# Read input\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\na_b_line = lines[0]\nc_line = lines[1]\n\na_str, b_str = a_b_line.split()\na = int(a_str)\nif b_str == 'R':\n    target_is_roman = True\nelse:\n    b = int(b_str)\n    target_is_roman = False\n\nc = c_line\n\n# Convert c to decimal\ndecimal_value = 0\nfor i in range(len(c)):\n    c_char = c[i]\n    if c_char.isdigit():\n        digit = int(c_char)\n    else:\n        digit = 10 + (ord(c_char.upper()) - ord('A'))\n    exponent = len(c) - i - 1\n    decimal_value += digit * (a ** exponent)\n\n# Now, process\nif target_is_roman:\n    print(decimal_to_roman(decimal_value))\nelse:\n    print(decimal_to_base(decimal_value, b))\n\nWait, but wait: in the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1'—so a=10, b=2, c='1'.\n\nConverting c to decimal: 1 in base 10 is 1.\n\nConverting to base 2: 1 is 1, so output is '1'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: when a=16, b=R, c=5.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the first line is '16 R\\n5'—so a=16, b='R', c='5'.\n\nWait, no: wait, the sample input is given as:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSo, the second line is '16 R\\n5'—but that's for the a and b line?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the input format.\n\nWait, perhaps each line is a separate line, and the first line is a and b, the second line is c.\n\nSo, in the sample input, the first line is '10 2' and the second is '1'.\n\nWait, no, looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWhich is a list of lines. So, the first line is '10 2\\n1'—so a=10, b=2, c='1'.\n\nSecond line is '16 R\\n5'—so a=16, b='R', c='5'.\n\nThird line is '5 R\\n4'—a=5, b='R', c='4'.\n\nFourth line is '2 2\\n1111001'—a=2, b=2, c='1111001'.\n\nFifth line is '12 13\\nA'—a=12, b=13, c='A'.\n\nSo, each line is a combination of a and b, and c.\n\nBut wait, the first line is '10 2\\n1'—so after splitting, a_str is '10', b_str is '2', and the rest is '1'—but wait, the line is '10 2\\n1'—so after splitting, the parts are ['10', '2', '1']?\n\nNo, because when you split a string like '10 2\\n1' on whitespace, the split would produce ['10', '2', '1'], because the \\n is considered a whitespace.\n\nSo, the code as written would split the first line into three parts: a_str='10', b_str='2', and c='1'.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nBecause for the first line, the a and b are '10' and '2', but the rest is '1' which is c.\n\nSo, the code as written would incorrectly treat c as '1' in the first case.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the second line is the c string.\n\nSo, the first line is a and b, and the second line is c.\n\nSo, the code should read the first line as a and b, and the second line as c.\n\nBut in the sample input provided, the first line is '10 2\\n1' which would imply that the second part is '2\\n1', which would be treated as b_str='2\\n1'?\n\nWait, no. Because the code is written to read the first line as a and b, but the sample input is structured as a list of lines, each line being a combination of a, b, and c.\n\nSo, perhaps the code is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is miswritten, and each line is a separate line, but the first line is a and b, the second line is c.\n\nIn that case, the code would be correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1'—which suggests that a is 10, b is 2, and c is '1'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the second line is c.\n\nSo, perhaps in the code, the first line is a and b, and the second line is c.\n\nSo, in the code, the first line is a and b, the second line is c.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\na_b_line = lines[0].split()\na = int(a_b_line[0])\nb_str = a_b_line[1]\nc_line = lines[1]\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1'—so when split, it becomes ['10', '2', '1'], and the second line is '16 R\\n5'.\n\nSo, in this case, the code would set a=10, b_str='2', c='16 R\\n5'?\n\nNo, that's not correct.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps the problem statement is that the first line is a and b, and the second line is c.\n\nSo, regardless of the sample input, the code should read the first line as a and b, and the second line as c.\n\nSo, the sample input provided may have been misrepresented.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system. The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103.\n\nSo, the first line is a and b, the second line is c.\n\nSo, in the sample input, perhaps it's a formatting error, and the lines are:\n\nLine 1: 10 2\n\nLine 2: 1\n\nLine 3: 16 R\n\nLine 4:5\n\netc.\n\nBut in the given sample input, it's a list of lines, each being a combination.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should read the first line as a and b, and the second line as c.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\na_b_line = lines[0].split()\na = int(a_b_line[0])\nb_str = a_b_line[1]\nc = lines[1]\n\nYes, that would fix the issue.\n\nSo, in the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1'—when split, it would be ['10', '2', '1'], but the code takes a=10, b_str='2', and c=lines[1] which is '16 R\\n5'?\n\nNo, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should read the first line as a and b, and ignore any other parts in that line.\n\nBut that's not feasible because, for example, if a is 12 and b is 13, and the line is '12 13\\nA', then the third part is 'A' which would be treated as c.\n\nBut in reality, c is 'A' in base 12.\n\nWait, no, because c is in base a, which is 12, and the line is '12 13\\nA'—so the c is 'A' in base 12.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should read the first line as a and b, and the second line as c.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\na_b_line = lines[0].split()\na = int(a_b_line[0])\nb_str = a_b_line[1]\nc = lines[1]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for the first line, any extra parts after a and b are ignored, but the second line is c.\n\nThus, in the sample input:\n\nThe first line is '10 2\\n1'—so a=10, b_str='2\\n1'—but no, that can't be right.\n\nWait, no—because the first line is '10 2\\n1'—so when split(), it becomes ['10', '2', '1'].\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the first line is a and b. So, a is 10, b is '2', and the rest is part of c.\n\nBut that's not correct because the second line is supposed to be c.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should read the first line as a and b, and the second line as c.\n\nSo, the code should read the first line as a and b, and the second line as c.\n\nThus, in the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1'—but that would make a=10, b=2, and c='1'.\n\nThe second line is '16 R\\n5'—so a=16, b='R', c='5'.\n\nBut that's conflicting.\n\nSo, perhaps the sample input is not correctly structured, and the code should read the first line as a and b, the second line as c.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nSo, to recap, the code reads:\n\na = int(first line's first token)\n\nb_str = first line's second token\n\nc = second line.\n\nSo, for the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1'—so a=10, b_str='2\\n1', which is incorrect.\n\nWait, but that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is a mistake, but in the actual problem, the first line is a and b, the second line is c.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo, the code would process the first line as a and b, and the second line as c.\n\nThus, for the sample input, the first line is '10 2', the second line is '1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from one base to another, taking into account the possibility of using Roman numerals for the target base. The solution involves parsing the input, converting the given number from its source base to a decimal integer, and then converting that decimal integer to the target base or Roman numerals as required.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line contains two integers, `a` (source base) and `b` (target base). The second line contains the number `c` in base `a`.\n\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: Convert the number `c` from base `a` to a decimal integer. This involves iterating over each character of `c`, converting it to its corresponding value in base `a`, and summing up the contributions of each digit multiplied by the appropriate power of `a`.\n\n3. **Conversion to Target Base or Roman Numerals**: Depending on whether the target base `b` is 'R' (Roman numerals) or an integer, convert the decimal integer to either a string representation in base `b` or to a Roman numeral string.\n\n4. **Helper Functions**:\n   - `decimal_to_roman(n)`: Converts a decimal number to its Roman numeral representation.\n   - `decimal_to_base(n, base)`: Converts a decimal number to its string representation in the specified base.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res += r\n            n -= i\n        if n == 0:\n            break\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\n# Read input\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\nif len(lines) < 2:\n    exit()\n\na_b_line = lines[0].split()\na = int(a_b_line[0])\nb_str = a_b_line[1] if len(a_b_line) > 1 else ''\n\nc = lines[1]\n\n# Determine if target is Roman\ntarget_is_roman = b_str == 'R'\n\n# Convert c to decimal\ndecimal_value = 0\nfor i in range(len(c)):\n    c_char = c[i]\n    if c_char.isdigit():\n        digit = int(c_char)\n    else:\n        digit = 10 + (ord(c_char.upper()) - ord('A'))\n    exponent = len(c) - i - 1\n    decimal_value += digit * (a ** exponent)\n\n# Process conversion\nif target_is_roman:\n    print(decimal_to_roman(decimal_value))\nelse:\n    # Ensure b is an integer\n    b = int(b_str)\n    print(decimal_to_base(decimal_value, b))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, with the first line split into `a` and `b`, and the second line taken as `c`.\n- **Conversion to Decimal**: Each character in `c` is converted to its numerical value in base `a`, and the resulting value is accumulated into a decimal integer.\n- **Target Conversion**: Depending on whether `b` is 'R', the decimal integer is converted to a Roman numeral string or to a string representation in base `b`. The helper functions `decimal_to_roman` and `decimal_to_base` handle these conversions efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that the problem constraints are met, including handling large numbers and bases up to 25 efficiently.",
