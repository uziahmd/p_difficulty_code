The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Neko Finds Grapes.\" Hmm, sounds interesting. So, Neko found some treasure chests and keys. The goal is to open as many chests as possible using the keys.\n\nLet me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, each chest has a number a_i and each key has b_j. A key can unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd. That means either one is even and the other is odd because even + odd = odd. Oh right, but wait, no: wait, 1+2=3 which is odd. Yes, that's right.\n\nEach key can be used once on at most one chest. Each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nWe need to find the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the approach is to match keys and chests such that a_i + b_j is odd, and maximize the number of such pairs where each key and chest are used only once.\n\nWait, but since each key is used once, and each chest once, it's a bipartite matching problem, but with two possible types of edges based on the parity of a_i and b_j.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases.\n\nFor a_i and b_j to have an odd sum, one must be even and the other odd.\n\nSo, the chests can be divided into two groups: those with even a_i and those with odd a_i. Similarly for the keys.\n\nSo, let's count:\n\n- Number of chests with even a_i: let's call it even_chests.\n- Number of chests with odd a_i: odd_chests = total_chests - even_chests.\n\nSimilarly, for the keys:\n\n- Number of keys with even b_j: even_keys.\n- Number of keys with odd b_j: odd_keys = total_keys - even_keys.\n\nNow, for a key j to unlock a chest i, we need that exactly one of a_i or b_j is odd.\n\nSo, when pairing:\n\nCase 1: Use an even key with an odd chest. Because even (b_j) + odd (a_i) = odd.\n\nCase 2: Use an odd key with an even chest. Because odd (b_j) + even (a_i) = odd.\n\nSo, the maximum number of chests is the sum of the minimum of (even_keys and odd_chests) plus the minimum of (odd_keys and even_chests).\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nWait, think about it:\n\nThe first case: even_keys can be used on odd_chests. Each even key can be matched to an odd chest. But the number of such pairs is limited by the smaller of the two. For example, if you have 3 even keys and 5 odd chests, you can use all 3 keys, getting 3 chests opened.\n\nSimilarly, the second case: odd_keys can be used on even_chests. The number here is the minimum of odd_keys and even_chests.\n\nAdding these two gives the total maximum chests.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd in the a array (chest numbers).\n2. Count the number of even and odd in the b array (key numbers).\n3. Compute the sum of min(even_a_count, odd_b_count) and min(odd_a_count, even_b_count).\n4. That sum is the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the even_a is the number of chests that are even. The odd_b is the number of keys that are odd. To pair even_a with odd_b, but each key is used once.\n\nWait, no. Wait, to make the sum odd, even_a (chests) can be paired with odd_b (keys). Because even + odd is odd.\n\nWait, no: wait, the condition is a_i + b_j is odd. So, if a_i is even, then b_j must be odd. If a_i is odd, then b_j must be even.\n\nSo, for the even_a chests, we need to use as many as possible of the odd_b keys. But each key can be used only once. So the maximum possible is the minimum between even_a and the number of odd_b keys.\n\nSimilarly, for the odd_a chests, we need even_b keys. So the maximum possible is the minimum between odd_a and even_b.\n\nBut wait, no. Because each key can be used once, so the number of possible pairs is determined by both the available keys and the available chests.\n\nSo, the total maximum is the sum of the two minima.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read n, m.\n- Read a list, compute the count of even and odd a's.\n- Read b list, compute the count of even and odd b's.\n-",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the available keys. Each key can unlock a chest if their numbers sum to an odd number, which means one must be even and the other must be odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parity**: First, count how many of the chest numbers are even and how many are odd. Similarly, count how many of the key numbers are even and how many are odd.\n2. **Pairing Strategy**: To maximize the number of chests opened:\n   - Use even keys to unlock odd chests. The number of such pairs is limited by the smaller count between even keys and odd chests.\n   - Use odd keys to unlock even chests. The number of such pairs is limited by the smaller count between odd keys and even chests.\n3. **Sum the Pairs**: The total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the pairs from the two strategies mentioned above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n, m = int(input[ptr]), int(input[ptr+1])\n    ptr += 2\n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    ptr += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+m]))\n    \n    even_a = 0\n    odd_a = 0\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_a += 1\n        else:\n            odd_a += 1\n    \n    even_b = 0\n    odd_b = 0\n    for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_b += 1\n        else:\n            odd_b += 1\n    \n    # Calculate the maximum possible chests\n    max_even_key_pairs = min(even_a, odd_b)\n    max_odd_key_pairs = min(odd_a, even_b)\n    total = max_even_key_pairs + max_odd_key_pairs\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of chests, keys, and their respective values.\n- **Counting Parity**: We iterate through the chest and key values to count how many are even and how many are odd.\n- **Calculating Pairs**: We determine the maximum number of pairs by checking how many even keys can pair with odd chests and how many odd keys can pair with even chests.\n- **Output Result**: The sum of these pairs gives the maximum number of chests that can be opened, which is then printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the given keys, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
