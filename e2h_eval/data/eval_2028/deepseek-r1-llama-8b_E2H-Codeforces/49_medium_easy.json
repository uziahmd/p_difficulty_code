They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Mushroom Strife. Hmm. So the setup is that Pasha and Akim made a forest map where lawns are vertices and roads are edges. Each road has two numbers: GCD and LCM of the mushrooms on the connected lawns. But now, some of the map is torn, leaving only m roads. My task is to help restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn based on the given roads. If it's not possible, output NO; else, output any valid arrangement.\n\nThe input gives n and m, followed by m lines each with four numbers: the two lawns connected by the road, the GCD, and the LCM of their mushroom counts.\n\nWait, but in the example input, the first line seems to be '1 0' which might represent one lawn and zero roads. Then the next lines have more info. Oh right, the way the input is structured: each of the m lines has four numbers, which are the two lawns, GCD, LCM. So for example, the second line in the sample input is \"2 1\\n1 2 1 3\" — wait, no, looking back, maybe the input is split into tokens. Wait, perhaps each road is given as u, v, gcd, lcm. Because in the sample input, the second line is '2 1\\n1 2 1 3' — that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the input is read as a list of lines, each line containing four integers: u, v, g, l. So for the second line, 2 1 1 3 — meaning the road connects lawn 2 and lawn 1, with GCD 1 and LCM 3. So, the mushrooms on 2 and 1 must satisfy that GCD( x, y ) = 1 and LCM( x, y ) = 3. So x and y must be 1 and 3, or 3 and 1. But since GCD is 1, that's correct. So that's how it works.\n\nSo the problem is to assign a value to each lawn (from 1 to n) such that for every given road, the GCD and LCM of the two values at the ends are as specified.\n\nHmm. So this sounds like a problem that can be modeled using constraints between variables. Each road imposes certain conditions on the two lawns it connects. So perhaps we can model this as a system of equations or constraints and then try to find a solution.\n\nLet me think about the properties of GCD and LCM. For two numbers a and b, we know that GCD(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So for each road, the product of GCD and LCM should equal the product of the two mushrooms.\n\nWait, that's a key point. So for any given road, if the two mushrooms are a and b, then:\n\ngcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = a * b\n\nWhich means that for each road, we can compute a * b as the product of the given GCD and LCM. So for each edge, the product is fixed.\n\nSo for each road (u, v, g, l), we have a * b = g * l, where a is the value assigned to u, and b to v.\n\nAdditionally, a and b must satisfy that the GCD of a and b is g, and LCM is l. But since the product is fixed, perhaps those are redundant constraints. Because if a * b is fixed, then the GCD and LCM determine a and b up to ordering.\n\nWait, yes. Because given a and b, the GCD and LCM are determined. So for each road, the product is fixed, and the GCD and LCM are given. So for each road, the two numbers a and b must satisfy a * b = g * l, and also that GCD(a, b) = g and LCM(a, b) = l. But perhaps these two together uniquely determine a and b.\n\nWait, let's see. Suppose g divides both a and b, and l is a multiple of both. Also, the product is g*l. So, perhaps a and b can be expressed as g * x and g * y, where x and y are coprime, and their LCM is l/g. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since a and b must be multiples of g, because GCD(a,b) = g. So a = g * a', b = g * b', where a' and b' are coprime. Then, LCM(a, b) = g * (a' * b') / GCD(a', b') ) — but since a' and b' are coprime, their GCD is 1. So LCM(a, b) = g * a' * b'.\n\nBut the given LCM is l, so g * a' * b' = l → a' * b' = l/g.\n\nAlso, a * b = g^2 * a' * b' = g^2 * (l/g) = g * l. Which aligns with our earlier point that a*b = g*l.\n\nSo given that, for each road, the product a*b is fixed as g*l. And a and b must be multiples of g, and their co-prime parts multiply to l/g.\n\nSo for each edge, the two variables a and b must satisfy a * b = g*l, and a and b must be multiples of g. So for each edge, we can model the possible pairs (a, b) as (g * x, g * y), where x * y = (l/g), and x and y are positive integers that are coprime.\n\nWait, but wait. Because x and y could be in any order. So for each edge, the possible pairs for (a, b) are all pairs (g*x, g*y) where x*y = (l/g), x and y are positive integers, and GCD(x, y) = 1.\n\nSo for each edge, the possible a and b must be in such pairs.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to assigning variables to each node such that for each edge, the pair (a, b) satisfies a*b = g*l, and a and b are in the allowed pairs as above.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be modeled using a graph where each variable is a node, and each edge represents a constraint. The variables must be assigned values such that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut solving this for general graphs can be tricky. However, considering that the constraints are multiplicative, perhaps we can model this with a Union-Find data structure or some other method that tracks the possible factors.\n\nWait, another approach: since a * b = g * l, which is known, for each edge, we can model the relationship between the two nodes as a ratio. Because a = (g * l) / b. So for each edge, the product of the two nodes is fixed.\n\nThis suggests that the variables are linked multiplicatively. So, for each connected component, the variables can be expressed in terms of a base variable, multiplied by some factor. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each connected component, we can assign a variable to a root node, and express all other nodes in terms of that variable. But the constraints may complicate this.\n\nWait, perhaps the variables can be considered as being part of a system where each variable is a multiple of some base variable, but the exact multiple depends on the edges.\n\nWait, here's an idea: for each connected component, assign a variable x to one node, say the root. Then, for each edge in the component, express the connected node's variable in terms of x, using the constraints.\n\nEach edge (u, v, g, l) would impose that x_u * x_v = g * l. Because u's value is x_u, and v's is x_v. So x_u * x_v = g*l.\n\nBut wait, that's only true if the variables are scaled versions of a base variable. So if each variable is a multiple of the base, then yes. But perhaps the base can be chosen as 1, but that might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each connected component, we can choose a variable x for the root, and then express all other variables in terms of x, ensuring that the constraints are met.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: for a connected component, suppose we have a tree structure where each edge relates two variables. For each edge, we have x_u * x_v = g * l.\n\nIf the component is a tree, then we can assign variables in a way that propagates from the root down.\n\nBut what if the component has cycles? Then, the product constraints along the cycles must be consistent. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n1. For each connected component, assign a variable x to the root (say, node 1 in the component).\n\n2. For each edge in the component, starting from the root, express the connected node's variable in terms of x.\n\n3. As we process each edge, check if the current assignment is consistent with the edge's constraints. If a contradiction is found, the system is impossible.\n\n4. Once all edges are processed without contradiction, assign x to the root, and compute the variables accordingly.\n\n5. Then, after processing all components, check whether all constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how exactly do we model the variables for each node? Let's think.\n\nSuppose for a connected component, we pick node r as the root. We'll assign a variable x_r to it. Then, for each edge from r to its child u, we have x_r * x_u = g * l. So x_u = (g * l) / x_r.\n\nWait, but then for another edge from u to another node v, x_u * x_v = g' * l'. Substituting x_u, we get ((g * l)/x_r) * x_v = g' * l'. Solving for x_v gives x_v = (g' * l') * x_r / (g * l).\n\nAnd so on for each edge.\n\nSo, as we process each edge, we can express the variable for the next node in terms of x_r.\n\nIf during this process, any expression for a node's variable conflicts with a previous assignment, then the system is impossible.\n\nOtherwise, once all edges are processed, we can assign x_r as any value (since it's a variable), and compute all other variables accordingly.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. Because the variables must be integers. So when computing x_v, the expressions must result in integer values.\n\nSo, for each step, when we compute x_v = (g' * l') * x_r / (g * l), we need to ensure that (g' * l') is divisible by (g * l). Otherwise, x_v won't be an integer.\n\nBut wait, no—because for any edge, the product of x_u and x_v must equal g * l. So x_v is determined as (g' * l') * x_u^{-1}, but x_u is already determined in terms of x_r.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as follows:\n\nFor a connected component, select a root node. Assign x_root = k (some integer). Then, for each edge (u, v, g, l):\n\nx_u * x_v = g * l.\n\nWe can express x_v as (g * l) / x_u.\n\nSo, for each node, we can traverse the graph, and for each edge, compute the required x_v based on the current x_u.\n\nBut how do we manage this? It seems like a BFS or DFS approach where we assign x_v based on x_u.\n\nBut the problem is that when processing an edge, we might have already assigned x_v, which may not match the new computed value. So we need to detect such inconsistencies.\n\nLet's formalize this approach:\n\n- For each connected component:\n   - Choose a root node.\n   - Assign x_root = 1 (initially, but could be any integer? Or perhaps not, because the initial assignment can affect the rest of the variables.)\n   - Perform a BFS/DFS, for each node u, when visiting an adjacent node v via an edge (u, v, g, l):\n      - Compute x_v as (g * l) / x_u.\n      - If v is unvisited, set x_v and add to the queue.\n      - If v is visited, check if x_v matches the computed value. If not, the system is impossible.\n\nWait, but why x_root is 1? Because for each component, the variables are determined up to a multiplicative factor. Choosing x_root as 1 will give a particular solution, but perhaps other x_roots could lead to different solutions. However, since the problem allows any valid assignment, choosing x_root as 1 could be a way to find a valid solution, but only if it's possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps choosing x_root as 1 may lead to fractional x_v for some nodes, which is invalid because the variables must be integers.\n\nSo, the approach needs to consider that for each edge, the product of x_u and x_v must be equal to g * l. So, during the traversal, when we compute x_v as (g * l) / x_u, we must ensure that this division is exact, i.e., x_u divides g * l.\n\nSo, the algorithm would proceed as:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n   1. Pick a root node, say r. Assign x_r = 1 (or any integer, but 1 is a good starting point).\n\n   2. For each node u in the component, in BFS order:\n\n      a. For each edge (u, v, g, l):\n\n         i. Compute x_v = (g * l) / x_u.\n\n         ii. If x_v is not integer, then it's impossible.\n\n         iii. If v has been visited before, check if its current x_v matches this computed value. If not, it's impossible.\n\n         iv. If v hasn't been visited, set x_v and add to the queue.\n\nOnce all components are processed, collect the x values.\n\nBut wait, what if during BFS, a node is revisited and the x_v computed from its edges don't match the existing x_v? That's a conflict, and the system is impossible.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read all the edges.\n\n- For each connected component:\n\n   - Assign a root.\n\n   - Perform BFS, assigning x values based on the edges.\n\n   - Check for any inconsistencies.\n\nIf all components are processed without inconsistency, then the assignment is possible. Otherwise, it's not.\n\nBut wait, what about the choice of x_root? Because if we choose x_root as a different value, say 2, the resulting x_v's would scale accordingly. But the problem requires that the assignment must be consistent across all edges, regardless of the initial x_root choice.\n\nWait, no. Because x_root is arbitrary in this approach. So, perhaps the system will only have a solution if, for each connected component, the product of edges forms a consistent system, regardless of the x_root choice.\n\nBut how does that hold? Let's see.\n\nIn the BFS approach, when you assign x_r as 1, you get a specific solution. But perhaps the actual solution could be any multiple of x_r. But since the problem allows any assignment, perhaps the initial x_r can be any integer, as long as all other x_v's computed are integers.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that all x_v's are integers because they represent the count of mushrooms.\n\nSo, during the BFS, whenever you compute x_v as (g * l) / x_u, you must ensure that this is an integer. So, for each edge, x_u must divide g * l.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n   - Assign x_r = 1.\n\n   - For each edge (u, v, g, l) in the component:\n\n      - Compute x_v as (g*l) / x_u.\n\n      - If x_v is not an integer, return NO.\n\n      - If v is already assigned, check if it equals x_v. If not, return NO.\n\n      - Else, assign x_v and proceed.\n\nOnce all edges are processed without issues, the assignment is possible.\n\nWait, but what about cycles in the component? Because, for example, a cycle may impose that the product of the edges around the cycle must equal 1, leading to a condition on x_r.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is missing something.\n\nWait, let's take an example.\n\nConsider a triangle of nodes A, B, C connected by edges:\n\nA-B: GCD 2, LCM 6 → product is 12.\n\nB-C: GCD 3, LCM 4 → product is 12.\n\nC-A: GCD 4, LCM 3 → product is 12.\n\nSo, for each edge, the product is 12.\n\nNow, let's assign x_A = 1.\n\nThen x_B = (12) / x_A = 12.\n\nThen x_C = (12) / x_B = 1.\n\nThen, when processing edge C-A: x_C * x_A = 1*1 = 1, but the edge says it should be 12. So 1 ≠ 12, which is a problem.\n\nThus, the BFS approach would detect this inconsistency.\n\nSo, the BFS approach correctly handles cycles.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nProcess each connected component, assign x_r = 1, and for each edge, compute x_v as (g*l) / x_u. Ensure that this is integer and consistent with previous assignments.\n\nIf any inconsistency is found, output NO.\n\nElse, after processing all edges, output YES and the x_v's.\n\nWait, but the x_v's are relative to the root. So, in the example above, the BFS would process A→B→C, but then process C→A, which would find that x_C * x_A = 1*1 = 1, which is not equal to 12. Thus, the system is impossible.\n\nSo, the BFS approach would correctly return NO.\n\nSo, that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nWe can represent the graph as an adjacency list. For each node, we'll store its connected edges.\n\nWe'll also keep track of the x values for each node, initializing them as None or some default.\n\nThen, for each node not yet visited, we start a BFS. We assign x_root = 1. Then, for each neighbor via an edge, we compute x_v as (g*l) / x_u.\n\nBut wait, the edges are bidirectional? Because the problem statement says that no two lawns are connected by more than one road. So, each edge is present once in both directions. So, the adjacency list should include both directions.\n\nYes, because for each road between u and v, we need to add it to the adjacency list for both u and v.\n\nSo, for each edge (u, v, g, l), add to u's list (v, g, l) and to v's list (u, g, l).\n\nThen, during BFS, for each node u, iterate through all its edges and process each.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nBuild an adjacency list: adj[u] contains tuples (v, g, l).\n\nInitialize x as a dictionary or array, with x[u] initially set to None or some default.\n\nFor each node u from 1 to n:\n\n   if x[u] is not yet set:\n\n      perform BFS or DFS starting at u.\n\n      assign x[u] = 1.\n\n      create a queue and enqueue u.\n\n      while queue not empty:\n\n          current_node = dequeue.\n\n          for each (neighbor, g, l) in adj[current_node]:\n\n              if x[neighbor] is not set:\n\n                  compute x_neighbor = (g * l) / x[current_node]\n\n                  if (g * l) % x[current_node] != 0:\n\n                      print NO and exit.\n\n                  x[neighbor] = x_neighbor\n\n                  enqueue neighbor.\n\n              else:\n\n                  if x[neighbor] != (g * l) // x[current_node]:\n\n                      print NO and exit.\n\nSo, that's the basic idea.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the same edge is processed in both directions? Like, when processing u, then processing v, which points back to u. So, during the BFS, when processing v, it will process the edge back to u, which already has x set. So, in that case, we check whether (g * l) / x[v] equals x[u]. Since x[u] was set as (g * l) / x[v], because x[v] was set based on u, this would always hold.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nSuppose u has x= a, and v has x= b. Edge u-v has g and l such that a*b = g*l.\n\nWhen processing u, we set v's x as (g*l)/a = b.\n\nThen, when processing v, when we look at the edge back to u, we compute x_u as (g*l)/v.x = (g*l)/b = a. Which matches the existing x_u. So, no conflict.\n\nThus, the algorithm correctly handles both directions.\n\nSo, now, the code outline is clear.\n\nBut wait, what about multiple edges between the same nodes?\n\nThe problem statement says that no two lawns are connected by more than one road. So, each pair of nodes is connected by at most one road, which implies that the adjacency list for each node has each neighbor once.\n\nSo, in the code, for each edge, we add both directions.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nfor each of the m edges:\n\n   read u, v, g, l.\n\n   add to adj[u] a tuple (v, g, l).\n\n   add to adj[v] a tuple (u, g, l).\n\nBut wait, the input may have u and v in any order. So, for each edge, u and v are distinct, and each direction is added.\n\nThus, the adjacency list correctly represents all edges.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as outlined.\n\nNow, let's think about the example given in the problem statement.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\nWait, perhaps the actual input is:\n\nn=1, m=0.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misread the input format. The first line is n and m. Then, each of the next m lines contains four numbers: u, v, g, l.\n\nWait, the sample input shows:\n\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\nBut that seems like the first line is '1 0', meaning n=1, m=0.\n\nThen, the next lines are four-number lines, but the way they're written seems off. Maybe the input is represented as a list of lines, each line is a string like '2 1 1 3' which corresponds to u=2, v=1, g=1, l=3.\n\nSo, the code should read n and m, then read m lines, each with four integers.\n\nSo, for the sample input, the first line is n=1, m=0. Then, since m=0, no edges follow.\n\nThus, the output is YES, and the mushrooms are [1].\n\nAnother sample line is:\n\nThe third input line is '2 1\\n1 2 3 7' which probably is u=2, v=1, g=2, l=7.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should read each line as a list of four integers, ignoring any newlines.\n\nSo, the code in Python would read the first line as n, m = map(int, input().split()). Then, for m lines, read each line as a string, split into four parts, converting to integers.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\nadj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]  # nodes are 1-based.\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    parts = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    u = int(parts[0])\n    v = int(parts[1])\n    g = int(parts[2])\n    l = int(parts[3])\n    adj[u].append( (v, g, l) )\n    adj[v].append( (u, g, l) )\n\nx = [None] * (n+1)\n\npossible = True\n\nfor u in range(1, n+1):\n    if x[u] is None:\n        # Start BFS\n        queue = deque()\n        queue.append(u)\n        x[u] = 1\n        while queue:\n            current = queue.popleft()\n            for (neighbor, g, l) in adj[current]:\n                if x[neighbor] is None:\n                    # Compute x_neighbor\n                    product = g * l\n                    if product % x[current] != 0:\n                        possible = False\n                        break\n                    x_neighbor = product // x[current]\n                    x[neighbor] = x_neighbor\n                    queue.append(neighbor)\n                else:\n                    if x[neighbor] != (g * l) // x[current]:\n                        possible = False\n                        break\n            if not possible:\n                break\n        if not possible:\n            break\n\nif not possible:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n    print(' '.join(map(str, x[1:])))\n    \nWait, but what about when m=0, like the first sample input where n=1 and m=0. Then, x[1] is 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when n=2, and m=1, with u=1, v=2, g=1, l=3. So, x[1] = 1, x[2] = 3. Then, the product is 3, which is 1*3.\n\nWhat if another edge exists between 1 and 2 with g=3, l=1. Then, during BFS, when processing 1's edge, x[2] is 1*3 / 1 = 3. Then, processing 2's edge, when checking 1's x, it's 3, and (3*1) / 3 = 1, which is x[1]. So no conflict.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nBut wait, what if the initial x_root is set to something else, say 2? Then, x[2] would be (g*l)/2. But since the problem allows any valid assignment, the initial x_root can be set to 1, which is a valid choice.\n\nBut what if the initial x_root is 1, and during BFS, the computation leads to x_v being non-integer, but if x_root had been set to a different value, x_v could have been integer? Then, the code would incorrectly mark it as impossible, even though a solution exists.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nBecause the initial assignment of x_root=1 might not be the correct choice to allow all other variables to be integers.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a component where x_root must be 2, because otherwise, some x_v's would not be integers.\n\nIn such a case, the BFS approach with x_root=1 would fail, but a solution exists if x_root is 2.\n\nThus, the current approach is flawed.\n\nSo, the problem is that the initial x_root=1 might not be compatible with all edges, leading to a wrong \"NO\" when a solution exists.\n\nSo, how can we handle this?\n\nHmm, that's a big issue.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect because the choice of x_root can affect whether the BFS can assign all variables as integers.\n\nSo, we need a way to find a suitable x_root such that all variables can be assigned as integers, and that for each edge, the product of x_u and x_v equals g*l.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as each variable being a multiple of some base variable. So, for each connected component, we can assign variables as multiples of a base variable, ensuring that the product constraints are satisfied.\n\nWait, perhaps each variable can be represented as a product of a base variable and some factor. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables can be represented in terms of a logarithm, turning the multiplicative constraints into additive ones. But that's getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the variables are constrained in such a way that for each connected component, the product of all edges must form a multiplicative loop that equals 1. So, for a cycle, the product of all edges' (g*l) must equal 1.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because each edge has its own g and l.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as a system of equations where x_u * x_v = c_uv for each edge u-v, where c_uv is g*l.\n\nThen, the system can be solved by finding a multiplicative function over the connected components.\n\nBut solving such systems is non-trivial.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that each variable is determined up to a multiplicative constant. So, for each connected component, we can choose a variable (like the root) and assign a value to it, and then compute the rest based on that.\n\nBut the initial assignment must be such that all other variables are integers.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to selecting x_root for each component such that all x_v's computed are integers.\n\nBut how to find such x_root?\n\nIt's possible that for a component, x_root can be any divisor of the product of all c_uv's for the component.\n\nBut that sounds computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each component, the product of all edges' c_uv must be a perfect power, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for a component, the product of all edges' c_uv's must be equal to x_root squared times the product of some factors. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product of all edges' c_uv's must be equal to x_root squared, but again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the product of all edges' c_uv's in a component must equal x_root squared times some product of the variables' factors.\n\nNo, that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each component, the product of all edges' c_uv's must be a square number, because x_root is a square factor.\n\nBut I'm not confident.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to model the variables as logarithms. Since multiplication becomes addition, but that introduces floating-point inaccuracies, which may not be manageable.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the constraints are that each x_u and x_v are integers, and their product is known for each edge. So, perhaps the variables can be represented as exponents of a common base.\n\nBut that's getting too abstract.\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps, for each connected component, the variables form a multiplicative group, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a system where each variable is a multiple of some base variable. For example, each variable can be expressed as k * x, where x is the base value, and k is an integer.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables can be represented as products of primes raised to certain exponents, and the constraints translate into equations on the exponents.\n\nBut that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each connected component, the variables can be expressed as a product of a common variable and a unique identifier for that node.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nLet me think about the problem again. Each edge constrains x_u * x_v = c_uv. So, for a connected component, the variables are interdependent. The system must have a solution where all variables are integers, and the product constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe problem is that the initial approach of setting x_root=1 may lead to a situation where some x_v's are non-integers, but a different x_root could have worked.\n\nSo, the initial approach is insufficient.\n\nThus, perhaps the correct approach is to model each variable as a multiple of a base variable, allowing for scaling.\n\nWait, perhaps for each connected component, the variables can be represented as x_i = k * y_i, where y_i is a base variable and k is a scaling factor.\n\nThen, substituting into the product constraints, we have:\n\nx_u * x_v = (k_u * y_u) * (k_v * y_v) = c_uv.\n\nBut since y_u and y_v are base variables, perhaps for each component, the base variables are coprimes, and the scaling factors can be determined.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each variable can be expressed as a product of a common base variable and a unique scalar for the node. For example, x_i = base * s_i, where s_i is a scalar for the node.\n\nSubstituting into the product constraints:\n\n(base * s_u) * (base * s_v) = c_uv → base^2 * s_u s_v = c_uv.\n\nSo, for each edge, c_uv must be divisible by base^2. But this seems restrictive.\n\nWait, perhaps the base can be determined as the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all c_uv's in the component.\n\nWait, but that may not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the base is a square factor of all c_uv's in the component.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nMaybe another approach is needed.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nEach variable x can be written as x = a * b^k, where b is a base and k is an exponent. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the constraints are multiplicative, perhaps the variables can be represented as products of prime factors, and the constraints can be checked for divisibility.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a system where each variable is a product of a common variable and some other factors. For example, for a connected component, let’s choose a variable x_1 as the base, and express all other variables as x_2 = c_1 * x_1, x_3 = c_2 * x_1, etc. Then, substitute into the product constraints to find the conditions on the c_i's.\n\nBut this is similar to the initial approach.\n\nWait, let's model it.\n\nAssume for a connected component, x_i = k_i * x_1, where x_1 is the base variable.\n\nThen, for each edge (i, j, g, l), we have:\n\nx_i * x_j = g * l → (k_i * x_1) * (k_j * x_1) = g * l → k_i * k_j * x_1^2 = g * l.\n\nSo, for each edge, we have an equation: k_i * k_j = (g * l) / x_1^2.\n\nBut x_1 is a variable, which complicates things.\n\nBut perhaps, for a solution to exist, for each edge, (g * l) must be divisible by x_1^2.\n\nBut x_1 is unknown, so it's unclear how to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each edge, the product (g * l) must be a perfect square, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, but for the initial approach, the BFS assumes x_1=1, which may not work if (g*l) is not a multiple of 1, which it is, but in other cases, x_1 may need to be a higher value.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is incomplete.\n\nThus, perhaps the correct approach is to model the variables as products of a base variable and some factors, ensuring that for each edge, the product is as required.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nPerhaps, instead of trying to assign x_root=1, we can represent the variables as fractions, and find a way to scale them to integers.\n\nBut that's again complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the variables can be represented as ratios relative to a base variable. For example, for each edge, x_u/x_v = (g*l)/(x_v)^2.\n\nNo, perhaps not.\n\nWait, perhaps the variables can be represented as the product of a common factor and a unique identifier.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think about the variables in terms of their prime factors. Each variable x can be represented by its prime exponents. For each edge, the product x_u * x_v must equal c_uv.\n\nSo, for each prime p, the sum of exponents in x_u and x_v must equal the exponent in c_uv.\n\nBut this seems too involved.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each prime, the exponents in x_u and x_v must add up to the exponent in c_uv.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nBut given time constraints, perhaps it's better to consider that the initial approach is not sufficient and think about how to modify it.\n\nWait, perhaps for each connected component, the product of all edges' c_uv's must be equal to the square of the product of the variables in the component.\n\nBut that's not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each connected component, the product of all edges' c_uv's must be a square number.\n\nWait, let's test this with the sample input.\n\nIn the sample input, the third case is:\n\n3 3\n\nRoads:\n\n3 2: g=2, l=1 → c=2*1=2.\n\n3 1: g=1, l=10 → c=10.\n\n2 1: g=3, l=7 → c=21.\n\nSo, the product of all edges' c's is 2 * 10 * 21 = 420. 420 is not a square.\n\nBut in the sample output, the mushrooms are 5,1,2. So 5*1=5, 5*2=10, 1*2=2.\n\nSo, 5*1*2 = 10 → but 10 isn't a square either.\n\nHmm, so the product of edges' c's isn't necessarily a square.\n\nThus",
