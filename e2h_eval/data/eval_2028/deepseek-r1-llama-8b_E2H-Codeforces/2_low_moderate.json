Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X'. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe grid is n x n, where n is odd. The conditions for it being an 'X' are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same character.\n2. All the other squares (non-diagonal) must be the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to check the two main diagonals. Then, all the non-diagonal cells should have the same letter, which is not equal to the diagonal's letter.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think about what the 'X' looks like. For example, when n=3, the X would be like:\nx o x\no x o\nx o x\nWait, no. Wait, no. Wait, the X in a 3x3 grid would have the four corners as x and the center as something else. Or maybe the diagonals are all x's, and the rest are o's. So in a 3x3 grid, the main diagonals are x's, and the other 5 cells are o's.\n\nSo, more generally, for any n, the main two diagonals must be filled with the same character, say c. And all other cells must be filled with another character d, which is different from c.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Check that the two main diagonals are all the same character.\n2. Check that all the non-diagonal cells are the same character, different from the diagonal's.\n\nSo, how do I approach this in code?\n\nFirst, read the input. Since the input is given as a single string, I'll split it into lines. Each line represents a row of the grid.\n\nWait, the input is given as a list of strings? Or each line is a string. Oh right, the first line is n, then next n lines are the grid. So in Python, I can read it as:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nYes.\n\nThen, I need to find out what the diagonal characters are. So for each cell (i,j), if i == j or i + j == n-1, then it's on a diagonal.\n\nWait, since the grid is 0-based or 1-based? Well, in the code, the rows are 0-based. So for a cell at row i, column j: it's on the main diagonal if i == j, and on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n-1.\n\nSo first, collect all the diagonal characters.\n\nLet's loop through each cell:\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nWait, but wait, what if n is 5? Then the main diagonal has 5 cells, and the anti-diagonal has 5 cells as well. But in the case of n=3, both diagonals have 3 cells each, overlapping at the center.\n\nBut for the condition, the two diagonals must consist of the same character. So first, check that all the diagonal cells are the same.\n\nSo first, check if all elements in diagonal_chars are the same. If not, return NO.\n\nOnce that's confirmed, we get the value c = diagonal_chars[0].\n\nNext, check all non-diagonal cells. They must all be the same character d, which is not equal to c.\n\nSo, collect all the non-diagonal cells:\n\nnon_diagonal = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n            non_diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n\nIf any of these is not equal to a single value d, then it's invalid.\n\nAlso, d must be different from c.\n\nSo, if non_diagonal is empty? Wait, n is at least 3, so for n=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is 5. So non_diagonal is always non-empty.\n\nSo, check if all elements in non_diagonal are the same.\n\nAdditionally, check if that same element is not equal to c.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES. Else, NO.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=3.\n\nSample Input 1: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\n\nThis is the second test case in the sample, which outputs YES.\n\nWait, wait no. Looking back:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given n x n grid of characters forms the letter 'X'. The conditions for the grid to form an 'X' are:\n1. Both main diagonals must have the same character.\n2. All other cells (non-diagonal) must be the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the integer `n` and the subsequent `n` lines of the grid.\n2. **Check Diagonals:** Verify that all cells on both main diagonals are the same character.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells:** Ensure all non-diagonal cells are the same character and different from the diagonal character.\n4. **Output Result:** Print \"YES\" if both conditions are satisfied, otherwise print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Function to check if all elements in a list are the same\ndef all_same(lst):\n    return len(set(lst)) == 1\n\n# Check diagonals\ndiagonal = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif not all_same(diagonal):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    c = diagonal[0]\n    # Check non-diagonal cells\n    non_diagonal = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n                non_diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n    d = non_diagonal[0]\n    if all_same(non_diagonal) and d != c:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The grid is read as a list of strings where each string represents a row.\n2. **Checking Diagonals:** We iterate through each cell to collect characters from both main diagonals. If these characters are not all the same, the grid cannot form an 'X'.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check:** After confirming the diagonals, we check that all non-diagonal cells are the same and different from the diagonal character. This ensures the rest of the grid is filled with a uniform character.\n4. **Output:** Based on the checks, we print \"YES\" if the grid meets the criteria for an 'X', otherwise \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the necessary conditions with a time complexity of O(n^2), which is suitable given the constraints.",
