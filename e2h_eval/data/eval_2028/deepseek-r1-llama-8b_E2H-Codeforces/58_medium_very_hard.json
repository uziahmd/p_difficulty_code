You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vitaly and Cycle.\" Hmm, I need to find the minimum number of edges to add to a graph to form an odd-length cycle (more than one vertex) and also count the number of ways to do this. \n\nAlright, let's break down the problem. The input is a graph with n vertices and m edges. It's undirected, no loops or parallel edges. The output should be two numbers: t (minimum edges to add) and w (number of ways to add those t edges to form the desired cycle).\n\nFirst, I need to understand when a graph has such a cycle already. For example, if there's a cycle of odd length, then t would be 0, and w would be 1 if that's the only way, or more if there are multiple such cycles.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex.\" So each vertex in the cycle must appear exactly once.\n\nSo the first thing is to check whether the graph already contains such a cycle. If yes, then t=0 and w is the number of such cycles.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal number of edges to add to create such a cycle, and count how many ways that can be done.\n\nHmm. How to approach this? Let's think about the components of the graph. Because the graph might not be connected, but each component can contribute to forming the cycle.\n\nWait, but for a cycle to exist, it's necessary that the graph is at least connected, right? Or wait, no. Wait, a cycle is a connected structure. So if the graph is disconnected, any cycle must lie entirely within a single connected component. So perhaps the approach is to consider each connected component and determine whether it's possible to form an odd-length cycle by adding edges within that component.\n\nBut wait, for example, a tree is a connected component without any cycles. Adding one edge creates exactly one cycle. But if the tree is connected and has an even number of vertices, adding one edge might give an odd cycle only if certain conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to look for each connected component and see if it's possible to form an odd cycle by adding edges to it.\n\nWait, but the problem allows us to add edges between any two vertices, regardless of their current connection. So even if two vertices are in different connected components, adding an edge between them could merge their components.\n\nHmm, that complicates things because adding an edge can connect two separate components, which might then have the possibility of forming an odd cycle.\n\nBut the goal is to find the minimal number of edges to add. So maybe the minimal t is determined by considering all possible ways to connect components and see what's the smallest number of edges needed to form an odd cycle.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let me try to find some patterns or properties.\n\nFirst, for a connected component, what's the condition under which adding k edges can form an odd cycle?\n\nLet me think about the degrees of the vertices in a connected component. Maybe using some graph theory here.\n\nIn a connected component, if it's a tree, adding one edge creates exactly one cycle. The length of that cycle depends on the path between the two added vertices. If the path has even length, then the cycle will have even length plus one (since the path is even, adding an edge makes a cycle of length even+1 = odd). Oh wait, no. Let me think: Suppose two nodes u and v are connected via a path of length l (number of edges). Adding an edge between u and v creates a cycle of length l+1. So if l is even, the cycle length is odd; if l is odd, the cycle is even.\n\nWait, wait. No, the length of the cycle is l+1. Because the path is l edges, so adding an edge between u and v gives a cycle of l+1 nodes, which is l+1 edges. So if l is even, the cycle has an odd number of edges. If l is odd, the cycle has even number of edges.\n\nSo, in a tree, adding an edge between two nodes whose path has even length will create an odd cycle. But if the path has odd length, adding that edge creates an even cycle.\n\nSo for a tree component, to form an odd cycle, we can add one edge, provided that there exists a pair of nodes in the component whose path has even length.\n\nWait, but for a tree, every pair of nodes has a unique path. So the question is, does this tree contain at least two nodes whose path has even length.\n\nBut wait, in a tree, any two nodes' path has even or odd length depending on their depth parity. For example, if the tree is a straight line, like a linked list: node 1-2-3-4-...-n. Then the distance between node 1 and node 3 is 2 (even), between 1 and 4 is 3 (odd), etc.\n\nSo, in a tree, if the number of vertices is even, then the path from the root to the last node is even (if root is depth 0), but that's just one path. Wait, but for any tree, the number of vertices can vary. So perhaps, for a tree, if the number of vertices is even, then there exists at least two nodes whose path has even length, allowing the addition of one edge to create an odd cycle.\n\nWait, no. Let me take an example. Suppose a tree with three nodes: 1-2-3. The path between 1 and 3 is two edges, so even. Adding an edge between 1 and 3 would create a cycle of length 3, which is odd. So in this case, adding one edge suffices.\n\nAnother example: a tree with four nodes arranged as 1-2-3-4. The path between 1 and 4 is three edges (odd). So adding an edge between 1 and 4 would create a cycle of four edges, which is even. But what if we add an edge between 1 and 3? The path is two edges (even), so adding that creates a cycle of three edges, which is odd.\n\nAh, right. So in this tree, there are multiple pairs of nodes whose path has even length. So even if the overall tree's path from root to leaf is odd, other pairs may have even lengths.\n\nSo for a tree, is it always possible to add one edge to form an odd cycle?\n\nWait, another example: a star-shaped tree. Root node connected to all others. So for any two leaves, their path is through the root, which is two edges (even). So adding any edge between two leaves would create a cycle of three edges, which is odd. So in this case, adding one edge is sufficient.\n\nSo perhaps for any tree with more than one node, adding one edge can create an odd cycle. Is that always true?\n\nWait, no. Consider a tree with two nodes. Well, that's just an edge. Adding another edge between them isn't allowed because it's a loop. So for n=2, the tree is just one edge. To form a cycle, you can't add any edges. So in this case, it's impossible.\n\nWait, but the problem requires the cycle to consist of more than one vertex. So for a tree with two nodes, adding zero edges won't form a cycle, since it's just a single edge. Adding one edge would create a loop, which is prohibited. So in this case, it's impossible to form a cycle. So for a tree with two nodes, we can't form any cycle.\n\nSo the initial step is: for each connected component, determine whether it's possible to form an odd cycle by adding edges within that component, possibly merging with other components.\n\nWait, but merging components is allowed. So perhaps the minimal t can be achieved by connecting two components, each of which has certain properties.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal t is either 0 (if any component already has an odd cycle) or 1 (if adding one edge can create an odd cycle in a component or by connecting two components), or higher.\n\nWait, but when you add one edge, it's possible to connect two separate components. So perhaps the minimal t is 0, 1, or 2.\n\nWait, for example, suppose there are two connected components, each of which is a tree with an even number of nodes. Then adding one edge between them would create a component where we can form an odd cycle.\n\nBut wait, each tree has a path between any two nodes. So if the two trees are connected, the new component might have a cycle.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal t is 1 when the entire graph isn't connected, and adding an edge between two components allows the formation of an odd cycle.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to outline the steps.\n\nFirst, for each connected component, we need to determine:\n\n1. Whether it has an existing odd cycle. If any component does, then t is 0, and w is the number of such components times the product of the ways in each.\n\nWait, no, because the problem requires a single cycle. So if the graph already has an odd cycle, then t is 0 and w is the number of such cycles.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says, \"the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex.\"\n\nSo if the graph already has such a cycle, then t is 0, and w is the number of such cycles.\n\nIf not, then t is the minimal number of edges to add to create such a cycle, and w is the number of ways to do that.\n\nSo the first step is to check all connected components for any existing odd cycles. If any exists, output t=0, w=count_of_such_cycles.\n\nIf not, proceed.\n\nNow, if none of the connected components have an odd cycle, then we need to find the minimal number of edges to add.\n\nWhat's the minimal t? It can be 1, 2, etc.\n\nCase 1: Any connected component has an even cycle (like a tree). Adding one edge to that component can create an odd cycle.\n\nSo for each component, if it's a tree, then adding one edge can create an odd cycle. So the minimal t is 1.\n\nWait, but wait: if the component is a tree, adding one edge creates exactly one cycle. The length of that cycle is (path length between the two nodes) + 1. So if the path length is even, the cycle length is odd. So in that case, adding one edge between any two nodes in the tree can create an odd cycle, provided that their path length is even.\n\nBut in a tree, any two nodes have a unique path. So for a tree, can we choose two nodes whose path is even in length?\n\nYes, unless the tree has exactly two nodes. For example:\n\n- Tree with 2 nodes: no way to add an edge to make a cycle, because adding another edge would create a loop. So no solution in this case.\n\n- Tree with 3 nodes: adding an edge between two nodes whose path is 2 (so even) creates a cycle of length 3, which is odd.\n\nWait, in a tree with 3 nodes arranged as 1-2-3, the path between 1 and 3 is two edges (even). So adding 1-3 creates a cycle of 3 nodes, which is odd.\n\nSo for any tree with more than two nodes, adding one edge can create an odd cycle.\n\nBut what about trees with even number of nodes? Like 4 nodes in a straight line: 1-2-3-4. The path between 1 and 4 is 3 edges (odd), so adding 1-4 would create a cycle of 4 edges (even). So that's not good. But adding 1-3, the path is 2 edges (even), so adding 1-3 creates a cycle of 3 edges (odd). So in that case, it's possible.\n\nSo for any tree with more than two nodes, there exists at least two nodes whose path is even, allowing the addition of one edge to create an odd cycle.\n\nSo in this case, for any connected component that is a tree with size >=3, adding one edge can create an odd cycle.\n\nSo, for each connected component that is a tree, and has size >=3, we can contribute to a possible t=1.\n\nBut what if the component is not a tree? For example, it's a cycle of even length. Then adding one edge would create another cycle, but the original was even. So adding an edge can create a chord, making the cycle split into smaller cycles. But the new cycle would have a length equal to the sum of the two path lengths plus one. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, suppose we have a cycle of even length. Adding an edge between two nodes that are k steps apart in the cycle. The new cycle formed by that addition would have length k+1. If k is even, then the new cycle is odd.\n\nSo in this case, adding one edge can create an odd cycle.\n\nFor example, a cycle of 4 nodes: 1-2-3-4-1. The path between 1 and 3 is 2 steps. Adding 1-3 would create a cycle of 3 nodes (1-2-3-1?), wait, no. Wait, in the original cycle, 1 is connected to 2 and 4. 3 is connected to 2 and 4. So adding 1-3: the cycle would be 1-3-2-1? No, wait that's a triangle, which is an odd cycle.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the original cycle is 1-2-3-4-1. Adding an edge between 1 and 3 creates two cycles: 1-2-3-1 (length 3) and 1-3-4-1 (length 3). Both are odd. So yes, adding one edge to a cycle of even length can create an odd cycle.\n\nSo for a connected component that is a cycle of even length, adding one edge can create an odd cycle.\n\nSo, to summarize, for each connected component, if it's a tree with size >=3, or a cycle of even length, then adding one edge can create an odd cycle.\n\nSo, the minimal t is 1 in such cases.\n\nBut what if the graph is such that no connected component can contribute to forming an odd cycle with adding one edge?\n\nWait, but perhaps the graph is disconnected into two components, each of which is a tree with even number of nodes. Then, adding one edge between them could form a cycle.\n\nWait, but how? Let's say we have two trees, each with even number of nodes. So each tree cannot form an odd cycle when adding one edge. But when connected together, perhaps the combined component can form an odd cycle.\n\nHmm, perhaps the combined component would have an odd number of nodes, but that's not necessarily the case. Or perhaps the structure after adding one edge allows for an odd cycle.\n\nWait, let's think of two trees, A and B. Each is a straight line with even number of nodes. Suppose A has 2 nodes, B has 2 nodes. So each is a single edge. Adding an edge between them creates a component of 4 nodes connected as a chain. Now, any two nodes in A and B can be connected via the new edge. So, for example, adding an edge between node 1 of A and node 1 of B: the path between 1 and 2 in A is 1 edge (odd), so adding 1-B's 1 would create a cycle of 1 + 1 (edges) = 2, which is even. Not useful. Alternatively, adding an edge between node 1 of A and node 2 of B: the path between them is 1 (edge between them). So adding that edge creates a cycle of 2 edges (even). Not helpful.\n\nHmm, maybe this approach isn't working. So perhaps in some cases, adding one edge isn't enough, and we need to add two edges.\n\nWait, perhaps when the graph is disconnected into two components, each of which is a tree with two nodes (edges). Then, adding one edge between them creates a component of four nodes connected as 1-2-3-4, but that's a straight line. In this case, adding a second edge between 1 and 3 would create a cycle of 3 edges (odd). So t=2 in this case.\n\nWait, but initially, each component is a tree of two nodes. So adding one edge between them creates a chain of four nodes. Then, to form an odd cycle, we need to add another edge. So t=2.\n\nSo in this scenario, the minimal t is 2.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: find the minimal number of edges to add (t) such that either:\n\n- There's an existing odd cycle in the graph (t=0).\n- Or, there's a way to add one edge to form an odd cycle (t=1).\n- Else, t=2.\n\nWait, but is t=2 always possible? Or are there cases where even adding two edges isn't sufficient?\n\nHmm, perhaps if the graph is such that all connected components are trees with exactly two nodes (edges), then adding two edges can connect them into a four-node chain, and then adding two more edges to form a cycle.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in any case where t is greater than zero, it can be 1 or 2.\n\nWait, let's think about when adding one edge isn't sufficient but adding two edges is.\n\nSuppose the graph is two separate triangles (each is a cycle of 3 nodes). So each component is a cycle of odd length. So t=0, w is the number of such cycles.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that if any component already has an odd cycle, then t=0. So in this case, the answer is t=0, w=2.\n\nBut suppose the graph is two separate trees, each of which is a straight line with four nodes (so each is a chain 1-2-3-4). So each is a tree of four nodes. Now, adding one edge between any two nodes in the same component can create an odd cycle. For example, adding an edge between 1 and 3 in the first component creates a cycle of three nodes (1-2-3-1), which is odd. So in this case, t=1.\n\nBut what if the graph is two separate trees, each of which is a chain of three nodes (like 1-2-3). Then adding one edge between any two nodes in the same component can create an odd cycle. So again, t=1.\n\nBut what about the case where the graph is two separate trees, each of which is a chain of two nodes (edges). Then, adding one edge between them creates a four-node chain. But in this case, any single edge addition doesn't create an odd cycle. Because adding one edge creates a longer chain, and any cycle would require adding more edges.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: each component is a single edge (nodes 1-2 and 3-4). Adding an edge between 2 and 3 creates a path 1-2-3-4. Now, the cycle would require adding another edge, perhaps between 1 and 3, creating a cycle of length 3 (1-2-3-1). But wait, to create that, we need to add two edges: the initial edge (2-3) and then another edge (1-3). So in this case, t=2.\n\nSo, the conclusion is:\n\nIf any component already has an odd cycle: t=0, w is the number of such components.\n\nElse, if any component is a tree with size >=3, or any component is a cycle with even length: then t=1.\n\nElse, if all components are trees with size <=2: then to form an odd cycle, we need to connect two such components, each of which is a tree of two nodes. So, we need to add two edges: one to connect them, and another to form the cycle.\n\nWait, but wait: if there are two components, each being a tree of two nodes, then adding one edge between them connects them into a four-node chain. Now, adding a second edge between nodes 1 and 3 (for example) forms a cycle of three nodes. So in this case, t=2.\n\nBut what if there are three components, each being a tree of two nodes? Then, we need to connect two of them, and add another edge. So t=2.\n\nSo, the minimal t is:\n\n- 0 if any component has an odd cycle.\n- 1 if any component is a tree with >=3 nodes, or a cycle with even length.\n- 2 otherwise.\n\nSo the next task is to compute for each component whether it meets the above conditions.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Check each connected component for existing odd cycles. If any, output t=0 and count the number of such cycles.\n\n2. Else, check each component:\n   a. If it's a tree with size >=3, then adding one edge can form an odd cycle. So mark that t=1 is possible.\n\n   b. If it's a cycle with even length, then adding one edge can form an odd cycle. So t=1 is possible.\n\n3. If any component can allow t=1, then the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is the product of the number of ways in each component.\n\nWait, no. Because when t=1, you can choose any component that allows adding an edge to form an odd cycle. So for each such component, the number of ways is the sum over all components that can contribute, multiplied by the number of choices in each.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's the sum over all possible ways in each component.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the ways are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges. So, for each component that can contribute, the number of possible edges to add is the number of edges that can be added to form an odd cycle in that component. Then, the total number of ways is the product of the number of choices across all such components.\n\nWait, but no. Because when you have multiple components that can each individually form an odd cycle by adding one edge, then the total number of ways is the sum of the products of the number of choices for each component.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose the graph is two separate components. Component 1 is a tree with three nodes, so adding any edge between two nodes that form a path of even length will create an odd cycle. How many ways are there for component 1? It's the number of such possible edges.\n\nComponent 2 is a tree with four nodes, so similarly, the number of possible edges is the number of pairs of nodes whose path is even.\n\nThen, the total number of ways for t=1 is (ways in component 1) * (ways in component 2) + ... for all possible combinations of components that can contribute.\n\nWait, no. Because adding an edge can be done in any one of the possible components. So for each component that can contribute, the number of ways is the product of the number of ways in that component, summed over all possible components.\n\nWait, for example, if component A has x ways, component B has y ways, and component C has z ways, then the total number of ways is x + y + z.\n\nBecause for each way in A, you can add an edge in A, and not touch B or C. Similarly for B and C.\n\nSo, the total number of ways is the sum of the number of ways across all components that can contribute to t=1.\n\nBut wait, no. Because adding an edge in component A doesn't affect component B or C. So the total ways are the sum of the ways for each component that can contribute.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- For each component that can form an odd cycle by adding one edge, compute the number of ways for that component.\n\n- Sum these numbers across all such components to get w.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n1. For each connected component, determine whether it can contribute to t=1.\n\n   a. If the component is a tree with size >=3, compute the number of possible edges that can be added to form an odd cycle.\n\n   b. If the component is a cycle of even length, compute the number of possible edges that can be added to form an odd cycle.\n\n2. Sum the counts from all such components to get w.\n\n3. Also, during this process, track whether any component can contribute to t=1. If any, then t=1.\n\nOtherwise, check if there are at least two components that are trees of two nodes. Then, the minimal t is 2, and w is the number of ways to connect any two such components, multiplied by the number of ways to add the required edge.\n\nWait, but in that case, how?\n\nFor example, if there are k components that are trees of two nodes. To form a cycle, we need to choose two of them and add two edges: one to connect them, and another to form the cycle.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, each component is a single edge. So to form a cycle, you need to connect two components, which requires adding one edge. Once connected, you can add another edge within the combined component to form a cycle.\n\nSo, for each pair of components, the number of ways is (number of edges between them) * (number of edges that can form the cycle in the combined component).\n\nWait, but this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when the graph consists of only trees of two nodes, the minimal t is 2, and the number of ways is (k choose 2) * (m)^2, where m is the number of possible edges between the two components. Or something like that.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to handle this case separately.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n\n- For each connected component, determine whether it's a tree with size >=3, a cycle of even length, or a tree of size 2, or a cycle of odd length.\n\n- First, check for any component that has an odd cycle. If found, set t=0 and count the number of such components.\n\n- Else, check for any component that can form an odd cycle by adding one edge. For each such component, compute the number of possible edges that can be added. Sum these to get w.\n\n   - If any such component exists, set t=1 and w as the sum.\n\n- Else, check if the number of components that are trees of two nodes is >=2. If yes, set t=2 and compute the number of ways as follows:\n\n   - Choose two components. The number of ways to connect them with one edge is the number of possible edges between the two components. For each such edge, multiply by the number of possible edges that can form the cycle in the merged component.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, suppose we have two components, each with two nodes (edges). So each is a single edge. When we connect them with one edge, the combined component has four nodes. Now, in this component, to form an odd cycle, we need to add another edge.\n\nHow many ways are there to add that second edge?\n\nIn the four-node chain, the number of possible edges that can form an odd cycle is the number of edges that, when added, create an odd-length cycle.\n\nIn a four-node chain, the possible edges are:\n\nBetween nodes 1-3, 2-4, etc. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nThe four-node chain is 1-2-3-4.\n\nPossible edges to add:\n\n1-3: creates a cycle 1-2-3-1 (length 3, odd).\n\n1-4: creates a cycle of 4 (even).\n\n2-4: creates a cycle of 3 (1-2-4-1? No, wait, 2-4 is directly connected, so the cycle would be 2-4-3-2, which is length 3 (edges 2-4, 4-3, 3-2). So yes, odd.\n\nSo in this case, adding 1-3 or 2-4 creates an odd cycle.\n\nSo for each pair of components (each a tree of two nodes), the number of ways is:\n\n- Number of possible edges between the two components.\n\n- For each such edge, the number of possible edges in the merged component that can form an odd cycle.\n\nIn the example above, for each edge between components A and B, the number of edges that can form the cycle is 2.\n\nSo the total number of ways is (number of edges between A and B) * 2.\n\nBut how to compute this for all possible pairs of components.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when the graph consists solely of t components that are trees of two nodes, then the number of ways is:\n\nsum over all pairs (A,B) of components [ (number of edges between A and B) * (number of possible edges in the merged component that form an odd cycle) ]\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, but in the merged component, the number of possible edges that form an odd cycle depends on the structure of the merged component.\n\nIn the example earlier, after adding an edge between A and B, the merged component is a four-node chain, and the number of possible edges to add is 2.\n\nBut if the components are connected differently, perhaps the number varies.\n\nWait, perhaps the merged component is a four-node tree, so the number of possible edges that create an odd cycle is fixed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of such edges is fixed, like 2.\n\nSo for each pair of components, the number of ways is 2 * (number of edges between them).\n\nBut wait, in the example, the number of edges between the two components is 1 (since each component is a single edge, and the two nodes are separate). So for each pair, the number of edges between them is 2: node 1 in A can connect to node 1 in B, and node 2 in A can connect to node 2 in B. Or wait, each component is a single edge. So for component A: nodes 1 and 2 connected. Component B: nodes 3 and 4 connected. So the possible edges between them are 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, 2-4. So four possible edges.\n\nWait, no, because in the initial state, each component is a single edge. So between component A and B, there are 2x2=4 possible edges: 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, 2-4.\n\nEach of these edges can be added. For each such edge, the merged component is a four-node tree. In this four-node tree, the number of possible edges that can form an odd cycle is 2.\n\nSo for each such edge between A and B, the number of ways is 2. So for each pair (A,B), the contribution is 4 * 2 = 8 ways.\n\nWait, no. Because for each edge between A and B, adding that edge is one way, and then adding one of the two edges in the merged component is another way.\n\nSo for each edge between A and B, the number of ways is 2. Since there are 4 edges between A and B, the total for the pair (A,B) is 4 * 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the total number of ways is the sum over all pairs (A,B) of components, the number of edges between them multiplied by 2.\n\nBut when there are multiple pairs, like three components, each being a tree of two nodes, then the number of pairs is 3 choose 2 = 3. And for each pair, the number of edges between them is 4, so total ways is 3 *4*2=24.\n\nSo, in code, when the graph consists of s components that are trees of two nodes, then the number of ways is s*(s-1)/2 * (number of edges between each pair) * 2.\n\nWait, but the number of edges between each pair is 4, as in the example. So, for each pair, it's 4 edges. So for s components, the total number of ways is (s choose 2) * 4 * 2.\n\nWait, but in the example with two components, it's 1 pair, 4 edges between them, each contributes 2 ways. So 4 * 2 =8.\n\nSo, general formula for s components (each a tree of two nodes):\n\nways = (s choose 2) * 4 * 2.\n\nWait, 4 comes from the number of possible edges between two components (each with two nodes), and 2 is the number of edges that form an odd cycle in the merged component.\n\nSo, 4 * 2 =8 per pair.\n\nSo, the total is (number of pairs) * 8.\n\nNumber of pairs is s*(s-1)/2.\n\nSo total ways is 8 * s*(s-1)/2 =4*s*(s-1).\n\nWait, 8 * (s choose 2) = 8*(s(s-1)/2) =4 s(s-1).\n\nSo for s=2: 4*2*(2-1)=8.\n\nWhich matches the earlier example.\n\nSo, in code, when the graph is composed of s components that are trees of two nodes, then the number of ways is 4*s*(s-1).\n\nBut what if the graph has more than two components, each a tree of two nodes, but also other types of components.\n\nWait, no. Because in that case, the graph would have other components that can contribute to t=1. So the earlier cases would have been handled, and we wouldn't reach the s components of two-node trees.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\n1. Read the graph and build the adjacency lists.\n\n2. Find all connected components.\n\n3. For each component:\n\n   a. Determine its structure: whether it's a tree, a cycle, etc.\n\n   b. Check if it has an odd cycle. If yes, note that and proceed.\n\n4. If any component has an odd cycle, output t=0 and the count of such components.\n\n5. Else, for each component:\n\n   a. If it's a tree with size >=3: compute the number of edges that can form an odd cycle in this component.\n\n   b. Else if it's a cycle of even length: compute the number of edges that can form an odd cycle in this component.\n\n6. Sum the counts from all such components to get w. If any such component exists, output t=1 and w.\n\n7. Else, check if the number of components that are trees of size 2 is >=2. If yes, compute the number of ways as 4*s*(s-1), where s is the number of such components.\n\n8. Output t and w accordingly.\n\nSo now, the main challenge is to determine for each component whether it has an odd cycle, and for each component, compute the number of possible edges to add to form an odd cycle.\n\nHow to determine for a component whether it has an odd cycle.\n\nOne way is to perform a BFS-based cycle detection, keeping track of the parity of the distance from the starting node. If during BFS, we find a back edge that creates a cycle with odd length, then it's an odd cycle.\n\nAlternatively, for each component, we can check if it's bipartite. If it's not bipartite, it has an odd-length cycle.\n\nWait, because in a bipartite graph, all cycles are even-length. So if the component is not bipartite, it has at least one odd-length cycle.\n\nSo for each component, we can perform a bipartition check.\n\nThus, steps for each component:\n\n- Check if it's bipartite.\n\n- If not, it has an odd cycle.\n\nSo, for each component, if it's not bipartite, then t=0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNext, for each component that is a tree, and size >=3, compute the number of possible edges to add.\n\nWait, no. Because a tree is bipartite. So in this case, the component is a tree, so it's bipartite. Thus, it can't have an odd cycle. So the component is a tree, and its size is >=3.\n\nIn such a tree, adding one edge can create an odd cycle if the path between the two nodes has even length.\n\nSo, for a tree, the number of possible edges to add is the number of pairs of nodes (u, v) such that the distance between u and v is even.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, in a tree, each node can be assigned a level (depth) in BFS. The parity of the distance between two nodes is the XOR of their depths. So, for two nodes u and v, their distance is even if their depths have the same parity.\n\nSo, for each node, count the number of nodes with the same parity. Then, the number of pairs is (count_even * count_even) + (count_odd * count_odd).\n\nBut wait, for each pair (u, v), u != v, and the edge is added between them.\n\nBut the number of possible edges is the number of such unordered pairs.\n\nSo, for a tree with N nodes:\n\n- Let c0 be the number of nodes at even levels.\n\n- Let c1 be the number of nodes at odd levels.\n\nThe number of possible edges is c0 * (c0 -1)/2 + c1 * (c1 -1)/2.\n\nWait, no, because the edge is undirected, so each unordered pair is counted once.\n\nSo the total number of possible edges is (c0 choose 2) + (c1 choose 2).\n\nBut for a tree, the root can be at level 0. So the levels alternate.\n\nFor example, a tree with 3 nodes (root, left, right) has levels 0, 1, 1.\n\nc0=1, c1=2.\n\nNumber of possible edges is (1*0/2) + (2*1/2) = 1.\n\nWhich is correct because the root",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges to add to a graph to form a simple cycle of odd length and count the number of ways to achieve this. The solution involves analyzing each connected component of the graph and determining if it can contribute to forming an odd cycle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Odd Cycles**: If any connected component already contains an odd cycle, the answer is `t=0` with `w` being the count of such components.\n2. **Check for Trees and Even-Length Cycles**: For each connected component, determine if it can form an odd cycle by adding one edge. This is possible if the component is a tree with at least 3 nodes or a cycle of even length.\n3. **Handle Small Trees**: If all components are trees with exactly 2 nodes, we need to connect two such components and add another edge to form an odd cycle, resulting in `t=2`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 <<
