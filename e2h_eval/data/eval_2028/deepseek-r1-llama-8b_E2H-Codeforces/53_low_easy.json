Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nThe input is a single string consisting of lowercase letters. The output should be the maximum length of such a substring. Oh right, and the occurrences can overlap. So for example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears starting at index 0 and then again at index 2, which overlaps.\n\nFirst, I should consider all possible substrings and check if any of them appear more than once. But wait, checking every possible substring might be time-consuming, but since the maximum string length is 100, it's manageable.\n\nWhat's a substring? A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. For a string of length n, the number of possible substrings is O(n^2), which for n=100 is 10,000. That's manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Generate all possible substrings of the input string.\n2. For each substring, check if it appears again in the string, possibly overlapping.\n3. Keep track of the maximum length found so far that satisfies the condition.\n\nBut generating all substrings and checking their occurrence could be optimized. How?\n\nLet me think about how to generate all substrings. For each possible starting index i (from 0 to n-1), and for each possible ending index j (from i to n-1), we can take the substring s[i..j]. We can collect all these substrings into a set or something, but maybe a better approach is to use a dictionary to count occurrences.\n\nWait, but we need to find the longest possible substring that occurs at least twice. So perhaps we can start by checking the longest possible substrings first and work our way down. Once we find the maximum possible, we can stop early.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the steps would be:\n\nLoop from the maximum possible substring length down to 1:\n   For each possible substring of this length, check if it appears at least twice in the string.\n   If such a substring exists, return its length.\n\nThis way, as soon as we find the maximum length, we can exit early without checking smaller lengths.\n\nNow, how do I implement this efficiently?\n\nLet's outline the steps more concretely.\n\nGiven a string s of length n.\n\nFor l in range(n, 0, -1):\n   For i in 0 to (n - l):\n       substring = s[i:i+l]\n       Check if this substring appears again in s, possibly overlapping.\n       To check, look for the substring starting at any position j >= i, but j can be up to i + l - 1? Wait, no, because the next occurrence could start anywhere after i.\n\nWait, no. For example, in 'ababa' with l=3, the substrings are 'aba' starting at 0 and 2. So when i=0, j=2, and when i=2, j=4. So when looking for another occurrence, I need to see if there's any position j where j >= i and j <= (n-l) such that s[j:j+l] == substring.\n\nSo, for each substring of length l starting at i, I can check all positions j starting from 0 to (n-l). So for each i, I can loop through j from i to (n-l), and see if any of the substrings starting at j match.\n\nAlternatively, for a given substring, I can slide a window of length l across the entire string and count how many times it appears.\n\nHmm, but for each l, we can precompute all possible substrings of length l and then check for duplicates.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, create a dictionary where the key is the substring and the value is the list of starting indices. Then, for each substring, if the list has at least two elements, we know it occurs at least twice. So for each l, we can iterate through all substrings of length l, add them to the dictionary, and if any have multiple entries, record l as a possible answer.\n\nOnce we find the largest l where this happens, we can return it.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nLoop l from n down to 1:\n   Create a dictionary, say substr_dict, where each key is a substring of length l, and the value is a list of starting indices.\n   Iterate through each possible starting index i in 0 to (n-l):\n       substring = s[i:i+l]\n       if substring is already in substr_dict:\n           append i to substr_dict[substring]\n       else:\n           substr_dict[substring] = [i]\n   After building substr_dict, check if any value in the lists has a length >=2.\n   If yes, return l as the result.\n\nIf none found, return 0.\n\nThat seems solid.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Generate Substrings**: For each possible length starting from the maximum possible down to 1, generate all substrings of that length.\n2. **Check for Duplicates**: For each substring of a given length, check if it appears again in the string. Use a dictionary to track the starting indices of each substring.\n3. **Early Termination**: As soon as we find the longest substring that appears at least twice, return its length. This approach ensures we efficiently find the solution without unnecessary checks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nmax_length = 0\n\nfor l in range(n, 0, -1):\n    substr_dict = {}\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in substr_dict:\n            max_length = l\n            print(max_length)\n            exit()\n        else:\n            substr_dict[substr] = True\n    if max_length > 0:\n        break\n\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the input string and determine its length.\n2. **Loop Over Lengths**: Start from the maximum possible substring length and decrement down to 1.\n3. **Substring Generation**: For each length, generate all possible substrings and store their starting positions in a dictionary.\n4. **Duplicate Check**: For each substring, if it is found more than once, record the length and exit early.\n5. **Output Result**: If a valid substring is found, print its length. If no such substring exists, print 0.\n\nThis approach ensures we efficiently find the longest repeating substring by leveraging early termination and dictionary-based tracking of substring occurrences.",
