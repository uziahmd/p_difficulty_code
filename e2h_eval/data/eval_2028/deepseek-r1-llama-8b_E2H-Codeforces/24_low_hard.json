She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a girl named Luba who has multiple tabs open in her browser and needs to close some of them as quickly as possible. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds she needs to spend to leave only a specific segment of tabs open.\n\nHmm. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, initially, she has n tabs open, numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position pos. She wants to keep the tabs from l to r inclusive. So, any tabs outside this range must be closed. The operations she can perform are moving the cursor left or right (but not beyond the currently open tabs), or closing all tabs to the left or right of the current position.\n\nEach operation takes one second. We need to calculate the minimal time to achieve the desired state.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. The key here is to figure out the order of actions that minimizes the steps. Since each action is either a move or a close, we have to decide the optimal sequence.\n\nFirst, let's consider the initial state. The available tabs are 1 to n. But after closing some, the available tabs will form a contiguous segment. The endpoints of this segment, a and b, change as tabs are closed.\n\nWait, but when she closes tabs, the a and b for the next steps are determined by the remaining open tabs. For example, if she closes all tabs to the left of the current position, then a becomes i, where i is the current position after the close.\n\nSo, the process involves possibly moving the cursor around and then performing close operations on either the left or right side.\n\nI think the approach is to determine whether it's better to close the left side first or the right side first, and then compute the minimal steps required for both scenarios, choosing the better one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she can close one side, move to the other, and close that. Or maybe she doesn't need to move at all.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem:\n\nWe need to close all tabs to the left of l and/or to the right of r.\n\nWait no, wait: the desired state is to have exactly the tabs from l to r open. So, all tabs before l must be closed, and all tabs after r must be closed.\n\nSo, the plan is to close all tabs to the left of l, and all tabs to the right of r.\n\nBut depending on the initial position of the cursor, she may need to move to the correct positions to perform these closes.\n\nSo, the steps would involve:\n\n1. Moving to the position where she can close the left side (probably at l).\n2. Close the left side.\n3. Move to the position where she can close the right side (probably at r).\n4. Close the right side.\n\nAlternatively, she might choose to close the right side first, then the left.\n\nOr maybe she can do it in a single movement and two closes.\n\nWait, but sometimes she might not need to move at all. Like in the sample input where l=1 and r=n, she just needs to do nothing because all tabs are already in the desired state.\n\nSo, the first thing to check is whether l is 1 and r is n. If so, the answer is zero.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n- Check if l == 1 and r == n. If yes, output 0.\n- Else:\n   - Determine whether to close the left first or the right first, whichever gives a better (smaller) time.\n\nWait, but there's another possibility: she could close both sides in any order, but perhaps the total steps are minimized by choosing the best path.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to close the left and the right in an order that minimizes the sum of steps.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to model this as two separate options and choose the one with minimal steps.\n\nLet me break down the problem into two parts: closing the left side and closing the right side.\n\nFor each of these, we need to calculate the steps required.\n\nCase 1: Close left side first.\n\nHow to do that:\n\n- Need to get to position l to close all tabs to the left.\n- The steps to move from pos to l, considering that during movement, the available tabs change as she closes other parts.\n\nWait, no. Because moving to l is before any closing. So, the initial a is 1, b is n.\n\nSo, moving from pos to l: the distance is |pos - l| steps. Then, she can close the left side, which takes 1 second.\n\nSimilarly, after that, she needs to get to r to close the right side. Now, after closing the left, a is l, b remains whatever it was before.\n\nWait, no. After closing the left of l, the new a is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves calculating the optimal sequence of movements and closes to minimize the total time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Edge Cases**: If the desired segment [l, r] covers all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no action is needed, so the result is 0.\n2. **Calculate Movements for Closing Left First**:\n   - Move from the initial position `pos` to `l`.\n   - Close all tabs to the left of `l`.\n3. **Calculate Movements for Closing Right First**:\n   - Move from the initial position `pos` to `r`.\n   - Close all tabs to the right of `r`.\n4. **Compute Total Time for Both Strategies**: Calculate the total time for both closing left first and closing right first, then choose the minimum of the two.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Function to calculate steps for closing left first\n    def close_left_first():\n        # Steps to move to l from pos\n        steps_move = abs(pos - l)\n        # Close left\n        steps_close = 1\n        # Now, after closing left, a becomes l. Need to move to r if needed\n        if l < r:\n            # Move from l to r\n            steps_move += abs(l - r)\n            # Close right\n            steps_close += 1\n        return steps_move + steps_close\n\n    # Function to calculate steps for closing right first\n    def close_right_first():\n        # Steps to move to r from pos\n        steps_move = abs(pos - r)\n        # Close right\n        steps_close = 1\n        # Now, after closing right, b becomes r.
