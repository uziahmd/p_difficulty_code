    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about finding the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then determining the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such a graph with that minimum number of nodes.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nA directed graph is called p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) such that u < v and both can reach each other. So these are pairs where u and v are reachable from each other, and u is less than v. Oh right, because it's an ordered pair, so direction matters but only for the reachability.\n\nSo the first part is to find the minimal number of nodes needed to have exactly p such pairs. The second part is, among all such graphs with that minimal number, find the maximum possible number of unidirectional pairs. Unidirectional means that (u, v) is in the graph, but (v, u) is not, and there's no path from v to u.\n\nHmm, okay. So first, I need to model the problem.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the graph. Since we want as many edges as possible to be unidirectional, perhaps the optimal graph is a DAG with certain properties. Or wait, maybe it's better to have a structure where certain components form strongly connected components (SCCs), and within those components, the edges are arranged in a way that maximizes unidirectional pairs.\n\nWait, but the p-reachable condition requires that for exactly p pairs (u, v) where u < v and they are mutually reachable. So these must be in the same SCC, because mutual reachability implies that u and v are in the same SCC.\n\nSo for the graph, the p pairs must come from a single SCC, perhaps? Because if two nodes are in different SCCs, they can't reach each other. So the p pairs must all be within a single SCC. Or wait, no, because multiple SCCs could have their own pairs, but the sum across all would contribute to p. But wait, the problem states that the graph has exactly p such pairs. So if we have multiple SCCs, each contributing some number of such pairs, their sum must equal p.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other.\" So any pair (u, v) where u and v are in the same SCC and u < v counts towards p.\n\nBut for the minimal number of nodes, perhaps the graph should have as few nodes as possible, meaning that we arrange the edges to maximize the number of such pairs per node.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal number of nodes is achieved when the graph is structured as a linear chain or something similar, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of nodes is determined by the triangular number. Because for n nodes, the maximum possible number of such pairs is C(n,2) = n*(n-1)/2. But wait, in our case, the graph may not allow all pairs to be mutual reachable. So the p pairs are exactly those that are mutual reachable.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the graph is p-reachable, meaning that it has exactly p such pairs. So to minimize the number of nodes, we need to arrange the graph such that the number of such pairs is p, using as few nodes as possible.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the minimal number of nodes is the smallest n where the sum of some k choose 2 equals p. Wait, that might not hold because the structure of the graph affects how many pairs are mutual reachable.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: Each such pair (u, v) contributes one to p. So for the minimal graph, we can model it as a collection of nodes arranged in a way that each new node added contributes as many new pairs as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of nodes is the ceiling of the square root of 2p. Because for each new node added beyond the first, the number of new pairs is increasing. For example, adding the second node adds 1 pair, the third adds 2, etc. Wait, but that's similar to the triangular numbers.\n\nWait, for n nodes, the maximum possible number of such pairs is C(n,2). But in our case, the graph may not have all possible edges. So to get p pairs, the minimal n is the smallest integer where C(n,2) >= p. Or perhaps it's more involved.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the graph can have any structure, not necessarily complete. So perhaps the minimal n is determined by the maximum number of such pairs possible, given n nodes. So for a given n, the maximum possible p is C(n,2), and the minimal n is the smallest n where C(n,2) >=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such a graph with that minimum number of nodes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-reachable Graphs**: A p-reachable graph has exactly `p` ordered pairs `(u, v)` where `u < v` and both `u` and `v` are mutually reachable.\n2. **Minimum Number of Nodes**: The minimum number of nodes required is determined by finding the smallest integer `n` such that the sum of the first `n-1` natural numbers (triangular number) is at least `p`. This is because each new node added can contribute to increasing the number of reachable pairs.\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: To maximize unidirectional pairs, the optimal structure is a complete DAG where each node points to every subsequent node. This structure ensures that all possible edges are unidirectional, maximizing the count.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef minimal_nodes(p):\n    if p == 0:\n        return (0, 0)\n    n = 0\n    s = 0\n    while s < p:\n        n += 1\n        s += n - 1\n    return (n, n*(n-1)//2 if n >=2 else 0)\n\np = int(input())\nif p == 0:\n    print(\"0 0\")\nelse:\n    n, max_uni = minimal_nodes(p)\n    print(f\"{n} {max_uni}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is a single integer `p` which represents the number of ordered pairs required.\n2. **Finding Minimum Nodes**: The function `minimal_nodes` calculates the smallest `n` such that the sum of the first `n-1` integers is at least `p`. This gives the minimum number of nodes needed.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Unidirectional Pairs**: For the optimal structure, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is given by the formula `n*(n-1)/2`, which is the number of ways to choose 2 nodes from `n` nodes.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the required values using mathematical properties and ensures optimal performance even for large values of `p`.",
