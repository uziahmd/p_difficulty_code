He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Prefixes and Suffixes.\" Hmm, Ivan has a string s of length n, and I don't know it. He tells me all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so lengths from 1 to n-1). But he doesn't say which are which—whether they're prefixes or suffixes. My task is to determine for each of the 2n-2 given strings whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the actual string s.\n\nWait, the output is a string of 'P's and 'S's where each character corresponds to one of the input strings. So for each input string, I need to decide if it's a prefix (mark as P) or a suffix (mark as S).\n\nThe first thing I need to figure out is how to determine, for each possible string in the input, whether it's a prefix, a suffix, or both. Because some strings could be both a prefix and a suffix of the original string s.\n\nBut since the input is given as a list of 2n-2 strings, each of length from 1 to n-1, and exactly two of each length, but without knowing which are prefixes and which are suffixes, I need to find a way to assign 'P' or 'S' correctly.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the original string s. For example, the original string s must have a certain prefix of length k and a certain suffix of length m, where k + m = n. So, for the original s, s[0..k-1] is a prefix, and s[n-m..n-1] is a suffix.\n\nWait, maybe that's not directly applicable here. Another approach: The key is that the entire string s must consist of a prefix and a suffix such that the prefix's last character is the same as the suffix's first character. Because when you combine them, they form the full string.\n\nSo, for example, if the prefix is \"aba\" and the suffix is \"ba\", then the full string would be \"ababa\". Wait, but wait, no—the prefix is length k, and the suffix is length m, where k + m = n. So the last character of the prefix must equal the first character of the suffix.\n\nThis is a crucial point. So, any candidate s must have its prefix ending with the same character as its suffix begins with.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find all possible candidates for the original string s by considering that the prefix and suffix must connect properly.\n\nWait, but the problem says that it's guaranteed that the given strings can form such a scenario. So for our problem, we can assume that there exists at least one possible s.\n\nBut how do I find which s it is? Or more precisely, for each input string, determine whether it's a prefix or suffix.\n\nHmm, perhaps another angle: For each possible string s_candidate that can be formed by combining a prefix and a suffix from the input, check whether all the given strings match either being a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate. Then, assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nBut trying all possible combinations might be computationally feasible since n is up to 100, but wait, the number of possible prefixes and suffixes is manageable.\n\nWait, but n can be 100, so the string can be up to 100 characters. So generating all possible s_candidate might be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be solved without explicitly constructing s_candidate. Instead, for each string in the input, determine whether it can be a prefix, a suffix, or both.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think about the process:\n\nEach string in the input is either a prefix, a suffix, or both. For the original string s, the prefixes are the ones of length 1, 2, ..., n-1, and similarly for the suffixes.\n\nBut for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two strings in the input of length l. One is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Or maybe both are prefixes, but that's not possible because the prefixes are of varying lengths and can't be overlapping in a way that allows two different prefixes for the same l.\n\nWait, no. Each length l from 1 to n-1 has exactly two strings in the input. They are either both prefixes, both suffixes, or one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, suppose the string is \"aaa\". Then, for length 1, \"a\" is both a prefix and a suffix. So for l=1, there are two \"a\"s, but they are both prefixes and suffixes. Similarly, for l=2, \"aa\" is both a prefix and a suffix.\n\nSo, in the problem statement, it",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether each of the given strings is a prefix or a suffix of the original string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves checking each string against possible candidates for the original string and categorizing them accordingly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Prefixes and Suffixes**: The original string `s` will have multiple prefixes and suffixes. Each prefix is a substring from the start up to some length, and each suffix is a substring from some length to the end.\n2. **Key Insight**: For the original string `s`, the last character of any prefix must match the first character of any corresponding suffix to form a valid string.\n3. **Candidate Construction**: We construct potential candidates for the original string by combining each possible prefix with a suffix where their characters align correctly.\n4. **Validation**: For each candidate string, check if all given strings can be either prefixes or suffixes of this candidate. If they can, mark them as 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    strings = []\n    for _ in range(2*n-2):\n        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        strings.append(s)\n    \n    # Group strings by their lengths\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    groups = defaultdict(list)\n    for s in strings:\n        l = len(s)\n        groups[l].append(s)\n    \n    # Now, for each possible l, there are two strings\n    # We need to find for each l whether one is prefix and the other is suffix\n\n    # For each possible l, determine which strings could be prefix and suffix\n    # The prefix of length l must be such that when combined with a suffix of length m (where l + m = n), the last char of prefix == first char of suffix\n\n    # Let's try to find all possible candidates for s\n    candidates = []\n\n    # Iterate through all possible splits into prefix and suffix\n    for l in range(1, n):\n        group = groups[l]\n        # Try all possible pairs of prefix and suffix\n        for prefix in group:\n            for suffix in group:\n                if len(prefix) != l or len(suffix) != l:\n                    continue\n                if prefix[-1] == suffix[0]:\n                    candidate = prefix + suffix\n                    if len(candidate) == n:\n                        candidates.append(candidate)\n    \n    # Now, for each candidate, determine which input strings are P or S\n    result = [''] * (2*n - 2)\n    for i, s in enumerate(strings):\n        is_prefix = False\n        is_suffix = False\n        for candidate in candidates:\n            if s == candidate[:len(s)] and len(s) < n:\n                is_prefix = True\n            if s == candidate[-len(s):] and len(s) < n:\n                is_suffix = True\n        if is_prefix or is_suffix:\n            # Determine if it's P or S based on being a prefix or suffix in at least one candidate\n            # But since the problem allows any possible correct answer, we can assign it as P if it's a prefix in any candidate, else S\n            # Alternatively, check if it's a prefix in any candidate\n            # But perhaps a better way is to see if it's a prefix or suffix in at least one candidate\n            # Since the problem requires that the output is consistent with at least one possible s, but the actual s may not be known\n            # So for each string in the input, if it is a prefix of some candidate, mark as P; else, if it is a suffix, mark as S\n            # Else, it's impossible, but the problem states it's guaranteed\n            # So let's try to find for each string if it is a prefix of any candidate\n            found_p = False\n            found_s = False\n            for cand in candidates:\n                if s == cand[:len(s)] and len(s) < n:\n                    found_p = True\n                if s == cand[-len(s):] and len(s) < n:\n                    found_s = True\n            if found_p:\n                result[i] = 'P'\n            elif found_s:\n                result[i] = 'S'\n            else:\n                # This should not happen as per problem statement\n                pass\n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution reads the input and groups the strings by their lengths. It then constructs potential candidates for the original string by combining each possible prefix with a suffix where their characters align. Each candidate is checked to see if all given strings can be either prefixes or suffixes of this candidate. The result is then determined by checking if each string fits as a prefix or suffix in any candidate, marking them accordingly. This approach ensures that we correctly categorize each string as 'P' or 'S' based on the constraints provided.",
