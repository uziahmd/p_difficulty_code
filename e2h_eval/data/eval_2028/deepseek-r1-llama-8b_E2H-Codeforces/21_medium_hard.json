The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Neko Finds Grapes.\" Hmm, sounds interesting. So, Neko found some treasure chests and keys. The goal is to open as many chests as possible using the keys.\n\nLet me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, each chest has a number a_i and each key has b_j. A key can unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd. That means either one is even and the other is odd because even + odd = odd. Oh right, but wait, no: wait, 1+2=3 which is odd. Yes, that's right.\n\nEach key can be used once on one chest, and each chest can be opened at most once. So, we need to assign keys to chests such that as many chests as possible are unlocked.\n\nThe input gives n chests and m keys. We have to find the maximum number of chests we can open.\n\nHmm, okay. So, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I think we need to count the number of even and odd a_i and b_j. Because the condition depends on the parity.\n\nLet me think: for a key j and chest i, a_i + b_j must be odd. So, the parities must be different. So, if a_i is even, then b_j must be odd. Or vice versa.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal way is to:\n\n- Find how many keys are even and how many are odd.\n- Similarly, find how many chests are even and how many are odd.\n\nThen, match the even keys with the odd chests, and the odd keys with the even chests.\n\nWait, yes! Because each even key can only unlock an odd chest, and each odd key can only unlock an even chest.\n\nSo, the maximum number of chests we can open is the sum of the minimum between the number of even keys and the number of odd chests, plus the minimum between the number of odd keys and the number of even chests.\n\nBut wait, is that all? Because maybe there's a better way. Like, sometimes you might have more even keys than odd chests, but perhaps after assigning as much as possible, you can't do anything else. So, the sum would be correct.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because any key can only unlock a chest of opposite parity. So, the maximum possible is to take as many as possible from each category.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd in the a array (chest numbers).\n   Let's say, even_a = number of even a_i, odd_a = n - even_a.\n\n2. Count the number of even and odd in the b array (key numbers).\n   Even_b = number of even b_j, odd_b = m - even_b.\n\n3. Then, the maximum chests we can open is min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a).\n\nWait, no. Wait, because each key can only be used once. So, the sum is the total possible matches.\n\nWait, let's see: for example, suppose even_b is 5, and odd_a is 3. Then, we can use 3 even keys to unlock 3 odd chests. Then, for the remaining even_b (5-3=2), they can't do anything because there's no more odd chests left. Similarly, if odd_b is 4 and even_a is 2, then we can use 2 odd keys to unlock 2 even chests. The remaining 2 odd keys can't do anything else.\n\nSo the total is 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but what if even_b is larger than odd_a? Then, the sum is odd_a plus the min between (even_b - odd_a) and something else? No, no, because the even_b beyond odd_a can't unlock any more chests since the chests are all used up.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum is just the number of even keys that can be matched to odd chests plus the number of odd keys that can be matched to even chests. So, the maximum is the sum of those two minima.\n\nWait, but wait another case. Suppose even_b is 5, odd_a is 3, and even_a is 4, odd_b is 6.\n\nSo, even_b can match 3 odd chests. Then, even_a is 4, and odd_b is 6. So, we can match 4 even chests with 4 odd keys. The remaining 2 odd keys can't do anything.\n\nSo total is 3+4=7.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the formula is indeed the sum of the two minima.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For a, count the number of even and odd elements.\n\n- For b, count the number of even and odd elements.\n\n- The result is min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a).\n\nBut wait, is that all? Because, in the first sample input, let's see:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nSo, a is [9,14,6,2,11]. So, a_i's parities:\n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd.\n\nSo, even_a is 3 (14,6,2). Odd_a is 2 (9,11).\n\nb is [8,4,7,20]: 8 even,4 even,7 odd,20 even. So, even_b is 3 (8,4,20), odd_b is 1 (7).\n\nSo, min(even_b=3, odd_a=2) → 2.\n\nmin(odd_b=1, even_a=3) →1.\n\nTotal 3, which matches the sample output.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother sample: second input.\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\na is [2,4,6,8,10] → all even. So, even_a=5, odd_a=0.\n\nb is [5], which is odd. So, even_b=0, odd_b=1.\n\nSo, min(even_b=0, odd_a=0) is 0. Min(odd_b=1, even_a=5) is 1. So total 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample: n=1, m=4.\n\na is [10], which is even.\n\nb is [20,30,40,50], all even. So, even_b=4, odd_b=0.\n\nSo, min(even_b=4, odd_a=0) is 0. Min(odd_b=0, even_a=1) is 0. Total 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the approach works for these samples.\n\nSo, the solution is to compute the counts of even and odd in a and b, then apply the formula.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this efficiently, especially considering the constraints.\n\nConstraints: n and m can be up to 1e5, which is manageable.\n\nIn Python, reading the inputs, processing each list to count evens and odds is straightforward.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Read the a list, count how many are even and how many are odd.\n\n3. Read the b list, count how many are even and how many are odd.\n\n4. Compute the sum of min(even_b, odd_a) and min(odd_b, even_a).\n\n5. Output that sum.\n\nSo, the code is simple.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nCase where all a are even, all b are even: then even_b + even_a's min is 0, because to unlock, a and b must have opposite parity. So, no chests can be opened.\n\nAnother case: a has both even and odd, b has both even and odd. So, the sum is the sum of the minima.\n\nWhat if m is larger than n? Or n is larger than m? It doesn't matter; the min function will cap it.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nLet me think about how to count the even and odd numbers in a list.\n\nIn Python, for each element x in a list, check if x % 2 == 0. If yes, increment even count, else odd.\n\nSame for b.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_a = 0\n\nodd_a = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n\n        even_a += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        odd_a += 1\n\neven_b = 0\n\nodd_b = 0\n\nfor num in b:\n\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n\n        even_b +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        odd_b +=1\n\nresult = min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a)\n\nprint(result)\n\nWait, that's all. Seems straightforward.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nAfter processing a, even_a=3, odd_a=2.\n\nProcessing b: even_b=3, odd_b=1.\n\nSo, min(3,2)=2, min(1,3)=1. Sum 3.\n\nSample 2:\n\na all even, even_a=5, odd_a=0.\n\nb has 1 element, odd_b=1, even_b=0.\n\nmin(0,0)=0, min(1,5)=1. Sum 1.\n\nSample 3:\n\na is even, even_a=1.\n\nb all even, even_b=4, odd_b=0.\n\nSo, min(4,0)=0. min(0,1)=0. Sum 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when a has some even and some odd, and b has more.\n\nLike a has 2 even, 2 odd. b has 3 even, 1 odd.\n\nSo, even_b=3, odd_a=2.\n\nmin(3,2)=2.\n\nodd_b=1, even_a=2 → min is 1.\n\nTotal 3.\n\nSo, 3 chests can be opened.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: a has 0 even, 3 odd. b has 2 even, 1 odd.\n\nmin(even_b=2, odd_a=3) is 2.\n\nmin(odd_b=1, even_a=0) is 0.\n\nTotal 2.\n\nWhich is correct, because we can use 2 even keys to unlock 2 of the 3 odd chests, leaving one chest unlocked but no keys to open it.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the given keys. Each key can unlock a chest if their numbers have opposite parities (i.e., one is even and the other is odd).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count the number of even and odd integers in both the list of chests and the list of keys.\n2. **Match Keys to Chests**: Use the counts from the previous step to determine how many keys can unlock each type of chest (even or odd). Specifically:\n   - Even keys can unlock odd chests.\n   - Odd keys can unlock even chests.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Opened Chests**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum of even keys and odd chests plus the minimum of odd keys and even chests.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_a = 0\nodd_a = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_a += 1\n    else:\n        odd_a += 1\n\neven_b = 0\nodd_b = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_b += 1\n    else:\n        odd_b += 1\n\nmax_chests = min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a)\nprint(max_chests)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of chests `n`, the number of keys `m`, followed by two lists representing the chests and keys respectively.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Numbers**: We iterate through both lists to count how many even and odd numbers are present.\n3. **Matching Keys to Chests**: Using the counts, we determine how many keys can unlock each type of chest by checking the minimum values between the counts of even/odd keys and chests.\n4. **Output Result**: The result is the sum of these minimum values, which gives the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
