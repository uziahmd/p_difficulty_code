She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a browser with several tabs open, and Luba needs to close some tabs efficiently. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds she needs to spend to close all the tabs outside a specific range [l, r].\n\nHmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, the initial setup is that there are n tabs, numbered from 1 to n. The cursor starts at position pos. Luba wants to keep tabs from l to r open. She needs to close all other tabs as quickly as possible.\n\nEach second, she can do one of two actions: move the cursor left or right, but within the current range of open tabs. Or, she can close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor. Closing tabs affects the current range because after closing, the remaining tabs are the ones between a and b, where a is the min index of unclosed tabs and b is the max.\n\nThe task is to calculate the minimal steps (seconds) needed to achieve this.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which tabs need to be closed. So any tabs before l or after r must be closed.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says she needs to leave only the tabs in [l, r]. So she has to close all tabs not in that segment.\n\nBut the initial state may have some of those already closed? No, wait, initially, all tabs are open except those that have been closed by her actions. Oh, no, the problem says she needs to close all the tabs that don't belong to [l, r]. So regardless of initial state, she has to close them.\n\nSo, for example, if l is 2 and r is 4, then any tab 1 must be closed, and any tab 5,6,...n must be closed.\n\nNow, each second, she can perform either a move or a close action.\n\nI think the key is to model the problem into steps:\n\n1. Determine which tabs to the left of l need to be closed.\n2. Determine which tabs to the right of r need to be closed.\n3. Find the optimal path to close these, considering that moving the cursor might take steps, and closing takes one step each.\n\nWait, but each close operation closes a large chunk at once. For example, if the cursor is at position x, she can close all tabs to the left (so everything from a to x-1), or to the right (x+1 to b).\n\nSo, for the left side, she needs to reach a position where she can close all the left unwanted tabs. Similarly for the right.\n\nSo, the steps would involve:\n\n- Moving to the correct position to close the left part.\n- Close it.\n- Move to the correct position to close the right part.\n- Close it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she can close both in a single movement if possible.\n\nSo, let's break it down.\n\nCase 1: All the left tabs to close are from 1 to l-1.\n\nShe needs to get to a position where she can close the left. The best position is l, because then she can close all tabs to the left, which would include everything from 1 to l-1. Because when she's at l, the a is the first unclosed tab, which is 1. So, closing left would close 1 to l-1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the a and b change as tabs are closed. So initially, a=1, b=n.\n\nIf she moves to position l, then the left closure would close [a, l-1], which is 1 to l-1. So yes.\n\nSimilarly, on the right side, she needs to reach r, and close all tabs from r+1 to b. But when she's at r, closing to the right will close r+1 to b.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Move from pos to l (or to some position where she can close the left side).\n   - Time taken is |pos - l| steps.\n   - Then, close left (1 sec).\n2. Move from l to r (time |r - l| steps).\n   - Then, close right (1 sec).\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can find a better way, like moving to some other point and then closing both sides.\n\nWait, another idea: what if she doesn't need to move to l for closing the left side. Maybe she can just move to a position where closing left or right is sufficient without needing to go all the way to l or r.\n\nFor example, suppose she is at some position x where x is beyond l, but she can close all left tabs by moving to l and then closing left.\n\nWait, no. Because to close the left, she needs to be at a position where the left closure includes all the unwanted tabs.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal steps involve:\n\n- Calculating the steps needed to close the left side and the right side, considering that she can do them in any order.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps can be calculated as the sum of the steps to reach the left closure point, plus the steps to reach the right closure point, plus two (for the two close operations). But she can possibly do them in an order that allows her to minimize the movement.\n\nLet me consider the steps involved.\n\nFirst, decide whether to close the left first or the right.\n\nOption 1: Close left first, then right.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Move from pos to l. Steps: |pos - l|.\n2. Close left. Time: 1.\n3. Now, the left is closed. So the new a is l, and b remains whatever it was after the left closure.\n4. Then, we need to close the right side. So, we need to move to r. Steps: |current_pos (which is l) to r|.\n5. Close right. Time: 1.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - l| + 1 + |l - r| + 1 = |pos-l| + |l - r| + 2.\n\nOption 2: Close right first, then left.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Move from pos to r. Steps: |pos - r|.\n2. Close right. Time: 1.\n3. Now, right is closed. a remains the same, and b is r.\n4. Then, move to l. Steps: |r - l|.\n5. Close left. Time: 1.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1 = same as option 1.\n\nWait, but sometimes, the positions could be such that one direction requires less movement than the other. Like, if pos is closer to l than to r, then closing left first is better.\n\nWait, but in the two options, the total movement is |pos - l| + |l - r|. Which is the same as |pos - r| + |l - r| if you switch. Because |pos - l| + |l - r| = |pos - r| + |r - l|, since |l - r| is the same as |r - l|.\n\nSo, the total movement is fixed as the distance from pos to l plus the distance from l to r. Or, alternatively, pos to r plus r to l.\n\nWait, no: |pos - l| + |l - r| is the same as |pos - l| + |r - l|. But |pos - r| + |r - l| is equal to |pos - l| + |r - l| only if pos is on one side of l and r is on the other.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose pos is at 3, l is 2, r is 4. So |3-2|=1, |2-4|=2. Total movement is 3.\n\nIn option 2, moving to r (4) from pos (3) is 1 step, then moving to l (2) is 2 steps. So total movement is 1+2=3, same as option 1.\n\nSo, the total movement is the same in both cases.\n\nHmm, so the order doesn't matter for the movement steps. Only the initial movement and the final movement.\n\nWait, but what about the case where l is the same as r? Then, she doesn't need to move at all. Just close both left and right, but that's only needed if l != r.\n\nWait, if l == r, then she needs to close all tabs except that single tab. So, she needs to move to that position and close both left and right.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if l == r, then she only needs to close all tabs except l. So, she can close the left (tabs before l) and the right (tabs after l). Or, perhaps she can close both in a single move, but probably not. Let me think.\n\nWait, in this case, l = r, say 3. So she needs to close all tabs before 3 and after 3.\n\nShe can move to 3, close left, then close right. Or the other way around.\n\nSo, movement steps would be 0 (if pos is at 3) plus two steps for the closes.\n\nSo, the total steps are 2.\n\nBut wait, if she is already at 3, then she can close left and then right, each taking 1 second. So 2 steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can close both in one step? No, because each close is a separate action.\n\nSo, in that case, the steps are 2.\n\nAnother edge case: l == pos. Then, she is already at l, so moving to l is 0 steps. So she can close left (if needed) and then proceed.\n\nBut in general, the steps required are:\n\n- Steps to move to l (or r, depending on order) → 1 step for close → steps to move to r → 1 step for close.\n\nBut wait, perhaps she can combine the movements in some way.\n\nWait, maybe she can move to l, close left, then move to r, close right. Or move to r, close right, then move to l, close left.\n\nWhich order is better depends on the distances.\n\nWait, let's think about the steps in each case.\n\nCase 1: Close left first.\n\nTime = |pos - l| (move to l) + 1 (close left) + |l - r| (move to r) + 1 (close right).\n\nTotal: |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2.\n\nCase 2: Close right first.\n\nTime = |pos - r| (move to r) + 1 (close right) + |r - l| (move to l) + 1 (close left).\n\nTotal: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nBut |pos - l| + |l - r| is equal to |pos - r| + |r - l| because:\n\n|pos - l| + |l - r| = |pos - l| + |r - l|.\n\nAnd |pos - r| is equal to |pos - l - (r - l)|, which isn't necessarily the same as |pos - l| + |r - l|.\n\nWait, no. Wait, |pos - r| is |(pos - l) - (r - l)|. So it's the same as |pos - l| + |r - l| if pos is on one side of l and r is on the other.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. For example, if pos is to the right of r, then |pos - r| is (pos - r), and |pos - l| is (pos - l), which could be larger than (r - l) if l < r < pos.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me take an example.\n\nSuppose l=2, r=4, pos=5.\n\nThen, Case 1: move to 2 (3 steps), close left (1), move to 4 (2 steps), close right (1). Total steps: 3+1+2+1=7.\n\nCase 2: move to 4 (1 step), close right (1), move to 2 (2 steps), close left (1). Total steps: 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nSo in this case, choosing to close the right first is better.\n\nAh, so the order can affect the total steps.\n\nSo the approach is not fixed; it depends on the relative positions.\n\nTherefore, to find the minimal steps, we need to compute both possibilities and choose the one with the least steps.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWe can model the problem by considering the four possible scenarios:\n\n1. Close left first, then right.\n\n2. Close right first, then left.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps another scenario exists where she can close both in a single move, but I don't think so.\n\nSo, for each scenario, compute the steps and choose the minimum.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps for each scenario:\n\nScenario A: Close left first.\n\n- Move from pos to l: steps = |pos - l|.\n\n- Close left: 1 step.\n\n- Then, move from l to r: steps = |l - r|.\n\n- Close right: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2.\n\nScenario B: Close right first.\n\n- Move from pos to r: steps = |pos - r|.\n\n- Close right: 1 step.\n\n- Then, move from r to l: steps = |r - l|.\n\n- Close left: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nScenario C: Perhaps, if she can close both in a single movement? But no, each close is a separate action.\n\nSo, the minimal steps would be the minimum between Scenario A and Scenario B.\n\nBut wait, is that all? Are there other scenarios?\n\nWhat if she doesn't need to close both sides? For example, if l is 1 and r is n, then she doesn't need to close any tabs.\n\nWait, in that case, the answer is 0 steps because all tabs are already in [l, r].\n\nAnother edge case: l = 1 and r = n. Then, no tabs need to be closed. So the output is 0.\n\nAnother case: l == r. Then, she needs to close all tabs except l. So she can move to l (if not already there), close left, then close right. So steps are |pos - l| + 2.\n\nWait, yes. Because after moving to l, closing left closes all tabs to the left (but there's nothing), and then closing right closes all to the right. So that's correct.\n\nSo, to handle all cases, we can:\n\n- If l == r: then she needs to close all tabs except l. So steps are 2 (assuming she is at l) or more.\n\nBut wait, if she is not at l, she needs to move there and then close left and right.\n\nWait, but in this case, l and r are the same. So, when she is at l, closing left and right will close everything else.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, now, the algorithm would be:\n\nCompute the minimal steps as the minimum between:\n\n- Scenario A: close left first, then right.\n\n- Scenario B: close right first, then left.\n\nAdditionally, handle the case where l > r, but according to the problem statement, l <= r, so no.\n\nBut wait, what about when l is 1 and r is 1. Then, she needs to close all tabs except 1.\n\nSo, steps are:\n\n- Move to 1: steps |pos - 1|.\n\n- Close left: 1 step (but no tabs to close on left, so same as closing nothing).\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, closing left would close [a, i-1], where a is the current minimum open tab.\n\nInitially, a is 1. So, if she's at 1, and she closes left, it will close all tabs from a=1 to i-1=0, which is none. So nothing happens.\n\nSo, closing left when at l=1 does nothing. So, she needs to close the right side.\n\nSo, after moving to 1, she needs to close the right.\n\nSo, steps:\n\nMove to 1: |pos-1|.\n\nClose right: 1 step.\n\nThus, total steps |pos-1| + 1.\n\nWait, but earlier thought said that she needs to close both left and right. So, why is that?\n\nBecause, for l=1, r=1: all tabs except 1 are to the left and right. So, she needs to close both.\n\nWait, no. Because 1 is the only tab she wants to keep. So, she needs to close all tabs before 1 (none) and all after 1.\n\nSo, she can close the right side, which includes all tabs after 1, which is exactly what she needs.\n\nSo, in this case, she can just close the right side after moving to 1.\n\nSo, steps are |pos -1| + 1.\n\nSo, the initial reasoning that she needs to close both is incorrect. It's sufficient to close the right.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the desired state is to have only tabs in [l, r]. So, if l=r=1, then all other tabs (to the right) need to be closed. So, she can just close the right side.\n\nSo, in that case, she doesn't need to close the left side, because there's nothing to close on the left.\n\nSo, the earlier logic that she needs to close both is wrong.\n\nSo, this suggests that the initial approach may have a flaw.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model each scenario, considering whether she needs to close left, right, both, or neither.\n\nSo, let's reevaluate.\n\nFirst, determine whether she needs to close the left side (i.e., any tabs before l) and/or the right side (tabs after r).\n\nSo:\n\n- left_close_needed = (l > 1)\n\n- right_close_needed = (r < n)\n\nIf both are needed: then she has to close both.\n\nIf only left is needed: close left.\n\nIf only right is needed: close right.\n\nIf neither is needed: zero steps.\n\nSo, for each case:\n\nCase 1: Both left and right need to be closed.\n\nShe has to close both. So, the steps are as per Scenario A and B.\n\nCase 2: Only left needs to be closed.\n\nShe can just close the left.\n\nHow?\n\nShe can move to l, close left.\n\nBut wait, moving to l may take steps, and then closing left takes 1.\n\nBut perhaps she can find a better position than l.\n\nWait, for example, if she is at a position x where x is >= l, and closing left from x will automatically close all tabs before l.\n\nWait, no. Because a is the current minimum open tab. Suppose she is at x, and she closes left: she'll close all tabs from a to x-1.\n\nBut if a is 1, and x is somewhere, then x-1 could be >= l.\n\nWait, no. For example, if she is at x=5, l=3. Then, closing left would close all tabs from a=1 to 4. But 4 is >=3, so the left closure includes some tabs that are inside [l, r], which is not allowed.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nAh! So, the strategy of moving to l and closing left only works if the current a is l, and x is l. Because then, closing left will close all tabs from l to l-1, which is nothing. So that's not useful.\n\nWait, this suggests that my initial approach is incorrect. Because when you're at position x, closing left will close all tabs from a to x-1. So, if a is 1, then x-1 could be greater than l, thus including some tabs that are in [l, r], which we cannot close.\n\nWait, that's a big issue.\n\nSo, the approach of moving to l and closing left is only valid if the left closure doesn't include any of the desired tabs.\n\nWhich would be the case if x-1 is l-1, meaning x is l.\n\nBecause then, when you close left, you close a to l-1, which is 1 to l-1, which is exactly the tabs to close.\n\nBut if x is greater than l, then x-1 is greater than l-1, so the left closure would include some tabs that are inside [l, r], which we don't want to close.\n\nSo, that's a problem. So, the initial approach is flawed.\n\nWait, this changes everything.\n\nSo, the correct approach is that to close the left side, the position must be such that when you close left, all the tabs before l are closed, and none of the [l, r] are touched.\n\nWhich means that the position x must be l, because then, the left closure is from a to x-1, which is 1 to l-1.\n\nSimilarly, to close the right side, the position must be r, because then, the right closure is from r+1 to b.\n\nSo, in order to close the left side, she must be at l, and then close left.\n\nSimilarly, to close the right side, she must be at r, and then close right.\n\nSo, this complicates things.\n\nSo, the steps are as follows:\n\n- She needs to reach l to close the left.\n\n- She needs to reach r to close the right.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. Move from pos to l.\n\n2. Close left.\n\n3. Move from l to r.\n\n4. Close right.\n\nOr, alternatively:\n\n1. Move from pos to r.\n\n2. Close right.\n\n3. Move from r to l.\n\n4. Close left.\n\nWhich order is better depends on the distance.\n\nSo, the total steps for each order:\n\nOrder 1:\n\nSteps to move to l: |pos - l|.\n\nClose left: 1.\n\nSteps to move to r: |l - r|.\n\nClose right: 1.\n\nTotal: |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2.\n\nOrder 2:\n\nSteps to move to r: |pos - r|.\n\nClose right: 1.\n\nSteps to move to l: |r - l|.\n\nClose left: 1.\n\nTotal: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nBut since |r - l| is the same as |l - r|, the total steps for both orders are the same.\n\nWait, but in the first example given in the problem statement:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4\n\nOutput: 5.\n\nLet's compute the steps.\n\nOrder 1: move to 2 (distance 1), close left (1), move to 4 (distance 2), close right (1). Total 5 steps.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the initial approach is correct.\n\nBut what about the case where l=1 and r=1.\n\nIn this case, she needs to close all tabs except 1.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Move to 1.\n\n2. Close right (since left closure won't do anything, as a=1 and x=1, so x-1=0. So, no tabs are closed on the left).\n\n3. Close right: this closes all tabs from 2 to n.\n\nSo, steps are |pos-1| + 1.\n\nBut according to the initial approach, the code would compute:\n\nleft_close_needed is true (since l>1? No, l is 1. So left_close_needed is false.\n\nright_close_needed is true (since r=1 < n).\n\nSo, she needs to close right.\n\nSo, steps are |pos - r| (r is 1) + 1.\n\nWhich is |pos-1| + 1.\n\nSo, the initial approach correctly handles this case.\n\nBut earlier, the case where she needs to close both left and right, but the initial approach of moving to l and then to r is required.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct steps are as follows:\n\nCompute the number of steps to close the left and right, considering that she has to move to l and r, and perform the closes.\n\nAdditionally, if l > r, which can't happen because l<=r.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nCompute the steps for both orders (left first or right first), but since the movement steps are same in both, the total steps are the same.\n\nWait, no. Because in some cases, moving to l first may require more steps than moving to r first.\n\nWait, for example, if pos is very close to r, but far from l.\n\nLike pos is 5, l is 2, r is 4.\n\nThen, moving to r (4) is 1 step, then to l (2) is 2 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5.\n\nAlternatively, moving to l first: 3 steps (from 5 to 2), close left (1), then move to 4 (2 steps), close right (1). Total steps: 3+1+2+1=7.\n\nSo, clearly, the order affects the total steps.\n\nSo, the algorithm needs to compute both possibilities and choose the minimal.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCompute the steps for both orderings:\n\nOption 1: Close left first, then right.\n\nOption 2: Close right first, then left.\n\nTake the minimal of the two.\n\nSo, the steps for each option are:\n\nOption 1:\n\nsteps = |pos - l| + 1 (close left) + |l - r| + 1 (close right).\n\nOption 2:\n\nsteps = |pos - r| + 1 (close right) + |r - l| + 1 (close left).\n\nSince |r - l| is same as |l - r|, the difference is in |pos - l| vs |pos - r|.\n\nSo, the minimal steps is the minimum of (option1, option2).\n\nBut wait, what if she doesn't need to close both sides?\n\nFor example, if l=1 and r= n. Then, she needs to close nothing.\n\nSo, steps are 0.\n\nAnother case: if l=1 and r=5, and n=10. So, she needs to close 6-10.\n\nSo, she can close right after moving to 5.\n\nSo, steps: |pos -5| + 1.\n\nBut according to the initial approach, option1 would compute |pos-1| + |1-5| + 2.\n\nWhich is |pos-1| +4 +2 = |pos-1| +6.\n\nWhich is worse than just closing right.\n\nSo, the initial approach is incomplete because it assumes that both left and right need to be closed, but in reality, she may only need to close one.\n\nThus, the correct approach is:\n\nDetermine whether both left and right need to be closed, only left, only right, or none.\n\nIf none: 0 steps.\n\nIf only left: steps are |pos - l| +1.\n\nIf only right: steps are |pos - r| +1.\n\nIf both: then compute both options and choose the minimal.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute:\n\nleft_needed = (l > 1)\n\nright_needed = (r < n)\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n    return 0\n\nelif left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n    steps = |pos - l| + 1\n\nelif not left_needed and right_needed:\n\n    steps = |pos - r| + 1\n\nelse:\n\n    # both needed\n\n    option1 = |pos - l| + 1 + |l - r| + 1\n\n    option2 = |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1\n\n    steps = min(option1, option2)\n\nSo, this seems correct.\n\nTesting this logic against the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n6 3 2 4\n\nleft_needed: 2>1 → True\n\nright_needed:4<6 → True\n\nSo, compute option1 and option2.\n\noption1: |3-2|=1 +1 + |2-4|=2 +1 → 1+1+2+1=5.\n\noption2: |3-4|=1 +1 + |4-2|=2 +1 → 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nSo, min is 5. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n6 3 1 3\n\nleft_needed:1>1 → False.\n\nright_needed:3<6 → True.\n\nSo, steps = |3-3| +1 = 0 +1=1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 2 1 5.\n\nleft_needed:1>1 → False.\n\nright_needed:5<5 → False.\n\nSo steps=0. Which matches sample.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput: n=10, pos=5, l=3, r=7.\n\nleft_needed:3>1 → True.\n\nright_needed:7<10 → True.\n\nCompute option1: |5-3|=2 +1 + |3-7|=4 +1 → 2+1+4+1=8.\n\noption2: |5-7|=2 +1 + |7-3|=4 +1 → 2+1+4+1=8.\n\nSo steps=8.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=10, pos=9, l=3, r=7.\n\noption1: |9-3|=6 +1 +4 +1=12.\n\noption2: |9-7|=2 +1 +4 +1=8.\n\nSo, minimal is 8.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=10, pos=5, l=1, r=10.\n\nleft_needed:1>1 → False.\n\nright_needed:10<10 → False.\n\nsteps=0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=10, pos=5, l=1, r=9.\n\nleft_needed:1>1 → False.\n\nright_needed:9<10 → True.\n\nsteps= |5-9|=4 +1=5.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=10, pos=1, l=1, r=5.\n\nleft_needed:1>1 → False.\n\nright_needed:5<10 → True.\n\nsteps= |1-5|=4 +1=5.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=10, pos=5, l=2, r=8.\n\nleft_needed:2>1 → True.\n\nright_needed:8<10 → True.\n\nCompute option1:\n\n|5-2|=3 +1 + |2-8|=6 +1 → 3+1+6+1=11.\n\noption2:\n\n|5-8|=3 +1 +6 +1=11.\n\nsteps=11.\n\nBut what if she can close both in a smarter way?\n\nWait, she needs to close left (1-1) and right (9-10).\n\nTo close left, she must be at 2, then close left.\n\nTo close right, she must be at 8, then close right.\n\nSo, the steps are 3 (to 2) +1 +6 (to 8) +1= 11.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the algorithm seems correct.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nImplement the following steps:\n\n1. Read n, pos, l, r.\n\n2. Compute left_needed = (l > 1).\n\n3. Compute right_needed = (r < n).\n\n4. If neither is needed, output 0.\n\n5. Else if only left is needed: output |pos - l| +1.\n\n6. Else if only right is needed: output |pos - r| +1.\n\n7. Else (both needed):\n\n   a. Compute option1: |pos - l| + 1 + |l - r| + 1.\n\n   b. Compute option2: |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1.\n\n   c. Output the minimum of option1 and option2.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in code, we have to calculate these values.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead the input as four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n\nCompute left_needed and right_needed.\n\nDepending on the conditions, compute the steps.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nleft_needed=True, right_needed=True.\n\noption1= |3-2|+1 + |2-4|+1 → 1+1+2+1=5.\n\noption2= |3-4|+1 + |4-2|+1 → 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nmin is 5.\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3.\n\nleft_needed=False, right_needed=True.\n\nsteps= |3-3| +1 →0+1=1.\n\nTest case 3:\n\nn=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5.\n\nleft_needed=False, right_needed=False.\n\nsteps=0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=10, pos=9, l=3, r=7.\n\nleft_needed=True, right_needed=True.\n\noption1: |9-3|=6 +1 + |3-7|=4 +1 →6+1+4+1=12.\n\noption2: |9-7|=2 +1 +4 +1 → 8.\n\nSo, minimal is 8.\n\nSo, code should output 8.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nSo, implementing this in Python.\n\nThe code:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute:\n\nleft_needed = (l > 1)\n\nright_needed = (r < n)\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelif left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n    steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelif not left_needed and right_needed:\n\n    steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1\n\n    option2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1\n\n    steps = min(option1, option2)\n\nprint(steps)\n\nWait, but in the code above, when both left and right are needed, the code computes:\n\noption1 = (move to l) + 1 (close left) + (move to r) + 1 (close right).\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly for option2.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: 6 3 2 4 → code returns 5.\n\nSample 2: 6 3 1 3 → code returns 1.\n\nSample 3:5 2 1 5 →0.\n\nAnother test case: n=10, pos=9, l=3, r=7.\n\noption1: 6+1+4+1=12.\n\noption2: 2+1+4+1=8. So, min is 8.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves calculating the optimal path for moving the cursor and closing the necessary tabs efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Need to Close Tabs**: Determine if tabs need to be closed on the left of `l` or on the right of `r`. Specifically:\n   - `left_needed` is True if `l > 1`.\n   - `right_needed` is True if `r < n`.\n\n2. **Handle Edge Cases**:\n   - If neither left nor right tabs need to be closed, the result is 0.\n   - If only left tabs need to be closed, calculate the steps to move to `l` and close them.\n   - If only right tabs need to be closed, calculate the steps to move to `r` and close them.\n\n3. **Calculate Steps for Both Sides**:\n   - If both sides need to be closed, compute the steps for two scenarios: closing the left side first, then the right, and vice versa. Choose the scenario with fewer steps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nleft_needed = l > 1\nright_needed = r < n\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n    print(0)\nelif left_needed and not right_needed:\n    steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\nelif not left_needed and right_needed:\n    steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\nelse:\n    option1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1\n    option2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1\n    steps = min(option1, option2)\nprint(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Identify Needs**: Determine if tabs on either side of the segment [l, r] need to be closed.\n- **Edge Cases**: Directly handle cases where no tabs need to be closed or only one side needs attention.\n- **Optimal Path Calculation**: For both sides needing closure, compute the steps required for each possible order of closing (left first or right first) and choose the minimal steps.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal time required by considering all possible scenarios and choosing the optimal path.",
