There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a tennis tournament where players are eliminated in a knockout style. The main thing is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by no more than one. The goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner could have played.\n\nHmm, right. So the tournament starts with n players, and each game eliminates one player. The winner keeps playing until they lose. But wait, no— the winner is the one who continues until they can't anymore. Wait, no, the winner is the one who wins all their games, right? So the winner will play as many games as possible.\n\nThe key constraint is that when two players face each other, the difference in the number of games they've played before this match is at most one. So for example, if player A has played 3 games and player B has played 2, they can play each other. But if A has 4 and B has 1, that's a difference of 3, which is not allowed.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a structure where the winner plays as many opponents as possible, each time making sure that the previous game counts allow them to meet the condition.\n\nLet me think about small examples first.\n\nTake n=2: there's only one match. So the winner plays 1 game.\n\nn=3: the winner plays two matches. How? They must have played 0, then 1, then 2. Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, in the initial state, all players have 0 games played. The winner starts by playing someone. After that, they have 1 game. Then, they play another match, now having 2 games. So for n=3, the maximum is 2.\n\nWait, but how does the tournament proceed? For n=3, the initial matches are two, say between A vs B and C vs D (but wait, n is 3, so maybe it's A vs B, and C sits out. Then the winner of A/B plays C. So the winner plays two games.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAnother example: n=4. What's the maximum? The sample says it's 2. Hmm, how?\n\nBecause after the first round, you have two winners. Suppose the winner plays two matches: each time, the opponent must have either the same or one less game count.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf the winner plays in such a way that they have 0, 1, 2 games. So how? Because when they play the second match, the opponent must have either 0 or 1 games.\n\nBut if the tournament structure is such that the winner plays two matches, each time meeting an opponent who has played one less game than them, then perhaps that's possible.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum number of games is the largest k such that the sum of 1 + 2 + ... + (k-1) is less than or equal to n-1.\n\nWait, wait. Let's think of the winner's path. Each game they win increases their game count by one. To maximize the number of games, the winner should play against opponents in a way that allows as many games as possible, considering the constraint on the number of games each opponent has played before facing them.\n\nSo, for each step, the opponent must have a game count that is either equal to or one less than the winner's current game count minus one (since each game adds one).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the maximum number of games the winner can have as the largest k where the sum from 1 to k is >= n.\n\nNo, perhaps not. Let me think differently.\n\nEach time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games, where k is the number of games the winner has played before this match.\n\nWait, because when the winner has played k games, their next opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\nSo the tournament is structured such that the winner's path requires that each opponent has as few games as possible before facing them, allowing more opponents to be used.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of games is the largest k such that the sum of (k choose 2) is <= n - 1.\n\nWait, maybe I should think recursively. For each possible k, determine if it's possible to have a tournament structure where the winner plays exactly k games, given the constraints.\n\nSo let's find the maximum k where the sum of the first k terms is <= n-1. Because each game the winner plays adds one to their count, and each opponent can only have a certain number of games.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of games the winner can have is the largest k where the sum of 1+2+...+(k-1) is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given that two players can only face each other if the number of games they have already played differs by no more than one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by the structure of the tournament. The winner must play in such a way that each opponent they face has either played the same number of games or one fewer game than the winner up to that point.\n\nWe can model this problem by finding the largest integer `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (1 + 2 + ... + k) is less than or equal to the total number of players minus one. This is because each game the winner plays increases their count, and the opponents must be arranged in a way that allows the winner to play as many games as possible while adhering to the given constraint.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nk = 0\ntotal = 0\nwhile True:\n    k += 1\n    total += k\n    if total >= n - 1:\n        break\nprint(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by reading the input value `n`, which represents the number of players.\n2. **Loop to Find Maximum Games**: We use a loop to find the largest integer `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `n - 1`. This loop increments `k` and accumulates the sum until the condition is met.\n3. **Output Result**: Once the loop exits, `k` holds the maximum number of games the winner can play, which is then printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of games by leveraging the properties of arithmetic progression and ensuring the constraints are met for each opponent the winner faces.",
