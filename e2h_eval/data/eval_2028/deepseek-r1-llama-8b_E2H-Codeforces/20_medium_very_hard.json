For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about finding the number of ways to choose c_s for each binary string s such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nWait, let me read the problem statement again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nWe are given n, k, and f. We consider all binary strings of length from 1 to n. For each string s, we choose a c_s between 0 and k. A multiset is beautiful if, for every string s (from length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix does not exceed c_s. Our goal is to find the number of ways to choose these c_s such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nOh right, and the answer needs to be modulo 998244353.\n\nThe example given helps. Let's think about how the example works.\n\nIn the first sample input, n=1, k=42, f=2. The output is 3. The explanation says there are three ways to choose c_0 and c_1. So for each way, the maximum beautiful multiset size is exactly 2.\n\nWait, but wait—how do we model this? It seems like for each choice of c_s values, we need to compute the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset, and then count how many such choices result in the maximum being exactly f.\n\nHmm. So the key is to model for each possible choice of c_s, what is the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset, and then count how many of these choices lead to that maximum being f.\n\nBut since n can be up to 15, and for each string s, the c_s can be up to 2e5, enumerating all possibilities directly isn't feasible.\n\nSo, we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem.\n\nEach binary string s has a certain 'weight' in terms of how many times it appears in the multiset. But more precisely, each string t in the multiset contributes to the counts of all its prefixes s.\n\nFor example, if I have the string '01' in the multiset, it contributes 1 to the count of '0', 1 to '01', and 0 to others.\n\nWait no, wait: each string in the multiset adds 1 to all of its prefixes. So for '01', it adds 1 to '0' and 1 to '01'.\n\nSo, for any multiset M, the count for a string s is the number of strings in M that have s as a prefix.\n\nTherefore, when building M, each string contributes 1 to all its prefixes.\n\nNow, the condition for the multiset to be beautiful is that for every s, the number of strings in M that have s as a prefix must be ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, but M is a multiset. So, for a particular s, the count is the sum of occurrences of all strings in M that are prefixed by s.\n\nSo, the problem is to choose c_s for each s such that for each s, the total number of t in M where s is a prefix of t is ≤ c_s.\n\nThe goal is to maximize |M|, but we want exactly f such maximum.\n\nSo, for each possible set of c_s, the maximum possible |M| is determined by how the constraints c_s are chosen. Then, we need to count the number of sets of c_s that result in the maximum |M| being exactly f.\n\nThis sounds like a dynamic programming problem, perhaps involving inclusion-exclusion or some combinatorial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem as follows: Each c_s is a constraint on the number of extensions that can be added beyond s. Because, for each s, the number of t that are longer than s and start with s is equal to the number of elements in M that are prefixed by s. Wait, no: because any string in M that starts with s will add 1 to the count of s. So, the count for s is the sum over all t in M where s is a prefix of t. So, for each s, the count is the number of elements in M that are in the subtree rooted at s.\n\nWait, maybe thinking in terms of the trie structure. Each node s in the trie represents a binary string, and each of its children represents a longer string starting with s. The count for s is the number of nodes in M that are in the subtree of s.\n\nSo, for each s, the number of such t in M is the size of M in the subtree of s. This must be ≤ c_s.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to choosing c_s for each s, and then the maximum |M| is constrained by the minimal possible sum based on the c_s's.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, the maximum |M| is achieved when for each s, the subtree under s is exactly min(c_s, something). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size is determined by the sum over all s of the minimum between c_s and the number of possible strings in the subtree of s.\n\nWait, for each s, the maximum number of times we can include strings in its subtree is min(c_s, the number of possible strings in the subtree of s).\n\nWait, no. Because each string in the subtree of s contributes 1 to s's count. So the maximum number of strings that can be included in the subtree of s is the minimum of c_s and the number of possible strings in that subtree.\n\nWait, the number of possible strings in the subtree of s is 2^{m}, where m is the number of bits after s. For example, if s is \"01\", which is length 2, the subtree has 2^0 =1 string (\"01\").\n\nWait, no. Wait, s is a string of length l. The number of possible extensions is 2^{n - l} for each n >= l. But wait, no: for a specific s of length l, the number of possible strings in the trie that are exactly l' >= l and have s as a prefix is 2^{l'}, but for the subtree of s, it's all possible strings that start with s, regardless of their length beyond l.\n\nWait, the subtree of s includes s itself, and all longer strings that start with s. So the number of such strings is infinite if l < n, but in our case, we're considering only up to n.\n\nWait, no. Since the multiset is built from strings of lengths from 1 to n, each string s of length l < n can have children of length l+1, l+2, etc., up to n. So the number of possible strings that have s as a prefix is the sum from l'=l to n of 2^{n - l'}, but that doesn't make sense because for a fixed s of length l, the number of possible extensions is 2^{n-l-1} for each length l+1, l+2, ..., n. So the total is sum_{i=1 to n - l} 2^i = 2^{n - l + 1} - 2.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, for a string s of length l, the number of possible strings that are prefixed by s is 2^{n - l} × (number of possible strings beyond s) plus 1 (the string s itself). Wait, no. Because for each position after s, you can choose 0 or 1. So for s of length l, the number of possible t that have s as a prefix is sum_{m=0}^{n - l} 2^m = 2^{n - l + 1} - 1. Because for each extension length m (from 0 to n-l), there are 2^m possible strings.\n\nBut wait, including s itself, which is m=0 (no extension). So the total is 2^{n - l + 1} - 1.\n\nBut when n is up to 15, this can get quite large. For example, n=15, s is length 1: 2^{15} -1 = 32767.\n\nBut for the purposes of the problem, when calculating the maximum possible M, each s can contribute up to min(c_s, 2^{d} - 1), where d is the depth allowed beyond s. Or maybe not exactly that.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible size of M is determined by the sum for each s of min(c_s, 2^{n - l} ), where l is the length of s.\n\nNo, because for s of length l, any string t that starts with s and has length greater than l contributes to s's count. So, the count for s is the sum of all t in M that are in the subtree of s.\n\nThus, for s of length l, the maximum number of strings that can be in M in its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the maximum possible number of such strings. But wait, the maximum possible is 2^{n - l} × (number of possible t's beyond s). Or wait, no. Because each extension of s can be present multiple times in M.\n\nWait, no, M is a multiset. So, for each s, the count is the number of t in M that have s as a prefix. So for each s, the count can't exceed c_s. But each t in M contributes to all of its prefixes.\n\nSo, the problem is to arrange the c_s such that for each s, the sum of t's in M that are prefixed by s is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut we want to maximize |M|, which is the sum of all t's in M.\n\nWait, but |M| is the sum of all t's in M, which is exactly the sum of all s's in M (since each t is counted once). So |M| is the number of elements in M.\n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\nFor each s, sum_{t in M, t is a prefix of s} 1 <= c_s.\n\nWait, no: for each s, the count is the number of t in M that have s as a prefix. So for s, the count is the number of t's in M where s is a prefix of t.\n\nThus, for each s, the count is the number of t's in M that are in the subtree of s (including s itself).\n\nSo, the constraints are for each s, the count of t in M in the subtree of s must be ≤ c_s.\n\nOur goal is to choose c_s for all s such that the maximum possible |M| is exactly f.\n\nWait, but how is |M| related to the c_s's? Let's think about the constraints.\n\nEach time we add a string t to M, it contributes 1 to all of its prefixes s.\n\nSo, for each t in M, all the s's that are prefixes of t will have their count increased by 1.\n\nThus, the count for s is the number of t's in M that are in the subtree of s (including s itself).\n\nSo, the constraints are that for each s, the number of t's in M in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s.\n\nWe need to choose the c_s's such that the maximum possible |M| is exactly f.\n\nHmm. So the problem is to model the selection of c_s's, ensuring that the maximum |M| is f. And then count how many such selections are possible.\n\nSo, for a given selection of c_s's, the maximum |M| is the maximum number of strings t that can be chosen, subject to the constraints that for each s, the count of t's in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, but the maximum |M| is determined by the c_s's. So for each c_s, the maximum possible is the minimum of c_s and the number of possible t's in the subtree of s. Or perhaps it's more involved.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum |M| is the sum over all s of the minimum of c_s and the number of possible t's in the subtree of s, but considering that adding a t affects all of its prefixes.\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe it's better to model this as a tree where each node s has a capacity c_s, and the edges represent the possible children. Then, the maximum |M| would be the sum of the number of nodes we can select, considering the constraints that for each node s, the number of selected nodes in its subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum |M| is determined by the constraints on the subtrees. For instance, for each s, the number of t's in the subtree of s is at most c_s. So the maximum |M| is the sum over all s of the minimum between c_s and the number of possible t's in the subtree of s.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because selecting a t in a deeper subtree affects all its ancestors.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum |M| is the sum for each s of the minimum between c_s and the number of possible t's in the subtree of s, but this is an overcount because selecting a t affects all of its prefixes.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the problem using inclusion-exclusion.\n\nFor each string s, the count of t's in M that have s as a prefix is the sum of all t's in M that are in the subtree of s.\n\nSo, for each s, the constraint is that this sum ≤ c_s.\n\nWe want to maximize |M|, which is the number of t's in M.\n\nSo, the maximum |M| is the maximum number of t's we can have such that for each s, the number of t's in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nPerhaps the maximum |M| can be computed by considering each s's contribution, but taking into account that selecting a t affects all its prefixes.\n\nThis feels like a tree-based DP problem, where for each node s, we track the number of t's selected in its subtree, and ensure that it's ≤ c_s.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 15, which gives 2^15 -1 possible strings, but each string can be represented as a bitmask.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this using a bitmask approach, where each state represents a subset of the strings, but that's probably too slow for n=15.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model it as a directed acyclic graph, where each node represents a string s, and the edges represent the parent-child relationships (prefixes). Then, the constraints form a tree where each node s has a maximum allowed count c_s, and the sum of the counts in the subtree of s cannot exceed c_s.\n\nWait, but that's still vague.\n\nLet me think differently. For the maximum |M|, each string s can contribute at most min(c_s, 2^{n - len(s)} ) to the total, but this isn't accurate because adding a string t affects all its prefixes.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum |M| is the sum over all s of the minimum between c_s and the number of possible t's in the subtree of s. But this might overcount because selecting a t contributes to all its prefixes.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum |M| is the minimum, for each s, of the c_s, but that also seems incorrect.\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to model the problem as a system of inequalities. For each s, the count of t's in its subtree is ≤ c_s. The count for s is the number of t's in M that are in the subtree of s.\n\nWe can model this as a tree where each node s has a constraint on the sum of its subtree.\n\nSo, the problem becomes to assign a value x_t for each t (x_t is 0 or 1, indicating whether t is in M), such that for each s, the sum of x_t for t in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s. We aim to maximize the sum of x_t for all t.\n\nThe maximum sum is then the maximum possible |M|.\n\nBut how to find, for a given set of c_s, what is this maximum sum?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a flow network, where each node s has a capacity c_s, and the edges represent the dependencies between the nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum flow approach could work. Let's imagine that each node s has a capacity c_s, and the edges are from the leaves to their parents, enforcing that the sum of the children's flows cannot exceed the parent's capacity.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Because for each node s, the sum of the x_t's in its subtree is the sum of the x_t's in its children's subtrees plus x_s itself (if x_s is 1). So, the sum for s is x_s plus the sum of the x_t's for its children.\n\nTherefore, for each s, we have:\n\nsum_{t in children(s)} x_t + x_s ≤ c_s\n\nAnd we aim to maximize sum x_t.\n\nThis looks like a tree-based flow problem where each node s has a supply of x_s, and the edges from s to its children enforce that the sum of the children's x_t's plus x_s cannot exceed c_s.\n\nWait, but this is similar to the problem of scheduling jobs with precedence constraints, where the sum of certain variables must not exceed a limit.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node represents a string s, and the edges represent the constraint that the sum of the children plus x_s must be ≤ c_s.\n\nThen, the maximum |M| is the maximum flow from a source to the sink, where the source connects to each leaf node, and the sink connects from each internal node, with capacities based on the constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as a bipartite graph where each node has a certain capacity, and edges represent the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a linear programming problem, but since the variables are binary (each x_t is 0 or 1), it's more of an integer linear programming problem, which is NP-hard. However, given the small n (up to 15), perhaps a DP approach is feasible.\n\nWait, another idea: for each s, the maximum number of times we can include a string in the subtree of s is c_s. But since each t contributes to all its prefixes, the inclusion of t affects all its ancestors.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum |M| is the sum over all s of the minimum between c_s and the number of possible t's in the subtree of s, but with the constraint that for each s, the count of t's in its subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut again, this is unclear.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the problem differently.\n\nSuppose we fix the c_s's. Then, the maximum |M| is the largest possible number of strings t such that for every s, the number of t's in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s.\n\nWe need to find the number of c_s assignments such that this maximum is exactly f.\n\nSo, for a given assignment of c_s's, the maximum |M| is f. We need to count all such assignments.\n\nBut how to model this for n=15, which gives a lot of possible s's.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached using Möbius transforms or inclusion-exclusion, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Think recursively. For each string s, the maximum number of t's that can be included in its subtree is min(c_s, ... ). But I'm not sure how to model the dependencies.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum |M| is the sum over all s of the minimum between c_s and the number of possible t's in the subtree of s, but with the condition that for any s, the sum of the minimums for the children plus s's own x is ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, for each s, the sum of the x_t's in its subtree (including itself) can't exceed c_s. And the maximum |M| is the sum of x_t's across all t.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum |M| is the minimum, for each s, of the sum of c_s and the maximum possible in the subtree.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here.\n\nLet me try to think of the problem in terms of the constraints.\n\nEach string t contributes 1 to all its prefixes s. So, for each t, the presence in M of t requires that for every prefix s of t, c_s is at least the number of t's that have s as a prefix.\n\nWait, no, because it's the other way around: the presence of t requires that for all s that are prefixes of t, the count for s is at least 1. So, if we include t in M, then for each s that is a prefix of t, the count of s in M increases by 1.\n\nBut the constraints are that for each s, the count is ≤ c_s.\n\nSo, the process of adding t's to M must ensure that for each s, the count doesn't exceed c_s.\n\nThus, the maximum |M| is the largest possible set of t's such that, for each s, the number of t's in M that are prefixed by s is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is equivalent to assigning a variable x_t ∈ {0,1} for each t, such that for each s, the sum of x_t for t in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s. The objective is to maximize the sum of x_t.\n\nThe maximum sum is then the maximum |M|.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum for a given set of c_s's.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a tree where each node s has a capacity c_s, and the edges represent the hierarchy of the prefixes.\n\nThe maximum |M| is then the maximum number of nodes we can select in this tree, with the constraint that the sum of the selected nodes in each subtree (including itself) does not exceed its capacity.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum |M| is the sum over all s of the minimum between c_s and the number of possible t's in the subtree of s, but again, this may not capture the dependencies correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps for each s, the maximum number of t's in its subtree is min(c_s, the number of possible t's in the subtree). But the problem is that selecting a t in a child's subtree also affects the parent's count.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum is the minimum for each s of c_s and the sum of the min(c_child, ...) for the children.\n\nWait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum |M| is the minimum, for each s, of the sum of c_s and the sum of the minimums of the children.\n\nNo, I'm not making progress here.\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps for a given c_s, the maximum |M| can be computed as the sum over all s of min(c_s, the number of possible t's in the subtree of s). But this isn't correct because including a t affects all of its prefixes.\n\nWait, perhaps this can be modeled as a tree where each node s has a capacity c_s, and the edges connect the children to the parent. The maximum |M| is then the sum of the flows through the tree, where each node's flow is limited by its capacity, and the sum of flows in a subtree is bounded by the capacity of the root.\n\nWait, yes! That makes sense.\n\nEach node s in the trie can have a certain capacity c_s. The flow through the node s is the number of t's in its subtree that are selected. So, for each node s, the flow can't exceed c_s. Also, the flow of s is the sum of the flows of its children plus 1 if s is selected.\n\nWait, but in terms of flow, perhaps each node s can have a certain amount of 'flow' which is the number of t's in its subtree that are selected. So, for each s, the sum of the flows of its children plus the indicator variable x_s (whether s is selected) must be ≤ c_s.\n\nBut this is a bit abstract. How can we model this as a flow problem?\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum |M| can be found by finding the maximum possible flow in a network where:\n\n- Each node s has a capacity c_s.\n- The network is structured such that the flow from a node to its parent is accounted for, ensuring that the sum of the flows in the subtree of a node s does not exceed c_s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each node s can have a certain number of slots, and the selection of t's in its subtree consumes some of these slots.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum |M| is determined by the minimum c_s along each path from the root to the leaves. Because, for a chain of prefixes s1, s2, ..., sk, the count for s1 is at least as large as the counts for s2, etc. So, the limiting factor for the maximum |M| is the minimum c_s along the path.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose s is a string of length l, and s has a child t of length l+1. The count for s is the number of t's in its subtree, which includes s itself and all its descendants. So, if s is included, it contributes 1 to the count of its parent, if any.\n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum |M| is the sum over all s of min(c_s, 2^{n - len(s)}), but that can't be right because overlapping contributions.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum |M| is the sum over all s of min(c_s, 2^{n - len(s)}), but I don't think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum |M| is the sum over all s of min(c_s, the number of possible t's in the subtree of s). But again, this ignores the dependencies between the t's.\n\nI'm stuck trying to model the maximum |M| for a given set of c_s's.\n\nMaybe I should try to find a way to compute the maximum |M| for a given set of c_s's, and then model the problem as counting the number of c_s assignments that lead to the maximum |M| being exactly f.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum |M| efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum |M| is the sum of all c_s minus the sum of the c_s's for the parents. But that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum |M| is the sum of the c_s's, but subtracting the c_parent for each node s, assuming that each s is part of its parent's subtree.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to model this as a tree where each node s has a certain capacity, and the maximum |M| is the sum of the minimum of c_s and the sum of the minima of the children.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, suppose for each node s, the maximum number of t's in its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum t's in each of its children's subtrees plus 1 (for s itself). So, for each s:\n\nmax_flow(s) = min( c_s, 1 + sum( max_flow(child) for each child of s) )\n\nBut this seems recursive.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for each node s, you can have at most c_s t's in its subtree. Additionally, each child can contribute up to their max_flow. Plus, s itself can be included, contributing 1.\n\nSo the maximum |M| is the sum of all max_flow(s) for each s.\n\nWait, no. Because max_flow(s) is the maximum number of t's in the subtree of s. So, for the entire tree, the maximum |M| is the sum of all max_flow(s) for each s.\n\nWait, no. Because each t is counted in all of its ancestor s's. So, the sum of max_flow(s) for all s would be much larger than |M|. So that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the max_flow(s) for each s represents the maximum number of t's that can be included in the subtree of s, considering the constraints. But the total |M| is the sum of all t's, which is the same as the sum of the max_flow(s) for the leaves minus the higher nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum |M| is the sum of all max_flow(s), but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think with an example. Consider the root node, say '0'. Its max_flow is min(c_0, 1 + sum of max_flow of its children).\n\nIf '0' has two children '00' and '01', then the max_flow of '0' is min(c_0, 1 + max_flow('00') + max_flow('01')).\n\nSimilarly, max_flow('00') is min(c_00, 1 + sum of its children's max_flow, etc.\n\nSo, the maximum |M| is the sum of all the max_flow(s) for each s.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because each t is included in multiple s's.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum |M| is the sum of the max_flow(s) for each s, but that would count each t multiple times.\n\nHmm, no. Because for each t, it is in the subtree of all its prefixes. So, the sum of max_flow(s) would be larger than |M|.\n\nThus, perhaps the approach of recursively computing max_flow(s) for each node s, and then the total |M| is the sum of the max_flow(s) for the leaves.\n\nNo, that doesn't fit either.\n\nI think I'm stuck trying to model the maximum |M|.\n\nPerhaps another approach is needed. Let's think about the problem as a series of constraints and see how to model it.\n\nEach string s contributes to the constraints of all its prefixes. So, the selection of the c_s's must satisfy that for each s, the number of t's in its subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nThe maximum |M| is the largest possible |M| satisfying all constraints.\n\nWe need to count the number of c_s assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the maximum |M| is determined by the c_s's, and that this is a monotonic function. So, for each possible assignment of c_s's, the maximum |M| is a non-decreasing function of the c_s's.\n\nWait, no. Actually, increasing any c_s can't decrease the maximum |M|.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be approached using inclusion-exclusion principles or combinatorial methods based on the constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding the number of c_s assignments that allow the maximum |M| to be exactly f. This is equivalent to saying that the maximum |M| is at least f, and the maximum |M| is at most f-1.\n\nBut how?\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be viewed as the sum over all possible subsets of the c_s's that allow a maximum |M| of exactly f.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution involves precomputing for each possible subset of the c_s's whether the maximum |M| is f, and then count the number of such subsets.\n\nBut with n up to 15, the number of possible c_s's is 2^15 * k, which is way too big.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's consider the problem in terms of the required c_s's. For the maximum |M| to be exactly f, there must be exactly one way to assign c_s's such that the constraints are satisfied.\n\nWait, no. Because the c_s's can vary, leading to different maximum |M|'s.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find all possible c_s assignments such that the maximum |M| is f, and count them.\n\nBut again, how.\n\nAnother Idea: For each possible c_s assignment, compute the maximum |M|. Then, count the number of c_s assignments where this maximum is f.\n\nBut for n=15, even with k=2e5, the number of possible c_s's is 2^(2^15), which is impossible.\n\nThus, this approach is not feasible.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be modeled using generating functions or matrix exponentiation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem on a trie, where each node s has a capacity c_s, and the maximum |M| is the sum of the minimum of c_s and the sum of the c_child for each child.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum |M| can be determined by the sum over all s of the minimum of c_s and the number of possible t's in the subtree of s, but again, the dependencies complicate things.\n\nAt this point, I'm not making progress, so perhaps it's better to look for hints or think about the problem differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum |M| is the sum of the c_s's for all s, minus the sum of the c_s's for their parents, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the number of ways to choose c_s's such that the sum of the min(c_s, 2^{n - len(s)}) is exactly f.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum |M| is the sum over all s of min(c_s, 2^{n - len(s)}), but again, this doesn't account for the overlapping constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum |M| is the sum of the min(c_s, the number of possible t's in the subtree of s), but again, this would overcount because each t is in multiple s's.\n\nI'm stuck.\n\nPerhaps I should look for patterns or think about smaller examples.\n\nTake the first sample input: n=1, k=42, f=2.\n\nThe possible c_0 can be 0, 1, or 2, and c_1 can be 0,1, or 2.\n\nWait, but in the example, the valid assignments are:\n\n1. c_0=0, c_1=2: The maximum |M| is 2.\n\nBecause for s='0', the count is 2 (since '0' is a prefix of both '0's and '1's?), but wait, no: for s='0', the count is the number of strings in M that have '0' as a prefix. So if M is {'0', '1'}, then '0' is a prefix of both, so the count is 2, which must be ≤ c_0. So c_0 must be ≥2.\n\nBut in this case, c_0 is 0, which is less than 2, so this assignment is invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the example says that in the first sample, the maximum |M| is 2, and the three valid c assignments are:\n\nc_0=0, c_1=2 → M={0,0}, which has size 2.\n\nWait, because for '0', the count is 2, which is ≤ c_0=0? No, that can't be. 2 >0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example.\n\nWait, the note says:\n\nIn the first example, the three ways are:\n\n1. c_0=0, c_1=2: the maximum M is {1,1} → size 2.\n\nBecause for s='0', the count is 0, since neither '1' nor '1' is a prefix of '0'? No, wait '1' is not a prefix of '0'.\n\nWait, no: '0' is a prefix of '00', '01', etc., but '1' is not a prefix of '0' or '00'.\n\nWait, in this case, M = {'1','1'}: for s='0', the count is 0, because neither '1' is a prefix of '0'; for s='1', the count is 2, which is ≤ c_1=2. So the maximum |M| is 2.\n\nAh, I see. So in this case, c_0 is 0, but since the M doesn't contain any strings that are prefixes of '0', the count is zero, which is ≤ c_0.\n\nSo, the maximum |M| depends on how the c_s's are chosen and which t's are included.\n\nSo, for each t in M, it contributes 1 to all its prefixes. Thus, the inclusion of t in M is possible only if for all its prefixes s, c_s is ≥ the number of t's in M that are prefixed by s.\n\nWait, no. Because for each t in M, all its prefixes s will have their count increased by 1. So, for each s that is a prefix of t, the count of s in M increases by 1. Thus, including t in M is only possible if for all s in the prefixes of t, the count of s is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut since the count is the number of t's in M that are in the subtree of s, including t in M affects all s's along its path to the root.\n\nThis suggests that the inclusion of t's in M is subject to the constraints of all their prefixes.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nPerhaps the problem can be thought of as a tree where each node s has a capacity c_s, and the inclusion of a node t contributes 1 to all its ancestors. Thus, the inclusion of t is only possible if, for each ancestor s of t, the current count of t's in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut this seems like a resource allocation problem, where each t's inclusion depends on the availability of the capacities of all its ancestors.\n\nBut solving this for n=15 is challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum |M| is the sum over all s of min(c_s, 2^{n - len(s)} ), but that's not correct because it doesn't account for overlapping t's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum |M| is the sum over all s of the minimum between c_s and the number",
