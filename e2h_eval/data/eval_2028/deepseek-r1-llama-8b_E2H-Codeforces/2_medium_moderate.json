Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X'. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe grid is n x n, where n is odd. The conditions for it being an 'X' are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same character.\n2. All the other squares (non-diagonal) must be the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to check the two main diagonals. Then, all the positions not on these diagonals should be the same as each other but different from the diagonal letters.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think about what the 'X' looks like. For a 3x3 grid, the X is formed by the four corners and the center. So in that case, the two diagonals are both 'x's (assuming the example uses 'x' as the diagonal), and the middle is also 'x'. But wait, no—wait, the problem says the diagonals have the same letters, and the other squares must be the same but different. So for the 3x3 case, the four corners and the center would be the diagonals. Wait, no, wait: the main diagonals are from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left. In a 3x3 grid, that's positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) for one diagonal, and (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) for the other. So in the 'X', all these positions must be the same character, say 'x'. Then, the remaining positions (the four edges) must all be another single character, say 'o'.\n\nSo for a 5x5 grid, the main diagonals are longer. Positions like (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) and (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0). All these must be the same. And all other cells (non-diagonal) must be the same, and different from the diagonal.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n2. Check if the main diagonals are the same. That is, all elements in the main diagonal (i == j) are the same character, say c.\n3. Check if the other diagonal (i + j == n-1) also consists of the same character c.\n4. Then, check that all the non-diagonal elements are the same, but not equal to c.\n\nWait, but step 2 and 3 may not be sufficient because the diagonals could have different characters. So first, I need to check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. Because the condition says \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". So, the diagonal characters must all be the same as each other. So, for example, if the main diagonal is all 'x's and the other diagonal is all 'y's, then it's invalid.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n- Check if all elements on the main diagonal are the same. Let's call this char c.\n- Check if all elements on the other diagonal are also c.\n- Then, check that all other elements (not on either diagonal) are the same, let's say d, which is different from c.\n\nSo how do I implement this?\n\nFirst, read the grid. Since the input is given as lines, each line is a string. So for n=5, there will be 5 lines, each 5 characters long.\n\nLet me represent the grid as a list of lists. Each row is a list of characters.\n\nThen, for the main diagonal: for each i from 0 to n-1, grid[i][i] should be c. So, collect all grid[i][i] into a list and see if they are all the same.\n\nSimilarly, for the anti-diagonal (other diagonal): for each i, j = n-1 -i. So for each i, grid[i][n-1-i] should be c.\n\nOnce I have that, then I need to check all the non-diagonal cells. These are the cells where i != j and i + j != n-1.\n\nAll such cells must be the same, and that character must be different from c.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Read n lines, each line as a string. So grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)].\n3. Check the main diagonal:\n   a. Collect all grid[i][i].\n   b. If any of them is different, return NO.\n   c. Else, c is grid[0][0].\n4. Check the other diagonal:\n   a. For each i, j = n-1 -i.\n   b. Check if grid[i][j] is c. If any is different, return NO.\n5. Now, check all non-diagonal cells:\n   a. Collect all such cells.\n   b. If all are same, and that character is not c, then YES. Else, NO.\n\nBut wait, what if n=1? Well, n is at least 3 according to the input constraints. So n starts from 3 upwards.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to handle this?\n\nFirst, reading the grid:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nWait, but sometimes the input might have leading or trailing spaces? No, the problem says each line is n letters, so each line is exactly n characters. So using strip() is okay.\n\nNext, checking the main diagonal:\n\nmain_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    main_diag.append(grid[i][i])\nif len(set(main_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nc = main_diag[0]\n\nThen, check the other diagonal:\n\nanti_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    j = n - 1 - i\n    anti_diag.append(grid[i][j])\nif any(ch != c for ch in anti_diag):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nNow, collect all the non-diagonal cells:\n\nother_cells = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i != j and (i + j) != (n-1):\n            other_cells.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen, check if all other_cells are the same:\n\nif not other_cells:\n    # This can't happen since n >=3, and diagonals have length 2n-1, but for n=3, 5 cells total, 5-3=2. So other_cells has at least 2 elements.\n    pass\n\nd = other_cells[0]\nif any(ch != d for ch in other_cells):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nAlso, check if d != c. Because the other cells must be different.\n\nif d == c:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nElse, print \"YES\".\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the other cells are empty? Like n=1, but n is at least 3. So no, other_cells will always have elements.\n\nWait, for n=3: the grid is 3x3. Diagonals have 3 elements each (since for 3x3, main diagonal is 3, other diagonal is 3, but the center is counted twice). Wait, no: for n=3, main diagonal is (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). The other diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So the center cell is part of both diagonals.\n\nThus, for n=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is 4 (since 9 - 3 -3 +1 = 4). So for n=3, other_cells has 4 elements.\n\nIn general, for any n, the number of non-diagonal cells is n^2 - 2n +1 = (n-1)^2.\n\nWhich is positive, so other_cells is never empty.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the grid.\n\nCheck main diagonal.\n\nCheck anti-diagonal.\n\nCheck other_cells.\n\nIf all conditions met, output YES, else NO.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nMain diagonal: positions (0,0)=x, (1,1)=o, (2,2)=x, (3,3)=o, (4,4)=x. So main_diag is x, o, x, o, x. So not all same. So condition fails, output NO.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nMain diagonal: w, s, w. All same? Wait, w, s, w. Oh, no, because they are not all same. So the main diagonal is w, s, w. So set is {'w', 's'}, which is size 2. So condition fails, but wait no, sample output for this case is YES. Wait, wait maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the second sample input is:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: 'wsw' → ['w','s','w']\nRow 1: 'sws' → ['s','w','s']\nRow 2: 'wsw' → ['w','s','w']\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,2)=w. So all same.\n\nAnti-diagonal: (0,2)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,0)=w. So all same.\n\nOther cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nLooking at those:\n\n(0,1) = 's'\n(1,0) = 's'\n(1,2) = 's'\n(2,1) = 's'\n\nSo all are 's' and different from 'w'.\n\nSo conditions are satisfied. So output is YES.\n\nWait, but in my initial code, for the main diagonal, I collected the main_diag as grid[i][i], which for this case is 'w', 'w', 'w' → all same. So code proceeds.\n\nAnother test case: third sample input.\n\n3\nxpx\npxp\nxpe\n\nMain diagonal: x, p, x. So not all same. So code returns NO.\n\nSo the sample outputs are correct.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where n=3, but the diagonals have same, but other cells are mixed.\n\nFor example:\n\nx x x\nx x x\nx x x\n\nMain and anti-diagonal are x. Other cells are x as well. So all are same as diagonal, so it's invalid. So output is NO.\n\nAnother case:\n\nx x x\na a a\nx x x\n\nHere, main diagonal is x, x, x. Anti-diagonal is x, a, x → so not all same. So output is NO.\n\nAnother case:\n\nx x x\nx x x\nx x x\n\nThis is invalid because the other cells are same as the diagonals.\n\nAnother case:\n\nx o x\no x o\nx o x\n\nWait, main diagonal is x, x, x. Anti-diagonal is x, x, x. Other cells are o, o, etc. So all other cells are o, which is different from x. So it's valid.\n\nSo code should output YES.\n\nAnother case: diagonals are same, but other cells have two different characters.\n\nLike:\n\nx o x\no x o\nx o x\n\nOther cells are o, but in some rows, perhaps some are o and others are different. Wait, no, in this case, other cells are all o. So it's valid.\n\nWait, another scenario: the diagonals are same, but other cells have varying letters, not all same.\n\nE.g.,\n\nx o o\no x o\no o x\n\nMain diagonal: x, x, x. Anti-diagonal: x, x, x.\n\nOther cells: o, o, o, o, o → same. So valid.\n\nAnother case: diagonals are same, but some other cells are different.\n\nE.g.:\n\nx a x\na x a\nx a x\n\nOther cells are a, a, a, a, a → same. So valid.\n\nBut if one of them is different:\n\nx a x\na x a\nx a x\n\nWait, same as before. No, all other cells are a.\n\nAnother example: \n\nx a x\nb x b\nx a x\n\nDiagonals are x, x, x. Anti-diagonal is x, x, x.\n\nOther cells: a, b, a, a, a. So a and b. So other_cells are not all same. So code will output NO.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, think about the code structure.\n\nIn Python, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the grid.\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\nmain_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\nif len(set(main_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nc = main_diag[0]\n\nCheck anti-diagonal:\n\nanti_diag = [grid[i][n-1 -i] for i in range(n)]\nfor ch in anti_diag:\n    if ch != c:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\nNow, check other cells:\n\nother_cells = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i != j and i + j != n - 1:\n            other_cells.append(grid[i][j])\n\nd = other_cells[0]\nif any(x != d for x in other_cells):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif d == c:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but wait. What if other_cells is empty? As discussed earlier, it's impossible for n >=3, so no problem.\n\nAnother thing to note: when n=1, but the problem states n is odd and >=3, so n can be 3,5, etc.\n\nAnother point: in the code, after checking the anti-diagonal, if any character is different from c, we print NO and exit. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nThen, collect all non-diagonal cells.\n\nIf they are all same as each other, and different from c, then output YES.\n\nElse, NO.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, let me think about possible errors.\n\nWhat if the grid is read incorrectly? Like, if the input lines have varying lengths? But the problem statement says each line has n letters, so each line is exactly n characters. So using input().strip() is okay.\n\nAnother point: for the anti-diagonal, the loop runs from i=0 to n-1, and j is n-1 -i. So for i=0, j is n-1. For i=1, j is n-2, and so on.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nWhat about the case where the main diagonal and anti-diagonal have the same character, but some other cells are same as c?\n\nE.g.,\n\nx x x\nx x x\nx x x\n\nIn this case, other_cells are all x, same as c. So condition fails, output is NO.\n\nYes, because the other cells must be different.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3\n\nx x o\nx x x\no x x\n\nMain diagonal: x, x, x.\n\nAnti-diagonal: o, x, o. So not all same as x → code returns NO.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter \"X\". The grid must satisfy specific conditions for this: both main diagonals must be the same character, and all other cells must be the same character which is different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Check Main Diagonal**: Verify that all elements on the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) are the same character.\n3. **Check Anti-Diagonal**: Verify that all elements on the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are the same character and match the main diagonal character.\n4. **Check Other Cells**: Ensure that all cells not on either diagonal are the same character and different from the diagonal character.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Check main diagonal\nmain_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\nif len(set(main_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nc = main_diag[0]\n\n# Check anti-diagonal\nanti_diag = [grid[i][n-1 - i] for i in range(n)]\nfor ch in anti_diag:\n    if ch != c:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\n# Check other cells\nother_cells = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i != j and (i + j) != (n - 1):\n            other_cells.append(grid[i][j])\n\nd = other_cells[0]\nif any(x != d for x in other_cells):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif d == c:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The grid dimensions and contents are read from standard input.\n2. **Main Diagonal Check**: We iterate through the main diagonal and check if all elements are the same.
