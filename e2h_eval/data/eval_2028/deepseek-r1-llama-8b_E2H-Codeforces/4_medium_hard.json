The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is a variation of Rock-Paper-Scissors between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They play n rounds, and in each round, the winner gives the loser a pinch, which leaves a red spot. We need to calculate how many red spots each has after all the rounds.\n\nHmm. So the key here is that both players have their own sequences for choosing their moves. For each round i (from 0 to n-1), Nikephoros uses A[i % m] and Polycarpus uses B[i % k]. Then, based on the outcome, one gets a point.\n\nWait, wait. The question is, for each round, who wins? That depends on the two choices. So for each round, we determine whether the first player (Nikephoros) wins, loses, or it's a draw.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, for each round, we can index into A and B using the current round number modulo m and k respectively. Because they cycle through their sequences.\n\nFor example, in the sample input, A is \"RPS\", which is length 3, so m=3. B is \"RSPP\", k=4.\n\nRound 0: A[0] is R, B[0] is R → draw.\nRound 1: A[1] is P, B[1] is S → P beats S, so Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a pinch.\nRound 2: A[2] is S, B[2] is P → S beats P, so Polycarpus loses, Nikephoros wins.\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each round from 0 to n-1:\n   a. Get the move for Nikephoros (A[(i) % m])\n   b. Get the move for Polycarpus (B[(i) % k])\n   c. Determine who wins this round.\n   d. Increment the respective counter.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2*10^9. Oh right, because the problem says n is up to 2e5? Wait, no: looking back, the input line says n can be up to 2·109, which is 2e9. Oh, that's a huge number. So any approach that iterates n times is going to be way too slow. So we need a smarter way than O(n) time.\n\nOh right, because if m and k are up to 1000, then the total possible combinations of (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B is 1000 * 1000 = 1e6. But n can be 2e9, which is way larger than that. So we need to find a way to compute how many times each pair (a, b) occurs over all rounds, multiply by the outcome, and sum them up.\n\nAh, right! So for each possible pair (a, b), we can compute how many times that pair occurs in the n rounds. Then, for each pair, determine whether a beats b, b beats a, or it's a draw. Then, accumulate the results.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So let's proceed with that.\n\nFirst, precompute all possible (a, b) pairs. For each a in A, each b in B, we can find out how many times this pair occurs across all rounds.\n\nBut wait, how?\n\nEach round, the ith round, the indices are i mod m and i mod k for A and B respectively.\n\nSo for each i, the a is A[i mod m], and b is B[i mod k].\n\nWe need to count, for each possible (a_char, b_char), the number of rounds where this pair occurs.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet’s think of it as follows:\n\nThe sequence of a's is periodic with period m. Similarly for b's with period k. So the combined sequence of pairs is periodic with a period equal to LCM(m, k). Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both A and B cycles complete an integer number of times.\n\nSo for example, if m=3, k=4, LCM(3,4)=12. So every 12 rounds, the pairs repeat.\n\nSo the number of full cycles is q = n // (LCM(m, k)), and the remaining rounds are r = n % (LCM(m, k)).\n\nFor each full cycle, each possible pair (a, b) occurs exactly (m * k) / (LCM(m, k)) ) times. Wait, no: wait, LCM(m, k) is m*k / GCD(m, k). So the number of times each pair occurs per full cycle is (number of times each (a, b) occurs in one cycle).\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nIn one cycle of LCM(m, k) rounds, each a in A is used exactly k times, and each b in B is used exactly m times. Because LCM(m, k) is the least common multiple, so m divides LCM(m,k) and k divides LCM(m,k).\n\nWait, for example, m=3, k=4. LCM is 12. So in 12 rounds, each a (3 possibilities) appears exactly 4 times (since 12/3=4). Similarly, each b (4 possibilities) appears exactly 3 times.\n\nWait, no, wait. Each a is selected in every m-th step. So for each a, the number of times it appears is the number of times the round index mod m equals a's position in A. So for each a in A, the number of times it's chosen is floor((n + s)/m) for some s? Or maybe it's better to think in terms of the full cycles plus the remainder.\n\nAlternatively, for each a in A, the number of times it's selected in n rounds is equal to the number of times i mod m == pos_a, where pos_a is the position in A.\n\nWhich can be calculated as:\n\ncount_a = (n + (m - pos_a)) // m\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure. Let me think.\n\nSuppose m=3, and a is at position 0. Then, in every group of 3 rounds, a is selected once. So for n=7, the count is 7//3 + 1 (since 7%3 is 1, which is >=1). Wait, 7//3 is 2, and 2+1=3 times. Let's see: rounds 0, 3, 6: yes, 3 times.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the formula is count_a = (n + (m - pos_a)) // m.\n\nSimilarly for each b in B, count_b = (n + (k - pos_b)) // k.\n\nBut wait, that would give the total number of times a particular a is played, and same for b.\n\nBut the problem is that for each round, a and b are determined, so the pair (a, b) can be considered as a tuple. So the challenge is to count how many times each (a, b) pair occurs across all n rounds.\n\nBut since the selection is based on round i, for each i, a is A[i mod m], b is B[i mod k]. So each round contributes one pair (a, b).\n\nNow, the key is to find for each possible (a, b) how many times it occurs in n rounds.\n\nThis can be done by considering the periods.\n\nLet me denote M = m, K = k.\n\nThe round numbers can be divided into cycles of LCM(M, K). So each cycle has length L = LCM(M, K).\n\nIn each cycle, each (a, b) pair will occur exactly (M*K)/(L) ) times? Or is that not the case?\n\nWait, no. Because for each round i in 0..L-1, the a is A[i mod M], and b is B[i mod K]. So each possible pair (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B can occur multiple times in a cycle.\n\nWait, but the number of times (a, b) occurs in a full cycle is equal to the number of times i mod M = a's position AND i mod K = b's position.\n\nHmm, that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for each (a, b), the positions where a is chosen and b is chosen are the solutions to i ≡ x mod M and i ≡ y mod K, where x is the position of a in A, and y is the position of b in B.\n\nThis is a system of congruences, and the number of solutions in [0, L) is either 0 or 1, depending on whether x ≡ y mod D, where D is GCD(M, K).\n\nWait, the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) tells us that for two congruences to have a solution, the remainders must agree modulo the GCD of the moduli.\n\nSo for i to satisfy i ≡ x mod M and i ≡ y mod K, there must exist a solution only if x ≡ y mod G, where G is GCD(M, K). If such a solution exists, then there's exactly one solution in each LCM(M, K) interval.\n\nSo for each (a, b) pair, the number of times it occurs in one full cycle (of LCM(M, K) rounds) is either 0 or 1.\n\nWait, that's a crucial insight. So for each (a, b), check whether x ≡ y mod G, where x is the position of a in A, y is the position of b in B. If yes, then in each full cycle, this pair occurs exactly once. Otherwise, zero times.\n\nSo, for the entire n rounds, the number of times (a, b) occurs is:\n\nnumber_of_cycles = n // L\nremainder_rounds = n % L\n\ncount = number_of_cycles * (1 if CRT(x, y) else 0) + (1 if CRT(x, y) and i < remainder_rounds else 0)\n\nWhere L is LCM(M, K).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute for each (a, b) whether x ≡ y mod G, where G is GCD(M, K). If yes, then this pair occurs once per L rounds.\n\n2. Compute the number of full cycles, and the remainder.\n\n3. For each pair where CRT holds, add the number_of_cycles to their count, and then check if the remainder includes a solution, adding 1 if so.\n\nOnce we have the count for each (a, b), we can process each pair to determine the outcome and accumulate the red spots accordingly.\n\nBut given that m and k can be up to 1000, the total possible (a, b) pairs is 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute for each a in A and b in B, the count of how many times their pair occurs in the n rounds.\n\n- For each such count, determine if a beats b. If so, add the count to Nikephoros' losses (so Polycarpus gets a spot). If b beats a, add the count to Polycarpus' losses (Nikephoros gets a spot). If it's a draw, do nothing.\n\nSo now, the main steps are:\n\nCompute for each (a_char, b_char):\n\nCheck if the pair (x, y) satisfies x ≡ y mod G, where x is the position of a in A, y is position of b in B, G is GCD(m, k).\n\nIf not, then the count is 0.\n\nIf yes, then compute how many times it occurs.\n\nSo, for each (a_char, b_char):\n\nCompute x = position of a in A (i.e., the index in the string)\nCompute y = position of b in B.\n\nCompute g = GCD(m, k).\n\nIf (x - y) % g != 0, then this pair never occurs. So count is 0.\n\nElse, compute the number of cycles and remainder.\n\nLet L = LCM(m, k) = (m * k) // g.\n\nfull_cycles = n // L\nremainder = n % L\n\nThen, the count is:\n\ncount = full_cycles * 1\n\nNow, for the remainder part: in the first 'remainder' rounds of the cycle, does the pair (x, y) occur?\n\nBecause, within each cycle, the pair (x, y) occurs exactly once. So in the first 'remainder' rounds, if the solution i is less than 'remainder', then it occurs once, else not.\n\nSo, we need to find whether the solution i exists in 0 <= i < remainder.\n\nBut how do we find if the solution i exists in the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\nAlternatively, since the solution i is unique mod L, the earliest occurrence is at i = t, where t is the smallest non-negative solution to the congruence.\n\nSo, for the remainder, if t < remainder, then the pair occurs once more.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nFor each (a_char, b_char):\n\nif (x - y) mod g != 0:\n    count = 0\nelse:\n    compute the minimal solution i0 to the congruence:\n        i ≡ x mod m\n        i ≡ y mod k\n    then, the number of occurrences is:\n        count = full_cycles * 1\n        if i0 < remainder:\n            count += 1\n\nBut how to compute i0?\n\nUsing the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nWait, the problem of solving i ≡ x mod m and i ≡ y mod k can be solved as follows.\n\nWe can represent the system as:\n\ni = x + a*m\ni = y + b*k\n\nSetting equal:\n\nx + a*m = y + b*k\n\n=> a*m - b*k = y - x\n\nWe can write this as a linear Diophantine equation: a*m - b*k = C, where C = y - x.\n\nWe can find integers a and b such that this holds.\n\nThe equation can be rewritten as:\n\na*m + (-b)*k = C.\n\nTo solve this, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm on m and k.\n\nThe equation has a solution if and only if GCD(m, k) divides C. Which is the condition we already checked earlier.\n\nSo, assuming that (x - y) is divisible by g, we can proceed.\n\nLet me denote:\n\ng = GCD(m, k)\nm' = m / g\nk' = k / g\nC' = (y - x) / g\n\nWe can then solve the equation a*m' - b*k' = C'\n\nSince m' and k' are coprime, the solution can be found.\n\nThe general solution is:\n\na = a0 + t*k'\nb = b0 + t*m'\n\nfor some initial a0, b0.\n\nBut to find the minimal positive solution i, we can compute:\n\ni0 = x + a0 * m\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute i0 as the minimal solution.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\ni0 = (x * k' * inv_k'_mod_m') + (y * m' * inv_m'_mod_k') ) mod L\n\nWait, perhaps that's getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, we can find the minimal solution using the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of code, we can use a helper function to compute the minimal solution i0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the congruence and compute i0.\n\nAnother approach is to note that the minimal solution i0 can be found as:\n\ni0 = (x * k * inv_k_mod_m + y * m * inv_m_mod_k) mod L\n\nwhere inv_k_mod_m is the modular inverse of k' modulo m', and inv_m_mod_k is the modular inverse of m' modulo k'.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident about this.\n\nWait, perhaps another way is to realize that the minimal solution can be found by:\n\ni0 = x + ( ( (y - x) // g ) * (m // g ) ) * ... hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the minimal solution.\n\nI think the correct way is to find i0 as the minimal positive solution to the congruence equations.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of this problem, it's better to precompute for each (x, y) whether the CRT is solvable, and if so, compute how many times the pair occurs in the n rounds.\n\nBut implementing this requires handling the CRT correctly.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each (x, y) in all possible positions of A and B:\n\nif (x - y) mod g != 0:\n    continue\nelse:\n    compute the minimal i0 that satisfies i0 ≡ x mod m and i0 ≡ y mod k.\n\n    then, the number of times this pair occurs in n rounds is:\n\n        full_cycles = n // L\n        remainder = n % L\n\n        count = full_cycles * 1\n\n        if i0 < remainder:\n            count += 1\n\nSo, the problem reduces to implementing the CRT correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each (x, y) that satisfies (x - y) mod g == 0, we can compute the number of times the pair occurs in the n rounds.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read n, A, B.\n\n- Precompute for each a in A, x is its index (0-based).\n\n- Precompute for each b in B, y is its index.\n\n- Compute g = GCD(m, k), where m is len(A), k is len(B).\n\n- Compute L = LCM(m, k) = (m * k) // g.\n\n- Compute full_cycles = n // L\n- Compute rem = n % L\n\n- For each a in A, for each b in B:\n\n    x = position of a in A\n    y = position of b in B\n\n    if (x - y) mod g != 0:\n        continue\n    else:\n        compute the minimal i0 that solves the congruence.\n\n        if i0 >= L:  # which can't happen, because i0 is in [0, L)\n            pass\n        else:\n            count = full_cycles\n            if i0 < rem:\n                count += 1\n\n            then, for this pair (a, b), the count is added to the appropriate result.\n\nBut the problem is, how to compute i0.\n\nSo, implementing CRT for two congruences.\n\nI remember that the minimal solution can be found by solving the congruence equations.\n\nThe extended Euclidean algorithm can be used to find the solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula:\n\ni0 = ( (x * k_inv_mod_m ) + (y * m_inv_mod_k) ) mod L\n\nBut wait, let's see:\n\nWe can rewrite the congruence as:\n\ni ≡ x mod m\n\ni ≡ y mod k\n\nWe can express this as:\n\ni = x + a*m\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\nx + a*m ≡ y mod k\n\n=> a*m ≡ (y - x) mod k\n\nSince m and k have a GCD of g, and we have (y -x) divisible by g, let's define:\n\nd = m / g\ne = k / g\nc = (y -x) / g\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\na*d*e ≡ c mod e\n\nBecause m = d*g, k = e*g.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me re-express the equation.\n\nWe have:\n\na * (m) ≡ (y - x) mod k\n\nBut m = d * g, and k = e * g.\n\nSo:\n\na * (d * g) ≡ c * g mod (e * g)\n\nDivide both sides by g:\n\na * d ≡ c mod e\n\nSince d and e are coprime (as g was the GCD), d has an inverse modulo e.\n\nSo, a ≡ (c * inv_d_mod_e) mod e.\n\nThus, the minimal a is a0 = (c * inv_d_mod_e) mod e.\n\nThen, the minimal i0 is x + a0 * m.\n\nWait, let's test this with an example.\n\nExample:\n\nm = 3, k =4.\n\ng = GCD(3,4)=1.\n\nSuppose x=0, y=2.\n\n(y -x) = 2, which is divisible by g=1.\n\nSo, d=3, e=4.\n\nc = (2)/1=2.\n\nWe need to solve a*d ≡ c mod e.\n\nd=3, e=4.\n\nWe have 3a ≡ 2 mod4.\n\nMultiplicative inverse of 3 mod4 is 3, since 3*3=9≡1 mod4.\n\nSo a0 = 2 *3 mod4 =6 mod4=2.\n\nThus, a=2.\n\ni0 = x + a*m =0 +2*3=6.\n\nWhich is indeed a solution, because 6 mod3=0 and 6 mod4=2.\n\nSo in the cycle of 12 rounds (since LCM(3,4)=12), the pair (A[0], B[2]) occurs once, at i=6.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nAnother example: x=1, y=1.\n\ng=1.\n\nd=3, e=4.\n\nc=0.\n\nSo 3a ≡0 mod4 → a=0.\n\ni0 =1 + 0*3=1.\n\nWhich is correct: i=1 mod3 and mod4.\n\nSo, the formula seems correct.\n\nSo, the steps to compute i0:\n\nGiven x, y, m, k, g:\n\nCompute d = m // g.\n\ne = k // g.\n\nc = (y -x) // g.\n\nWe need to solve a*d ≡ c mod e.\n\nSince d and e are coprime, the inverse of d mod e exists.\n\nCompute inv_d = modular inverse of d mod e.\n\na0 = (c * inv_d) % e.\n\nThen, i0 = x + a0 * m.\n\nBut wait, x is in 0..m-1, and a0 is in 0..e-1.\n\nSo, i0 can be up to x + (e-1)*m.\n\nBut since L = LCM(m, k) = m * k // g = m*e * g // g = m*e.\n\nSo i0 is in 0..m*e-1, which is the L.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nImplement a function to compute the modular inverse, using the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nFunction modinv(a, mod):\n\nfind x such that a*x ≡1 mod mod.\n\nIf a and mod are coprimes, returns x.\n\nElse, no inverse exists.\n\nBut in our case, d and e are coprimes, so it's safe.\n\nSo, in code, implement this function.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nm = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute g = GCD(m, k).\n\nCompute L = (m *k) // g.\n\nCompute full_cycles = n // L.\n\nrem = n % L.\n\nCreate two counters: nike and poly.\n\nFor each a_char in A:\n\n   x = index in A.\n\nFor each b_char in B:\n\n   y = index in B.\n\n   if (x - y) % g !=0:\n\n       continue.\n\n   else:\n\n       compute d = m//g.\n\n       e = k//g.\n\n       c = (y - x) // g.\n\n       try to compute inv_d = modinv(d, e).\n\n       if inv_d is None:\n\n           # impossible, but since (x - y) is divisible by g, this shouldn't happen.\n\n       a0 = (c * inv_d) % e.\n\n       i0 = x + a0 * m.\n\n       # Now, i0 is the minimal solution.\n\n       # but i0 could be larger than L, which is m*e.\n\n       # Wait, because m = d*g, e = k/g, L = (d*g) * (e) = d*e*g = m * k / g.\n\n       # Since a0 is in 0..e-1, i0 = x + a0 * m.\n\n       # x can be up to m-1, a0 up to e-1.\n\n       # So i0 can be up to (m-1) + (e-1)*m = (e) * m -1.\n\n       # But L is m*e.\n\n       # So i0 can be up to m*e -1, which is within the cycle.\n\n       # So, no need to mod L.\n\n       # So, i0 is in 0..L-1.\n\n       count = full_cycles\n\n       if i0 < rem:\n\n           count +=1\n\n       # Now, determine outcome.\n\n       if a beats b:\n\n           poly += count\n\n       elif b beats a:\n\n           nike += count\n\n       else:\n\n           pass.\n\nSo, the next step is to implement the modinv function.\n\nImplementing the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the inverse.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nFirst, the modinv function:\n\ndef modinv(a, mod):\n    # find x such that a*x ≡ 1 mod mod.\n    # returns x if exists, else None.\n\n    # Using extended Euclidean algorithm.\n    g, x, y = extended_gcd(a, mod)\n    if g !=1:\n        return None\n    else:\n        return x % mod\n\ndef extended_gcd(a, b):\n    if a ==0:\n        return (b, 0, 1)\n    else:\n        g, y, x = extended_gcd(b %a, a)\n        return (g, x - (b//a)*y, y)\n\nWait, but in Python, recursion may hit stack limits for large numbers, but in this case, m and k are up to 1e3, so it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, an iterative version:\n\ndef extended_gcd(a, b):\n    old_r, r = a, b\n    old_s, s = 1, 0\n    old_t, t = 0, 1\n    while r !=0:\n        quotient = old_r // r\n        old_r, r = r, old_r - quotient * r\n        old_s, s = s, old_s - quotient * s\n        old_t, t = t, old_t - quotient * t\n    return old_r, old_s, old_t\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nImplement the extended_gcd function as above, then modinv.\n\nNow, let's proceed.\n\nSo, for each a and b:\n\nCompute x and y.\n\nIf (x - y) mod g !=0: skip.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute d = m//g.\n\ne = k//g.\n\nc = (y -x) //g.\n\nCompute inv_d = modinv(d, e). If inv_d is None, which shouldn't happen.\n\na0 = (c * inv_d) % e.\n\ni0 = x + a0 * m.\n\nThen, count = full_cycles.\n\nif i0 < rem: count +=1.\n\nThen, determine if a beats b.\n\nSo, the beats function:\n\nWe can create a helper function that, given a and b, returns 1 if a beats b, -1 if b beats a, 0 otherwise.\n\nLike:\n\ndef get_outcome(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return 0\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return 1  # a beats b, so poly gets a point.\n    else:\n        return -1  # b beats a, so nike gets a point.\n\nSo, for each (a, b) pair:\n\ncount = ... \n\nif outcome is 1: poly += count.\n\nif outcome is -1: nike += count.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nBut wait, considering that for each (a, b) pair, we're looping through all a in A and all b in B.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps it's better to loop through all possible a and b in the strings A and B.\n\nBut since m and k are up to 1e3, 1e6 iterations are manageable.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\ng = math.gcd(m, k)\nL = (m * k) // g\n\nfull_cycles = n // L\nrem = n % L\n\nnike = 0\npoly = 0\n\ndef get_outcome(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return 0\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return -1\n\nfor idx_a, a_char in enumerate(A):\n    for idx_b, b_char in enumerate(B):\n        x = idx_a\n        y = idx_b\n\n        if (x - y) % g != 0:\n            continue\n\n        # Compute i0\n        d = m // g\n        e = k // g\n        c = (y - x) // g\n\n        # Compute inverse of d mod e\n        def modinv(a, mod):\n            g, x, y = extended_gcd(a, mod)\n            if g != 1:\n                return None\n            else:\n                return x % mod\n\n        inv_d = modinv(d, e)\n        if inv_d is None:\n            # This should not happen because (x - y) is divisible by g\n            continue\n\n        a0 = (c * inv_d) % e\n        i0 = x + a0 * m\n\n        # Now, count is full_cycles + (1 if i0 < rem else 0)\n        count = full_cycles\n        if i0 < rem:\n            count +=1\n\n        # Determine outcome\n        outcome = get_outcome(a_char, b_char)\n        if outcome == 1:\n            poly += count\n        elif outcome == -1:\n            nike += count\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n\nWait, but wait: in the code above, the modinv is inside the loop, which is not efficient. It's better to compute it once outside.\n\nSo, perhaps precompute inv_d for all possible cases, but since d and e are fixed for each (x, y), perhaps it's better to compute it inside.\n\nWait, no.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, after they play `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each player follows a specific sequence of moves, and the winner of each round gives the loser a pinch, resulting in a red spot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - Each round, both players choose their moves cyclically from their respective sequences.\n   - The winner is determined based on the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, and Paper beats Rock. If both players choose the same move, it's a draw.\n   - We need to efficiently determine the number of times each possible pair of moves occurs across all `n` rounds and compute the outcomes.\n\n2. **Efficient Calculation**:\n   - Given the constraints, iterating through each round directly is infeasible due to the potential size of `n` (up to 2 billion). Instead, we use properties of modular arithmetic and the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to count occurrences of each move pair efficiently.\n   - The sequences are periodic, so we can compute how often each pair of moves occurs within one full cycle and then extend this to `n` rounds.\n\n3. **Modular Arithmetic and CRT**:\n   - Compute the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the period after which the move pairs repeat.\n   - For each possible pair of moves, determine if they can occur together using CRT and count their occurrences in `n` rounds.\n\n4. **Determine Outcomes**:\n   - For each valid move pair, determine if it results in a win for Nikephoros, a win for Polycarpus, or a draw, and accumulate the results accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef extended_gcd(a, b):\n    old_r, r = a, b\n    old_s, s = 1, 0\n    old_t, t = 0, 1\n    while r != 0:\n        quotient = old_r // r\n        old_r, r = r, old_r - quotient * r\n        old_s, s = s, old_s - quotient * s\n        old_t, t = t, old_t - quotient * t\n    return old_r, old_s, old_t\n\ndef modinv(a, mod):\n    g, x, y = extended_gcd(a, mod)\n    if g != 1:\n        return None\n    else:\n        return x % mod\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\ng = math.gcd(m, k)\nL = (m * k) // g\n\nfull_cycles = n // L\nrem = n % L\n\nnike = 0\npoly = 0\n\ndef get_outcome(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return 0\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return -1\n\nd = m // g\ne = k // g\n\nfor idx_a, a_char in enumerate(A):\n    for idx_b, b_char in enumerate(B):\n        x = idx_a\n        y = idx_b\n\n        if (x - y) % g != 0:\n            continue\n\n        c = (y - x) // g\n\n        inv_d = modinv(d, e)\n        if inv_d is None:\n            continue\n\n        a0 = (c * inv_d) % e\n        i0 = x + a0 * m\n\n        count = full_cycles\n        if i0 < rem:\n            count += 1\n\n        outcome = get_outcome(a_char, b_char)\n        if outcome == 1:\n            poly += count\n        elif outcome == -1:\n            nike += count\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the sequences of moves for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n2. **Precompute Periods**: Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the period after which the move pairs repeat.\n3. **Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: Used to compute the modular inverse, which is essential for solving congruences using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n4. **Count Occurrences**: For each possible pair of moves, determine if they can occur together and count their occurrences in `n` rounds.\n5. **Determine Winners**: For each valid move pair, determine the winner and accumulate the results to count the number of red spots.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large possible value of `n` by leveraging periodic patterns and modular arithmetic, ensuring the solution is both optimal and scalable.",
