The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem is about radio towers in towns arranged along a coordinate line. The towns are numbered from 0 to n+1. We build a tower in each of the towns 1 to n with a probability of 1/2, independently. Then, for each tower built, we assign a signal power p (an integer between 1 and n). The signal from tower i covers all cities c where |c - i| < p. \n\nOur goal is to find the probability that after building the towers, we can assign the powers such that:\n- Towns 0 and n+1 get no signal.\n- Each town from 1 to n gets exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. So we need to calculate the probability that the set of built towers allows for such an assignment of powers.\n\nLet me think about the conditions required for this to be possible.\n\nEach town from 1 to n must be covered by exactly one tower. Moreover, the coverage areas must not extend beyond town 0 or n+1. So, the first and last towers must have their signals just enough to not reach town 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, for town 1: it can't be covered by any tower beyond it, because that would include town 0. So the tower covering town 1 must have a power such that |1 - i| >= p_i. Similarly, the last tower must have p_i <= ... wait, maybe the farthest it can cover is town n, so its power must be exactly 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the arrangement of towers forms some sort of structure where each tower's coverage is contained within a specific range without overlapping more than once.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be reduced to finding valid configurations of built towers. For each configuration of built towers, we need to check if there's a way to assign the powers such that all the constraints are met.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 2e5, checking each configuration is impossible. So we need a mathematical approach.\n\nLet me think about what configurations allow such an assignment.\n\nSuppose the built towers form a certain kind of structure. For example, maybe they are placed in a way that each tower's coverage doesn't overlap with others except as needed.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. Maybe the problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a graph. Each town from 1 to n must be covered exactly once, and each built tower's coverage must not extend beyond 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, but each tower's coverage is a range. So the entire arrangement must form a partition of the towns 1..n into non-overlapping ranges, each centered at a built tower, and the ranges don't extend beyond 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, for each tower i with power p_i, the coverage is [i - (p_i -1), i + (p_i -1)]. But since town 0 can't be covered, we have i - (p_i -1) >= 0? No, wait, the condition is that town 0 is not covered. So for any tower i, the leftmost town it covers is i - (p_i - 1), which must be >= 0. Wait, no: the coverage is |c - i| < p_i, which means c can be from i - (p_i - 1) to i + (p_i - 1), inclusive. So to prevent town 0 from being covered, the leftmost point of any tower's coverage must be >= 1. Because town 0 is at position 0. Wait, no: if a tower i has p_i=1, its coverage is only town i. So for town 0 to not be covered, i must be >= 1, which it already is. So the only real constraint is that the rightmost coverage does not reach n+1. Wait, no: the rightmost coverage is i + (p_i -1) < n+1. Or wait, the coverage is |c - i| < p_i, which is equivalent to c is in (i - p_i, i + p_i). Since c must be an integer, the coverage is from max(0, i - p_i + 1) to min(n+1, i + p_i - 1).\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nFor a tower at position i with power p, the towns it covers are those c where |c - i| < p. So c must be in (i - p, i + p). Since c is an integer, the covered towns are from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1, inclusive. So the coverage interval is [i - p + 1, i + p - 1].\n\nSo for town 0 to not be covered by",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in towns 1 to n, we can assign signal powers such that each town from 1 to n is covered exactly once, while towns 0 and n+1 are not covered at all.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the problem can be reduced to finding valid configurations of built towers. Each configuration must form a non-overlapping partition of the towns 1 to n, where each segment is centered at a built tower. This forms a structure known as a \"domino tiling\" or \"Fibonacci-like\" sequence.\n\nThe solution involves counting the number of valid configurations and dividing by the total number of possible configurations, which is \\(2^n\\). The result is then taken modulo \\(998244353\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # Precompute Fibonacci numbers modulo MOD\n    fib = [0] * (n + 2)\n    fib[1] = 1\n    for i in range(2, n + 2):\n        fib[i] = (fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]) % MOD\n    \n    # The number of valid configurations is fib[n]\n    ans = fib[n]\n    \n    # Compute the modular inverse of 2^n\n    pow2 = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    inv_pow2 = pow(pow2, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    \n    # Probability is ans * inv_pow2 mod MOD\n    probability = (ans * inv_pow2) % MOD\n    print(probability)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We need to ensure that each town from 1 to n is covered exactly once, and towns 0 and n+1 are not covered. This translates to finding valid configurations of built towers that form non-overlapping segments covering all towns from 1 to n.\n\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The number of valid configurations follows a Fibonacci-like sequence where each term is the sum of two previous terms. This is because each valid configuration can either end at the first tower or the second tower, leading to a recursive relation similar to Fibonacci numbers.\n\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be modulo \\(998244353\\), we use modular exponentiation to compute powers and their modular inverses efficiently.\n\n4. **Efficient Computation**: Precompute Fibonacci numbers up to n using dynamic programming. Compute the modular inverse of \\(2^n\\) using Fermat's Little Theorem for efficient division under modulo.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count valid configurations and compute the required probability, handling large values of n up to \\(2 \\times 10^5\\).",
