After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about determining the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. Hmm.\n\nSo, each student has marks for m subjects. A student is considered the best at a subject if no one else has a higher mark for that subject. And a student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. My task is to find out how many such students there are.\n\nLet me think about the input. The first line gives n and m. Then there are n lines, each representing a student's grades. Each grade is a string of m characters, each being a digit from 1 to 9. So for example, a line like '223' would mean the student scored 2, 2, 3 in three subjects.\n\nThe output is a list (or maybe just a single number) of the count of successful students. Oh wait, looking at the example, the output is two numbers, 2 and 3. So each test case's output is a line with the counts separated by spaces? Or perhaps the example shows that the input is two test cases, but that's not clear. Wait, the sample input is written as ['3 3\\n...', '3 5...'], which suggests that the actual input is two test cases. But the problem statement says \"the given group\" which is singular. Hmm, maybe the sample is miswritten, or perhaps the input actually consists of multiple test cases. But the problem description says, \"your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\" So perhaps the input is a single group, but the sample shows two groups because the example is incorrect. Or perhaps the sample is a mistake. Well, perhaps the code should handle each group individually, but the problem statement is a bit unclear. Wait, the problem says, \"the following is a competitive programming problem. Marks Vasya...\" — perhaps the sample is just an illustration, and the actual input is a single group.\n\nWait, looking back: the sample input is given as a list with two strings, each representing a group. Oh, wait, no, the sample input is:\n\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\nWhich probably represents two test cases. Because each element is a separate group. So the program needs to process each group separately and output the results for each. So the output is a list of counts, one per group.\n\nBut wait, the problem says, \"print the single number\" — but the sample output shows two numbers. That makes me think that perhaps the input is a single group, and the sample is showing the output for each group as two separate lines. Or perhaps the problem statement is slightly off, and the output is for each group in the input.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects that each group is processed, and for each group, the number of successful students is printed. So the input may have multiple test cases, each consisting of n lines. So the code needs to read all test cases and output the result for each.\n\nWell, regardless, the approach remains the same: for each group of students, compute the number of successful students.\n\nNow, the main task is to process each student's marks, determine for each subject which student has the maximum mark, and then count how many students are the maximum in at least one subject.\n\nSo, the steps to solve this:\n\n1. Read each test case.\n2. For each test case:\n   a. Read n and m.\n   b. Read n strings, each of length m. These represent the marks for each subject across students.\n3. For each subject (each position in the string), find the maximum mark among all students.\n4. For each student, check if they have the maximum mark in any of the m subjects.\n5. Count how many such students exist.\n\nSo, let's think about data structures. For each subject (from 0 to m-1), we can track the maximum value. Then, for each student, check each subject: if the student's mark equals the maximum for that subject, and mark that the student is successful.\n\nAlternatively, for each subject, we can find the student(s) who have the highest mark. Each of those students gets a mark that they are the best in that subject.\n\nThen, for each student, if they are the best in any subject, count them as successful.\n\nBut how do we efficiently track which students are the best in each subject?\n\nOne approach is:\n\n- For each subject j:\n   - Iterate through all students, collect their j-th mark.\n   - Find the maximum mark in that subject.\n   - Record which students have that maximum mark.\n\nOnce this is done, for each student, if they are in any of the best-in-subject lists, count them.\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read n strings, each of length m. Let's store them as a list of strings, say 'students'.\n- For each subject j (0-based from 0 to m-1):\n   - Create a list of tuples (mark, index) for each student's j-th mark and their index.\n   - Sort this list in descending order of marks. If two students have the same mark, their order doesn't matter.\n   - Take the first student in this sorted list. All students who have the same mark as this student are the best in this subject.\n   - Record these indices for subject j.\n- Now, for each student, check if they are present in any of the subject's best lists. If yes, increment the count.\n\nWait, but storing for each subject the set of students who are best in that subject would help. So after processing all subjects, for each student, check if they are present in any of the sets.\n\nAlternatively, during the processing of each subject, we can note which students are the best in that subject. For each subject, we can create a set of student indices who are the best in that subject. Then, for each student, if they are in any of these sets, they are successful.\n\nSo, the steps in code would be:\n\nRead each test case:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, for each j in 0..m-1:\n\ncurrent_max = max(students[i][j] for i in range(n))\ncandidates = [i for i in range(n) if students[i][j] == current_max]\nbest_in_subject[j] = set(candidates)\n\nWait, but for each subject j, the best student(s) are those with the maximum mark in that subject. So for each j, we find the maximum mark, then collect all students who have that mark.\n\nOnce this is done, for each student, if they are in any of best_in_subject[j], then they are successful.\n\nSo, after collecting all best_in_subject[j], for each student s in 0..n-1:\n\nsuccessful = False\nfor j in 0..m-1:\n   if s is in best_in_subject[j]:\n       successful = True\n       break\nif successful:\n   count +=1\n\nSo, that's the plan.\n\nNow, considering edge cases:\n\nCase 1: All students have the same marks for all subjects. Then, all students are the best in every subject, so all are successful.\n\nCase 2: Only one student. Then, he is the best in all subjects, so he is successful.\n\nCase 3: Two students, same in all marks except one subject where one is better. So only the second is successful.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when multiple students have the same maximum in a subject. All of them are best in that subject.\n\nWait, the problem statement says, \"consider a student the best at some subject if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\"\n\nWait, so for a subject, if multiple students have the same highest mark, each of them is considered the best in that subject. So, for example, if two students have the maximum mark in a subject, both are the best in that subject, so both will count as successful for that subject.\n\nSo, for each subject, the best students are all those who have the maximum mark, regardless of whether others also have that mark.\n\nThus, in the code, for each subject j, collect all students who have the maximum mark for j.\n\nSo, the code needs to find for each j, the maximum value among the j-th characters of all students, then collect all students whose j-th character is equal to that maximum.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python, for each j:\n\nmax_mark = max( [students[i][j] for i in range(n)] )\n\nThen, best_students_j = [i for i in range(n) if students[i][j] == max_mark]\n\nThen, add these to a list of sets, say, best_in_subject[j] is a set containing the indices of the best students for that subject.\n\nOnce all subjects are processed, for each student s, check if s is in any of the best_in_subject[j] sets.\n\nIf yes, count +=1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nFirst, read all test cases. Wait, wait, the sample input shows two test cases, but the problem statement isn't clear. Looking back: the problem says, \"given group\", which is singular, so perhaps the sample is wrong. Or perhaps the input is a series of test cases, each on a separate line. Hmm.\n\nWait, the sample input is written as a list of two elements, each being a group. So perhaps the actual input is multiple groups, each consisting of n lines. So, the code needs to process each group as a separate test case.\n\nSo, the code should read until EOF, and for each group, process it.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the first line is two integers n and m. So, perhaps each group is represented by a block of lines starting with a line with n and m.\n\nSo, the code should read each group as follows:\n\nWhile there are lines:\n\nread a line, split into n and m.\n\nthen read the next n lines as the students.\n\nprocess this group, compute the count, and add to the output.\n\nSo, in code, something like:\n\nimport sys\n\ngroups = []\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    line = line.strip()\n    if not line:\n        continue\n    # process as group\n    n, m = map(int, line.split())\n    students = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        students.append(s)\n    groups.append(students)\n\nBut perhaps, for each group, the first line is n and m, followed by n lines.\n\nBut the way the input is given can vary. For instance, sometimes, after reading the first line, the next n lines are read, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire input is a single group, but the sample shows two groups. That's confusing.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is as follows:\n\nFirst line contains n and m.\n\nNext n lines describe the group.\n\nSo, perhaps the input is a single group, but the sample seems to show two. Maybe the sample is a typo, and the actual input is a single group.\n\nBut for now, perhaps the code should read n and m, then read n lines.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is intended to have multiple test cases, each consisting of a line with n and m, followed by n lines.\n\nSo, the code should read each group as a separate entity.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead each group:\n\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        line = sys.stdin.readline()\n        if not line:\n            break\n        n, m = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        students = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n        # process group\n        # compute count\n        # add to output list\n    except:\n        break\n\nSo, that's the idea.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nImplementing the steps:\n\nFor each group:\n\nn, m = ... \n\nstudents = [s1, s2, ..., sn]\n\nbest_in_subject = [set(), set(), ..., set()]  # size m\n\nfor j in 0 to m-1:\n    max_mark = max( students[i][j] for i in range(n) )\n    best_in_subject[j] = set( i for i in range(n) if students[i][j] == max_mark )\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor s in 0 to n-1:\n    is_successful = False\n    for j in 0 to m-1:\n        if s in best_in_subject[j]:\n            is_successful = True\n            break\n    if is_successful:\n        count +=1\n\nAdd count to output.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nFirst group:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nProcessing:\n\nstudents are ['223', '232', '112']\n\nsubjects 0,1,2.\n\nSubject 0:\n\nmarks are '2', '2', '1' → max is 2. Students 0 and 1.\n\nbest_in_subject[0] = {0,1}\n\nSubject 1:\n\nmarks are '2','3','1' → max is 3. Only student 1.\n\nbest_in_subject[1] = {1}\n\nSubject 2:\n\nmarks are '3','2','2' → max is 3. Only student 0.\n\nbest_in_subject[2] = {0}\n\nNow, for each student:\n\nStudent 0: present in subject 0 and 2 → successful.\n\nStudent 1: present in subject 0 and 1 → successful.\n\nStudent 2: not present in any → not successful.\n\nSo count is 2.\n\nSecond group:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nStudents are ['91728', '11828', '11111']\n\nsubjects 0-4.\n\nSubject 0:\n\nmarks '9','1','1' → max is 9. Only student 0.\n\nsubject 1: '1','1','1' → all have 1. So best students are all.\n\nsubject 2: '7','8','1' → max 8. Only student 1.\n\nsubject3: '2','8','1' → max 8. Only student1.\n\nsubject4: '8','8','1' → max 8. Only student1.\n\nSo best_in_subject:\n\n0: {0}\n\n1: {0,1,2}\n\n2: {1}\n\n3: {1}\n\n4: {1}\n\nNow, for each student:\n\nStudent 0: present in subject 0 → yes.\n\nStudent 1: present in subjects 1, 2,3,4 → yes.\n\nStudent 2: present in subject 1 → yes.\n\nSo all three are successful. Output is 3.\n\nSo the code correctly produces 2 and 3.\n\nNow, handling the input correctly is important.\n\nAnother test case: when a student is the best in more than one subject.\n\nAnother case: all students are same in all subjects → all are best in all.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python:\n\nWe'll need to read the groups correctly.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead all lines, process each group.\n\nBut in Python, it's easier to read all lines at once.\n\nAlternatively, read until EOF.\n\nSo, the code outline:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_successful():\n    output = []\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        line = line.strip()\n        if not line:\n            continue\n        n, m = map(int, line.split())\n        students = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n            students.append(s)\n        # Process each group\n        best_in_subject = [set() for _ in range(m)]\n        for j in range(m):\n            max_mark = max( students[i][j] for i in range(n) )\n            best_in_subject[j] = {i for i in range(n) if students[i][j] == max_mark}\n        count = 0\n        for s in range(n):\n            found = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if s in best_in_subject[j]:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n            if found:\n                count +=1\n        output.append(str(count))\n    print(' '.join(output))\n\ncount_successful()\n\nWait, but if the input is multiple groups, each followed by a blank line, the code skips the empty lines. But if the input has no trailing newlines, it's okay.\n\nTesting this code.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the groups are provided as two separate entries, each with their own n and m. So the code should process each group as a separate test case.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1.\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n5\n\nOutput: 1.\n\nBecause the single student is the best in the only subject.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStudents:\n\n99\n\n98\n\nFor subject 0: both have 9, so both are best.\n\nSubject1: 9 and 8. So only student 0 is best.\n\nSo, for each student:\n\nstudent 0: best in subject 0 and 1 → yes.\n\nstudent1: best in subject0.\n\nSo both are successful. Output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStudents:\n\n91\n\n82\n\nSubject0: 9 and 8 → student 0 is best.\n\nSubject1: 1 and 2 → student 1 is best.\n\nSo student0 is best in subject0 → yes.\n\nStudent1 is best in subject1 → yes.\n\nCount is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStudents:\n\n12\n\n23\n\nSubject0: 1 and 2 → student1 is best.\n\nSubject1: 2 and 3 → student1 is best.\n\nSo student1 is best in both. Student0 is not best in any.\n\nSo count is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling multi-digit marks correctly. But since each character is a single digit, it's fine.\n\n- Off-by-one errors in the loop for j.\n\n- Empty lines in the input. The code skips empty lines, which is correct.\n\n- When a student has the same mark as others in all subjects, they are counted as successful.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, writing the code accordingly.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best at least one subject, where \"best\" means no other student has a higher mark for that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing two integers `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). This is followed by `n` lines, each representing a student's marks for `m` subjects.\n2. **Track Best Students per Subject**: For each subject, identify the students who have the highest mark. These students are considered the best in that subject.\n3. **Count Successful Students**: A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. We check each student against the list of best students for each subject to determine if they are successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_successful():\n    output = []\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        line = line.strip()\n        if not line:\n            continue\n        n, m = map(int, line.split())\n        students = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n            students.append(s)\n        best_in_subject = [set() for _ in range(m)]\n        for j in range(m):\n            max_mark = max(students[i][j] for i in range(n))\n            best_in_subject[j] = {i for i in range(n) if students[i][j] == max_mark}\n        count = 0\n        for s in range(n):\n            found = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if s in best_in_subject[j]:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n            if found:\n                count += 1\n        output.append(str(count))\n    print(' '.join(output))\n\ncount_successful()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads each test case line by line. It processes each test case separately, extracting the number of students and subjects, followed by the marks for each student.\n2. **Tracking Best Students**: For each subject, the code determines the maximum mark and identifies all students who achieved this mark. These students are recorded as the best in that subject.\n3. **Counting Success**: For each student, the code checks if they are among the best students for any subject. If they are, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Output**: The results for each test case are collected and printed as a space-separated string.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each test case and accurately counts the number of successful students by leveraging sets to track the best performers in each subject.",
