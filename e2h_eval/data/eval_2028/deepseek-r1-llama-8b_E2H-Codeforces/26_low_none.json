Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles that satisfy certain conditions based on given integers A, B, C, D.\n\nHmm, the problem statement says that x, y, z are the sides of the triangle. They must satisfy A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, and C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, because it's a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. So, x + y > z.\n\nWait, but since z is the largest side (because x ≤ y ≤ z), the condition reduces to x + y > z. Because in a triangle, if the sum of the two smaller sides is greater than the largest, it's non-degenerate.\n\nSo our task is to find all possible triplets (x, y, z) where x is between A and B inclusive, y is between B and C inclusive, z is between C and D inclusive, and x ≤ y ≤ z. But also, x + y > z.\n\nBut wait, how do we efficiently compute this without iterating through all possible triplets, which would be way too slow for the constraints given (since D can be up to 5e5)?\n\nHmm, I need to find a mathematical approach here.\n\nLet me think about the variables. We have x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D]. And x ≤ y ≤ z. Also, x + y > z.\n\nSince x ≤ y and y ≤ z, z is at least y, so the condition x + y > z is crucial.\n\nI think it's better to fix z first and then find the possible x and y for each z.\n\nWait, but z ranges from C to D. For each z, we need to find the number of (x, y) pairs where x is in [A, B], y is in [max(B, x), min(C, z)], and x + y > z.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible z, we can calculate the number of valid (x, y) pairs.\n\nBut even this approach might be O(D - C + 1), which could be up to 5e5 steps. For each step, we need to compute something quickly.\n\nSo, let's break it down.\n\nFor a fixed z, what are the possible x and y?\n\nx can vary from A to B.\n\nFor each x, y can vary from max(B, x) to min(C, z). But wait, since y has to be ≥ x and ≥ B, and also ≤ C and ≤ z.\n\nSo for a given x, the lower bound of y is max(x, B), and upper bound is min(C, z).\n\nBut when x is less than B, then max(x, B) is B. When x is equal to or larger than B, then it's x.\n\nWait, no. Since B ≤ y and x ≤ y. So for x <= B, y starts at B, but for x >= B, y starts at x.\n\nWait, no: because x can be up to B, and y has to be >= x and >= B. So for x <= B, the minimum y is max(x, B) = B. For x >= B, the minimum y is x.\n\nBut x can't be more than B, right? Because x is in [A, B].\n\nWait, x is in [A, B], and y is in [B, C], but y must also be ≥ x. So for x <= B, y can be from B up to C, but also y ≥ x. So for x ≤ B, y's lower bound is max(x, B) which is B. Wait, because B is the lower limit for y. So for x ≤ B, y starts at B, but since y also has to be ≥ x, which is ≤ B, so the minimum y is B as long as B >= x. Wait, but x can be less than B, so for x < B, y starts at B.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's rephrase:\n\ny must satisfy two conditions: y ≥ x and y ≥ B. So y must be ≥ max(x, B). Also, y must be ≤ min(C, z).\n\nSo for each x, the range of y is [lower_y, upper_y], where lower_y = max(x, B), upper_y = min(C, z).\n\nAdditionally, for y to be valid, lower_y must be ≤ upper_y. Otherwise, there are no y's for this x.\n\nSo for a given z, the approach is:\n\n- Iterate x from A to B.\n\n- For each x, compute lower_y and upper_y.\n\n- If lower_y > upper_y, skip this x.\n\n- Else, the number of y's is (",

The number of valid \\(x\\) values is computed, and for each valid \\(x\\), the number of valid \\(y\\) values is determined. The total count of valid triangles is accumulated efficiently using mathematical summation to avoid nested loops and ensure the solution handles large input sizes within acceptable time limits.",
