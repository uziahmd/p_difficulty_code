He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Check the string,\" and from the description, it seems like we have to verify if a given string meets certain conditions based on how it was built by three friends—A, B, and C.\n\nHmm. Let me try to break down the problem step by step. \n\nSo, the process goes like this: A creates a string of some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's. After that, C appends some 'c's. But there are specific constraints:\n\n1. The string after each step must be such that:\n   - After A, there's at least one 'a' and no 'b's yet.\n   - After B, there's at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n   - After C, the number of 'c's added must be equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's (or both) in the string before C adds them.\n\nAdditionally, the order of the characters must be correct. So the string should consist of all 'a's first, followed by 'b's, then 'c's. Any other order would make it invalid.\n\nSo, the task is to take a given string and determine if it could have been formed this way. If yes, output YES; otherwise, NO.\n\nLet me think about the steps needed to check this.\n\nFirst, the string must have the form a+b+c+... but only in that order. So any 'a' comes before 'b', which comes before 'c'. So, for example, if the string has an 'a' after a 'b', it's invalid.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is check the order. How can I do that? Well, the string should not have any 'b' before an 'a' or any 'c' before a 'b'. So, perhaps we can scan through the string and ensure that once we encounter a 'b', there are no 'a's after it, and similarly, once we encounter a 'c', there are no 'a's or 'b's after it.\n\nWait, but the string is a concatenation of three parts: all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's. So the entire string should consist of a block of 'a's, followed by a block of 'b's, then a block of 'c's. Any other arrangement would mean the string isn't in the correct order.\n\nSo, perhaps we can split the string into these blocks and check their order.\n\nSo step 1: Check the structure of the string. It must consist of a sequence of 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's, without any interleaving.\n\nIf this condition isn't met, then we immediately return NO.\n\nOnce the structure is correct, the next step is to check the counts.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Check the order of the string. It should be a's followed by b's followed by c's. How to do this?\n\nWe can iterate through the string and make sure that after the first 'b' is encountered, there are no 'a's left. Similarly, after the first 'c' is encountered, there are no 'a's or 'b's left.\n\nAlternatively, we can split the string into three parts: a's, b's, c's, ensuring that the a's come first, then b's, then c's.\n\nHow to implement this:\n\n- Find the indices where each new character type starts. For example, the first occurrence of 'b' after the a's, and the first occurrence of 'c' after the b's.\n\n- Once a 'c' is found, make sure that all subsequent characters are 'c's.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to split the string into segments. Let's think of the string as being divided into three parts: the a's part, the b's part, and the c's part.\n\nSo, for example, in 'aaabccc', the a's are 'aaa', then the b's are 'b', then the c's are 'ccc'.\n\nWe can find the count of a's, then the count of b's, then the count of c's.\n\nBut wait, the string may have multiple transitions between these letters. Like, maybe after a's, there's a mix of b's and a's, which would be invalid.\n\nSo the first thing is to check that the string is a run of a's, followed by a run of b's, followed by a run of c's. So, for example, 'aabbcc' is okay. 'abac' is not because after the initial a, there's a b, then an a again, which breaks the order.\n\nSo, how to check that the string is correctly ordered?\n\nIdea: The string must consist of a's, followed by b's, followed by c's, with no other characters appearing out of order. So, the string can be checked by scanning each character and ensuring that once a character of higher priority (like 'b' comes after 'a') appears, the previous ones don't reappear.\n\nAn alternative approach is to split the string into runs of the same character and ensure that the runs are in the order a, b, c.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for example, the string 'aaabbbc' would split into runs: 'a' (3), 'b' (3), 'c' (1). So that's valid.\n\nBut a string like 'aabba' would split into 'a'(2), 'b'(2), 'a'(1)—invalid.\n\nSimilarly, 'abcabc' would have runs a, b, c, a, b, c—so invalid.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Split the string into runs, noting the order of the runs.\n\n- If the runs are not exactly a, b, c in order, then the string is invalid.\n\nSo, first, check the structure.\n\nOnce the structure is correct, we need to compute the counts.\n\nLet me note down the required conditions:\n\nAfter A gives the string to B:\n\n- The string has at least one 'a' and zero 'b's.\n\nThen B appends some 'b's. So after B's step, the string has at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'.\n\nThen C appends some 'c's. The number of 'c's must be equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\nWait, but the number of 'a's and 'b's could be different. So C's 'c's count is either equal to the count of a's, or the count of b's, or both.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\ncount_a = number of a's in the string.\n\ncount_b = number of b's in the string.\n\ncount_c = number of c's in the string.\n\nWe must have count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nAdditionally, since C appends some 'c's, count_c must be >=1.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says that C appends some number of 'c's. So the count of 'c's must be at least 1.\n\nWait, but in the string S, the c's are added by C. So the count of c's is exactly the number of 'c's that C added. So, the count_c is the number of 'c's in the string, and this must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut also, during the process:\n\n- Before C appends, the string has count_a 'a's and count_b 'b's.\n\nSo, when C appends, he appends count_c 'c's, which is equal to either count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, the condition is count_c = count_a OR count_c = count_b.\n\nBut wait, the count_a and count_b are the total numbers before C appends. Because during B's step, B appends some 'b's, so count_b is the number of 'b's after B's step.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify:\n\n- A creates a string with x 'a's.\n\n- B appends y 'b's. So after B's step, the string has x 'a's and y 'b's.\n\n- Then C appends z 'c's, where z is equal to x or y.\n\nSo, in the final string, the counts are:\n\ncount_a = x\n\ncount_b = y\n\ncount_c = z = x or y.\n\nSo, the total count of 'c's in the string is z, which equals x or y.\n\nThus, the conditions are:\n\ncount_c == count_a OR count_c == count_b.\n\nAlso, since C appends at least one 'c', count_c must be >=1.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says that C appends some number of 'c's. So, z >=1.\n\nSo, in the final string, count_c is at least 1.\n\nAdditionally, the counts x and y must be at least 1 because after A and B's steps, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\nSo, in the string S, the counts are:\n\ncount_a = x >=1\n\ncount_b = y >=1\n\ncount_c = z >=1, and z = x or z = y.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nConditions to check:\n\n1. The string is in the form a^+ b^+ c^+ — i.e., runs are a, then b, then c.\n\n2. count_c equals count_a or count_b.\n\n3. count_c is at least 1.\n\n4. Also, count_a and count_b must be at least 1.\n\nBecause after A and B's steps, the string must have at least one a and one b.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's given that after B appends, the string has at least one a and one b.\n\nSo, in the final string, count_a and count_b are at least 1.\n\nSo, in our code, after verifying the structure, we need to:\n\n- Compute count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\n- Check that count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\n- Check that count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, then output YES, else NO.\n\nSo, now the plan for the code is:\n\nRead the input string S.\n\nCheck the structure:\n\n- The string must be composed of a's, then b's, then c's, each in contiguous blocks.\n\n- So, split S into runs. Each run is a consecutive same character.\n\n- The runs must be in the order a, b, c.\n\nIf any of the runs are out of order, then it's invalid.\n\nFor example, if the runs are a, c, b — invalid.\n\nOnce the structure is correct, compute the counts.\n\nCheck:\n\ncount_a >=1\n\ncount_b >=1\n\ncount_c >=1\n\nand (count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b)\n\nIf all conditions are met, output YES. Else, NO.\n\nSo, now, the challenge is to implement the structure check.\n\nHow to split the string into runs and check the order.\n\nLet me think: for the string S, iterate through each character, keep track of the current run's character. When the next character is different, record the end of the current run.\n\nStore the runs as a list, where each element is the character of the run.\n\nThen, check if the list is [a, b, c].\n\nFor example, for 'aaabbbccc', the runs list is ['a','b','c'] — valid.\n\nFor 'aabba', the runs are ['a','b','a'] — invalid.\n\nFor 'abbaac', the runs are ['a','b','a','c'] — invalid.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nInitialize runs = []\n\ncurrent_char = None\n\nfor char in S:\n\n    if char != current_char:\n\n        runs.append(char)\n\n        current_char = char\n\nSo, runs is a list of the unique characters in order.\n\nWait, no. Because in 'aaabbbccc', the runs will be ['a','b','c'].\n\nIn 'aabba', the runs are ['a','b','a'].\n\nBut for 'aabbaac', it's ['a','b','a','c'].\n\nSo, to get the runs, it's better to collect all the runs.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to create a list of the runs. Each run is a tuple of (char, start index, end index).\n\nBut for our purposes, just knowing the order is sufficient.\n\nAlternative idea: after creating the runs list, check that it has exactly three elements, and that they are in the order 'a' followed by 'b' followed by 'c'.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nruns = []\nprev_char = None\nfor char in S:\n    if char != prev_char:\n        runs.append(char)\n        prev_char = char\n\nif len(runs) != 3:\n    # Not enough runs, or too many.\n    # For example, 'aaabbb' has runs ['a','b'] → len 2 → invalid.\n    # Or 'aaabbbcccaaa' → runs ['a','b','c','a'] → len 4 → invalid.\n    return 'NO'\n\nelse:\n    if runs[0] != 'a' or runs[1] != 'b' or runs[2] != 'c':\n        return 'NO'\n\nSo, this will check that the runs are exactly a, then b, then c.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the runs are longer than 3? Like 'aaabbbbaaaaa'? No, because in that case, the runs would be a, b, a, etc. So the len(runs) would be more than 3, which would fail the condition.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, this seems manageable.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: 'abc' → runs are a, b, c → valid.\n\ncount_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=1 → count_c = count_a and count_b → condition holds.\n\nSo output YES.\n\nCase 2: 'aabbc' → runs are a, b, c → valid.\n\ncount_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=1 → count_c is 1, which is not equal to count_a or count_b. So condition fails → output NO.\n\nWait, no. Because count_c is 1, which is not equal to count_a (2) or count_b (2). So condition not met.\n\nSo output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbbc' → runs a, b, c → count_a=3, count_b=3, count_c=1 → count_c is 1, which is not equal to 3 or 3. So condition fails.\n\nSo output NO.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, C appends count_c 'c's, which is equal to either count_a or count_b. So, in this case, count_c is 1, which is less than both a and b's counts. So it's invalid.\n\nAnother example: 'aaabbbccc' → count_a=3, count_b=3, count_c=3.\n\ncount_c equals both, so condition holds → YES.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbbaaaa' → runs a, b, a → invalid structure.\n\nSo, the structure check catches it.\n\nWhat about 'abbaacc'? The runs are a, b, a, c → len(runs)=4 → structure invalid.\n\nSo, that's handled.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaaccc' → runs a, b, a, c → invalid.\n\nSo, the structure check is crucial.\n\nNow, considering all this, let's outline the steps in code.\n\nRead S.\n\nCompute runs.\n\nIf runs is not exactly a, b, c, return NO.\n\nElse, compute count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\nCheck:\n\ncount_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nAnd (count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b).\n\nIf all true, output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but wait. What about the structure check in the case of 'abcabc'? The runs are a, b, c, a, b, c → len(runs)=6, so the structure check returns NO.\n\nWhich is correct, because the string is 'ab c ab c' — which is not the correct order.\n\nSo, the structure check is working.\n\nNow, code.\n\nIn Python, read S as input.\n\nCompute runs:\n\nruns = []\nprev_char = None\nfor char in S:\n    if char != prev_char:\n        runs.append(char)\n        prev_char = char\n\nif len(runs) != 3:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif runs[0] != 'a' or runs[1] != 'b' or runs[2] != 'c':\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nThen, count_a = S.count('a'), count_b = S.count('b'), count_c = S.count('c').\n\nCheck:\n\ncount_a >=1\n\ncount_b >=1\n\ncount_c >=1\n\nand (count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b).\n\nIf all, print YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about cases where the runs are a, b, c, but in the string, there are no a's or no b's or no c's?\n\nFor example, 'abbbc' → runs a, b, c → but count_a is 1, count_b is 3, count_c is 1.\n\nWhich is acceptable because count_c is 1, which is equal to count_a.\n\nSo, output YES.\n\nAnother example: 'acbbc' → runs are a, c, b → structure invalid.\n\nSo, code correctly outputs NO.\n\nWhat about 'a' followed by 'b's and 'c's, but count_c is not equal to a or b?\n\nLike 'aaabbbcccc' → count_a=3, count_b=3, count_c=4. So 4 !=3, so condition fails.\n\nSo output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbccc' → count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=3. So count_c is 3, which is equal to count_b (2?) Wait, no.\n\nWait, in this example, count_a is 2, count_b is 2, count_c is 3. So 3 is not equal to 2. So condition fails.\n\nSo output NO.\n\nWait, but in the sample input given:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\nLet me look at each case.\n\nFirst case: 'aaabccc' → runs a, b, c.\n\ncount_a =3, count_b=1, count_c=3.\n\ncount_c is 3, which is equal to count_a (3). So condition holds → YES.\n\nSecond case: 'bbacc' → the string is 'bba cc'?\n\nWait, the string is 'bbacc' → the runs are 'b', 'a', 'c' → invalid structure. So code correctly outputs NO.\n\nThird case: 'aabc' → runs a, a, b, c → no, wait: 'aabc' is 'aa' followed by 'b' then 'c'? Or wait, the string is 'aabc' → 'a','a','b','c' → the runs are a, b, c? Because the first two are a's, then b, then c. So runs are a, b, c.\n\ncount_a =2, count_b=1, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c is 1, which is equal to count_b (1). So condition holds → YES.\n\nYes, so the sample outputs are covered.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbcc' → runs a, b, c → counts a=2, b=2, c=2. So condition holds → YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaabbaaccc' → runs are a, b, a, b, a, c → len>3 → structure invalid.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the runs are a, b, c but the counts are a=0, but that's impossible because the runs start with a, so a's count is at least 1.\n\nNo, because the runs start with 'a', so count_a is >=1.\n\nSimilarly, count_b is at least 1, because the second run is 'b'.\n\nAnd count_c is at least 1, because third run is 'c'.\n\nWait, no. Because, for example, the string could be 'abba', which is 'a','b','a' → runs length 3, but the third run is 'a' again. So in that case, runs would be a, b, a → which doesn't match the required a, b, c → so structure check fails.\n\nBut in the structure check, runs must be exactly a, b, c in order.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nWait, but what if the runs are a, b, c, but in the string, the 'c's are added but count_c is zero? That's impossible, because the third run is 'c's, so count_c is at least 1.\n\nSo, in the code, the counts will always be at least 1.\n\nThus, the code steps are:\n\nRead S.\n\nCompute runs.\n\nIf runs not a,b,c → NO.\n\nElse, compute counts.\n\nCheck count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf yes → YES, else NO.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nTesting another case:\n\nInput: 'abc' → runs a, b, c. counts 1,1,1 → condition holds → YES.\n\nInput: 'abbbc' → runs a, b, c. counts a=1, b=3, c=1. count_c=1 equals a=1 → condition holds → YES.\n\nInput: 'aabbaabbaaccc' → runs a, b, a, ... → structure invalid → NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbbccc' → runs a, b, c. counts 3,3,3 → condition holds → YES.\n\nAnother case: 'ab' → runs a, b → len 2 → structure invalid → NO.\n\nAnother case: 'abbaaccc' → runs a, b, a, c → len 4 → structure invalid → NO.\n\nAnother case: 'abcdd' → but the problem states that the string consists only of a, b, c. So this case is not possible, as per the problem constraints.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, time to write the code.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a single string. So, in Python, reading from stdin would be:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen proceed as above.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead s.\n\nCompute runs.\n\nCheck runs are a, b, c.\n\nIf not, output NO.\n\nElse, compute counts.\n\nCheck counts meet the condition.\n\nOutput YES or NO.\n\nSo, code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nruns = []\nprev_char = None\nfor char in s:\n    if char != prev_char:\n        runs.append(char)\n        prev_char = char\n\nif len(runs) != 3:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif runs[0] != 'a' or runs[1] != 'b' or runs[2] != 'c':\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\ncount_b = s.count('b')\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where the runs are a, b, c, but the counts are zero for any of a, b, c? But since the runs are a, b, c, count_a is at least 1, count_b is at least 1, count_c is at least 1.\n\nSo, in the code, the checks count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1 are redundant because the runs ensure that each count is at least 1.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → runs a, b, c. count_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3. 3 ==3 → YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → runs are b, a, c → invalid → NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → runs a, b, c. count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1. 1 ==1 → YES.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: 'abba' → runs a, b, a → len 3, but runs[0]=a, runs[1]=b, runs[2]=a != c → output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbaac' → runs a, b, a, c → len 4 → output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbcc' → runs a, b, c. count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=2 → 2 ==2 → YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaaccc' → runs a, b, a, c → len 4 → NO.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by a specific sequence of operations involving three friends: A, B, and C. The string must be constructed in the order of 'a's followed by 'b's and then 'c's, with certain constraints on the counts of each character.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check the Order of Characters**: The string must consist of contiguous blocks of 'a's, followed by contiguous blocks of 'b's, and finally contiguous blocks of 'c's.

If not, the string is immediately deemed invalid.\n4. **Count Occurrences**: The counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' are determined using the `count` method.\n5. **Validation of Counts**: The count of 'c' must match either the count of 'a' or 'b'. If it does, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\nThis approach ensures that the string meets all the required conditions efficiently, handling both the structural and count constraints effectively.",
