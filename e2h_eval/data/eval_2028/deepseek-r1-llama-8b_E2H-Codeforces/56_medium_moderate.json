Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Guard Duty,\" and from the description, I understand that we need to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases in such a way that each base has exactly one spaceship, and vice versa. But there's a catch: the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship shouldn't intersect any other paths. So, no two straight lines connecting a base to its spaceship should cross each other in the galaxy plane.\n\nHmm, right. So the first thing that comes to mind is that this is a matching problem, but with an additional geometric constraint. The main task is to determine whether such a perfect matching exists.\n\nLet's break down the problem.\n\nWe have R Rebel ships and B bases. The numbers can be up to 10 for each. So R and B are both at most 10. That suggests that the solution might not require anything too complex, perhaps even brute-force methods could work.\n\nThe input gives the coordinates of the ships and the bases. The key is to find a bijection between ships and bases such that when you draw straight lines from each ship to its assigned base, none of these lines intersect.\n\nWait, but how do we check for line intersections? For every pair of lines (base1-ship1 and base2-ship2), their paths should not cross.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Generate all possible perfect matchings between the ships and the bases.\n2. For each matching, check if the corresponding lines don't intersect.\n3. If any matching satisfies this condition, output \"Yes\". Otherwise, \"No\".\n\nBut wait, the number of perfect matchings depends on the minimum of R and B. Since R and B are up to 10, the maximum possible number of matchings would be 10! which is 3,628,800. That's manageable, as it's a few million operations, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read the input: R and B, then R ship coordinates, then B base coordinates.\n- Generate all possible permutations of assigning ships to bases, ensuring that each ship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base is assigned exactly one ship. Wait, but since the number of ships and bases may not be equal? Oh, wait the problem statement says it's a perfect matching, so R must equal B because otherwise it's impossible to have a perfect matching. Because a perfect matching implies a bijection between the two sets. So, the first thing to check is whether R equals B. Because if R != B, then it's impossible. So in the code, first, we should check if R == B. If not, immediately output \"No\".\n\nWait, but looking back at the problem statement: It says the assignment is a perfect matching. So yes, R must equal B. So in the code, the first step is to check if R equals B. If not, output \"No\".\n\nWait, but the sample input shows R=3 and B=3, so that's okay. In the second example, R=2 and B=3, so output is \"No\" because it's impossible.\n\nSo that's the first condition: if R != B, output \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nSo the next step is to generate all possible permutations of the bases, where each permutation represents a possible assignment of ships to bases.\n\nWait, no. Each permutation is a mapping from the ships to the bases. So for R=3, the permutation would be a list where each position corresponds to a ship, and the value is the index of the base it's assigned to.\n\nBut wait, the bases are given in a particular order. So, for each permutation, each ship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base is assigned to exactly one ship. So for each permutation, it's a unique mapping.\n\nFor each permutation, we need to check whether all the corresponding lines (ship i to base p[i]) do not intersect with any other lines.\n\nSo for each permutation, for all i < j, check if the line from ship i to base p[i] and the line from ship j to base p[j] intersect. If any pair intersects, this permutation is invalid. Otherwise, it's a valid solution.\n\nIf any permutation is valid, output \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Check if R != B. If yes, output No.\n\n- Else, for each possible permutation of B bases (each permutation represents an assignment of ships to bases):\n\n   - For each pair of ships (i, j), compute the line between ship i and base p[i], and ship j and base p[j].\n\n   - Check if these two lines intersect.\n\n   - If any pair of lines intersects, this permutation is invalid.\n\n- If any permutation is valid, return Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to implementing this logic.\n\nSo the main challenges are:\n\n1. Generating all possible permutations of the bases.\n\n2. For each permutation, checking all pairs of lines for intersection.\n\nSo let's think about the data structures.\n\nWe'll represent each ship as a point (x, y), same for the bases.\n\nFor each permutation, we can create a list where the i-th element is the index of the base assigned to the i-th ship.\n\nThen, for each pair (i, j), we get the two lines: line1 from ship i to base p[i], and line2 from ship j to base p[j]. We need to check if these two lines intersect anywhere except possibly at their endpoints.\n\nWait, but the problem says that no three points are colinear, so three points can't lie on the same line. So any two points will form a line segment that doesn't have any other points on it.\n\nSo, the lines are just infinite lines, and we need to check if any two lines (from different assignments) intersect somewhere.\n\nSo, to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect, we can use the standard computational geometry approach.\n\nWait, but in our case, the line segments are from ship to base, but each line is a line segment. So, for two line segments, we need to check if they intersect at all.\n\nBut how do we check if two line segments intersect?\n\nI remember there's a method using cross products to determine the orientation of points. Alternatively, using parametric equations.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to compute the intersection point of the two lines (if they intersect) and then check if that point lies within both segments.\n\nBut since the problem states that no three points are colinear, any two distinct points define a unique line, and any two lines either don't intersect or intersect at exactly one point. So, for two lines defined by AB and CD, if they intersect, it's either at a point that's one of the four endpoints (but since no three are colinear, only two points can be on the same line). Or, if the lines intersect elsewhere, then the segments will cross.\n\nWait, but in our case, the lines are AB and CD. So, if the lines AB and CD intersect at some point P, but P is not one of A, B, C, D, then the segments AB and CD must cross each other.\n\nSo the algorithm for checking whether two line segments AB and CD intersect is as follows:\n\nCompute the intersection of lines AB and CD. If the intersection point lies on both segments, then they intersect.\n\nBut since the problem ensures that no three points are colinear, the lines can't coincide. So, we can proceed.\n\nSo, let's implement a function that, given two line segments (A, B) and (C, D), returns True if they intersect, False otherwise.\n\nImplementing this function is crucial.\n\nAnother approach is to use the cross product method to determine whether two line segments intersect.\n\nI recall that the method involves checking the orientation of various points.\n\nAlternatively, I can represent each line as a parametric equation and compute the parameters for the intersection.\n\nLet me outline the steps for checking segment intersection.\n\nGiven two line segments AB and CD.\n\nLine AB: A = (x1, y1), B = (x2, y2)\nLine CD: C = (x3, y3), D = (x4, y4)\n\nWe can represent the lines as vectors.\n\nThe parametric equations for AB can be written as:\nx = x1 + t*(x2 - x1)\ny = y1 + t*(y2 - y1)\nwhere t is in [0, 1]\n\nSimilarly for CD:\nx = x3 + s*(x4 - x3)\ny = y3 + s*(y4 - y3)\nwhere s is in [0, 1]\n\nTo find if the segments intersect, we need to find t and s such that:\n\nx1 + t*(x2 - x1) = x3 + s*(x4 - x3)\ny1 + t*(y2 - y1) = y3 + s*(y4 - y3)\n\nThis is a system of linear equations in variables t and s. Solving this system will give us t and s. If both t and s are in [0, 1], then the segments intersect.\n\nBut solving this system can be done via determinants (using cross products).\n\nAnother approach is to compute the direction vectors and use the cross product to determine orientation.\n\nLet me think of the steps.\n\nFirst, calculate the direction vector of AB: dirAB = (dxAB, dyAB) = (x2 - x1, y2 - y1)\nSimilarly for dirCD: (dxCD, dyCD) = (x4 - x3, y4 - y3)\n\nCompute the cross product of AB and CD. The cross product can tell us whether the lines are parallel or not. If they are not parallel, then the lines will intersect at exactly one point.\n\nIf the lines are parallel, then the segments either don't intersect or are coincident (but in our problem, no three points are colinear, so this can't happen).\n\nWait, but in our problem, it's stated that no three points are on the same line. So, AB and CD can't be colinear because that would imply three points are on the same line. So, in our problem, if two lines are parallel, they are either non-intersecting or overlapping, but since no three are colinear, they can't be overlapping. So, if the lines are parallel, the segments don't intersect.\n\nWait, no. Suppose AB and CD are parallel but distinct. Then their lines don't intersect, so the segments won't intersect either. So, in that case, no need to check further.\n\nSo, the first step is to check if the lines are not parallel.\n\nIf they are not parallel, compute the intersection point, and check if it lies within both segments.\n\nIf the lines are parallel, then the segments don't intersect.\n\nWait, but how to determine if the lines are parallel.\n\nThe direction vectors AB and CD must be scalar multiples. So, the cross product of AB and CD should be zero. Wait, no. The cross product of two vectors (a, b) and (c, d) is ad - bc. If this is zero, the vectors are colinear.\n\nSo, in our case, the lines AB and CD are parallel if the direction vectors are colinear.\n\nWait, no. The direction vectors being colinear makes the lines either parallel or coinciding. But since in our problem no three points are colinear, the lines can't coincide, so if the direction vectors are colinear, the lines are parallel and distinct, hence don't intersect.\n\nSo, the steps for checking if two segments AB and CD intersect are:\n\n1. Compute the cross product of the direction vectors of AB and CD.\n\n   cross = (dxAB * dyCD - dxCD * dyAB)\n\n   If cross is not zero, then the lines are not parallel. Proceed to find the intersection point.\n\n2. Compute the intersection point (t, s) as per the parametric equations.\n\n   To solve for t and s:\n\n   (x1 + t*dxAB) = x3 + s*dxCD\n   (y1 + t*dyAB) = y3 + s*dyCD\n\n   Rearranged:\n\n   t*dxAB - s*dxCD = x3 - x1\n   t*dyAB - s*dyCD = y3 - y1\n\n   This can be represented as a matrix equation:\n\n   | dxAB   -dxCD | [t]   = [x3 - x1]\n   | dyAB   -dyCD | [s]     [y3 - y1]\n\n   We can solve for t and s using Cramer's rule.\n\n   The determinant of the coefficient matrix is D = dxAB*(-dyCD) - (-dxCD)*dyAB = -dxAB*dyCD + dxCD*dyAB = dxAB*dyCD - dxCD*dyAB.\n\n   Wait, wait: The determinant is (dxAB * (-dyCD)) - (dyAB * (-dxCD)) ?\n\n   Wait, the matrix is:\n\n   a  b\n   c  d\n\n   where a = dxAB, b = -dxCD, c = dyAB, d = -dyCD.\n\n   So determinant D = a*d - b*c = dxAB*(-dyCD) - (-dxCD)*dyAB = -dxAB*dyCD + dxCD*dyAB.\n\n   Which is the same as (dxAB * dyAB) - (dxCD * dyCD)? No, not exactly. Wait, no:\n\n   Wait, D = dxAB*(-dyCD) - ( -dxCD * dyAB ) \n\n   = -dxAB * dyCD + dxCD * dyAB \n\n   = dxCD*dyAB - dxAB*dyCD \n\n   Which is equal to (dxCD*dyAB - dxAB*dyCD) = -(dxAB*dyCD - dxCD*dyAB) = -cross_product.\n\n   Hmm, interesting.\n\n   So, the determinant D = dxCD * dyAB - dxAB * dyCD.\n\n   So, if D is zero, then the lines are parallel.\n\n   So, for the case where cross product is not zero (lines are not parallel), D is non-zero, so we can compute t and s.\n\n   So, once t and s are found, if both are in [0, 1], then the segments intersect.\n\n   Else, they don't.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\nFunction to check if segments AB and CD intersect:\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    # Compute direction vectors\n    dxAB = B[0] - A[0]\n    dyAB = B[1] - A[1]\n    dxCD = D[0] - C[0]\n    dyCD = D[1] - C[1]\n\n    # Compute cross product of AB and CD direction vectors\n    cross = dxAB * dyCD - dxCD * dyAB\n    if cross != 0:\n        # Lines are not parallel; check if they intersect within segments\n        # Compute determinant D\n        D = dxCD * dyAB - dxAB * dyCD\n        if D == 0:\n            # This shouldn't happen since cross is not zero and no three points are colinear\n            return False\n        # Solve for t and s\n        denominator = D\n        # Compute numerators for t and s\n        numerator_t = (C[0] - A[0]) * (-dyCD) - (C[1] - A[1]) * (-dxCD)\n        numerator_s = (C[0] - A[0]) * (-dyAB) - (C[1] - A[1]) * (-dxAB)\n        # Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the equations.\n\n        # Let me recompute the system of equations:\n\n        # From x1 + t*(dxAB) = x3 + s*(dxCD)\n        # => t * dxAB - s * dxCD = x3 - x1\n        # Similarly for y.\n\n        # So, the system is:\n        # dxAB * t - dxCD * s = x3 - x1 --> (1)\n        # dyAB * t - dyCD * s = y3 - y1 --> (2)\n\n        # So, to solve for t and s:\n\n        # Multiply equation (1) by dyAB, equation (2) by dxAB:\n        # (dxAB * dyAB) t - (dxCD * dyAB) s = (x3 - x1) * dyAB\n        # (dyAB * dxAB) t - (dyCD * dxAB) s = (y3 - y1) * dxAB\n\n        # Subtract the two equations to eliminate t:\n        # - (dxCD * dyAB - dyCD * dxAB) s = (x3 - x1) dyAB - (y3 - y1) dxAB\n        # So, s = [ (y3 - y1) dxAB - (x3 - x1) dyAB ] / (dxCD dyAB - dxAB dyCD )\n\n        # Wait, but earlier I thought D is dxCD dyAB - dxAB dyCD.\n\n        # So, denominator = D.\n\n        # Numerator for s is (y3 - y1) * dxAB - (x3 - x1) * dyAB.\n\n        # Similarly for t, after substituting s.\n\n        # So, s_numerator = (y3 - y1) * dxAB - (x3 - x1) * dyAB\n        s_num = (y3 - y1) * dxAB - (x3 - x1) * dyAB\n        t_num = (x3 - x1) * dyAB - (y3 - y1) * dxAB\n\n        # So, s = s_num / denominator\n        # t = t_num / denominator\n\n        # But we can compute this using Cramer's rule.\n\n        # Compute D = dxCD * dyAB - dxAB * dyCD\n        if D == 0:\n            return False  # lines are parallel, no intersection\n\n        t = ( (C[0] - A[0]) * dyAB - (C[1] - A[1]) * dxAB ) / D\n        s = ( (C[0] - A[0]) * (-dyCD) - (C[1] - A[1]) * (-dxCD) ) / D\n\n        # Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

So in code, we have to compute that.\n\nBut considering floating-point precision, perhaps it's better to avoid using division, but in this problem, since all coordinates are integers, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut in code, dealing with floating points can introduce precision issues. So, perhaps an alternative approach is to compute the intersection using fractions to avoid floating points.\n\nAlternatively, since all coordinates are integers, perhaps the parametric approach can be handled with integer arithmetic.\n\nBut for now, perhaps it's easier to proceed with floating points, but we need to handle them carefully.\n\nWait, but perhaps an alternative approach is to represent the lines in terms of their parametric equations and find if the parameters t and s fall within [0, 1].\n\nBut let's proceed with the code.\n\nSo, in code, for each permutation, we'll loop through all pairs of ships (i, j) and check if the line from i to p[i] and j to p[j] intersect.\n\nIf any permutation has all pairs of lines non-intersecting, then output \"Yes\".\n\nElse, after checking all permutations, output \"No\".\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nFirst, read R and B.\n\nIf R != B, output \"No\".\n\nElse, read R ship points and B base points.\n\nGenerate all possible permutations of the B bases.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   for i in 0 to R-1:\n\n      ship_i is ships[i]\n\n      base_i is permutation[i]\n\n   then, for each pair of ships (i, j), i < j:\n\n      compute the line from ship i to base_i.\n\n      compute the line from ship j to base_j.\n\n      check if these two lines intersect.\n\n      if any pair intersects, mark this permutation as invalid.\n\n   if all pairs are non-intersecting, then this permutation is valid. Return \"Yes\".\n\nIf after all permutations, none is valid, output \"No\".\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\n- Read the input.\n\n- Generate all permutations.\n\n- For each permutation, check all pairs.\n\nNow, in Python, generating all permutations can be done using itertools.permutations.\n\nBut since B can be up to 10, which means 10! permutations, which is around 3.6 million, and for each permutation, checking C(10, 2) = 45 pairs, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nimport itertools\n\nR, B = map(int, input().split())\nships = []\nfor _ in range(R):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    ships.append( (x, y) )\nbases = []\nfor _ in range(B):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    bases.append( (x, y) )\n\nif R != B:\n    print(\"No\")\n    exit()\n\n# Now, for each permutation of bases\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(bases):\n    # Assign each ship to a base in perm\n    # Check all pairs of ships (i, j) whether their lines intersect\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(R):\n        for j in range(i+1, R):\n            # Ship i is assigned to perm[i], ship j to perm[j]\n            A = ships[i]\n            B_point = perm[i]\n            C = ships[j]\n            D_point = perm[j]\n            if segments_intersect(A, B_point, C, D_point):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n    if valid:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"No\")\n\nBut wait, the function 'segments_intersect' is not defined yet.\n\nSo, we need to implement that function.\n\nLet's write the function.\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    # A and B are endpoints of segment AB\n    # C and D are endpoints of segment CD\n    # Returns True if AB and CD intersect, except at endpoints.\n\n    # Compute direction vectors\n    dxAB = B[0] - A[0]\n    dyAB = B[1] - A[1]\n    dxCD = D[0] - C[0]\n    dyCD = D[1] - C[1]\n\n    # Compute cross product of AB and CD direction vectors\n    cross = dxAB * dyCD - dxCD * dyAB\n    if cross != 0:\n        # Lines are not parallel; check for intersection\n        a = dxAB\n        b = dxCD\n        c = dyAB\n        d = dyCD\n        e = C[0] - A[0]\n        f = C[1] - A[1]\n\n        # Compute determinant D\n        denom = a * d - b * c\n        if denom == 0:\n            # Lines are parallel, no intersection\n            return False\n\n        # Compute t and s using Cramer's rule\n        t_num = e * d - b * f\n        s_num = a * f - e * c\n        t = t_num / denom\n        s = s_num / denom\n\n        # Check if t and s are between 0 and 1\n        if 0 <= t <= 1 and 0 <= s <= 1:\n            return True\n        else:\n            return False\n    else:\n        # Lines are parallel, check if they are coincident (but according to problem statement, no three points are colinear, so this can't happen)\n        return False\n\nWait, but wait: in the problem statement, it's stated that no three points are colinear. So, for any two distinct points, the lines defined by them cannot contain a third point. So, in our case, for two different segments, if their direction vectors are colinear, then the lines are parallel and distinct, so the segments can't intersect.\n\nSo, in the code, when cross is zero, we can return False without further checks.\n\nBut in the function, the 'else' clause returns False, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the code above, when cross is zero, the function returns False. But in reality, when cross is zero, the lines are either parallel or coincident. But since no three are colinear, the lines can't be coincident, so the segments can't intersect.\n\nSo, the function correctly returns False.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the 'else' part is when cross is zero, and the function returns False, meaning that the segments do not intersect.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the function is correct.\n\nNow, testing.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nBases:\n\n-2 1\n\n3 1\n\n0 3\n\nWait, no, the input is:\n\nThe first line is '3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2'\n\nWait, the first line is R=3, B=3.\n\nShips:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nBases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWait, the sample input seems a bit unclear. Looking back:\n\nIn the first sample, the input is:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, perhaps the first part is the ships, and the next part is the bases.\n\nSo, for the first sample, R=3, B=3.\n\nShips:\n\n(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)\n\nBases:\n\n(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)\n\nSo, the code would generate all permutations of the 3 bases.\n\nOne of the permutations is ( (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2) ), which is the identity permutation.\n\nSo, for this permutation:\n\nCheck all pairs:\n\nShip 0 to base 0: (0,0) to (-2,1)\n\nShip 1 to base 1: (2,0) to (0,3)\n\nShip 2 to base 2: (3,1) to (2,2)\n\nCheck if any pair of lines intersect.\n\nCheck Ship 0 and Ship 1:\n\nLine 0: from (0,0) to (-2,1)\n\nLine 1: from (2,0) to (0,3)\n\nDo these lines intersect?\n\nUsing the function:\n\nCompute cross product.\n\ndxAB = (-2 - 0) = -2, dyAB = 1 -0 = 1.\n\ndxCD = 0 - 2 = -2, dyCD = 3-0=3.\n\nCross = (-2)*3 - (-2)*1 = -6 +2= -4 ≠0.\n\nSo, lines are not parallel.\n\nCompute D = a*d -b*c = (-2)*3 - (-2)*1 = -6 +2= -4.\n\nt_num = (0-0)*3 - (-2)*(3-0) = 0 - (-2*3) = 0 +6=6\n\ns_num = (-2)*(3-0) - (0-0)*1 = (-2)*3 -0= -6.\n\nt = 6 / (-4) = -1.5\n\ns = (-6)/ (-4) = 1.5.\n\nSo, t is -1.5, which is less than 0. So, the lines do not intersect within the segments.\n\nSo, Ship 0 and Ship 1's lines do not intersect.\n\nSimilarly, Ship 0 and Ship 2:\n\nShip 0 to base 0: (0,0) to (-2,1)\n\nShip 2 to base 2: (3,1) to (2,2)\n\ndxAB = (-2), dyAB=1.\n\ndxCD = -1, dyCD=1.\n\nCross product: (-2)*1 - (-1)*1 = -2 +1 = -1≠0.\n\nCompute D: (-2)*1 - (-1)*1 = -2 +1= -1.\n\nt_num = (2-0)*1 - (-1)*(2-0) → (2)*1 - (-1)*2= 2+2=4.\n\ns_num = (-2)*(2-0) - (2-0)*1 → (-2)*2 -2*1= -4-2= -6.\n\nt=4/-1= -4 <0 → no intersection.\n\nSimilarly, Ship 1 and Ship 2:\n\nShip 1 to base 1: (2,0) to (0,3)\n\nShip 2 to base 2: (3,1) to (2,2)\n\ndxAB = (-2), dyAB=3.\n\ndxCD = -1, dyCD=1.\n\nCross product: (-2)*1 - (-1)*3= -2+3=1≠0.\n\nCompute D: (-2)*1 - (-1)*3= -2+3=1.\n\nt_num = (2-2)*1 - (-1)*(2-0) → 0 - (-2) → 2.\n\ns_num = (-2)*(2-0) - (2-2)*3 → (-4) - 0 → -4.\n\nt=2/1=2>1 → no intersection.\n\nSo, this permutation is valid, so output is \"Yes\".\n\nIn the second sample, R=2, B=3. So, since R != B, output is \"No\".\n\nSo, the code should handle these cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n1. Precision in floating points: when t and s are exactly 0 or 1, due to floating-point inaccuracies, the code might treat them as outside the [0,1] interval. But in Python, using exact integers for t and s would be better.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, all coordinates are integers. So, perhaps we can compute t and s as fractions, avoiding floating points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using integer arithmetic for t and s.\n\nBut this complicates the code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can compute t and s as fractions, but that's more complex.\n\nBut considering that the problem allows R and B up to 10, the code should handle it correctly.\n\nAnother issue: when lines are exactly parallel but not overlapping. Since the problem states that no three points are colinear, this case is not possible.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplement the function 'segments_intersect' as described.\n\nRead the input, check if R != B.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the bases.\n\nFor each permutation, check all pairs of ships.\n\nIf any permutation is valid, output \"Yes\".\n\nElse, output \"No\".\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nThe code should output \"Yes\".\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 3\n\nShip coordinates:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\nBase coordinates:\n\n3 1\n\n2 2\n\nWait, no. The second sample input is:\n\n['2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, perhaps the first line is R=2, B=3.\n\nShips:\n\n(2,1), (1,0)\n\nBases:\n\n(2,2), (3,1).\n\nWait, but B is 3, so there's a third base.\n\nWait, perhaps the second sample's input is:\n\nR=2, B=3.\n\nShips:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\nBases:\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\n... and another base.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nThe first line is '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1'.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial line is R=2, B=3.\n\nSo, ships are two points: (2,1) and (1,0).\n\nBases are three points: (2,2), (3,1), and another point.\n\nWait, perhaps the second sample's input is:\n\nThe first line is '2 3\\n2 1\\n1 0\\n3 1\\n0 3'.\n\nSo, R=2, B=3.\n\nShips: (2,1), (1,0).\n\nBases: (3,1), (0,3), and another point.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the sample input, but in any case, the code should correctly handle the cases.\n\nAnother test case: when R=B=1.\n\nThen, there's only one permutation, and since no other ships, nothing to check. So output is \"Yes\".\n\nAnother test case: R=B=2.\n\nShips: (0,0), (1,0).\n\nBases: (1,0), (0,1).\n\nCheck if any permutation is valid.\n\nPossible permutations:\n\nEither assign (0,0) to (1,0), (1,0) to (0,1). Then, the lines are from (0,0) to (1,0) and (1,0) to (0,1).\n\nThese two lines are the x-axis and a line from (1,0) to (0,1). Do they intersect?\n\nAt (1,0), which is an endpoint. But the problem requires that any two paths do not intersect. So, the line from (0,0) to (1,0) is along the x-axis, and the other line starts at (1,0) and goes to (0,1). So, they meet at (1,0), which is a common point. But according to the problem statement, is this considered an intersection?\n\nThe note says that the paths should not intersect in the galaxy plane. So, if two paths share a common point (like a base), does that count as an intersection?\n\nWait, in the problem statement, it says that the paths are from a base to its assigned spaceship. So, the paths are the line segments.\n\nIf two line segments share a common point (like a base), does that count as an intersection? For example, if two ships are assigned to bases that are connected through a common point.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the paths are from the base to the spaceship. So, suppose ship A is assigned to base X, and ship B is assigned to base Y, and X and Y are the same point. Then, the paths would both start from X, but go to their respective ships. So, the two paths meet at X, but since X is a base, it's a shared point.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the paths are line segments, and their intersection is allowed at the base point. Or is it not?\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\"\n\nSo, if two paths share a common point (the base), is that considered an intersection?\n\nIn the example I was considering, two paths share the same base. So, the two paths start at that base, go to different ships. So, they both start at the same point. Do they intersect?\n\nWell, in that case, the two lines intersect at that base point. But according to the problem statement, is this allowed?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: the constraint is that any two paths do not intersect. So, if two paths meet at a point, that counts as an intersection.\n\nTherefore, in the case where two paths meet at a base, the assignment is invalid.\n\nSo, in the example I had:\n\nShips: A (0,0), B (1,0).\n\nBases: X (1,0), Y (0,1).\n\nIf we assign A to X, B to Y.\n\nThen, path A to X is the line segment from (0,0) to (1,0), which is the x-axis.\n\nPath B to Y is from (1,0) to (0,1).\n\nThese two paths do not intersect except at (1,0), which is the base for B.\n\nSo, the two paths share a point (the base of B), but is that considered an intersection?\n\nAccording to the problem statement, any two paths should not intersect. So, if two paths meet at any point, including a base, the assignment is invalid.\n\nWait, but the base is a single point. So, in that case, the two paths share a point, which is a base. So, that's an intersection.\n\nTherefore, the code should consider that as an invalid case.\n\nSo, in that case, the code should output \"No\" for that permutation.\n\nThus, the code correctly identifies that the two paths intersect at the base of B.\n\nSo, in that example, the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. Additionally, the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship should not intersect in the galaxy plane.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Perfect Matching**: First, we check if the number of Rebel spaceships (R) is equal to the number of bases (B). If R != B, it is impossible to have a perfect matching, so we immediately return \"No\".\n\n2. **Generate Permutations**: Since R equals B, we generate all possible permutations of the bases. Each permutation represents a potential assignment of ships to bases.\n\n3. **Check for Intersection**: For each permutation, we check if any two paths (from a ship to its assigned base) intersect. This is done using a geometric approach to determine if two line segments intersect.\n\n4. **Geometric Intersection Check**: The intersection of two line segments is checked using their direction vectors and parametric equations. If any permutation results in intersecting paths, that permutation is invalid. If any permutation is valid, we output \"Yes\"; otherwise, we output \"No\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    dxAB = B[0] - A[0]\n    dyAB = B[1] - A[1]\n    dxCD = D[0] - C[0]\n    dyCD = D[1] - C[1]\n\n    cross = dxAB * dyCD - dxCD * dyAB\n    if cross != 0:\n        a = dxAB\n        b = dxCD\n        c = dyAB\n        d = dyCD\n        e = C[0] - A[0]\n        f = C[1] - A[1]\n\n        denom = a * d - b * c\n        if denom == 0:\n            return False\n\n        t_num = e * d - b * f\n        s_num = a * f - e * c\n        t = t_num / denom\n        s = s_num / denom\n\n        if 0 <= t <= 1 and 0 <= s <= 1:\n            return True\n        else:\n            return False\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R_B = input[idx].split()\n    R = int(R_B[0])\n    B = int(R_B[1])\n    idx += 1\n\n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        ships.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                A = ships[i]\n                B_point = perm[i]\n                C = ships[j]\n                D_point = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(A, B_point, C, D_point):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution involves generating all possible permutations of the bases and checking each permutation for valid assignments where no paths intersect.
