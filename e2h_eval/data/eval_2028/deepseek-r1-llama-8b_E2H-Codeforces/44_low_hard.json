He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is called Polycarp's Practice. The goal is to maximize the total profit from solving problems over k days.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, Polycarp has a list of n problems with difficulties a_1 to a_n. He needs to solve all of them in exactly k days. Each day he must solve at least one problem, and he can't skip any. So each day's problems are a contiguous sequence starting from some point. For example, on day 1, he might solve the first m problems, then on day 2, the next p, and so on until all are done.\n\nThe profit for each day is the maximum difficulty in that day's problems. The total profit is the sum of these maxima across all days. We need to distribute the problems into k contiguous groups (days) such that the sum is as large as possible.\n\nOur task is to find this maximum sum and output the way to split the list.\n\nHmm, how to approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about the constraints. n can be up to 2000, k up to 2000 as well. So O(n^3) might be acceptable, but we need to find an efficient way.\n\nWait, maybe dynamic programming can help here. Because for each position i and day j, we can track the best possible way to split up to i into j days.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let's consider a DP table where dp[i][j] represents the maximum total profit when considering the first i problems and using j days.\n\nBut wait, not just the maximum profit, but also how the last day was split. Because to compute the next step, we need to know where the current day starts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach is needed. Let's think about the structure of the optimal solution.\n\nEach day's contribution is the maximum of a contiguous subsequence. To maximize the total, we want as many high values as possible to be the maxima of their respective days.\n\nBut since the days are contiguous, the way you split affects which elements become the maxima.\n\nAn idea: the optimal splits will likely include making some of the higher a_i's the maximum for their day. So perhaps the strategy is to select certain points where a larger a_i is followed by smaller ones, thus allowing us to take that a_i as a separate day's maximum.\n\nWait, but we have to make exactly k days, so if there are more than k-1 such peaks, we can't take all of them. So we need to choose k-1 split points where the maximum is taken.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem reduces to selecting k-1 split points to form k contiguous segments, each contributing their maximum. The sum is the sum of the maxima of these segments.\n\nSo the problem becomes: partition the array into k contiguous parts, such that the sum of the maxima of these parts is as large as possible.\n\nThat's a crucial insight. So the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum sum of k segment maxima.\n\nSo how do we model this?\n\nWe can model it with dynamic programming. Let's define dp[i][j] as the maximum total profit when considering the first i elements and j days.\n\nTo compute dp[i][j], we need to look back to some m < i, where m is the end of the previous day, and then the j-th day is from m+1 to i. The maximum for the j-th day is max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nWait, but computing the max for each possible m could be expensive. But perhaps we can find a way to compute it efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, for each i and j, we can track the possible m's and keep track of the maximum a in the range m+1 to i.\n\nWait, but even that could be O(n^3), which for n=2000 would be 8e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So perhaps we need a smarter way.\n\nAnother thought: when adding a new element a[i], for each possible j, we can find the best m to split before, such that the sum up to m with j-1 days plus the max from m+1 to i is maximized.\n\nBut the key is to find, for each i and j, the best m where the max from m+1 to i is added.\n\nWait, but how do we quickly find the max in m+1 to i for various m?\n\nAlternatively, for each j, we can keep track of the best possible m for each i.\n\nWait, another angle: the maximum in the j-th day is the maximum of a segment. So, for the j-th day, the maximum can't be lower than the maximum in the previous j-1 days.\n\nWait, no. Because each day is a separate segment; the maximum could be higher",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit from solving problems over k days. Each day, Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of problems, and the profit for each day is the maximum difficulty in that sequence. The goal is to distribute the problems into k contiguous segments such that the sum of their maxima is maximized.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached using dynamic programming. We define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum total profit when considering the first `i` problems and using `j` days. The key insight is that for each position `i` and day `j`, we look back to some position `m` where the previous day ended, and the current day starts from `m+1` to `i`. The profit for the current day is the maximum value in this segment.\n\nTo efficiently compute the maximum value for each possible segment, we use a 2D array `max_val` where `max_val[i][j]` stores the maximum value from position `i` to `j`. This allows us to quickly determine the maximum value for any segment during the DP transition.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # Initialize the max_val table\n    max_val = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        max_val[i][i] = a[i]\n        if i < n-1:\n            max_val[i][i+1] = max(a[i], max_val[i+1][i+1])\n        for j in range(i+2, n+1):\n            max_val[i][j] = max(max_val[i][j-1], a[j-1])\n    \n    # Initialize DP table\n    dp = [[-1 for _ in range(k+1)] for __ in range(n+1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 0\n    \n    # Fill DP table\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(1, k+1):\n            for m in range(i):\n                if m == 0:\n                    current_max = max_val[m][i]\n                else:\n                    current_max = max_val[m+1][i]\n                if dp[m][j-1] != -1:\n                    total = dp[m][j-1] + current_max\n                    if dp[i][j] < total:\n                        dp[i][j] = total\n                        # Also track the split point\n                        splits[i][j] = m+1\n    \n    # Now reconstruct the splits\n    splits = [[0]*(k+1) for __ in range(n+1)]\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(1, k+1):\n            if dp[i][j] == -1:\n                continue\n            max_val_i_j = 0\n            for m in range(i):\n                current_max = max_val[m+1][i]\n                if dp[m][j-1] != -1:\n                    if dp[m][j-1] + current_max > dp[i][j]:\n                        dp[i][j] = dp[m][j-1] + current_max\n                        splits[i][j] = m+1\n                        max_val_i_j = current_max\n            if max_val_i_j == 0:\n                continue\n    \n    # Reconstruct the split points\n    split_points = []\n    current = n\n    for j in range(k, 0, -1):\n        prev = splits[current][j]\n        split_points.append(current - prev + 1)\n        current = prev - 1\n    \n    # Compute the total profit\n    total = dp[n][k]\n    \n    print(total)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, split_points)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize a `max_val` table to store the maximum values for all possible segments of the array.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: The `dp` table is used to store the maximum profit achievable up to each position `i` using `j` days.\n3. **Transition**: For each position `i` and day `j`, we consider all possible previous positions `m` and compute the profit if the current segment starts at `m+1`.\n4. **Reconstruction**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack to determine the exact split points that achieve the maximum profit.\n5. **Output**: Finally, we print the maximum total profit and the split points for each day.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the optimal solution using dynamic programming and precompute necessary maximum values to handle the constraints effectively.",
