And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Average Sleep Time.\" Hmm.\n\nThe task says that Polycarp has been keeping track of his sleep times for n days. But a week in Berland is k days long. So the doctor wants to find the average sleep time per week over all possible consecutive weeks. Oh right, like sliding windows of size k.\n\nSo the input gives me two integers, n and k, followed by a list of n integers representing each day's sleep time. My goal is to compute the average of these k-day windows.\n\nWait, how do I approach this? Well, let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to process all possible consecutive k-day windows in the array a. For each window, calculate the sum, then find the average of all those sums.\n\nLet me think about the example they gave. Like when n=3, k=2, and a = [3,4,7], the windows are [3,4] and [4,7]. Their sums are 7 and 11, so the average is (7+11)/2 = 9.0, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate through the array, taking each possible window of size k.\n2. For each window, compute the sum.\n3. Sum all these window sums and then divide by the number of windows (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\nBut wait, what if k is equal to n? Then there's only one window, so the average is just the sum of all elements.\n\nNow, considering the constraints: n can be up to 2e5, which is 200,000. So any O(nk) solution would be too slow because for k=2e5, that's 4e10 operations—way beyond what's acceptable.\n\nI need an efficient way to compute the sum for each window quickly. The standard approach here is to use a sliding window technique with a prefix sum array.\n\nHow does that work?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Compute the prefix sum array, where prefix[i] is the sum of the first i elements. So prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a[0], prefix[2] = a[0] + a[1], etc.\n- For each window starting at index i (from 0 to n-k), the sum is prefix[i + k] - prefix[i].\n- Sum all these window sums and divide by the number of windows.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the time complexity becomes O(n), which is acceptable for n=2e5.\n\nSo the steps I need to implement are:\n\n1. Read n and k from input.\n2. Read the array a as a list of integers.\n3. Compute the prefix sum array.\n4. For each window, compute the sum using the prefix array.\n5. Sum all the window sums.\n6. Divide by the number of windows to get the average.\n7. Print the result with at least 6 decimal places.\n\nWait, but how to handle the prefix sum correctly? Let me think about indices. Let's say the array is zero-based or one-based. Probably easier to make it zero-based, with prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a[0], prefix[2] = a[0]+a[1], ..., prefix[n] = sum of all a's.\n\nThen, the sum from a[i] to a[i+k-1] is prefix[i + k] - prefix[i].\n\nSo for i in 0 to (n - k):\n\nsum = prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]\n\nAdd all these sums together.\n\nOnce I have the total sum, average is total / m, where m is n - k + 1.\n\nSo now, the code steps.\n\nIn Python, reading the input is straightforward. But I have to be careful with leading/trailing spaces.\n\nFor example, the first line is '3 2\\n', so after splitting, it's [3, 2].\n\nThe second line is the numbers.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead n and k from the first line. Split and convert to integers.\n\nThen read the next line, split into list of integers.\n\nCompute the prefix sum.\n\nInitialize prefix as a list where prefix[0] = 0. Then for i from 0 to len(a)-1, add a[i] to prefix[i+1].\n\nThen, for each window starting at i, from 0 to (n - k), calculate the sum as prefix[i + k] - prefix[i].\n\nAccumulate all these sums into a total.\n\nFinally, average = total / (n - k + 1).\n\nBut wait, n could be up to 2e5, and adding 2e5 elements is manageable.\n\nNow, about precision. The output needs to have at least six decimal digits. So we should print it with sufficient decimal places, perhaps 10 as in the sample.\n\nIn Python, formatting the output as a float with 10 decimal places should suffice.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nSo the windows are:\n\n1+2 = 3\n\n2+4 = 6\n\n4+100000 = 100004\n\n100000+123=100123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789+1=790\n\nSumming all these:\n\n3 +6 =9; +100004=100013; +100123=200136; +579=200715; +1245=201960; +790=202750.\n\nTotal is 202750.\n\nNumber of windows is 8-2+1=7.\n\n202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: when k equals n, like n=1, k=1. Then the average is a[0].\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase where k=1: each day is a separate window. So the average is the sum of all a's divided by n.\n\nWait no: because each window is a single day, so the sum is the same as each a_i, so average is (sum(a)) / n.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: k=n. So only one window, sum is sum(a), average is sum(a).\n\nSo the code should handle these.\n\nWhat about when n is 0? But according to the problem statement, k ≤ n, and 1<=k <=n. So n is at least 1.\n\nSo the code will not have to handle n=0.\n\nTesting another scenario: n=2, k=2. So one window, sum is a[0]+a[1].\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nImplementing in Python:\n\nRead n and k:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nCompute prefix sum:\n\nprefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\nCompute total:\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(n - k + 1):\n\n    total += prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]\n\naverage = total / (n - k + 1)\n\nPrint with 10 decimal places:\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but in the sample, the third case's output is 28964.2857142857, which is 10 decimal places. So yes.\n\nBut wait, when you print, sometimes floating points can have more than 10 decimal digits, but in Python, using .10f will round to 10 decimal places.\n\nWait, but the problem says to output at least 6 digits, so 10 is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's test the first sample.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nprefix is [0,3,7,14]\n\nwindows: i=0 and i=1.\n\ni=0: sum 7-0=7.\n\ni=1: sum 14-3=11.\n\nTotal 18. Average 9.0 → printed as 9.0000000000.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nprefix is [0,10]\n\nwindow: i=0: sum 10-0=10. Average 10 → 10.0000000000.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what about when n is large, like 2e5? The code uses a loop of 2e5 steps, which is manageable.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother consideration: the sum can be very large, but in Python, integers can handle that.\n\nSo I think this should work.\n\nThus, the code should be as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of size k from a given list of sleep times for n days. The goal is to efficiently calculate this average using a sliding window technique.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** We first read the integers n and k, followed by the list of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array:** We construct a prefix sum array where each element at index i represents the sum of the first i elements of the sleep times array. This allows us to quickly compute the sum of any subarray.\n3. **Sliding Window Technique:** Using the prefix sum array, we compute the sum of each possible window of size k. For each starting index i (from 0 to n-k), the sum of the window starting at i is given by the difference between two elements in the prefix sum array.\n4. **Total Sum and Average Calculation:** Sum all the window sums and then divide by the number of windows (n - k + 1) to get the average sleep time per week.\n5. **Output the Result:** The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to ensure accuracy within the required tolerance.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprefix = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(n - k + 1):\n    total += prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]\n\naverage = total / (n - k + 1)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The input is read and parsed into the number of days (n), the window size (k), and the list of sleep times (a).\n- **Prefix Sum Array:** This array helps in efficiently calculating the sum of any subarray in constant time. The prefix sum array is built such that each element at index i is the sum of the first i elements of the sleep times array.\n- **Sliding Window Sum Calculation:** Using the prefix sum array, we iterate over all possible starting points of the window. For each starting point, the sum of the window is computed as the difference between two corresponding elements in the prefix sum array.\n- **Total and Average Calculation:** The total sum of all window sums is accumulated, and this total is divided by the number of windows to get the average sleep time.\n- **Precision Handling:** The result is formatted to ensure it is printed with at least 10 decimal places, meeting the problem's precision requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required average with a time complexity of O(n), making it suitable for large input sizes up to 200,000 elements.",
