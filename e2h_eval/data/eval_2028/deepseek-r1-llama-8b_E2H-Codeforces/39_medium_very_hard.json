Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about arranging numbers on an N x N chessboard such that when a rook and a queen move according to specific rules, the rook ends up paying strictly fewer vuns than the queen. And if no such arrangement exists, we have to output -1.\n\nLet me try to break down the problem. The chessboard has cells numbered from 1 to N², each exactly once. The movement rules are a bit tricky. For each step, the piece (rook or queen) moves to the next cell based on some criteria.\n\nWait, the process starts with the cell containing 1. That's already visited. Then, for each move, among all unvisited cells reachable in one move, the piece goes to the one with the smallest number. If there are no more reachable cells (because all possible moves are already visited), but there are still unvisited cells, then teleportation happens: the piece jumps to the smallest-numbered unvisited cell, paying a fee of 1 vun. We need to count the total fees each piece pays during their rounds.\n\nSo, the task is to construct such a board where the rook's total vuns are less than the queen's. Or determine if it's impossible.\n\nHmm, how do I model this? Let's think about the movement steps for both pieces.\n\nFor the rook, in each step, it can move any number of squares along a row or column. So from its current position, it can reach any cell in the same row or column, as long as it's unvisited. Among these, it picks the cell with the smallest number.\n\nFor the queen, she can move any number of squares in any straight line—so diagonally, horizontally, vertically. So from her current position, she can reach any cell in the same row, column, or diagonal, choosing the smallest-numbered unvisited cell each time.\n\nThe key is to arrange the numbers in such a way that the rook's path incurs fewer teleportations (and thus fewer vuns) compared to the queen's.\n\nI remember that in the sample provided, N=4, and the output was a specific arrangement where the rook paid 1 vun and the queen paid 2. So the solution exists for N=4.\n\nBut for N=1, it's impossible because both would just stay on the same cell without moving, so no fees are paid. Wait, but the problem says \"strictly less\"—if both pay zero, it's not less, so N=1 is invalid. Hence, the output is -1.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to figure out is for which N it's possible to construct such a board.\n\nWait, the problem says to output any valid board if it exists. So perhaps for even N, it's possible, and for odd, it's not. Or maybe only for N ≥ 2.\n\nWait, let's think about small N values.\n\nN=1: As discussed, no way to have rook < queen. Output -1.\n\nN=2: Let's see. The board is 2x2.\n\nNumbers are 1 to 4 arranged somehow.\n\nLet's try to arrange them so that the rook's path has fewer vuns than the queen's.\n\nLet me consider the example where the rook's path is 1 → 2 → 3 → 4. But wait, how does the rook move?\n\nWait, the starting position is 1. From 1, the rook can move to any other cell in the same row or column. So in a 2x2 grid, from 1, it can go to 2 or 4, depending on how they're arranged.\n\nWait, perhaps arranging the numbers in a way that the rook can reach 2, then 3, then 4, etc., without needing to teleport.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the queen's path will require more teleportations, leading to higher vuns.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe trying to construct such a board for N=2 could help.\n\nWait, for N=2, the board is:\n\na b\nc d\n\nEach cell must have unique numbers 1-4.\n\nSuppose 1 is at position (0,0). Then, the rook can choose between moving right to (0,1) or down to (1,0). Which is smaller between a and c? Well, since 1 is fixed, a and c can be 2 and 3, or 3 and 2.\n\nSuppose a=2, c=3, then the rook will choose to move right to 2.\n\nThen, from 2, the rook can move left (to 1, which is already visited), right (no further cells since it's 2x2), or down to 3. So the next cell is 3.\n\nFrom 3, the rook can't move right (since it's the end of the row), can't move up (already visited), so it moves down to 4.\n\nSo rook's path is 1 → 2 → 3 → 4. No teleportation. So vuns = 0.\n\nWhat about the queen's path?\n\nShe starts at 1. From there, she can move to any cell in the same row, column, or diagonal. So, the available cells are 2,3,4.\n\nAmong them, 2 is the smallest. So she moves to 2.\n\nFrom 2, she can move to 3 (same row) or 4 (diagonal). 3 is smaller, so she moves to 3.\n\nFrom 3, she can move to 4 (same column). So she goes to 4.\n\nSo queen's path is 1→2→3→4, no teleportations. So vuns=0. So rook and queen have same vuns. So this arrangement doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nHmm, so we need to find an arrangement where the rook's vuns are strictly less than the queen's.\n\nWhat if the rook's path requires a teleportation, but the queen's path requires more than one?\n\nWait, maybe arrange the numbers in such a way that the rook's path is forced to teleport once, while the queen's path is forced to teleport more times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for N=2, it's impossible. Because for both pieces, the minimal path may not involve teleportation. So their vuns would be equal.\n\nSo maybe for N=2, it's also impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the rook's path can be made to have as few teleportations as possible, and the queen's path can be forced to have more. So for larger N, like N=4, it's possible.\n\nSo perhaps the solution is possible for N ≥ 2 except for N=1.\n\nBut wait, the sample input is N=4, which works.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For N=1, output -1.\n\n2. For N=2, perhaps it's also impossible. Let's see.\n\nWait, another approach: Arrange the numbers in such a way that the rook's path is a single line, minimizing the teleportations, while the queen's path requires more steps, possibly involving more teleportations.\n\nWait, perhaps arrange the numbers in a spiral pattern or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, think of the rook's path as a grid that allows it to traverse each row and column in order, without requiring teleportation until the very end.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps place the numbers in such a way that for the rook, the next smallest unvisited cell is always in the same row or column, thus allowing it to move without teleportation until all cells are visited.\n\nWait, but when the rook's path covers all cells, it's done. So the teleportation only occurs when the rook can't move to any new cell via rook's movement, but there are still unvisited cells.\n\nSimilarly for the queen.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to ensuring that the rook's path uses as few teleportations as possible, and the queen's uses more.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother thought: The rook can only move along rows and columns. So, if the numbering is such that in every row and column, the numbers are arranged in a way that the next smallest unvisited cell is always in the same row or column.\n\nIn that case, the rook's path would cover all cells without teleportation. So the rook's vuns would be zero.\n\nBut the queen can't do that, because she can also move diagonally. So perhaps the queen's path would have to teleport more.\n\nWait, but if the rook can visit all cells without teleporting, then the queen might have a longer path, but perhaps with fewer teleportations.\n\nWait, but if the rook's path uses zero teleportations, then the queen's path could also use zero, making their vuns equal, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to have the rook's path require one teleportation, while the queen's requires two or more.\n\nSo, how to arrange the numbers so that the rook has to teleport once, but the queen has to teleport more times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for N≥2, there's a certain way to arrange the numbers.\n\nWait, looking back to the sample input: N=4, and the arrangement leads to the rook paying 1 vun, queen paying 2.\n\nSo the rook teleported once, the queen teleported twice.\n\nThus, in this arrangement, the rook's total vuns are less than the queen's.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to arrange the numbers in such a way that the rook's path requires exactly one teleportation, and the queen's requires at least two.\n\nBut how to structure this.\n\nLet me think about the arrangement in the sample.\n\nLooking at the sample output:\n\nRow 0: 4 3 6 12\n\nRow 1:7 5 9 15\n\nRow 2:14 1 11 10\n\nRow 3:13 8 16 2\n\nWait, the 1 is at position (2,1). So the rook's path starts here.\n\nWait, the rook's path is 1 →3 →4 →6 →9 →5 →7 →13 →2 →8 →16 →11 →10 →12 →15 →14.\n\nWait, how does the rook move from 1 to 3? Oh, because 3 is in the same row, but perhaps it's the next minimal.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the rook's path is designed to force a teleportation at the end.\n\nWait, perhaps the idea is to arrange the numbers in such a way that the rook's movement can't proceed further without having to teleport, but the queen's movement can.\n\nHmm, perhaps for N≥2, it's possible to arrange the board such that the rook's path requires exactly one teleport, and the queen's path requires more.\n\nBut how to model this programmatically.\n\nAn alternative approach is to find a specific pattern or structure that satisfies the conditions for all N≥2.\n\nWait, considering the sample, perhaps the arrangement is such that the rook's path is constructed in a way that after visiting all the cells except one, it has to teleport, thus adding one vun. Meanwhile, the queen's path may require teleporting again to reach that last cell, adding another vun.\n\nSo, for the queen, the path might require teleporting twice: once when she's stuck in a part of the board with no further reachable cells, and again to reach the last cell.\n\nIn the sample, the queen's path is 1 →3 →4 →2 →5 →6 →9 →7 →13 →8 →11 →10 →12 →15 →14 →16. Wait, the teleportation happens when she is at 15, because from 15, she can't reach any unvisited cell except 14 and 16. Wait, no, because 14 is in the same row as 15, but perhaps already visited. Or maybe the queen can't reach 16 in one move from 15.\n\nWait, the queen is at 15. What's the next step? From 15, she can move in all directions. The next unvisited cell is 14 and 16.\n\nWait, 14 is in row 3, column 0. From 15, which is row 1, column 3. So the distance is 2 rows apart and same column? No, row 3, column 0 is not in the same row, column, or diagonal as 15 (row 1, column 3). So 14 is unreachable from 15. So the queen can't get to 14 directly.\n\nWait, then the queen's path is 1 →3 →4 →2 →5 →6 →9 →7 →13 →8 →11 →10 →12 →15 →(teleport) →14 →16. So that's one teleport.\n\nWait, but in the note, the queen pays 2 vuns. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the movement.\n\nWait, the note says the queen pays 1 vun when she teleports from 15 to 14, and another when she teleports from 14 to 16. So total of 2.\n\nHmm, but why would she have to teleport from 14 to 16? Because 14 is in row 3, column 0, and 16 is in row 3, column 3. The queen can move directly from 14 to 16 in a diagonal, but wait, 14 is in row 3, column 0, and 16 is row 3, column 3. So that's a diagonal of length 3, which is allowed. So from 14, she can reach 16 directly without teleporting. So why did she pay a second teleport?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the queen's path.\n\nLet me retrace the queen's steps:\n\nAfter 15, the queen is at 15. She can't move to any other unvisited cells except 14 and 16. So she must teleport. She chooses the minimal unvisited cell, which is 14. So she pays a vun, moving to 14.\n\nNow, from 14, she can move in all directions. The next unvisited cell is 16, which is in the same row (row 3) and same column as 14? No, 14 is column 0, 16 is column 3. So same row, different columns. So the queen can move from 14 to 16 in a straight horizontal line. So she can do that without teleporting. So why does she have to teleport again?\n\nWait, perhaps the queen's path is 1 →3 →4 →2 →5 →6 →9 →7 →13 →8 →11 →10 →12 →15 →14 →16. So from 15, she moves to 14 (teleport, 1 vun), then from 14 she can reach 16 directly, so no more teleportation. Thus, the queen pays only 1 vun.\n\nBut the note says she pays 2. So perhaps my understanding is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queen's movement from 14 is blocked. Wait, 14 is in row 3, column 0. 16 is in row 3, column 3. So the queen can move directly. So perhaps the queen's path is 1 →3 →4 →2 →5 →6 →9 →7 →13 →8 →11 →10 →12 →15 →14 →16. So only one teleport.\n\nHmm, maybe the note is wrong, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the movement.\n\nWell, perhaps the key is that for the queen, the movement is such that she can't reach 16 from 14 without teleportation because of some arrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the sample is correct, but I'm missing something.\n\nWell, regardless, the main point is to find a way to arrange the numbers so that the rook's total vuns are less than the queen's.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For N=1: output -1.\n\n- For N≥2: construct a board where the rook's path requires exactly one teleportation, and the queen's path requires more than one.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother idea: Arrange the board in a way that the rook can move through all cells in a single path without teleportation, but the queen cannot, thus requiring teleportation.\n\nWait, but for the rook, if all cells are connected via rows and columns, then it can visit all without teleportation.\n\nFor the queen, perhaps the arrangement is such that she has to make several jumps.\n\nWait, perhaps arrange the numbers in a way that for the rook, the path is a single snake-like traversal through the grid, covering all cells in the same row and column, thus avoiding teleportation.\n\nBut for the queen, the path requires her to teleport multiple times because she can't reach some cells without jumping.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to arrange the numbers in a way that the rook's path is a single row-major or column-major traversal, while the queen's path is forced to take multiple teleportations.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps arrange the numbers so that the rook's path is a single line, but the queen's path requires her to jump across the board multiple times.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: The problem requires that the rook's total vuns are strictly less than the queen's. So perhaps, the rook's path must have exactly one teleportation, and the queen's path must have at least two.\n\nSo, for N≥2, perhaps it's possible to arrange the numbers such that the rook's path requires exactly one teleportation, and the queen's requires at least two.\n\nSo, the question is, how to construct such a board.\n\nLet me think of the sample N=4. The rook teleports once. How about the queen? She teleports once as well. So perhaps that's not sufficient.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the rook's path is 1 →3 →4 →6 →9 →5 →7 →13 →2 →8 →16 →11 →10 →12 →15 →14. So from 15, she can't reach 14 or 16 without teleporting. So she teleports to 14 (1 vun), then from 14, she can reach 16 directly. So the queen's path is 1 →3 →4 →2 →5 →6 →9 →7 →13 →8 →11 →10 →12 →15 →14 →16. So only one teleport.\n\nWait, but the sample says the queen pays 2 vuns. So perhaps my analysis is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queen's path is different.\n\nWait, perhaps after 15, the queen can't reach any unvisited cells except 14 and 16. So she chooses the minimal, which is 14, paying a vun. Then, from 14, she can't reach 16 in one move because it's two squares away diagonally. Wait, no, 14 is at (3,0), 16 is at (3,3). So the queen can move right three squares, which is a straight line. So she can reach 16 directly, without teleporting.\n\nHmm, perhaps the sample's note is incorrect.\n\nWell, regardless, the main challenge is to find a way to arrange the numbers such that the rook's vuns are less than the queen's.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to arrange the board in a way that the rook can traverse all cells in a single path, requiring zero teleportations, but the queen can't and requires more.\n\nBut how.\n\nAnother approach: Since the rook can only move along rows and columns, perhaps arrange the numbers in a way that the rook's path is a single row-wise traversal, while the queen's path requires her to jump across multiple rows and columns, thus requiring more teleportations.\n\nAlternatively, think about the arrangement where the numbers form a grid where each row is filled with consecutive numbers, but the columns are not. This way, the rook can move through each row in order, but the queen may have to jump between rows more often.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to arrange the numbers in such a way that the rook's path is a single path through the grid, covering all cells without teleportation. Then, the queen's path would have to include some teleportations because she can't reach certain cells in one move.\n\nBut how to ensure that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps arrange the numbers in a way that the rook's path is a Hamiltonian path (visiting each cell exactly once), while the queen's path isn't, leading to more teleportations.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nHmm, perhaps for N≥2, the solution is to arrange the numbers in a way that the rook can traverse all cells in a single path, but the queen can't, thus requiring teleportations.\n\nSo, let's try to model this.\n\nThe rook's path is a Hamiltonian path, so no teleportation needed. The queen's path may require multiple teleportations because she can't follow the same path.\n\nWait, but if the rook's path is a Hamiltonian path, the queen's path might also be possible without teleportation, but perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the arrangement makes it impossible for the queen to reach some cells in one move, forcing her to teleport multiple times.\n\nBut how to create such an arrangement.\n\nAnother idea: Place the numbers in such a way that for the rook, each step can reach the next number in the same row or column, forming a continuous path. For the queen, this is not the case—some steps require jumps.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for even N, it's possible, but for odd N, it's not.\n\nBut the sample is N=4, which is even, and it works.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is possible for all N ≥ 2.\n\nBut how to construct it.\n\nHmm, perhaps the following approach can work:\n\nArrange the board in such a way that the rook's path is a single row-major traversal, visiting each cell in order. The queen's path, however, requires her to jump between rows more frequently, leading to more teleportations.\n\nAlternatively, arrange the numbers in a way that the rook can move through the grid in a way that each step is adjacent (in row or column), but the queen can't, thus requiring her to teleport.\n\nBut I'm stuck on the exact arrangement.\n\nPerhaps it's easier to think about the problem in terms of the required conditions for the rook's and queen's paths.\n\nFor the rook's vuns to be less than the queen's, the rook must have fewer teleportations. So, the rook's path must have fewer teleportations than the queen's.\n\nSo, perhaps the rook's path can be arranged to have exactly one teleportation, and the queen's path to have two or more.\n\nBut how to achieve that.\n\nWait, perhaps the arrangement is such that the rook's path is a single row-major traversal, but the queen's path requires her to make jumps across multiple rows and columns, leading to more teleportations.\n\nBut without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nSince the rook's movement is constrained to rows and columns, perhaps the optimal way to minimize teleportations is to arrange the numbers in such a way that the rook can move through each cell in a single path, without leaving any gaps that would require teleportation.\n\nThis suggests that the numbers should be arranged in a way that each cell in the rook's path is adjacent (in row or column) to the next.\n\nSo, the rook's path is a Hamiltonian path through the grid, moving to adjacent cells each time.\n\nIn this case, the rook doesn't need to teleport at all.\n\nThe queen's path, on the other hand, may require more teleportations because she can't follow the same path.\n\nBut I'm not sure. It depends on the arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queen's path can be arranged to require more teleportations.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nArrange the numbers in a way that the rook's path is a single row-major traversal, but the queen's path is forced to take a detour, requiring teleportations.\n\nFor example, the rook's path is:\n\n1 →2 →3 →... →N², all in a single row.\n\nBut the queen can't reach some cells in one move, so she has to teleport.\n\nBut how to make this happen.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps arrange the numbers in a way that the rook's path is a single row-major traversal, but the queen's path can't follow that because it's blocked by higher numbers in certain cells.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern that works for N≥2.\n\nWait, perhaps for even N, the solution is possible, but for N=1, it's not.\n\nSo, for N=2, perhaps it's possible.\n\nWait, let's try to construct a 2x2 grid.\n\nArrange the numbers as:\n\n1 4\n\n2 3\n\nSo the rook starts at 1. From 1, it can move to 2 (column down) or 4 (row right).\n\nWhich is smaller, 2 or 4? 2 is smaller, so the rook moves to 2.\n\nFrom 2, it can move to 3 (row right) or 1 (already visited). So it moves to 3.\n\nFrom 3, it can't move right or down, so it's done. Vuns=0.\n\nQueen's path:\n\nStarts at 1. Can move to 2,3,4. 2 is smallest, so moves to 2.\n\nFrom 2, can move to 3 (right) or 4 (diagonal). 3 is smaller, so moves to 3.\n\nFrom 3, can't move further except to 4. So she moves to 4.\n\nNo teleportation. So both pay 0, which is not allowed.\n\nThus, this arrangement doesn't work.\n\nAlternative arrangement for N=2:\n\n1 3\n\n4 2\n\nRook's path:\n\nStarts at 1. From here, it can move to 3 or 4. 3 is smaller, so moves to 3.\n\nFrom 3, can't move left (1 is visited), so moves down to 2.\n\nFrom 2, can't move further. Rook's path is 1→3→2. Vuns=0.\n\nQueen's path:\n\nStarts at 1. Can move to 3 or 4. 3 is smaller. So moves to 3.\n\nFrom 3, can move to 2 (down-right) or 4 (down-left). 2 is smaller. So moves to 2.\n\nFrom 2, can't move to 4 in one step because it's not in the same row, column, or diagonal. So she has to teleport to 4. Pays 1 vun.\n\nSo queen's vuns=1, rook's vuns=0. So rook pays less. So this arrangement works.\n\nSo, for N=2, it's possible.\n\nThus, the solution is possible for N≥2.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For N=1: output -1.\n\n- For N≥2: construct a board where the rook's path has 0 teleportations, and the queen's path has at least 1.\n\nWait, but in the above arrangement, the rook has 0, queen has 1. So the condition is satisfied.\n\nThus, for N=2, it's possible.\n\nSo, the general approach is to arrange the board such that the rook can traverse all cells without teleportation, but the queen has to teleport at least once.\n\nSo, how to construct such a board.\n\nThe key is to arrange the numbers so that the rook's path is a Hamiltonian path, while the queen's path is forced to have at least one teleportation.\n\nOne possible way is to arrange the numbers in a way that the rook's path forms a single row-major traversal, but the queen's path is blocked by higher numbers, forcing her to teleport.\n\nAlternatively, arrange the numbers such that the queen can't reach the next cell in one move, hence requiring a teleport.\n\nWait, in the N=2 example, the queen had to teleport once.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to arrange the board is such that the queen's path requires at least one teleportation.\n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\n- Create a grid where the rook can traverse all cells in a single path without teleportation.\n\n- Ensure that the queen's path requires at least one teleportation.\n\nTo achieve this, perhaps arrange the grid such that the queen's path is forced to have a 'dead end' where she can't move to any unvisited cells except via teleportation.\n\nThus, the key is to arrange the numbers in a way that the queen's path is blocked at certain points, requiring her to teleport.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAn alternative approach is to arrange the grid in a way that the rook's path is a single row-major or column-major traversal, and the queen's path is forced to have a 'knight's move' type situation where she can't reach the next cell in one move, thus requiring a teleport.\n\nBut how.\n\nPerhaps for even N, it's possible to arrange the grid in a way that the queen's path requires teleportation, while the rook's doesn't.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For N=1: output -1.\n\n- For N≥2: construct a grid where the rook's path is a single row-major traversal, and the queen's path requires at least one teleportation.\n\nHow to construct such a grid.\n\nLet me think of N=4.\n\nArrange the grid so that the rook's path is 1 →2 →3 →4 →5 →... →16, all in a single row-major order.\n\nBut for the queen, she may have to teleport once.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the rook's path is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps arrange the numbers in a way that the queen's path is forced to have a 'gap' that she can't bridge with a single move.\n\nFor example, place high numbers in positions that block the queen's path, forcing her to teleport.\n\nBut this is vague.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nArrange the grid such that the rook's path is a single row-major traversal, but the queen's path is forced to jump across the grid, leading to a teleport.\n\nFor example, in the N=2 case, the queen had to teleport once.\n\nThus, perhaps for any N≥2, the solution can be constructed by arranging the grid such that the rook's path is row-major, and the queen's path is forced to teleport once.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. For N=1: output -1.\n\n2. For N≥2:\n\n   a. Create a grid where the rook's path is a single row-major traversal.\n\n   b. Ensure that the queen's path requires at least one teleportation.\n\nSo, how to arrange the grid.\n\nPerhaps the grid can be filled in a way that the numbers increase to the right and downwards, but with certain breaks that force the queen to teleport.\n\nWait, perhaps arrange the grid in a way that the queen's path is forced to have a 'dead end' after a certain point, requiring a teleport.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's arrange the grid in such a way that the rook's path is a single row-major traversal, and the queen's path is forced to have a situation where she can't reach the next cell in one move, thus requiring a teleport.\n\nFor example, in a 4x4 grid:\n\n1  2  3  4\n\n5  6  7  8\n\n9 10 11 12\n\n13 14 15 16\n\nIn this arrangement, the rook's path is 1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8→9→10→11→12→13→14→15→16. No teleportation.\n\nThe queen's path would be 1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8→9→10→11→12→13→14→15→16. No teleportation. So vuns are equal.\n\nThus, this arrangement doesn't work.\n\nSo, the arrangement needs to be different.\n\nWait, perhaps arrange the grid such that the queen's path is forced to have a 'dead end' where she can't move to any unvisited cells except via teleportation.\n\nBut how.\n\nPerhaps arrange the grid such that the queen's path is forced to have a 'U-shaped' barrier, blocking her movement, thus requiring a teleport.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps arrange the grid such that the queen's path requires her to move in a way that after visiting certain cells, she can't reach the next cell in one move, thus requiring a teleport.\n\nFor example, place high numbers in positions that block the queen's path.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nPerhaps it's easier to construct the grid for N=2 and then generalize.\n\nIn the N=2 case, the grid was:\n\n1 3\n\n4 2\n\nRook's path: 1→3→2.\n\nQueen's path: 1→3→2→4 (teleporting once).\n\nSo, in this arrangement, the rook's path is a single row-major traversal (but actually, it's not; it's more like a U-shape), and the queen's path requires a teleport.\n\nThus, for N=2, the arrangement works.\n\nSo, perhaps for larger N, a similar approach can be taken: arrange the grid so that the rook's path is a single traversal that doesn't require teleportation, but the queen's path is forced to have at least one teleportation.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nPerhaps for even N, it's possible to arrange the grid in a way that the queen's path is forced to have at least one teleportation, while the rook's path doesn't.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For N=1: output -1.\n\n- For N≥2: construct the grid such that the rook's path is a single traversal (like row-major) without teleportation, and the queen's path requires at least one teleportation.\n\nBut how to construct this.\n\nAnother Idea: The rook's path can be constructed as a row-major order, but the queen's path is blocked by a 'wall' of higher numbers, forcing her to teleport once.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps arrange the grid such that the rook's path is a single snake-like traversal through the grid, while the queen's path is blocked by a wall, requiring a teleport.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to arrange the grid such that the rook's path is a single row-major traversal, and the queen's path is forced to have a 'dead end' where she can't reach the next cell in one move.\n\nBut how.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to think about the code structure.\n\nOnce I have the arrangement, I need to compute the rook's and queen's paths to count the vuns.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the solution is to arrange the grid in a way that for N≥2, it's possible, and construct the grid accordingly.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows:\n\n- If N == 1: print -1.\n\n- Else:\n\n   - Fill the grid in a specific pattern that ensures the rook's vuns are less than the queen's.\n\nBut the question is, what's the specific pattern.\n\nIn the sample N=4, the grid is arranged in a way that the rook's path requires one teleportation, and the queen's requires two.\n\nThus, perhaps the grid can be filled in a way that the rook's path is a single row-major traversal, and the queen's path is forced to have at least two teleportations.\n\nBut how.\n\nAnother Idea: Arrange the grid such that the rook's path is a single row-major traversal, and the queen's path is forced to have at least one teleportation.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows:\n\nFor N=2, the arrangement is:\n\n1 3\n\n4 2\n\nWhich works.\n\nFor N=4, perhaps a similar approach can be taken, creating a grid where the rook's path is a single row-major traversal, and the queen's path is forced to have at least one teleportation.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to arrange the grid in a way that the rook's path is a single row-major traversal, and the queen's path is forced to have a 'dead end' where she can't reach the next cell in one move.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps the best approach is to construct the grid in a way that for N≥2, it's possible, and output any valid arrangement.\n\nThus, the code will:\n\n- For N=1: output -1.\n\n- Else:\n\n   - Fill the grid with numbers arranged in such a way that the rook's path has fewer teleportations than the queen's.\n\nBut the exact arrangement is unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to arrange the grid in a way that the rook's path is a single row-major traversal, while the queen's path is forced to have a 'dead end' where she can't move to the next cell without teleporting.\n\nThus, for N≥2, the solution is possible.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nRead N.\n\nIf N=1:\n\n   Output -1.\n\nElse:\n\n   Create a grid filled in a way that the rook's path is a single row-major traversal.\n\n   Ensure that the queen's path requires at least one teleportation.\n\nThus, the code can construct the grid as follows:\n\nFor N=2:\n\n   [[1,3], [4,2]]\n\nFor N=4:\n\n   [[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8], [9,10,11,12], [13,14,15,16]]\n\nBut wait, in this arrangement, the queen's path would have 0 teleportations, same as the rook.\n\nThus, it's not acceptable.\n\nThus, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps arrange the grid in a way that the rook's path is a single row-major traversal, but the queen's path is forced to have a",
