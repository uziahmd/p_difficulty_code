She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a girl named Luba who has multiple tabs open in her browser and needs to close some of them as quickly as possible. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds she needs to spend to leave only a specific segment of tabs open.\n\nHmm. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, initially, she has n tabs open, numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position pos. She wants to keep the tabs from l to r inclusive. So, any tabs outside this range must be closed. The operations she can perform are moving the cursor left or right (but not beyond the currently open tabs), or closing all tabs to the left or right of the current position.\n\nEach operation takes one second. We need to calculate the minimal time to achieve the desired state.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. The key here is to figure out the optimal order of moving and closing to minimize the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to determine which tabs need to be closed. These are the ones outside [l, r]. So, any tab less than l or greater than r needs to be closed.\n\nWait, but closing isn't just one action. Each close operation can close a lot of tabs at once. For example, if I'm at position i and I close all to the left, that would close all tabs from a to i-1, where a is the current leftmost open tab. Similarly for the right.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Identify the necessary close operations: left or right.\n2. Determine the order in which to perform these operations and the movements required to reach the positions where the closes are most efficient.\n\nBut wait, sometimes you might not need to do both. Like, if all the tabs to the left are already within l, then no need to close anything on the left.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial state includes all tabs. So, any tabs before l must be closed, and any after r must be closed.\n\nSo, for example, if l is 2 and r is 4, we need to close tabs 1, 5,6,...n if n>4.\n\nSo, the first thing is to check whether the current position is within [l, r]. Because if it's not, she may have to move the cursor into that range before closing.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial position is pos. So, perhaps she needs to move to a certain point to perform the close.\n\nBut let's think about the steps needed.\n\nCase 1: The current position is outside the target segment [l, r].\n\nIn this case, she needs to move to either l or r, then close the necessary sides.\n\nBut maybe she can choose the optimal path.\n\nWait, but the movement is constrained by the current open tabs. So, when moving, she can't go beyond the current a or b, which are the min and max of open tabs.\n\nHmm, that complicates things because the available moves change as she closes tabs.\n\nWait, but in the initial state, a is 1 and b is n. So, she can move freely until she starts closing.\n\nSo, to model this, perhaps the process is:\n\n- Move the cursor to a position where she can close the necessary tabs on the left and/or right.\n\n- Then perform the close operations.\n\n- The order of moving and closing affects the total time.\n\nSo, the main idea is to find the optimal points to close and the optimal way to get there, considering the time taken for each step.\n\nLet me break it down.\n\nFirst, determine which parts need to be closed.\n\nLeft part: if there are any tabs to the left of l that need to be closed. So, if l > 1, then yes.\n\nRight part: if there are any tabs to the right of r that need to be closed. So, if r < n, then yes.\n\nSo, we'll have two booleans: left_close = (l > 1), right_close = (r < n).\n\nIf neither is true, then no steps needed; output is 0.\n\nOtherwise, we need to calculate the steps.\n\nNow, the steps involve moving to certain positions and performing the close operations.\n\nLet's consider different scenarios based on the initial position.\n\nLet me outline the approach:\n\n1. Check if no tabs need to be closed. If so, return 0.\n\n2. Else, compute the steps required for each possible scenario.\n\nBut the scenarios can vary based on whether we need to close left, right, both, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model it as follows:\n\nWe need to decide the order of closing left and right.\n\nFor example, she could:\n\na) Close left first, then right.\n\nb) Close right first, then left.\n\nc) Close one side without needing to move, and the other requires moving.\n\nBut the order may affect the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves calculating the optimal sequence of movements and tab closures to achieve the desired state efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Necessary Closures**: Determine if tabs need to be closed on the left (if l > 1) and/or on the right (if r < n).\n2. **Check for No Closures Needed**: If no tabs need to be closed (i.e., l is 1 and r is n), return 0 as no actions are required.\n3. **Calculate Movements and Closures**:\n   - **Close Left First**: Move to position l, close left tabs, then move to r and close right tabs.\n   - **Close Right First**: Move to position r, close right tabs, then move to l and close left tabs.\n   - **Optimal Order Without Movement**: If the cursor is already within [l, r], simply close the necessary sides without additional movements.\n4. **Compute Time**: Sum the time taken for each movement and closure operation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nleft_close = l > 1\nright_close = r < n\n\nif not left_close and not right_close:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    steps = 0\n\n    current_pos = pos\n    if left_close:\n        # Move to l, close left\n        move_steps = abs(current_pos - l)\n        steps += move_steps\n        steps += 1  # close left\n        current_pos = l\n\n    if right_close:\n        # After closing left, move to r, close right\n        move_steps = abs(current_pos - r)\n        steps += move_steps\n        steps += 1  # close right\n\n    # Alternatively, if right_close is done first\n    if right_close:\n        # Move to r, close right\n        move_steps = abs(pos - r)\n        steps += move_steps + 1\n        current_pos = r\n\n        if left_close:\n            move_steps = abs(current_pos - l)\n            steps += move_steps + 1\n\n    # Or if neither order is better, compute the minimal path\n    min_steps = float('inf')\n    # Case 1: Close left first\n    temp_steps = 0\n    if left_close:\n        temp_steps += abs(pos - l) + 1  # move to l and close\n        if right_close:\n            temp_steps += abs(l - r) + 1  # move to r and close\n    # Case 2: Close right first\n    temp_steps_right = 0\n    if right_close:\n        temp_steps_right += abs(pos - r) + 1  # move to r and close\n        if left_close:\n            temp_steps_right += abs(r - l) + 1  # move to l and close\n    min_steps = min(temp_steps, temp_steps_right)\n\n    print(min_steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution calculates the minimum number of seconds required by considering two main scenarios: closing the left tabs first or closing the right tabs first. It computes the total steps for both scenarios and selects the one with the fewer steps. This approach ensures that we account for the optimal movement and closure sequence to minimize the total time spent.",
