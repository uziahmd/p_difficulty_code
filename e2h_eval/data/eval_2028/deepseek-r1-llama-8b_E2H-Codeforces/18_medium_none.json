The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Frog Jumping.\" Hmm. Let me read the description carefully.\n\nThe frog starts at position 0 on a number line. It can jump either +a or -b each time. So from position k, it can go to k+a or k-b. Wait, but the frog can't jump outside the interval [0, x] for any x that we're considering. For each x, f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach without leaving that interval. Then, given m, we need to compute the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to m.\n\nHmm. So for each i in 0..m, calculate how many reachable positions there are within [0, i], and sum all those counts.\n\nThe challenge is to compute this efficiently because m can be up to 1e9, which means any O(m) approach would be way too slow.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem.\n\nFirst, let's model the reachable positions. The frog can make jumps of +a and -b. But since it's starting at 0, each move can be thought of as adding a certain number of steps. Wait, but the frog can choose between two options at each step. So the reachable positions form some kind of set based on the possible linear combinations of a and b.\n\nWait, the key here might be to find the minimal and maximal positions that the frog can reach without exceeding x. Because for a given x, the frog can't go beyond x, but also can't go below 0.\n\nSo for each x, the frog can reach certain positions. The function f(x) counts how many such positions there are.\n\nBut calculating f(x) for every x up to m is expensive. We need a way to find a pattern or formula that allows us to compute the sum without iterating through each x.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Since each jump is a fixed step forward or backward, the reachable positions are determined by the linear combinations of a and b. So perhaps the problem reduces to finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b.\n\nWait, the set of reachable positions is the same as the set of numbers that can be written as (k * a - l * b), where k and l are non-negative integers, right? Because each +a is like adding a step, and each -b is subtracting a step.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the frog can choose to add a or subtract b at each step. So the total displacement after n steps is something like (n_a * a) - (n_b * b), where n_a is the number of times a was chosen, and n_b is the number of times b was subtracted. But n_a and n_b can vary as long as the total number of steps is n = n_a + n_b.\n\nWait, but the initial position is 0, and each step is a choice between +a or -b. So the reachable positions are all integers of the form s*a - t*b, where s and t are non-negative integers, and s + t is the number of steps taken. But wait, that's not quite right because each step is either a +a or a -b. So the total displacement after s steps is s*a minus the sum of b's added when choosing the -b option. Hmm, maybe I should model the reachable positions as a graph, where each node is a position, and edges represent the possible jumps. Then, f(x) is the number of nodes reachable from 0 without leaving [0, x].\n\nBut with m up to 1e9, we can't process each x individually. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable positions form an arithmetic progression once they start moving beyond a certain point. Or maybe they form multiple intervals, which can be handled in bulk.\n\nLet me consider the case where a and b are coprime. Then, according to the coin problem, the largest non-reachable number is a*b - a - b, but that's when you're only allowed to take positive steps. Not sure if that applies here.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find the minimal and maximal steps the frog can take without going beyond x. Once the frog can reach beyond x, the count changes.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the problem differently. For each x, f(x) is the number of reachable positions in [0, x]. Let's find when adding a new x increases the count by 1 or more.\n\nWait, for x=0: the frog can't make any jumps, so f(0)=1.\n\nFor x=1: if a is larger than 1, then even a single a jump would take the frog to a>1, which is outside the interval. So the frog can't move, so f(1)=1.\n\nIf a is 1, then the frog can jump to 1, but if x is 1, then yes, it can.\n\nWait, no, because for x=1, the frog can't jump beyond 1. So from 0, it can choose to jump +a (if 0+a <=x) or -b (which would take it to negative, which is less than 0, so it's invalid). So for x=1, if a is 1, then f(1) is 2: 0 and 1.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nInput was 7 5 3.\n\nLooking at the sample input, for x=5, f(5)=3. Let's see why.\n\nThe frog can reach 0,5 (via one a step), and also 0,5-3=2, then from 2, can it reach more points?\n\nWait, but the frog cannot jump beyond x=5. So from 0, it can jump to 5. From 5, it can't jump further because 5+5=10>5. So the frog can't jump back. Wait, no: from 5, it can choose to subtract b=3, which would take it to 2, which is within 0..5. So the positions are 0,5,2. That's three positions. So f(5)=3.\n\nHmm. So for each x, the reachable positions are those that can be reached via a series of a and -b steps, but without ever going above x or below 0.\n\nThis seems like a BFS problem, but again, with x up to 1e9, it's not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: find the earliest x where the reachable positions start to increase in a particular pattern. For example, after a certain x, each new x adds a fixed number of new positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the reachable positions form a periodic pattern once the frog has passed a certain threshold. Like, after some point, each step adds a certain number of new positions.\n\nWait, another idea: for each x, the maximum reachable position is min(k*a, x), where k is the number of a steps taken. But since the frog can also take steps back, perhaps the reachable positions are all the numbers that are congruent to 0 mod d, where d is the gcd(a, b).\n\nWait, because a and b have a greatest common divisor d. So any reachable position must be a multiple of d. Because a = d * a', b = d * b', and a' and b' are coprime. So any position is k*a - l*b = d*(k a' - l b'), which is divisible by d.\n\nSo the reachable positions are multiples of d. That's a key insight. So for any x, the reachable positions are the multiples of d up to x, but possibly not all of them.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, in the first sample, a=5, b=3. d is 1. So all positions are reachable, but due to the constraints of not going beyond x.\n\nWait, but wait: 5 and 3 are coprime. So the frog can reach any integer once x is large enough. But in the sample, for x=5, the reachable positions are 0,5,2. So how does that fit into the multiples of 1?\n\nAh, but perhaps the frog can reach all integers beyond a certain point, but for lower x, it's limited.\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b). All reachable positions are multiples of d.\n\n2. For each x, the reachable positions are all the multiples of d up to x, but also subject to being reachable via a and -b steps.\n\nWait, but that might not capture all cases. For example, if d is 1, then the frog can reach all integers, but for x >= some value. But for smaller x, it's limited.\n\nSo perhaps for x >= max_pos, the reachable positions are all multiples of d up to x, so f(x) is x//d + 1 (since 0 is included). But before that, f(x) may be less.\n\nWait, but how do I find the point where the reachable positions start to include all multiples of d up to x?\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: the frog can reach any multiple of d, provided that x is large enough. So the problem reduces to determining for each x, how many multiples of d are <=x and can be reached via the frog's jumps.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think with the sample.\n\nSample 1: a=5, b=3, d=1.\n\nAt x=5, reachable positions are 0,2,5.\n\nWait, but 1,3,4 are not reachable. So even though d=1, not all multiples of 1 are reachable.\n\nSo my earlier assumption is incorrect. So the fact that d divides the position doesn't automatically mean it's reachable.\n\nHmm, so that complicates things.\n\nSo the problem is not just about the multiples of d, but about which multiples can be achieved through the allowed jumps.\n\nWait, but the allowed jumps are adding a or subtracting b, which are both multiples of d. So any position reachable will indeed be a multiple of d.\n\nSo the reachable positions are exactly the multiples of d that can be expressed as s*a - t*b, where s and t are non-negative integers, and the position is within [0, x].\n\nSo the question becomes: for each x, how many such multiples of d are present in [0, x], and can be expressed as s*a - t*b with s,t >=0, and the intermediate steps don't exceed x.\n\nWait, but how to model this.\n\nPerhaps, for each x, the reachable positions are the numbers in the set {k | k mod d == 0, 0 <= k <=x} that can be expressed as s*a - t*b, with s and t such that all intermediate positions (after each step) are within [0, x].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the frog's movement as a state, and for each x, track the reachable positions.\n\nBut again, for x up to 1e9, that's impossible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the reachable positions form a certain pattern. Like, for x >= some value, the reachable positions are all multiples of d up to x. So f(x) would be (x//d) + 1.\n\nBut in the sample, when x=5, d=1, but f(5) is 3, which is less than 5+1=6. So that suggests that the reachable positions are not all multiples until x is sufficiently large.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to find the minimal x where all multiples of d up to x are reachable.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the point where the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. Beyond that, each additional x adds one more multiple.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each x, the reachable positions are all the numbers of the form k*d, where k is in some range, and the frog can reach them.\n\nBut the problem is that the frog's movement is constrained by the steps it takes, and thus certain multiples may not be reachable.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be broken down into two parts:\n\n1. Find the minimal x where all multiples of d up to x are reachable. Let's call this x_max_reachable.\n\n2. For x >= x_max_reachable, f(x) increases by 1 for each increment of x. So the sum from x_max_reachable to m would be (m - x_max_reachable) * (f(x_max_reachable) + ... ? No, wait, f(x) for x >= x_max_reachable is x//d + 1. So the sum from x_max_reachable to m is (sum_{x = x_max_reachable}^m (x//d + 1)).\n\nBut for x < x_max_reachable, f(x) can be computed separately.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute d = gcd(a, b).\n\n- Compute x_max_reachable, the smallest x where all multiples of d up to x are reachable.\n\n- For x < x_max_reachable: compute f(x) for each x.\n\n- For x >= x_max_reachable: f(x) is (x//d + 1). So the sum from x_max_reachable to m is the sum of (x//d + 1) for x from x_max_reachable to m.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute d.\n\n2. Find x_max_reachable.\n\n3. For x < x_max_reachable: compute f(x), which depends on how many reachable positions there are for each x.\n\n4. Sum all f(x) from x=0 to m.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute x_max_reachable and the sum for x < x_max_reachable.\n\nFirst, let's tackle x_max_reachable.\n\nWhat is x_max_reachable?\n\nIt's the smallest x such that all multiples of d up to x are reachable.\n\nWait, no. Because for x= x_max_reachable, adding a multiple of d would allow the frog to reach all lower multiples.\n\nWait, perhaps x_max_reachable is the smallest x such that x is equal to s*a - t*b for some s and t, and x is the maximum of the reachable positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x_max_reachable is the minimal x such that all reachable positions up to x are multiples of d, and beyond that, adding a step a or subtracting b won't take the frog out of the [0, x] interval.\n\nWait, perhaps x_max_reachable is the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and from x, adding a would take it beyond x, so the next step would have to be subtracting b. And so on, until it can't go further.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to model x_max_reachable as the point where the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x_max_reachable is the minimal x such that x is reachable, and from x, the frog can't reach any higher x without jumping beyond x.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because the frog can still make jumps that bring it back to lower positions.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me try to think of the sample.\n\nIn the first sample, a=5, b=3, d=1.\n\nx_max_reachable would be the point beyond which all multiples of 1 (i.e., all integers) are reachable.\n\nBut in the sample, f(7) is 8, which is 7//1 +1=8. So yes, for x=7, f(x) equals (x//d +1). So x_max_reachable is 5, because for x=5, f(x) is 3, which is less than 5+1=6.\n\nWait, no, because for x=5, the frog can reach 0,2,5. So 3 positions. So x_max_reachable is higher than 5.\n\nWait, perhaps x_max_reachable is the point where the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x.\n\nIn the sample, when x=7, f(7)=8, which is 7+1. So x_max_reachable is 7.\n\nWait, but how to find x_max_reachable for general a and b.\n\nAnother approach: the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x.\n\nBut perhaps x_max_reachable is the maximum between a and b, or some other function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x_max_reachable is the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and from x, adding a would take it beyond x, but subtracting b would take it to a position that is already covered.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and all positions beyond x can be reached by adding a steps, but that doesn't seem to fit the sample.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a mathematical pattern.\n\nLet me think about the positions that the frog can reach. They form a set S. For each x, f(x) is the size of S ∩ [0, x].\n\nThe sum we need is the sum of |S ∩ [0, x]| for x from 0 to m.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing the size of S ∩ [0, x] for each x, then summing these sizes.\n\nBut how to find the sum efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps S is a union of several arithmetic progressions, and for x beyond a certain point, the size is (x/d +1). So the sum can be divided into two parts: x up to x_max_reachable, and x beyond that.\n\nSo the first step is to determine x_max_reachable: the minimal x where the set S contains all multiples of d up to x. Then, for x >= x_max_reachable, f(x) is (x/d +1), and for x < x_max_reachable, f(x) is the count of elements in S up to x.\n\nBut how to find x_max_reachable.\n\nWait, perhaps x_max_reachable is the minimal x such that the frog can reach x, and x is reachable via a sequence of a and -b steps, and x is the maximum position the frog can reach before being forced to stay within [0, x].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x_max_reachable is the point where the frog can reach x, and the next step would take it beyond x.\n\nWait, perhaps x_max_reachable is the maximum of the reachable positions, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x_max_reachable is the minimal x such that the frog can reach x and from x, adding a would take it beyond x. So, the frog can't go further than x, but can still subtract b to get to x - b, which is still within x.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I should find the minimal x such that all multiples of d up to x are in S.\n\nWait, in the first sample, x_max_reachable is 7, as for x=7, f(x) is 8, which is 7+1=8.\n\nSo, for x>=7, f(x) is x+1.\n\nSo, in this case, x_max_reachable is 7.\n\nHow to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x_max_reachable is the minimal x such that x >= a and x >= b, but that doesn't hold for the sample.\n\nWait, in the sample, a=5, b=3. So a >b. So x_max_reachable is 5 +3 =8? No, because the sample's x_max_reachable is 7.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and from x, the next step (a) would take it beyond x, but subtracting b would take it to a position that's already in S.\n\nWait, in the sample, x=5: from 5, adding a would take it to 10, which is beyond x=5. Subtracting b would take it to 2, which is within [0,5], and 2 is already in S.\n\nSo, perhaps x_max_reachable is the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and the next step (a) is beyond x, but the previous steps allow the frog to reach all multiples up to x.\n\nSo, how to model this.\n\nLet me think about the condition for x to be x_max_reachable.\n\nAfter reaching x, adding a would take the frog to x+a, which is beyond x. So, the frog can't proceed further. However, subtracting b may allow the frog to reach new positions.\n\nWait, but in the sample, x=5, subtracting b (3) gives 2, which is within x. So, the frog can reach 2 from 5, but 2 is already in S.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother angle: the set S is the reachable positions. The frog can reach any position in S by making a series of a and -b steps. So, S is the set of all numbers that can be written as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and all intermediate steps are within [0, x].\n\nWait, but the intermediate steps are not considered; the frog can jump directly from any position to any other position as long as the path exists. But for the purposes of f(x), the frog can reach a position regardless of the path, as long as it's in [0, x].\n\nWait, perhaps S is the set of all positions reachable via any number of a and -b steps, and the order of steps doesn't matter. So S is the additive subgroup generated by a and -b, modulo d.\n\nWait, since a and b are multiples of d, any position in S is a multiple of d. So S is a subset of the multiples of d.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding all the multiples of d that can be expressed as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the resulting position is in [0, x].\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the set S forms an arithmetic progression with difference d, but perhaps with certain steps missing.\n\nWait, but I'm not making progress.\n\nLet me think about the sum we need to compute. It's the sum of f(x) for x from 0 to m.\n\nIf I can find the x where f(x) changes its behavior, I can split the sum into two parts: x < x_max_reachable and x >= x_max_reachable.\n\nBut how to compute x_max_reachable.\n\nAnother idea: x_max_reachable is the maximum of a and b, or the minimal x where the frog can reach x and from x, the next step (a or b) can't be taken without exceeding x.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x_max_reachable is the minimal x such that x >= a and x >= b, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps x_max_reachable is the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and from x, any further a steps would take it beyond x. So, the frog can't reach any x higher than that within the [0, x] interval.\n\nWait, but the frog can also subtract b from x, which may bring it back into the interval.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x_max_reachable is the minimal x such that x is reachable, and x +a > x. Which is always true, so that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe the sum can be calculated by considering the minimal x where the reachable positions form a complete residue system modulo d. Then, for x >= that point, the count is (x//d + 1).\n\nSo, for each x, f(x) is the number of reachable positions in [0, x], which are the multiples of d up to x that are in S.\n\nSo, to compute f(x), we need to count how many multiples of d up to x are in S.\n\nBut S is the set of positions reachable via a and -b steps.\n\nWait, perhaps S is the set of all numbers that can be written as s*a - t*b, where s and t are non-negative integers, and the position is >=0.\n\nBut how to model S.\n\nWait, considering the frog's movement as a graph, each position is connected to position +a and position -b, provided that the new position is within [0, x].\n\nBut again, for large x, this isn't feasible.\n\nAnother approach: the reachable positions can be found using BFS, but with pruning for positions beyond x. However, for each x, this is O(x), which is impossible for x up to 1e9.\n\nThus, I need a mathematical approach.\n\nLet me think about the minimal reachable positions.\n\nEach reachable position can be represented as a linear combination of a and b: pos = k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and pos >=0.\n\nWe can model this as pos = d*(k*a' - l*b'), where d is the gcd of a and b.\n\nSince a' and b' are coprime, any pos in S must satisfy pos = d * m, where m can be any integer that can be expressed as m = k*a' - l*b'.\n\nBut since a' and b' are coprime, the set of m is all integers, because by the coin problem, any integer greater than or equal to (a' * b' - a' - b') can be expressed as a combination of a' and -b'. But for small m, it's not guaranteed.\n\nWait, but for the frog, each step is either adding a or subtracting b. So the frog can reach any m >= 0 if a' and b' are coprime. Is that correct?\n\nNo, because for example, a'=3, b'=5. Then, the frog can't reach 1, because 3*1 -5*0=3, 3*0 -5*1=-5 (invalid), etc. So 1 is not reachable.\n\nWait, but 3 and 5 are coprime, but 1 is not reachable. So my earlier assumption is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so the reachable m's are those that can be expressed as m = k * a' - l * b', where k and l are non-negative integers, and m >=0.\n\nWait, perhaps the set S is the set of all m >=0 that can be written as m = (k * a' - l * b') * d, where k and l are non-negative integers, and m >=0.\n\nSo, for the problem, the reachable positions are exactly the multiples of d that can be expressed as such.\n\nThus, for each x, f(x) is the number of such m*d that are <=x.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting, for each x, the number of such m*d <=x, which are reachable via the frog's jumps.\n\nBut how to model the reachable m's.\n\nLet me think of the reachable m's as the ones that can be expressed as m = k*a' - l*b', where k and l are non-negative integers, and m >=0.\n\nBut since a' and b' are coprime, perhaps the reachable m's form a certain pattern.\n\nWait, for a' and b' coprime, the minimal m is 0, which is achieved by k=0, l=0.\n\nThen, the next reachable m is a', then a' - b', but that's negative, so not allowed. So perhaps the next is a' + a' = 2a', then 2a' - b', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the reachable m's are all non-negative integers, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's take a' = 2, b' =3.\n\nThen, the possible m's are:\n\n0 (k=0, l=0)\n\n2 (k=1, l=0)\n\n2 -3= -1 (invalid)\n\n2+2=4 (k=2, l=0)\n\n4-3=1 (k=2, l=1)\n\n1 is valid.\n\nSo now, the reachable m's are 0,2,4,1.\n\nWait, but 3 is missing.\n\nWait, can I reach 3?\n\nYes, if I take k=3, l=0: 3*2=6. Or is that the case?\n\nWait, no, because 3*2=6, which is 3*2 -0*3=6. So m=6 is reachable.\n\nBut wait, that's not helpful.\n\nHmm, perhaps the reachable m's are all non-negative integers, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable m's form a set where m can be written as a linear combination of a' and b' with non-negative coefficients, but I'm not certain.\n\nThis is getting too abstract. Maybe I should try to find a way to model the reachable m's.\n\nLet me consider the reachable m's as a state space. Each m can transition to m + a' (since adding a step of a) or m - b' (subtracting a step of b).\n\nBut since m must be >=0, m -b' is only allowed if m >=b'.\n\nSo, the reachable m's form a directed graph where edges are from m to m+a' and m-b' (if possible).\n\nThe initial state is 0.\n\nThe problem is to find all m that are reachable from 0, considering all possible steps.\n\nBut for a' and b' coprime, is the entire set of non-negative integers reachable?\n\nIn the earlier example where a'=2, b'=3: 0,2,4,1, etc. Can I reach all non-negative integers?\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom 0, I can go to 2.\n\nFrom 2, I can go to 4 (2+2) or -1 (invalid).\n\nFrom 4, I can go to 6 or 1 (4-3).\n\nFrom 1, I can go to 3 (1+2) or -2 (invalid).\n\nSo yes, 3 is reachable.\n\nSimilarly, from 3, I can go to 5 (3+2) or 0 (3-3).\n\nFrom 5, I can go to 7 or 2.\n\nSo, it seems that for a'=2, b'=3, all non-negative integers are reachable.\n\nIs this always the case when a' and b' are coprime?\n\nYes! Because a' and b' are coprime, their linear combinations (with non-negative coefficients) can generate all non-negative integers beyond a certain point.\n\nWait, but the frog can only perform a finite number of steps. So for the problem, the frog can reach any non-negative integer m via some steps.\n\nWait, no, because the frog can't perform infinite steps. For example, to reach m=1, the frog needs to make a step that subtracts b' from a previous position.\n\nBut in the case of a'=2, b'=3, the frog can reach 1.\n\nSo perhaps, for a' and b' coprime, the reachable m's are all non-negative integers.\n\nIf that's the case, then for the problem, all multiples of d are reachable. Thus, for any x, f(x) is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut in the sample, for x=5, f(x) is 3, which is 5/1 +1=6. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, this suggests that my assumption is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the reachable m's are not all non-negative integers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier reasoning. Let's re-examine.\n\nThe frog can make any number of steps, each step being +a or -b. So the frog can choose any combination of steps, as long as the position remains non-negative.\n\nBut perhaps the reachable m's are all non-negative integers, but for the problem, the frog is constrained by x.\n\nWait, but in the sample, a=5, b=3, d=1. So for x=5, the reachable positions are 0,5,2. Which are 3 positions, but 5/1 +1=6.\n\nSo why aren't all 6 positions reachable?\n\nBecause the frog can't reach 1, 3,4.\n\nHmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier logic, the frog should be able to reach any non-negative integer because a' and b' are coprime.\n\nBut in the sample, it's not possible.\n\nSo perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can't reach all m's, even when a' and b' are coprime.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is more complex.\n\nAn alternative idea: the frog can reach any m >= c, where c is some minimal value. So for x >=c, f(x) is (x//d +1), but for x <c, f(x) is less.\n\nSo, to find c, which is the minimal m such that all m' >=c are reachable.\n\nBut how to find c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal c is the Frobenius number, which is a*b -a -b, but that's when you're only allowed to take positive steps, which is not the case here.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the frog can choose to take negative steps (as in, subtracting b), which complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the reachable m's are all m >=0, but the frog can't reach some m's because of the constraints on the steps.\n\nWait, but that doesn't align with the sample.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps the reachable positions are those that can be written as (k*a + l*(-b)) = k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the position is >=0.\n\nBut that's the same as saying it's a linear combination with non-negative coefficients.\n\nSo, the problem is to find all such m's.\n\nBut for a' and b' coprime, the set of m's that can be expressed as k*a' - l*b' is all integers, but in the context of the frog, since m must be >=0, perhaps the reachable m's are all non-negative integers.\n\nBut in the sample, that's not the case.\n\nSo perhaps the initial analysis is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can reach any non-negative integer m, but in the sample, the frog can't reach 1,3,4 because it's limited by the x.\n\nSo for x=5, the frog can reach 0,2,5. So f(5)=3.\n\nBut according to the earlier logic, the frog should be able to reach 1.\n\nWait, how can the frog reach 1?\n\nIt would require a series of steps that results in m=1.\n\nLike, for a=5, b=3: 1 =5*k -3*l.\n\nLooking for non-negative integers k and l.\n\nk=1, l= (5-1)/3= (4)/3 → not integer.\n\nk=2: 10 -3l=1 → l=3 → yes.\n\nSo, 2 steps of a (total +10) and 3 steps of -b (total -9): 10-9=1.\n\nSo the frog can reach 1.\n\nBut in the sample, for x=5, the frog can't reach 1 because when trying to reach 1, it would have to make steps that go beyond x=5.\n\nWait, no. Because the frog can make any sequence of steps, regardless of order, as long as the final position is within x.\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can reach 1 in a way that doesn't exceed x=5.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nStart at 0.\n\nCan the frog reach 1 without ever exceeding x=5?\n\nOne possible path:\n\n0 → 0 +5=5 (still within x=5).\n\n5 →5 -3=2.\n\n2 →2 +5=7 (exceeds x=5, so invalid).\n\nWait, no, because that would take the frog beyond x=5.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n0 →0 +5=5.\n\n5 →5 -3=2.\n\n2 →2 -3= -1 (invalid).\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 0 →5 →2 →5 again.\n\nBut 5 is already visited.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to reach 1?\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, because from 0, the frog can only reach 5 or -3 (invalid). From 5, it can reach 10 (invalid) or 2.\n\nFrom 2, it can reach 7 (invalid) or -1 (invalid).\n\nSo, no way to reach 1 within x=5.\n\nAh, that explains why in the sample, 1 is not reachable for x=5.\n\nSo the frog can't reach 1 for x=5.\n\nSo my earlier assumption that all m's are reachable is incorrect.\n\nThus, the reachable positions depend on the specific steps and x.\n\nSo, how to model this.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think of the reachable positions as a graph, where each node is a position, and edges are a and -b steps.\n\nBut for x up to 1e9, this isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: The reachable positions can be determined by the following conditions:\n\n- The position is a multiple of d.\n\n- The position is reachable via some combination of a and -b steps.\n\nAdditionally, during the steps, the frog never goes beyond x.\n\nWait, but this brings us back to the original problem.\n\nAnother Idea: The minimal x_max_reachable is the minimal x such that the frog can reach x, and from x, adding a would take it beyond x, but subtracting b would take it to a position that's already been visited.\n\nWait, but in the sample, x=5, and subtracting b takes it to 2, which is already reachable.\n\nThus, x=5 is x_max_reachable because beyond x=5, adding a would take it to 10, which is beyond x=5. So the frog can't reach any higher positions without exceeding x.\n\nWait, but for x=5, the frog can reach 5, but not 1. So perhaps x_max_reachable is not the point where all multiples are reachable, but rather the point where further a steps can't be taken without exceeding x.\n\nThus, for x >= x_max_reachable, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no. In the sample,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the sum of the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line, starting from position 0, for each integer from 0 to m. The frog can jump either forward by a units or backward by b units without jumping outside the interval [0, x].\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog's reachable positions are determined by the linear combinations of `a` and `b`. Since the frog can both jump forward and backward, the positions it can reach form a set that can be analyzed using number theory.\n\n2. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: The key insight is that the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the GCD of `a` and `b`. This is because any reachable position can be expressed as a linear combination of `a` and `b`, scaled by their GCD.\n\n3. **Reachable Intervals**: For each position `x`, the number of reachable positions within [0, x] can be determined by how many multiples of the GCD fit into this interval. Beyond a certain point, all such multiples will be reachable, and the count will simply be the number of these multiples.\n\n4. **Summing Reachable Counts**: We need to compute the sum of reachable positions for each `x` from 0 to m. This involves two parts:\n   - Positions where not all multiples of the GCD are reachable.\n   - Positions where all multiples of the GCD are reachable, allowing us to sum these efficiently using arithmetic series.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    m, a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    # Find the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x\n    x_max_reachable = 0\n    # Compute the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and adding a would take it beyond x\n    # Also, from x, the frog can't reach x + a, but can reach x - b if x >= b\n    # So x_max_reachable is the maximum of a, b, or some other function\n    # Alternatively, find the minimal x such that the frog can reach x and x is the maximal reachable position before exceeding x on the next a step\n    # This is a bit tricky, so perhaps compute it as the minimal x where the frog can reach x and x is reachable via a path that doesn't go beyond x\n    \n    # Another approach: x_max_reachable is the minimal x such that the frog can reach x, and from x, adding a would take it beyond x\n    # So the frog can't make any further jumps beyond x, but can still subtract b to reach lower positions.\n    \n    # To compute x_max_reachable, we can simulate the steps until we find the point where adding a would take the frog beyond x_max_reachable.\n    # However, for large a and b, this may not be feasible.
