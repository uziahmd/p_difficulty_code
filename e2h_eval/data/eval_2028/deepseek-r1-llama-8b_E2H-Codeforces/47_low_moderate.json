During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.Neko has two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the least common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Neko does Maths\" and the task involves finding a non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple (LCM) of a+k and b+k is as small as possible. If there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest one.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, the problem gives two integers a and b. We need to find k ≥ 0 such that LCM(a + k, b + k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest k.\n\nWait, how do I model this? Let's see. Since a and b are given, adding k to both shifts them by the same amount. So, the difference between a +k and b +k remains the same as the original difference between a and b. Let me denote d = |a - b|. So, if a > b, then after adding k, a +k is larger than b +k by d.\n\nWait, right! Because a + k and b +k differ by d. So, the two numbers are d apart. That's an important observation because the LCM of two numbers can be related to their greatest common divisor (GCD). Remember that LCM(x, y) = x*y / GCD(x, y).\n\nSo, in this case, since the two numbers are d apart, let's say x = b + k and y = x + d. Then, LCM(x, x + d) is what we're trying to minimize.\n\nHmm, okay. So for each possible x, which would be b +k, the LCM of x and x +d is (x*(x+d)) / g, where g is the GCD of x and x+d.\n\nBut wait, x and x+d have a GCD of g. Let's denote g = GCD(x, x +d). Since x and x +d differ by d, the GCD of x and x +d must divide d. So, g is a divisor of d.\n\nThat's a key point. So, the maximum possible value of g is the largest divisor of d that divides both x and x +d. But since x is variable, perhaps the optimal g is the largest possible, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, but the LCM depends on x and x+d. Since x and x +d are d apart, their GCD is g, which must divide d. So, any possible g is a divisor of d.\n\nLet me think about the LCM: LCM(x, x +d) = (x*(x +d)) / g. But x*(x +d) can be written as x² + dx. So, to minimize the LCM, perhaps we should maximize g, because that reduces the denominator.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal LCM is achieved when x is chosen such that x and x +d have a large GCD. So, perhaps the optimal k is determined by choosing x such that g is as large as possible.\n\nWait, but how can we find such x? Because x can be any number, but the optimal x is probably somewhere near certain points relative to d.\n\nLet me think differently. Since g divides d, let's consider all possible divisors of d and see how they affect x.\n\nSuppose g is a divisor of d. Then, for x to be divisible by g, x must be congruent to 0 modulo g. Wait, no. Since g is the GCD of x and x +d, and since x and x +d are d apart, g must divide both x and x +d. Therefore, g must divide their difference, which is d. So, yes, g is a divisor of d.\n\nSo, for each possible divisor g of d, perhaps we can compute the minimal x that makes g the GCD of x and x +d. Then, among all these possibilities, find the one that gives the minimal LCM.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about this. For a given g (divisor of d), what is the minimal LCM that can be achieved? Or perhaps, for each g, what is the minimal x that allows x and x +d to have GCD g. Then, compute the LCM for that x and see if it's better than others.\n\nBut since d can be up to 1e9, enumerating all its divisors might be manageable because the number of divisors is at most around 1000 for 1e9. So, this seems feasible.\n\nSo, here's an approach:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|. If d is zero, then a = b. In that case, adding any k will result in a +k and b +k being equal, so L",
