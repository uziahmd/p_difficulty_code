Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements. The next line contains n space-separated integers a0, a1, ..., an - 1 (0 ≤ ai ≤ 104) — elements of array a.The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m. Number m equals .\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the maximum value of function f(x) for all .\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\n### Output\n['3', '27']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case m = 20 = 1, f(0) = 0, f(1) = a0 = 3.In the second sample m = 20 + 21 + 23 = 11, the maximum value of function equals f(5) = a0 + a2 = 17 + 10 = 27.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, Valera has an array 'a' with 'n' integers. He also has a function f(x) that's calculated using the binary representation of x. The goal is to find the maximum value of f(x) for all x between 0 and m, inclusive.\n\nWait, the function f(x) uses each bit of x. For each position i, if the i-th bit in x is 1, then we add a_i to f(x). Oh right, but wait—wait, the description says the array a is indexed from 0 to n-1. So for each bit in x, starting from the least significant bit as position 0, we check if it's set. If it is, we add a[i] where i is the bit position.\n\nSo for example, if x is 11 and n is 4, which is 1011 in binary (but wait, wait: no, wait, 11 in decimal is 1011 in binary, which is 4 bits. So for each bit, like bit 0 (LSB), bit 1, etc., up to bit 3. So for x=11, bits are 1, 0, 1, 1. So the positions are 0,1,2,3. So for each bit i, if it's 1, add a[i]. So in the example, a0 + a1 + a3 = 3+8+10 = 21? Wait, no, the example says f(11)=a0+a3. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the example says when n=4 and x=11, which is 1011 in binary, f(x) is a0 + a1 + a3. Wait, why not a0 + a1 + a2 + a3? Because in the example, the sum is a0 + a3, which equals 3+10=13. But wait, in the first sample input, the output was 27, which was from a0 + a2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the bit positions wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the bits are considered in reverse order. Like, the first character of the binary string is the highest bit. Or maybe I have the bit positions inverted. Oh wait, the problem says that bit(i) is one if the binary representation of x has a 1 on the i-th position. So for x=11, which is 1011 in binary, the bits are:\n\ni=0: 1 → a[0]\ni=1: 1 → a[1]\ni=2: 0 → a[2] not added\ni=3: 1 → a[3] added?\n\nWait, but in the example, for x=11, f(x) is a0 + a1 + a3. So that's 3+8+10=21? But the sample says f(11) is a0 + a3. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure of the binary string.\n\nWait, the third line of input is a string of digits s0s1...sn-1, which represents the binary form of m. So m is the number whose binary is s. So for example, in the first sample, the third line is '11010', which is 20 in decimal because 16+4=20. So m is 20.\n\nThen, for x in [0,20], find f(x) maximum.\n\nIn the first sample, the array is [3,8]. So n=2, a0=3, a1=8. So for x=1, which is 01 in binary, the bits are 0 (i=0) and 1 (i=1). So f(1) is a0 + a1 = 3+8=11. But the sample output says the maximum is 3, which is f(0). Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting the bits. Alternatively, perhaps the binary is read from the string in a different way. For example, the string is s0s1s2...s_{n-1}, where s0 is the most significant bit, or the least significant.\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position.\" So for x=11, which is 1011 in binary, which is 8 + 2 + 1 = 11. So the bits are at positions 3 (8), 1 (2), and 0 (1).\n\nWait, so for each bit i, if x's ith bit is 1, add a[i]. So for x=11, which is 1011, the bits are set",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of a function \\( f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in the range from 0 to \\( m \\) (inclusive). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined using an array \\( a \\) and the binary representation of \\( x \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Function \\( f(x) \\)**:\n   - The function \\( f(x) \\) sums up elements of the array \\( a \\) based on the binary representation of \\( x \\). Specifically, if the \\( i \\)-th bit of \\( x \\) is set (i.e., it is 1), then \\( a[i] \\) is added to \\( f(x) \\).\n\n2. **Binary Representation of \\( m \\)**:\n   - The input provides \\( m \\) as a binary string. We need to convert this binary string into its decimal form to determine the upper limit of \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Maximizing \\( f(x) \\)**:\n   - To maximize \\( f(x) \\), we should consider setting as many bits as possible in \\( x \\) such that the corresponding elements in \\( a \\) are maximized. This can be efficiently done by iterating through each bit position and deciding whether to set it to 1 or not, starting from the most significant bit.\n\n4. **Iterative Bit Setting**:\n   - We iterate over each bit position from the most significant to the least significant. For each bit, we check if setting it to 1 will keep \\( x \\) within the allowed range (0 to \\( m \\)). If it does, we include the corresponding element from \\( a \\) in the sum.\n\n5. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:\n   - Use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum possible sum for each bit position and each possible state of the higher bits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = int(s, 2)\n    \n    # Convert the binary string to a list of bits, where index 0 is the highest bit.\n    bits = [int(c) for c in s]\n    \n    # Now, the length of bits is n, since s has n digits.\n    max_bits = len(bits)\n    \n    # Initialize dp: dp[i][tight] represents the maximum sum up to bit i with tight being whether the previous bits matched exactly.\n    # We'll use a 1D array for space optimization.\n    dp = [0] * (max_bits + 1)\n    \n    for i in range(max_bits):\n        # For each bit position i, decide whether to set it.\n        # We can represent the current state as whether the bits so far match exactly the prefix of m's binary.\n        # So, for each bit, we have two states: tight (whether we're still constrained by m's bits) or not.\n        # But since we're building up, perhaps we can manage with a single array.\n        # Wait, perhaps we can model this as for each bit, what is the maximum sum possible up to that bit, considering whether we've already deviated from m's bits.\n        # So, for each bit, we can have two possibilities: either we have been following m's bits strictly up to now (so next bits are limited), or we have deviated (so next bits can be anything).\n        # But this might get complex.

For each bit, it decides whether to set it to 1 or 0 based on the constraints imposed by \\( m \\) and the current state of the sum.\n- **Dynamic Programming States**: The DP array keeps track of the maximum sum achievable up to the current bit, considering whether the bits processed so far are exactly matching those of \\( m \\) (tight state) or have deviated (non-tight state).\n- **Efficiency**: The approach efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the constraints and properties of binary numbers, ensuring that we explore all possible combinations without redundant calculations.",
