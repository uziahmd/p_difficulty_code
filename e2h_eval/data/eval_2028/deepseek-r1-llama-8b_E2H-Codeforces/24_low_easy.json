She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a browser with several tabs open, and Luba needs to close some tabs efficiently. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds she needs to spend to close all the tabs outside a specific range [l, r].\n\nHmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, the initial setup is that there are n tabs, numbered from 1 to n. The cursor starts at position pos. Luba wants to keep tabs from l to r open. She can perform certain actions each second: move the cursor left or right (but within the current range of open tabs), or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nEach time she moves, it takes one second. Similarly, closing all tabs on either side takes one second each. So, the challenge is to figure out the optimal sequence of moves and closes to minimize the total time.\n\nLet's think about the possible steps she needs to take.\n\nFirst, I need to determine which tabs are to be closed. Those are the ones outside the [l, r] range. So, any tab less than l needs to be closed, and any tab greater than r also needs to be closed.\n\nWait, but wait. Actually, she only needs to close the tabs that are not in [l, r]. So, for example, if l=2 and r=4, then tabs 1 and 5 and above must be closed.\n\nBut the way she can close them is by moving the cursor to a position where she can close all the tabs to the left or right in one step.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Determine the left boundary and right boundary that need to be closed.\n\nLeft boundary: anything before l.\nRight boundary: anything after r.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to model the problem as needing to close the left part (if l > 1) and the right part (if r < n). Because if l is 1, there's nothing to close on the left.\n\nWait, but l and r could be such that the entire range is already all the tabs. For example, if n=5, l=1, r=5, then no tabs need to be closed. So the answer is zero.\n\nSo the first thing to do is check if l == 1 and r ==n. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: how much time does it take to close the left part (if needed) and the right part (if needed), considering the movement of the cursor.\n\nNow, the approach is to calculate the minimal steps required to close the left and right parts, possibly in different orders, and choose the one that takes the least time.\n\nLet me consider each case separately.\n\nCase 1: Only left part needs to be closed.\n\nIn this case, she needs to move the cursor to position l, close the left part, and possibly move to other positions if needed.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when you close the left part, you're done with all tabs before l. So, for the left part, the steps are:\n\n- Move the cursor to l, then close left. Or maybe not exactly to l, but to a position where she can close all tabs to the left.\n\nWait, no. When she is at position i, closing the left will close all tabs from a to i-1, where a is the current leftmost open tab. But initially, a is 1. So, if she's at position l, then closing left would close all tabs from 1 to l-1.\n\nSimilarly, if she's at position i, closing right would close i+1 to b, where b is the current maximum open tab.\n\nSo, the strategy is to reach a position where she can close the left and/or right parts optimally.\n\nSo, for the left part:\n\nIf l > 1, she needs to close all tabs before l. To do that, she needs to move to a position where she can close the left. The optimal position is l, because closing left from l will close all the tabs from 1 to l-1.\n\nSo, the steps for the left part are:\n\nTime to move from pos to l: |pos - l| steps.\n\nPlus one step to close the left.\n\nSimilarly, for the right part:\n\nIf r < n, she needs to move to r, then close the right. Time is |pos - r| steps plus one step.\n\nBut wait, perhaps she can choose to close the left first, then the right, or vice versa. Depending on which order is faster.\n\nWait, but the order might matter. For example, moving to close left first may require moving past the right area, or vice versa. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal time is achieved by choosing the best order.\n\nWait, but in reality, the initial position is fixed, and the two movements (",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified range [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves calculating the optimal sequence of movements and tab closures.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Need for Closure**: Determine if tabs need to be closed on the left (before l) or right (after r). If the entire range [l, r] already includes all open tabs, no action is needed.\n2. **Calculate Movements for Left Closure**: If tabs need to be closed on the left, compute the time to move the cursor from its initial position to l and then close the left tabs.\n3. **Calculate Movements for Right Closure**: Similarly, if tabs need to be closed on the right, compute the time to move the cursor from its initial position to r and then close the right tabs.\n4. **Optimize Order of Operations**: Consider both possible orders of closing left and right tabs to determine which minimizes the total time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    left_close = False\n    right_close = False\n    if l > 1:\n        left_close = True\n    if r < n:\n        right_close = True\n\n    time = 0\n\n    # Calculate steps and time for left closure\n    if left_close:\n        steps_left = abs(pos - l)\n        time += steps_left + 1  # move and close\n        # After closing left, the new position is l\n        pos = l\n\n    # Calculate steps and time for right closure\n    if right_close:\n        steps_right = abs(pos - r)\n        time += steps_right + 1  # move and close\n        # After closing right, the new position is r\n\n    print(time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If the range [l, r] includes all tabs from 1 to n, output 0 as no action is needed.\n2. **Determine Closures**: Check if tabs need to be closed on the left (before l) or right (after r).\n3. **Compute Time for Left Closure**: Move the cursor to position l and close the left tabs. This takes `|pos - l| + 1` seconds.\n4. **Compute Time for Right Closure**: Move the cursor to position r and close the right tabs. This takes `|pos - r| + 1` seconds.\n5. **Total Time**: Sum the times for left and right closures, considering the optimal order of operations.\n\nThis approach ensures that the minimal time is calculated efficiently by considering both possible orders of operations and the necessary movements.",
