A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Soft Drinking,\" and from the description, I need to calculate how many toasts each friend can make given certain resources.\n\nHmm. Let me try to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe friends have bought k bottles of soft drink, each with l milliliters. So the total drink is k multiplied by l. Each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. Since each friend makes a toast, for one toast, all n friends together consume n * nl milliliters. Wait, no—wait, each toast is per friend. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast round (where everyone drinks), it's n * nl ml in total.\n\nThen, they have c limes cut into d slices each. So the total number of lime slices is c multiplied by d. Each toast requires one slice per friend, so again, for each toast round, they need n slices.\n\nAnd then there's the salt: p grams are available. Each toast requires np grams per friend. So for each toast round, that's n * np grams needed.\n\nSo the goal is to find the maximum number of toast rounds t such that:\n\n- The total drink is at least t * n * nl.\n- The total lime slices are at least t * n.\n- The total salt is at least t * n * np.\n\nThen, the minimum of these three values divided by 1 will give t, but since all must be satisfied, t is the minimum of (total_drink / (n * nl)), (total_limes / n), (total_salt / (n * np))).\n\nWait, no. Wait: the drink required per toast is n * nl per toast round, right? Because each of the n friends takes nl for each toast. So for t toast rounds, the total drink used is t * n * nl. Similarly, the lime slices needed are t * n (each toast uses one slice per person). And the salt is t * n * np.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Calculate the total_drink = k * l.\n2. Calculate total_limes = c * d.\n3. Calculate total_salt = p.\n4. Compute how many toast rounds t each resource allows:\n   - t_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n   - t_lime = total_limes // n\n   - t_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n5. The maximum t possible is the minimum of these three values.\n6. Output t.\n\nBut wait, the problem says to print the number of toasts each friend can make. So if t is the number of toast rounds, each friend can make t toasts. So that's correct.\n\nNow, looking at the example:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nCalculations:\ntotal_drink = 4 *5=20. Each toast round needs 3*3=9ml. 20/9 is 2.222, so t_drink is 2.\ntotal_limes =10*8=80. Each toast round needs 3 slices. 80/3 is 26.666, t_lime is 26.\ntotal_salt=100. Each toast round needs 3*1=3 grams. 100/3 is 33.333, so t_salt is 33.\nThe minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. So output is 2.\n\nYes, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input:\n5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\n\nTotal_drink: 100*10=1000. Each toast round needs 5*4=20. 1000/20=50.\nLime: 1*19=19. Each toast needs 5. 19/5=3.8 → 3.\nSalt: 90. Each toast uses 5*3=15. 90/15=6.\nMinimum is 3.\n\nThird test case:\n10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\n\nDrink: 1000 *1000=1,000,000. Each toast uses 10*50=500. 1e6 /500=2000.\nLime:25*23=575. Each toast needs 10 → 575/10=57.5 →57.\nSalt:1. Each toast needs 10*1=10. 1/10=0. So t_salt is 0. So overall t is 0.\n\nSo output 0.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe input is a single line with 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nWe need to compute as described.\n\nSo steps for code:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntoast_drink_per_round = n * nl\nt_drink = total_drink // toast_drink_per_round\n\ntotal_limes = c * d\ntoast_lime_per_round = n\nt_lime = total_limes // toast_lime_per_round\n\ntoast_salt_per_round = n * np\nt_salt = p // toast_salt_per_round\n\nt = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\nPrint t as a string.\n\nWait, but what if any of the denominators are zero? But according to the problem statement, all inputs are positive integers, so n is at least 1, and nl and np are at least 1. So no division by zero.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nLet me think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase where all resources are just enough:\n\nFor example, n=1, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=1, np=1.\n\ntotal_drink=1, toast_drink=1*1=1 → t_drink=1.\n\nlimes: 1*1=1, toast needs 1 → t_lime=1.\n\nsalt:1, toast_salt=1 → t_salt=1. So t=1.\n\nOutput is 1.\n\nAnother case where some resource is insufficient.\n\nn=2, k=1, l=1 → drink=2. Each toast needs 2 * nl. Let's say nl=1: each toast uses 2ml. So t_drink=1.\n\nIf nl was 3: 2*3=6 > 2 → t_drink is 0.\n\nWhat about when one of the resources is zero? No, because all inputs are positive.\n\nAnother test case: when the salt is exactly enough for t rounds.\n\nLike, salt is exactly n*np*t.\n\nSo in code, using integer division with // should work.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo now, writing the code.\n\nRead the input as 8 integers.\n\nCompute each variable as per above.\n\nCompute t as the min of the three computed t's.\n\nPrint t as a string.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ndrink_total = k * l\ntoast_drink = n * nl\nt_drink = drink_total // toast_drink\n\nlime_total = c * d\ntoast_lime = n\nt_lime = lime_total // toast_lime\n\nsalt_total = p\ntoast_salt = n * np\nt_salt = salt_total // toast_salt\n\nt = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\nprint(t)\n\nThat's the code.\n\nTesting against the samples:\n\nFirst sample: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\ndrink_total = 20, toast_drink=3*3=9 → 20//9=2.\n\nlime: 10*8=80, 80//3=26.\n\nsalt: 100, 3*1=3 → 100//3=33.\n\nmin(2,26,33) →2. Output 2.\n\nSecond sample:5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3.\n\ndrink:1000, 5*4=20 →1000/20=50.\n\nlime:19, 5 →19//5=3.\n\nsalt:90,5*3=15 →6.\n\nmin(50,3,6)=3.\n\nThird sample:10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\ndrink: 1e6, 10*50=500 → 1e6 /500 =2000.\n\nlime:25*23=575, 10 →575//10=57.\n\nsalt:1, 10*1=10 →1//10=0.\n\nso t=0.\n\nAll match.\n\nLooks good.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, lime slices, and salt per friend. The goal is to find the minimum number of toasts possible based on the available resources.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Requirements**: Each toast round requires:\n   - `n * nl` milliliters of drink.\n   - `n` lime slices.\n   - `n * np` grams of salt.\n   \n2. **Calculate Total Resources**:\n   - Compute the total amount of drink available as `k * l`.\n   - Compute the total number of lime slices as `c * d`.\n   - The total salt available is given as `p`.\n\n3. **Determine Toast Limits**:\n   - Calculate how many toast rounds can be supported by the drink: `total_drink // (n * nl)`.\n   - Calculate how many toast rounds can be supported by the lime slices: `total_limes // n`.\n   - Calculate how many toast rounds can be supported by the salt: `total_salt // (n * np)`.\n\n4. **Find the Minimum Toast Rounds**: The maximum number of toast rounds each friend can make is determined by the resource that runs out first. This is the minimum of the three calculated values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntoast_drink = n * nl\nt_drink = total_drink // toast_drink\n\ntotal_limes = c * d\ntoast_lime = n\nt_lime = total_limes // toast_lime\n\ntoast_salt = n * np\nt_salt = p // toast_salt\n\nmax_toasts = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters per toast per friend, and grams of salt per toast per friend.\n- **Total Resources Calculation**: We compute the total amount of each resource available.\n- **Toast Limits Calculation**: For each resource, we determine how many toast rounds can be supported based on the resource constraints.\n- **Determine Maximum Toasts**: The minimum value from the toast limits gives the maximum number of toast rounds each friend can make.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by breaking down the problem into manageable steps and ensuring all resource constraints are considered.",
