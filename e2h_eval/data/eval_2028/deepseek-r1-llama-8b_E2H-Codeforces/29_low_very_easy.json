Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem statement says that Andrew and Eugene are playing a game where they manipulate a string of digits through a series of substitution queries. After processing all the queries, we need to compute the resulting number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nHmm. So the initial string is s, and each query is of the form di → ti. This means that every occurrence of digit di in the current string is replaced by ti. For example, if s is '123123' and the query is \"2→00\", then replacing all '2's with '00' gives '10031003'. Another example is when a query is \"3→\", which replaces every '3' with an empty string, so the string becomes '1212'.\n\nWait, but the order of processing the queries is important. Each query must be applied in sequence. So first, process the first query, then the second, and so on until all are done.\n\nThe output is the remainder when the resulting number is divided by 1e9+7. Also, leading zeros should be ignored except when the result is zero (like if the string becomes empty after substitutions). Oh right, but according to the note, leading zeros are not removed. Wait, no—wait, the note says that the third sample shows that leading zeros are kept. So for example, in the third test case, the input is '222', then two queries: first replace '2' with '0', which makes '000', then replace '0' with '7', making '777'. So the output is 777, which is correct because leading zeros are not removed. So the final number is considered as the entire string, including any leading zeros, except when the string is empty, which is treated as zero.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says: when you represent s as a decimal number, ignore leading zeroes. But in the sample note, the third example has s=222 transformed into 777, which is correct because both steps don't involve leading zeros. So perhaps the problem is that the leading zeros are only ignored if the number is non-zero. Hmm, no, the note says that leading zeros are not removed from the string s after replacement. So for example, if after substitution the string is '00123', then it's treated as 123 when converted to a number? Or is it treated as 0123, which is 123 as well?\n\nWait, the problem statement says: when you represent s as a decimal number, ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed to equal zero. So the resulting number is computed by taking the processed string, ignoring leading zeros, but if the string is empty, it's zero.\n\nSo for example, if after substitution the string is '000', it represents zero, so the output is 0. If it's '00123', it's treated as 123.\n\nBut wait, the sample input 3's output is '777', which is correct because the substitution results in '777', not '0777' or anything like that. So the process is that each substitution replaces the digit, but the leading zeros are kept in the string but are ignored when converting to the number. So the actual numerical value is based on the string without leading zeros.\n\nWait, but how does that affect our computation? Because for the modulus, the numerical value is determined by the digits in the string, including leading zeros. Because 00123 is 123, but when modding, it's the same as 123. But if the string is just '0', then the result is 0. So perhaps the way to handle it is to treat the string as a number, but when calculating its value mod 1e9+7, we can process each digit and compute the mod accordingly.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Process each query step by step, replacing each occurrence of di with ti.\n- After all queries, compute the numeric value of the resulting string, modulo 1e9+7.\n- But when the string is empty, return 0. Otherwise, convert the string to a number, ignoring leading zeros, and then take mod 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the numeric value modulo 1e9+7 correctly, considering leading zeros? Because, for example, '000123' is equivalent to 123, so when computing mod, it's the same as 123 mod MOD.\n\nBut another thought: since leading zeros can be present, but in terms of mod, each digit contributes a certain power of 10 multiplied by its digit value. However, leading zeros would contribute nothing to the mod because 10^k mod MOD can be precomputed, but adding leading zeros might require us to track the position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to compute the numeric value of the processed string, treating it as a number, but",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the resulting number modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). The substitutions must be applied in sequence, and leading zeros should be ignored when converting the final string to a number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Parse Input**: Read the initial string and the list of substitution queries.\n2. **Process Queries**: For each query, replace every occurrence of the specified digit with the given substring.\n3. **Compute Result**: Convert the resulting string to a number, ignoring leading zeros, and compute its value modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\n\ncurrent = s\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    parts = input().split('->')\n    di = parts[0]\n    ti = parts[1]\n    \n    # Replace all occurrences of di in current with ti\n    new_s = []\n    for c in current:\n        if c == di:\n            new_s.append(ti)\n        else:\n            new_s.append(c)\n    current = ''.join(new_s)\n\n# Now compute the numeric value mod MOD\nif not current:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    num_str = current.lstrip('0')\n    if num_str == '':\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        result = 0\n        power = 1\n        for ch in num_str:\n            result = (result * 10 + int(ch)) % MOD\n        print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from the input.\n2. **Processing Each Query**: Each query is split into the digit to replace and the replacement substring. The current string is updated by replacing each occurrence of the digit with the substring.\n3. **Handling Empty String**: If the resulting string is empty after processing all queries, the result is zero.\n4. **Computing Modulo**: The resulting string is converted to a number by ignoring leading zeros. Each digit is processed sequentially to compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach ensures that all substitutions are applied correctly and efficiently computes the required result.",
