He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is called Polycarp's Practice. The goal is to maximize the total profit from solving problems over k days.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, Polycarp has a list of n problems with difficulties a_1 to a_n. He needs to solve all of them in exactly k days. Each day he solves a contiguous sequence of problems, meaning each day's problems are a consecutive block starting from some point. So the way the problems are divided into days is by making k splits in the list, such that every day's segment is contiguous and covers a part of the list without skipping any problems.\n\nThe profit for each day is the maximum difficulty in that day's segment. The total profit is the sum of these max values across all days. Our task is to distribute the problems into exactly k segments to maximize this total profit.\n\nHmm. So the question is, how do we split the array into k contiguous parts so that the sum of the maxima of each part is as large as possible.\n\nI need to find an efficient way to compute this. Let's think about the approach.\n\nFirst, let's consider the constraints. n can be up to 2000, and k can be up to 2000. So O(n^2) solutions might be acceptable since 2000^2 is 4 million, which is manageable.\n\nWhat's the key here? We want to maximize the sum of maxima. Intuitively, to maximize the sum, we should have as many high-value elements as possible contributing their value to the sum. But because each day's maximum is only counted once, perhaps it's optimal to select certain peaks in the array where their max contributes to multiple days. Wait, no—each element is part of exactly one segment, so each a_i is the maximum for at most one segment. Or wait, no: each a_i can be the maximum of its own segment. For example, if a_i is higher than all elements to its right and left, then it will be the maximum of its segment.\n\nWait, but in the way the segments are chosen, each a_i is part of exactly one segment, and the maximum of that segment is added to the total. So the total is the sum of the maxima of each segment.\n\nTo maximize this sum, we need to ensure that as many high-value elements as possible become the maximum of their respective segments.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal strategy is to select certain points where the maximum is as large as possible. But how?\n\nAnother angle: For each possible segment, the maximum is determined by the highest element in that segment. So, the problem reduces to selecting k non-overlapping, contiguous segments that cover the entire array, such that the sum of the maxima of these segments is maximized.\n\nThis sounds similar to some dynamic programming problem.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Let's define dp[i][j] as the maximum total profit achievable by considering the first i problems and dividing them into j segments.\n\nThen, for each state, we can try to split the current segment at different points and take the maximum.\n\nThe recurrence relation would be:\n\ndp[i][j] = max over m (from m=0 to i-1) of (dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1 ... i]))\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for the j-th day, we can choose a segment that starts after m and ends at i. The max of this segment is the maximum in a[m+1..i], which we can precompute.\n\nBut wait, the max function could be expensive. If we compute it naively for each i and m, it's O(n^3), which would be too slow for n=2000.\n\nSo we need a way to compute the maximum quickly for any range [m+1, i]. To do that, we can precompute a 2D array where max_table[i][j] is the maximum value from index i to j.\n\nYes, that's a standard approach. We can precompute this table using a sliding window method or a sparse table. For this problem, since n is 2000, building a 2D array is feasible.\n\nLet's plan the steps:\n\n1. Precompute the maximums for all ranges [l][r], where l and r are indices in the array.\n   - We can build this using dynamic programming. For each l, compute the maximum from l to r for increasing r.\n\n2. Use dynamic programming to compute dp[i][j], where i is the number of problems considered and j is the number of days used so far.\n   - The base case is dp[0][0] = 0.\n   - For each i, j, dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[m][j-1] + max_table[m+1][i], for all m from j-",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to distribute a list of problems into exactly k days such that the total profit from each day's maximum difficulty is maximized. Each day's profit is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum total profit achievable by solving the first `i` problems over `j` days.\n2. **Precompute Maximums**: We precompute a 2D array `max_table` where `max_table[l][r]` holds the maximum value in the subarray from index `l` to `r`. This allows us to quickly get the maximum value for any segment.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each state `dp[i][j]`, we consider all possible previous splits `m` and compute the maximum profit by adding the maximum value of the current segment `[m+1, i]` to the result of the previous state `dp[m][j-1]`.\n4. **Edge Cases Handling**: Ensure the solution handles cases where `k` equals `n` or other edge values efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    # Precompute max_table\n    max_table = [[0]*(n) for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        max_table[i][i] = a[i]\n    for l in range(n-1):\n        for r in range(l+1, n):\n            max_table[l][r] = max(max_table[l][r-1], a[r])\n    \n    # DP table\n    dp = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for j in range(1, k+1):\n        for i in range(j, n+1):\n            if j == 1:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + max_table[0][i-1]\n            else:\n                max_val = 0\n                for m in range(i-1, j-1):\n                    current_max = max_table[m+1][i-1]\n                    if dp[m+1][j-1] + current_max > dp[i][j]:\n                        dp[i][j] = dp[m+1][j-1] + current_max\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + max_table[i-1][i-1]\n    \n    # Reconstruct the segments\n    segments = [0]*k\n    for j in range(k, 0, -1):\n        for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n            if dp[i][j] != dp[i-1][j]:\n                m = i-1\n                segments[j-1] = m - segments[j-1] - 1\n                break\n    print(dp[n][k])\n    print(' '.join(map(str, segments)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Maximums**: The `max_table` is built to store the maximum value for every possible subarray. This allows quick access during the DP transitions.\n2. **DP Initialization and Transition**: The DP table is initialized with base cases and filled using the precomputed maximums. For each state, we consider all possible previous splits to find the optimal solution.\n3. **Reconstructing Segments**: After computing the DP table, we backtrack to determine the exact segments for each day to achieve the maximum profit.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum possible total profit while distributing the problems optimally into k days.",
