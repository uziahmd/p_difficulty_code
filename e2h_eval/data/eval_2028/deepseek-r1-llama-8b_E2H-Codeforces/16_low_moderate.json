Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Crazy Town,\" and from the description, it seems like it involves lines dividing a plane into regions, and moving between these regions with certain rules.\n\nHmm, the task is to find the minimum number of steps to get from the home block to the university block. Each step is moving from one block to another if they share a common border of non-zero length. So, the key here is understanding how the lines partition the plane and how the regions are connected.\n\nWait, the problem says that two blocks are adjacent if their shared boundary has non-zero length. So, for example, if two regions meet only at a single point (an intersection), that doesn't count as a shared border. They must share a line segment where two or more roads meet.\n\nI remember that in computational geometry, the arrangement of lines can create regions, and the adjacency between regions depends on whether they share an edge (a segment where two lines intersect). So, each region is a cell in the arrangement, and each edge is a segment between two consecutive intersections along a line.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to determining how the home and university points are separated by the arrangement of lines. Then, the minimal path between them would involve crossing through the edges in some way.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps we can model this using the concept of planar graphs. Each line is a node in the graph, and each intersection is an edge between two lines. Then, the regions are the faces of this graph. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the minimal number of steps is related to the number of lines that separate the two points. Because each such line would require crossing from one side to the other, which might take one step. Or perhaps it's more complex than that.\n\nLet me think about the example given:\n\nIn the sample input, home is (1,1) and university is (-1,-1). There are two roads. The first road is y=0 (since 0x +1y +0=0 is y=0), and the second is x=0 (since 1x+0y+0=0 is x=0). So, the lines form a cross. The home is in the region where x>0 and y>0, and the university is in x<0 and y<0.\n\nWait, no. Wait, home is (1,1), which is on the right side of x=0 and above y=0. University is (-1,-1), on the left of x=0 and below y=0.\n\nSo, the home is in the region defined by x>0 and y>0, but wait—no, because the lines are x=0 and y=0. The four regions are:\n\n1. x>0, y>0\n2. x>0, y<0\n3. x<0, y>0\n4. x<0, y<0\n\nBut the home is in region 1, and the university in region 4. How many steps?\n\nIn the sample output, the answer is 2. So, to move from region 1 to 4, you need to cross two lines. Because each step can cross one line. So, perhaps the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of lines that separate the two points.\n\nWait, how many lines separate the two points? Let's see. Each line that the home and university are on opposite sides of would require crossing.\n\nSo, for each line, check if the home and university are on the same side or different sides. The number of lines where they are on opposite sides is the number of times you have to cross, which would be the minimal steps required.\n\nBecause each step allows you to cross one line. So, if you have k separating lines, you need at least k steps.\n\nThat makes sense. Because each crossing takes you across one line, and each step can only cross one line.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- For each line, determine whether the home and university are on the same side or opposite sides.\n- Count how many lines have them on opposite sides.\n- That count is the minimal number of steps required.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nNow, how do we compute that for each line?\n\nFor a given line ax + by + c = 0, the home (x1,y1) and university (x2,y2) will be on opposite sides if substituting either point into the line equation gives a positive value and the other gives a negative value.\n\nAlternatively, evaluate the sign of (a*x + b*y + c) for both points. If the signs differ, the points are on opposite sides of the line.\n\nSo, for each line, compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c and s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. The town is divided by multiple lines, and each step allows moving from one block to another if they share a common border segment of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem can be reduced to determining how many lines separate the home and university points. Each line that separates these two points will require at least one step to cross.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each line defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\), check if the home and university lie on opposite sides. If they do, this line contributes to the number of steps required.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each line, compute the value of \\(ax + by + c\\) for both the home and university coordinates.\n   - If the signs of these values differ, it means the points are on opposite sides of the line, and thus, this line needs to be crossed.\n   - Count the total number of such lines to determine the minimum steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef readints():\n    return list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if (s1 > 0 and s2 < 0) or (s1 < 0 and s2 > 0):\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input includes the coordinates of home and university, followed by the number of lines and their coefficients.\n- **Checking Each Line**: For each line, we compute the value of the line equation at both home and university coordinates. If these values have opposite signs, it indicates that the line separates the two points.\n- **Counting Separating Lines**: The total count of such lines gives the minimum number of steps needed, as each separating line must be crossed once.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal steps by leveraging geometric properties of lines and their separation of points, ensuring an optimal solution.",
