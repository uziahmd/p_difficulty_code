    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Array Stabilization. Hmm.\n\nThe task says that given an array of integers, I need to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. So, for each possible removal of an element, I calculate the new max and min, subtract them, and then find the smallest such value among all possibilities.\n\nWait, but calculating this naively for each element would be O(n^2), which won't work for n up to 1e5. That's way too big. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about what happens when I remove an element. The max and min of the remaining array could either stay the same or change depending on whether the removed element was the current max, min, or something else.\n\nSo, the plan is: find all possible candidates for the new max and min after each possible removal, and compute the minimal instability.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nHmm, maybe the key is to precompute the global max and min, and then consider the cases where removing an element affects either the max or the min.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The initial max and min are known. When we remove an element, the new max will be either the original max (if the removed element wasn't the max) or the next highest element. Similarly for the min.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Find the global max and its count, and the global min and its count.\n2. For each element, determine if it's the max or the min. Then, find the new max and min when it's removed.\n3. Calculate the instability for each scenario and pick the minimum.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple elements with the same max or min? For example, if the max occurs multiple times, then even if you remove one occurrence, the max remains the same. So in that case, the new max wouldn't change.\n\nSo, first step: find all unique max and min values, along with their counts.\n\nThen, for each element in the array, I can check:\n\n- If the element is the current max:\n   - How many times does the max occur?\n   - If the count is more than one, then removing this element doesn't change the max.\n   - So the new max is still the same as before.\n   - What about the min? If the element being removed is not the min, then the min remains the same.\n   - But if the element is both max and min, which can't happen unless all elements are the same.\n\nWait, no. Because the max and min are different in general. So, if the element is the max, removing it may or may not affect the max. Similarly for min.\n\nSo, for each element a_i, when we remove it, the new array will have:\n\nnew_max = current_max if count_max > 1 and a_i == current_max\n         else, the second_max if a_i was the only max.\n\nSimilarly for new_min.\n\nWait, but computing the second_max and second_min might be necessary. Oh right, because if the current max occurs once, and we remove that element, then the new max becomes the second_max. Similarly for min.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute current_max, count_max, current_min, count_min.\n- Precompute the second_max, which is the maximum value less than current_max. Also, find the count of current_max.\n- Precompute the second_min, which is the minimum value greater than current_min. Also, find the count of current_min.\n\nThen, for each a_i:\n\nCase 1: a_i is the current_max.\n\nIf count_max > 1:\n   Then after removing a_i, the max remains current_max. So new_max is current_max.\nElse:\n   new_max is second_max.\n\nSimilarly, for min:\nIf a_i is current_min:\n   If count_min > 1:\n      new_min remains current_min.\n   Else:\n      new_min is second_min.\n\nBut wait, a_i could be both the current_max and current_min, but that's only possible if all elements are equal. So in that case, removing any element won't change the max or min.\n\nSo, for each a_i, when we remove it, the new instability is (new_max - new_min).\n\nWe need to compute this for each a_i and find the minimal value.\n\nBut wait, maybe that's not sufficient. Because sometimes, the new_max could be lower than the current_max, but perhaps the new_min is higher than the current_min. Or vice versa.\n\nWait, no. Because when you remove an element, the new_max can't be higher than the current_max, and the new_min can't be lower than the current_min. Because you're removing an element, so the extremes can",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Key Values**: First, find the global maximum (max_val) and minimum (min_val) values of the array along with their counts.\n2. **Compute Second Max and Min**: Determine the second highest value (second_max) and the second lowest value (second_min) to handle cases where removing the max or min might affect the new max or min.\n3. **Evaluate Each Element Removal**: For each element in the array, consider the effect of its removal on the max and min values:\n   - If the element is the current max and it occurs more than once, the new max remains unchanged.\n   - If the element is the only max, the new max becomes the second_max.\n   - Similarly, if the element is the current min and it occurs more than once, the new min remains unchanged.\n   - If the element is the only min, the new min becomes the second_min.\n4. **Calculate Instability**: Compute the instability for each scenario and track the minimum instability encountered.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required values without resorting to a brute-force method, making it suitable for large arrays.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nif n == 0:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\ncurrent_max = max(a)\ncurrent_min = min(a)\n\ncount_max = a.count(current_max)\ncount_min = a.count(current_min)\n\n# Find the second max and its occurrence\nsecond_max = -float('inf')\nfor num in a:\n    if num < current_max:\n        if num > second_max:\n            second_max = num\n\n# Find the second min and its occurrence\nsecond_min = float('inf')\nfor num in a:\n    if num > current_min:\n        if num < second_min:\n            second_min = num\n\nmin_instability = float('inf')\n\nfor num in a:\n    # Determine new_max when removing 'num'\n    if count_max > 1:\n        new_max = current_max\n    else:\n        new_max = second_max\n    \n    # Determine new_min when removing 'num'\n    if count_min > 1:\n        new_min = current_min\n    else:\n        new_min = second_min\n    \n    instability = new_max - new_min\n    if instability < min_instability:\n        min_instability = instability\n\nprint(min_instability)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Identify Key Values**: We start by finding the global max and min values and their counts.\n- **Compute Second Max and Min**: These are used to handle cases where removing the only max or min would change the extremes.\n- **Evaluate Each Element**: For each element, check how its removal affects the max and min. Update the instability accordingly.\n- **Track Minimum Instability**: Keep track of the smallest instability found during the evaluation.\n\nThis method efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures optimal performance for large arrays.",
