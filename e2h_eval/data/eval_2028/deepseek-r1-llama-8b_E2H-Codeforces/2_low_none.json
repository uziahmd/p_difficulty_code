            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Valera and X\n\nValera is a little boy. Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X'. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe grid is n x n, where n is odd. The conditions for it being an 'X' are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I'll need to check the two main diagonals. Then, check that all non-diagonal elements are the same and not equal to the diagonal character.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input. The input consists of an integer n followed by n lines, each containing n characters.\n\nWait, but in Python, reading the input as a list of strings, each string representing a row. So for each row, I can process it into a list of characters.\n\nSo step by step:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Read the next n lines, each line being a string of length n. So the grid is a list of lists or just a list of strings, each string representing a row.\n\nOnce I have the grid, I need to:\n\n- Check the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right). All characters in this diagonal should be the same.\n- Check the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). All characters in this diagonal should be the same.\n- Then, check that all the other cells (non-diagonal) have the same character, which is different from both diagonals.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that both diagonals must have the same letter. So first, the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal must consist of the same character.\n\nAnd all the other cells must be the same, which is different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\na) Check that all cells on the main diagonal are the same. Let's call this char d1.\n\nb) Check that all cells on the anti-diagonal are the same. Let's call this char d2.\n\nc) Check that d1 equals d2.\n\nd) Check that all other cells (non-diagonal) are the same, and that this character is not equal to d1.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nSo let's break it down.\n\nHow to get the main diagonal: for i from 0 to n-1, grid[i][i].\n\nAnti-diagonal: for i from 0 to n-1, grid[i][n-1 - i].\n\nWait, since the grid is zero-based or one-based? Well, the code will treat it as zero-based.\n\nSo for each i, j, grid[i][j] is row i, column j.\n\nSo for the main diagonal, it's grid[0][0], grid[1][1], ..., grid[n-1][n-1].\n\nFor the anti-diagonal, it's grid[0][n-1], grid[1][n-2], ..., grid[n-1][0].\n\nSo for each of these diagonals, I need to collect all their characters and see if they are the same.\n\nThen, compare the two diagonals' characters. If they are not the same, then it's automatically NO.\n\nIf they are the same, then proceed.\n\nNext, check all other cells. Each cell (i,j) where i != j and i + j != n-1 (since for the anti-diagonal, i + j = n-1). So if (i,j) is not on either diagonal, then its character must be the same as some common character, and that character must be different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo, first, check if the diagonals are the same. Let's say the diagonal character is c.\n\nThen, for all cells not on the diagonals, they must be the same, say s, and s != c.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that all non-diagonal squares must contain the same letter, which is different from the ones on the diagonals.\n\nSo, all non-diagonal cells must be the same, and that same character is different from the diagonal's.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nImplementation Steps:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read n lines, each line being a string. Let's store them as a list called grid.\n\n3. For each row in grid, ensure that it's exactly length n. But since the problem says it's a correct input, maybe we can skip checking.\n\n4. Check the main diagonal:\n\n   a. Collect all grid[i][i] for i in 0..n-1.\n\n   b. Check if all are the same. Let's call this c_main.\n\n5. Check the anti-diagonal:\n\n   a. Collect all grid[i][n-1 - i] for i in 0..n-1.\n\n",

The conditions for the grid to form an 'X' are that both diagonals must have the same character, and all other cells must be the same character which is different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the integer `n` and the subsequent `n` lines each containing `n` characters.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: \n   - Extract the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and check if all characters are the same.\n   - Extract the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) and check if all characters are the same.\n3. **Compare Diagonals**: Ensure that the main diagonal and anti-diagonal have the same character.\n4. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: Verify that all cells not on the diagonals have the same character, which is different from the diagonal character.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Function to check if all characters in a diagonal are the same\ndef check_diagonal(grid, n, direction):\n    diagonal = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if direction == 'main':\n            j = i\n        else:\n            j = n - 1 - i\n        diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n    return all(c == diagonal[0] for c in diagonal)\n\n# Check main and anti-diagonal\nmain_diag_char = check_diagonal(grid, n, 'main')\nanti_diag_char = check_diagonal(grid, n, 'anti')\n\nif main_diag_char != anti_diag_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Now check all non-diagonal cells\n    s = None\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if (i == j) or (i + j == n - 1):\n                continue\n            if s is None:\n                s = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != s:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n    # Also, ensure that s is different from the diagonal character\n    if valid and (s != main_diag_char):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n` followed by `n` strings representing the grid.\n2. **Checking Diagonals**: The function `check_diagonal` checks if all characters in a diagonal (either main or anti) are the same.\n3. **Diagonal Comparison**: The main and anti-diagonals must have the same character for the grid to potentially form an 'X'.\n4. **Non-Diagonal Check**: All non-diagonal cells must have the same character, which must be different from the diagonal character. If these conditions are met, the grid forms an 'X'; otherwise, it does not.",
