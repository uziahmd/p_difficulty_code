Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Cards.\" Hmm. Let me read the description carefully.\n\nSo, Vanya has some cards with numbers on them. Each number can be positive, negative, or zero, but their absolute value doesn't exceed x. Natasha hid all his cards, but he found n of them. He wants the sum of all the found cards to be zero. But right now, the sum isn't zero. So, he needs to find some more cards (from the infinite supply of -x to x) to add to the found ones so that the total sum is zero. Our task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nWait, but how do we determine which cards to add? Because each card can have any value as long as its absolute value is at most x. So, for example, if the current sum is S, then the total needed is -S. And the question is, what's the smallest number of cards such that their sum is exactly -S, and each card contributes a value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\nSo, the approach should be: calculate the current sum of the found cards. Then, the required sum from the additional cards is the negative of that sum. We need to find the minimal number of terms (each between -x and x) that add up to this required sum.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. Compute the current sum of the given cards.\n2. The target sum is -current_sum.\n3. Find the minimal number of integers (each in [-x, x]) that add up to the target sum.\n\nHmm, okay. So, for example, if the target is 5 and x is 2, the minimal number is 3, because 2+2+1=5, but wait, no—wait, 2+2+1 is three numbers adding to 5. But wait, 5 is bigger than 2, but perhaps you can use larger numbers. Wait, wait—no, because each card can only contribute up to x. So for target T, the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |T| divided by x.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. Suppose the target is T, and each step you can add up to x towards the target.\n\nFor example:\nIf T is 7, x is 3. Then 3 + 3 +1 = 7, but that's 3 steps. Alternatively, 3*2 +1, but that's still 3 steps. Or maybe 3*3 =9 is more than 7, but that would require one step, but that's not possible since 9>7. So, no, the minimal steps are 3.\n\nWait, another example: T is 6, x is 3. Then 3+3 =6, so two steps.\n\nWait, but what if T is 4 and x is 3? Then you can do 3+1, but 1 is allowed since x >=1. So that's two steps. Or is there a better way? No, because 3 is the maximum per step.\n\nSo, the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of (|T| / x), but wait, only if T is not zero. If T is zero, then you don't need any more cards.\n\nWait, but wait. What if T is zero? Then you don't need any additional cards. So that's an edge case.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Compute the sum of the found cards, S.\n- Compute the target T = -S.\n- If T is zero, return 0.\n- Else, compute the absolute value of T, say |T|.\n- The minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |T| divided by x.\n\nWait, but let's test this against the examples.\n\nFirst example in the note:\n\nInput:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nSum is (-1) +1 +2 = 2. So T is -2. So the target is -2, which is 2 (absolute value is 2). x is 2.\n\nSo minimal number is 2 / 2 =1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example:\n\nInput:\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nSum is -4. Target is 4. x is 3.\n\n4 divided by 3 is 1.333..., so ceiling is 2. So minimal number is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: what if the sum is 5, x is 3. Then |5|=5, divided by 3 is 1.666, so ceiling is 2. Can we get 5 with 2 steps? 3 +2=5. Yes. So yes.\n\nWhat if the sum is 0",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his found cards equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x (inclusive).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: Compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: The target sum is the negative of the current sum, as we need the total sum to be zero.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Compute Minimum Cards**: If the target sum is non-zero, compute the absolute value of the target sum. The minimum number of additional cards required is the ceiling of the absolute target sum divided by x. This ensures that each card contributes the maximum possible value towards reaching the target sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent_sum = sum(cards)\ntarget = -current_sum\n\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    absolute_target = abs(target)\n    min_cards = (absolute_target + x - 1) // x\n    print(min_cards)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of found cards `n` and the maximum absolute value `x`. It then reads the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed.\n3. **Target Calculation**: The target sum needed to make the total sum zero is calculated as the negative of the current sum.\n4. **Zero Check**: If the target sum is zero, the result is immediately zero since no additional cards are needed.\n5. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: For a non-zero target, the absolute value of the target is used to determine the minimum number of cards needed. This is done using integer division with ceiling, which is achieved by adding `x-1` to the target before dividing by `x`.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of additional cards required using basic arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
