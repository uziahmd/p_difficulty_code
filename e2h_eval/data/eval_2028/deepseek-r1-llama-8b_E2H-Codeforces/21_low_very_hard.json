The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Neko Finds Grapes.\" Hmm, sounds interesting. So, Neko found some treasure chests and keys, and she wants to open as many chests as possible using the keys.\n\nLet me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, each chest has a number a_i, and each key has a number b_j. To unlock a chest i with a key j, their sum must be odd. That means a_i + b_j is congruent to 1 mod 2. Which simplifies to (a_i is even and b_j is odd) or (a_i is odd and b_j is even). Oh right, because even plus odd is odd, and odd plus even is also odd.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum number of chests that can be opened by using the keys optimally. Each key can be used only once, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the first thing I think is that we need to count how many chests are even and how many are odd, and similarly for the keys. Then, depending on whether a key is used on an even or odd chest, we can determine the maximum possible matches.\n\nWait, but it's more than just counts. Because when you match a key with a chest, you have to pair them in a way that their parity allows the sum to be odd. So, for example, if a chest is even, it can be unlocked by any odd key, and vice versa.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n- Let's compute two values: the number of even a_i's (call it A_even) and the number of odd a_i's (A_odd).\n- Similarly, compute B_odd and B_even for the keys.\n\nNow, the maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by how we allocate the keys to the chests.\n\nWe can model this as follows:\n\nEach even a_i can be matched with any odd b_j. Each odd a_i can be matched with any even b_j.\n\nSo, the total possible is the minimum between the available keys that can be used for each type of chest.\n\nBut wait, it's not that straightforward. Because each key can be used only once. So, the optimal approach is to maximize the number of pairs where the parities are correct.\n\nLet me think of it in terms of bipartite matching. We have two groups: even and odd chests, and keys that are even and odd. We can create a bipartition where even chests connect to odd keys, and odd chests connect to even keys. Then, the maximum matching is the maximum number of chests we can open.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's a bipartite graph, and the maximum matching would be the solution. However, since it's a bipartite graph with all edges present between the respective parities, the maximum matching is equal to the minimum of the sum of the capacities, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of chests is the sum of the minimums of certain pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible is the sum of the following two terms:\n\n1. The minimum of A_even and B_odd.\n2. The minimum of A_odd and B_even.\n\nBut wait, no. Because each key can only be used once. So, for example, if there are 3 even chests and 5 odd keys, we can use all 3 even chests with 3 of the odd keys. But then, the remaining even keys can't be used for the odd chests.\n\nWait, no. Because the even chests can be unlocked by any odd key, and the odd chests can be unlocked by any even key.\n\nSo, the total maximum is the sum of:\n\nmin(A_even, B_odd) + min(A_odd, B_even)\n\nBut wait, no. Because imagine that B_odd is larger than A_even, but B_even is smaller than A_odd. Then, after using some B_odd keys for A_even, the remaining B_even keys might not be enough for A_odd.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think of it this way: each key can be used for either an even or odd chest, but not both. So, the process is to decide how many keys to allocate to even chests and how many to odd chests, ensuring that the sum is maximized.\n\nSo, let's denote x as the number of keys used for even chests, and y as the number used for odd chests. So, x can't exceed the number of odd keys (since each key used for even must be odd), and y can't exceed the number of even keys.\n\nAdditionally, x can't be larger than the number of even chests, and y can't be larger than the number of odd chests.\n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\nx <= A_even\ny <= A_odd\nx <= B_odd\ny <= B_even\n\nAnd",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the keys. Each key can unlock a chest if their sum is odd, meaning one must be even and the other must be odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count how many chests have even and odd numbers. Similarly, count how many keys are even and odd.\n2. **Match Even and Odd**: Use the keys to unlock chests in two ways:\n   - Even chests can be unlocked using odd keys.\n   - Odd chests can be unlocked using even keys.\n3. **Maximize Matches**: Calculate the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked by considering the minimum possible pairs between the required keys and chests for both even and odd parities.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    m = int(input[idx + 1])\n    idx += 2\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + m]))\n    \n    a_even = sum(1 for num in a if num % 2 == 0)\n    a_odd = n - a_even\n    \n    b_odd = sum(1 for num in b if num % 2 == 1)\n    b_even = m - b_odd\n    \n    # The maximum possible is the sum of the minimum of each possible pairing\n    max_even_matching = min(a_even, b_odd)\n    max_odd_matching = min(a_odd, b_even)\n    \n    total = max_even_matching + max_odd_matching\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of chests, keys, their respective values, and the values themselves.\n2. **Counting Parities**: We count how many chests are even (`a_even`) and how many are odd (`a_odd`). Similarly, we count how many keys are odd (`b_odd`) and how many are even (`b_even`).\n3. **Matching Strategy**: We calculate the maximum number of even chests that can be unlocked using odd keys (`max_even_matching`) and the maximum number of odd chests that can be unlocked using even keys (`max_odd_matching`).\n4. **Summing Up**: The total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of these two maximum matches.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the given keys, leveraging parity checks and matching strategies to maximize the result.",
