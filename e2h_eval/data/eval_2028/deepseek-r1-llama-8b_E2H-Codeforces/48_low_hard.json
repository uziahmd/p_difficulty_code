            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about converting a number from one base to another, but with some Roman numeral rules involved. Oh right, and the bases can be up to 25, which is manageable.\n\nThe input gives me two integers a and b. Wait, but b could be 'R', which indicates that the target base uses Roman numerals. Interesting. Then, there's a string c which is in base a. My task is to convert this into base b, but using Roman numerals if needed.\n\nLet me break this down. So first, I need to parse the input correctly. The first line has a and b, but b might be R. The second line is the number c in base a, possibly with leading zeros.\n\nThe output should be the same number, but written in base b as a Roman numeral if b is R, or as a standard integer in base b otherwise. Also, I have to omit leading zeros.\n\nSo, the steps I think I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input: a and b, then the number c in base a.\n2. Determine whether the target is Roman or decimal based on b.\n3. Convert c from base a to a decimal (base 10) number.\n4. Then, convert that decimal number into the target base, either as a Roman numeral (if b is R) or as a standard number in base b.\n\nWait, but wait—when b is not R, how do I handle it? Like, for example, if a is 10 and b is 2, then c is '16' in base 10, which is 16 in decimal. Then I need to convert 16 into binary, which is 10000. But wait, the output must not have leading zeros, so that's straightforward.\n\nBut the tricky part is when b is R. Because in that case, each digit of the converted number needs to be represented as a Roman numeral, following the specific rules.\n\nHmm, okay. So first, let's think about parsing the input correctly. For the second line, the string c is given in base a. So I need to read that string, split it into individual characters, and then process each character as a digit in base a.\n\nWait, but how about when a is larger than 10? For example, if a is 16, then the digits can be 0-15, represented by 0-9 and A-F, right? So I need to correctly parse each character into its corresponding value.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says that the input c is a non-negative integer in base a. So, for example, if a is 10, then each digit is 0-9. If a is 16, each digit is 0-15, represented as 0-9, A-F (uppercase, I assume). So, when processing c, I need to map each character to its value according to base a.\n\nWait, but what about letters? Oh, because the input is c as a string in base a. So for a base higher than 10, the digits can include letters. So, for example, in base 16, 'A' represents 10, 'B' 11, etc.\n\nSo, first, I'll need a helper function to convert a string in base a to a decimal integer. That's step 3.\n\nOnce I have the decimal value, I need to convert it into the target base, which is either a standard base or Roman numerals.\n\nLet's tackle the conversion from c to decimal. For each character in the string, I'll get its value in base a, multiply by a^(position), sum all together.\n\nFor example, if c is '16' in base 10, it's 1*10 + 6 = 16.\n\nBut what about when a is 2 and the string is '1111001'? That would be 1*(2^6) + 1*(2^5) + ... and so on.\n\nOnce I have the decimal value, I need to convert it into base b. If b is not R, then it's just converting from base 10 to base b, as a string without leading zeros.\n\nBut if b is R, then each digit in the base 10 number needs to be converted into Roman numerals, according to the rules.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when b is R, the target is to write the number in Roman numerals, not in base R. Because in the problem statement, it says that the door parts are either in base b or R. So, for example, if the target is R, the entire number is expressed as Roman numerals, not as a base-R number. So, for example, if the number is 5 and b is R, the output is 'V'.\n\nSo, the key point is: when b",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another. The target base can either be a standard integer base or a Roman numeral system. The solution involves parsing the input, converting the number to a decimal (base 10) format, and then converting it to the target base or Roman numeral representation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the input values for the source base `a` and the target base `b`, which can be 'R' for Roman numerals. Also, read the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: Convert the given number `c` from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**:\n   - If the target base `b` is a standard integer base, convert the decimal number to this base as a string without leading zeros.\n   - If the target base `b` is 'R', convert the decimal number to its Roman numeral representation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res += r\n            num -= i\n    return res\n\ndef char_to_value(c, base):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        return ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\ndef str_to_decimal(s, base):\n    total = 0\n    for c in s:\n        val = char_to_value(c, base)\n        total = total * base + val\n    return total\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if base == 1:\n        return '1'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        if remainder < 10:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits)) if digits else '0'\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    a = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    b = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    c = input[idx].strip()\n    \n    # Convert c to decimal\n    decimal = str_to_decimal(c, a)\n    \n    # Determine target type\n    if b != 'R':\n        # Convert to base b as a string\n        result = decimal_to_base(decimal, int(b))\n        print(result)\n    else:\n        # Convert to Roman numerals\n        roman = int_to_roman(decimal)\n        print(roman)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `str_to_decimal` converts a string in any base `a` to a decimal integer by iterating through each character, converting it to its respective value, and accumulating the total.\n2. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: The function `int_to_roman` converts a decimal integer to its Roman numeral representation using a list of tuples that map values to their corresponding Roman symbols.\n3. **Base Conversion**: The function `decimal_to_base` converts a decimal integer to a specified base, handling both standard bases and Roman numerals appropriately.\n\nThis approach ensures that the number is correctly parsed and converted regardless of the target base, efficiently handling all edge cases and constraints provided in the problem.",
