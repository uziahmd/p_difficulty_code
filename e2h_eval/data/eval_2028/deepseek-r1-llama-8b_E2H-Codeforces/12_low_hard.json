The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, Xenia is in a city with houses arranged in a ring, right? She needs to do some tasks, and each task requires her to be at a specific house. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks.\n\nWait, the problem says that each task i must be done after all tasks j where j < i. So, for example, if her tasks are in the order a1, a2, ..., am, she has to handle them in that exact sequence. Or wait, no. Wait, the description says: \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" Oh, right, so she needs to process them in the order of their indices. So the first task is a1, then a2, etc., but each ai is the target house for task i. So the sequence is fixed as a1, a2, ..., am.\n\nBut wait, the input gives m integers a1, a2,...,am. So the tasks are to be done in the order they appear, but the same house can appear multiple times. So for each task i, she must be at ai, and all previous tasks (1 to i-1) have already been completed.\n\nSo the challenge is to find the minimal time required to visit all these positions in order, considering that she can move clockwise around the ring.\n\nHmm. How do we model this?\n\nLet me think about the approach. Since the ring is circular, the distance between two points can be computed as the minimum of clockwise or counter-clockwise steps. But since the traffic is one-way clockwise, she can't go counter-clockwise. Wait, the ringroad is one-way and clockwise. So she can only move in the direction of increasing house numbers. That changes things.\n\nOh right, because the ring is a loop, but movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction. So from any house, she can only go to the next higher-numbered house, wrapping around from n back to 1.\n\nWait, but wait—n is the last house, and after that comes 1 again. So the ring is 1 → 2 → ... → n → 1 → 2, etc.\n\nSo the movement is constrained. She can't go backwards; she can only move forward. So from any house x, the next is x+1, except when x is n, then the next is 1.\n\nSo the way she moves is strictly clockwise.\n\nNow, the problem is to plan a path that starts at 1, then goes through a1, then a2, etc., up to am, in that order, with the minimal total time.\n\nWait, but each task i requires being at ai at some point after the previous tasks. So the sequence is 1 (initial position) → a1 → a2 → ... → am.\n\nBut how does that translate into movement steps?\n\nEach step is moving from current house to the next task's house, but the movement is along the ring, which is a circle.\n\nWait, let's model this as a series of movements. She starts at house 1. Then she moves to a1, then from a1 to a2, and so on until am.\n\nBut each movement between two consecutive targets (like a_i and a_{i+1}) could take a certain number of steps. The minimal steps would be the minimal way to go from a_i to a_{i+1} in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, but since the ring is circular, the distance between two points a and b can be calculated as (b - a) mod n, but since she can only move in the clockwise direction, the distance is (b - a) if b >=a, else (n - a + b).\n\nWait, for example, if a=3, b=2, and n=4: moving clockwise, she has to go 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps. But (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod4=3, which matches.\n\nSo the distance from a to b is (b - a) % n, but since she can't go counter-clockwise, it's exactly (b -a) if b > a, or n + (b -a) if b < a.\n\nWait, no, because when b < a, the clockwise path is longer. For example, a=4, b=2, n=4: 4 →1 →2 is 2 steps. (2-4) mod4 = (-2) mod4=2. So yes, the distance is (b -a) mod n.\n\nSo the total time is the sum of distances between each consecutive pair in the sequence, starting from 1, then a1, a2, ..., am.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's see the first example:\n\nInput:\n4 3\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks while moving clockwise around a ring of houses. Each task must be completed in the given order, and she can only move in the clockwise direction.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must visit each target house in the specified order. The key insight is that movement is constrained to the clockwise direction, which means the distance between two houses is the minimal steps required when moving in a clockwise manner around the ring.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For any two houses `a` and `b`, the clockwise distance is calculated as `(b - a) % n`, where `n` is the total number of houses. This formula works because it correctly handles cases where `b` is less than `a` by wrapping around the ring.\n3. **Summing Distances**: The total time required is the sum of the distances between consecutive target houses in the given order. Starting from house 1, we compute the distance to each subsequent target house and sum these distances to get the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprev = 1\ntotal_time = 0\nfor current_task in tasks:\n    # Calculate the distance from prev to current_task\n    if current_task >= prev:\n        distance = current_task - prev\n    else:\n        distance = (n - prev) + current_task\n    total_time += distance\n    prev = current_task\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`, followed by the list of target houses for each task.\n2. **Initial Setup**: Starting from house 1, the initial position is set, and the total time is initialized to 0.\n3. **Loop Through Tasks**: For each target house in the task list, the distance from the previous house is calculated using the clockwise distance formula.\n4. **Update Total Time**: Each computed distance is added to the total time, and the current target house is updated to the next task's location.\n5. **Output Result**: Finally, the accumulated total time is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time required by leveraging the properties of circular movement and ensures that the solution is optimal and handles all edge cases.",
