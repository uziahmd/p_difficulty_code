There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a tennis tournament where players are eliminated in each game, and the tournament grid isn't fixed yet. But there's a specific rule: two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. My task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in.\n\nHmm, right. So the winner needs to play as many games as possible while following that rule. Let me think about how the tournament could be structured to maximize this.\n\nLet's consider some examples first. Like the sample input:\n\nFor n=2, the winner plays once. That's straightforward.\n\nn=3: The winner plays two games. How? Maybe the initial structure has them beat two opponents, but wait, how does that work? Oh, because after the first game, the winner has 1 game. Then, in the next round, they can play someone who also has 1 game. So two total.\n\nWait, another example: n=4. The sample output is 2. Oh, because the winner can only play two games. Hmm, how?\n\nWait, let's think about the tournament structure. For n=4, maybe the initial rounds have the winner play two different opponents in the first two rounds, but then they can't play a third because their opponents might not have enough games.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum number of games is similar to the Fibonacci sequence? Because each step depends on the previous ones.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. Suppose f(k) is the maximum number of games a winner can play when there are k players. To reach f(k), the winner must have played f(k-1) games, but perhaps more.\n\nWait no, perhaps we should model it as building up the tournament in a way that each game the winner plays is against someone who has either the same number of games or one less.\n\nSo, for example, the maximum number of games is achieved when each opponent the winner plays has exactly one fewer game than the winner at each step.\n\nWait, that sounds like the Fibonacci numbers. Because each time, you add a new layer where the winner plays someone who has played one less game than them.\n\nLike, for n=2, it's 1 game.\n\nn=3: 2 games.\n\nn=4: 2 games.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, n=10 gives an output of 4. Let's see: 4 is part of the Fibonacci sequence (like 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.), but 4 isn't directly a Fibonacci number. Hmm, maybe my initial thought is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of games is the largest m such that the sum of the first m Fibonacci numbers is less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each time the winner plays, they have to have their opponent have a game count that's either equal or one less. So, for the winner to play m games, they must have beaten m opponents. Each opponent must have been allowed to play up to m-1, m-2, etc., games.\n\nWait, maybe it's similar to the Fibonacci sequence, where the number of players required to have a winner play m games is Fib(m+2). Or something like that.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nm=1: requires 2 players. So Fib(3) = 2.\n\nm=2: requires 3 players. Fib(4)=3.\n\nm=3: requires 5 players. Fib(5)=5.\n\nm=4: requires 8 players. Fib(6)=8.\n\nBut in the sample, n=10: the maximum m is 4. Wait, because Fib(6) is 8, which is less than 10. So the maximum m would be 4, which matches the sample.\n\nSo for n=10, the maximum m is 4, because 8<=10 <13 (which is Fib(7)).\n\nSo the approach is: find the largest m where Fib(m+2) <= n.\n\nThen, the answer is m.\n\nWait, but how do we compute this?\n\nWe need to generate Fibonacci numbers until we reach a value greater than n, then take the previous m.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with some examples.\n\nSample 1: n=2.\n\nFib(3) = 2. So m=1.\n\nSample 2: n=3.\n\nFib(4)=3. m=2.\n\nSample 3: n=4.\n\nFib(4)=3<4, Fib(5)=5>4. So m=2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test: n=5.\n\nFib(5)=5. So m=3.\n\nYes, because the winner can play 3 games.\n\nAnother test: n=6.\n\nFib(5)=5<=6, Fib(6)=8>6. So m=3.\n\nWait, but could the maximum games be 3? Let me think.\n\nIf n=6, can the winner play 3 games?\n\nHow? The first game is against someone (game 1). Then, in the second round, he plays someone who has played 0 or 1 games. Since he's played 1, his opponent can have 1 or 0.\n\nWait, no, the condition is that the two players' current game counts differ by at most 1. So, after playing 1 game, the next opponent can have 0 or 1.\n\nWait, but the opponent must have won their previous games. So if the opponent has 0 games, meaning they haven't played yet, that's allowed.\n\nWait, but how to structure the tournament to allow the winner to play 3 games.\n\nI think with n=6, the maximum is indeed 3.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute Fibonacci numbers until Fib exceeds n.\n\n- The maximum m is the largest index where Fib(m+2) <= n.\n\nSo, our steps are:\n\n1. Generate Fibonacci numbers up to Fib(k) where Fib(k) > n.\n\n2. Find the largest m such that Fib(m+2) <= n.\n\nThe answer is m.\n\nWait, but how to handle cases where n doesn't fit exactly into the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nFor example, n=7.\n\nFib(6)=8>7, Fib(5)=5<=7. So m=3.\n\nIs it possible for the winner to play 3 games?\n\nYes.\n\nBecause 5 players can support 3 games, but 7 is between 5 and 8.\n\nWait, but how? Maybe the tournament structure allows for more players.\n\nWait, let me think about the structure.\n\nWhen the winner has to play m games, each time they play, they face someone who has played either m-1 or m-2 games.\n\nSo the minimal number of players needed for m games is Fib(m+2).\n\nThus, any n >= Fib(m+2) can have a maximum of m games.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nSo, the code will generate the Fibonacci sequence, and for a given n, find the largest m where Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Initialize the Fibonacci sequence with a[0] = 1, a[1] = 1.\n\nWait, no, wait: Let me see.\n\nWait, Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, etc. So perhaps the standard Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait, but in the earlier examples, for m=1, Fib(3)=2.\n\nSo perhaps the correct starting point is Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13, etc.\n\nSo for m=1: Fib(3)=2.\n\nSo, the function is to find the largest m such that Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nSo, let's model this.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nWe can precompute Fibonacci numbers until they exceed n.\n\nThen, for each n, find the maximum m where Fib(m+2)<=n.\n\nSo, let's write a loop.\n\nRead n from input.\n\nCompute Fib numbers until Fib(k) >n.\n\nThen, for each m from 0 upwards, check if Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nThe maximum such m is the answer.\n\nWait, but how to represent the Fib sequence.\n\nLet me think about code:\n\nWe can initialize a list fib, starting with fib[0]=0, fib[1]=1.\n\nThen, for each next term, fib[i] = fib[i-1]+fib[i-2].\n\nWe continue until fib[i] exceeds n.\n\nOnce we have the fib list, we can iterate through it to find the maximum m.\n\nBut wait, for m=1, Fib(3) is 2.\n\nSo for each m, the required number is Fib(m+2).\n\nWait, so for m=1, Fib(3)=2.\n\nm=2: Fib(4)=3.\n\nm=3: Fib(5)=5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nGenerate Fib up to Fib(k) where Fib(k) >n.\n\nThen, for each possible m, check if Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nFind the largest such m.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nn=10.\n\nCompute Fib up to Fib(7)=13.\n\nCheck m=3: Fib(5)=5 <=10.\n\nm=4: Fib(6)=8 <=10.\n\nm=5: Fib(7)=13>10.\n\nSo, the maximum m is 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, now, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nCompute Fib up to Fib(k) >n.\n\nStore the Fib sequence.\n\nThen, iterate m from 0 to len(fib)-2 (since m+2 is the index).\n\nWait, wait.\n\nWait, for m=0, Fib(2) is 1.\n\nSo, for each m, check if Fib[m+2] <=n.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nmax_games = 0\n\nfor m in range(len(fib)):\n\n    if (m+2) < len(fib):\n\n        if fib[m+2] <=n:\n\n            max_games = m\n\n        else:\n\n            break\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, we can iterate over all possible m, and for each, see if Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nBut how to find the maximum m.\n\nAn alternative approach: for each m, the minimal n needed is Fib(m+2). So, the maximum m is the largest m where Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nSo, the code can be written as follows:\n\nCompute Fib until Fib exceeds n.\n\nThen, starting from m=1, check if Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to iterate m from 0 upwards, and find the maximum m where Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfib = [0, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_val > n:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_val)\n\nThen, for m in 0,1,2,...:\n\nthe required Fib is fib[m+2].\n\nWait, but for m=0, Fib(2) is 1.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nfib = [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13...]\n\nSo, for m=0: m+2=2, Fib(2)=1.\n\nm=1: m+2=3, Fib(3)=2.\n\nm=2: m+2=4, Fib(4)=3.\n\nm=3: m+2=5, Fib(5)=5.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the maximum m is the largest m where fib[m+2] <=n.\n\nSo, for each m in 0 to len(fib)-2:\n\nif fib[m+2] <=n, then candidate is m.\n\nWe can track the maximum.\n\nWait, but what if fib doesn't have m+2? For example, if len(fib) is k, then m can go up to k-2.\n\nSo, the code could be:\n\nmax_m = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(fib)):\n\n    # for each possible m, the Fib is at m+2\n\n    if (i+2) < len(fib) and fib[i+2] <=n:\n\n        max_m = i\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nWait, no. Because for i starting from 0, we can incrementally check if fib[i+2] <=n.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to find the largest m such that fib[m+2] <=n.\n\nSo, the code can be:\n\nmax_games = 0\n\nfor m in range(0, len(fib)):\n\n    if m+2 >= len(fib):\n\n        break\n\n    if fib[m+2] <=n:\n\n        current_max = m\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nWait, but this may not capture all possibilities. Because for example, if fib is [0,1,1,2,3,5,8], for n=7.\n\nLooking for m where fib[m+2] <=7.\n\nm=0: fib[2] =1 <=7 → current_max=0.\n\nm=1: fib[3]=2 <=7 → current_max=1.\n\nm=2: fib[4]=3 <=7 → current_max=2.\n\nm=3: fib[5]=5 <=7 → current_max=3.\n\nm=4: fib[6]=8>7 → break.\n\nSo, maximum m is 3.\n\nWhich is correct, since for n=7, the maximum games is 3.\n\nSo, the code logic seems correct.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the initial fib list starts with 0,1,1.\n\nSo for m=0: fib[2] is 1.\n\nm=1: fib[3]=2.\n\nm=2: fib[4]=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should correctly compute the maximum m.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: n=2.\n\nfib starts as [0,1,1,2].\n\nLooking for m where fib[m+2] <=2.\n\nm=0: fib[2]=1 <=2 → yes.\n\nm=1: fib[3]=2 <=2 → yes.\n\nm=2: fib[4]=3>2 → no. So maximum m is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1. Wait, but n is at least 2.\n\nSo, no issue.\n\nAnother case: n=1: but according to the problem statement, n >=2.\n\nSo, the code should handle all n >=2.\n\nWhat about n=5?\n\nfib is [0,1,1,2,3,5].\n\nLooking for m:\n\nm=0: fib[2]=1 <=5 → yes.\n\nm=1: fib[3]=2 <=5 → yes.\n\nm=2: fib[4]=3 <=5 → yes.\n\nm=3: fib[5]=5 <=5 → yes.\n\nm=4: fib[6]=8>5 → stop.\n\nSo maximum m is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read n from input.\n\n2. Generate the Fibonacci sequence until the next term exceeds n.\n\n3. For each m starting from 0, check if fib[m+2] <=n. Keep track of the maximum m.\n\n4. Output m.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nn = int(input())\n\nThen, generate fib:\n\nfib = [0, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_val > n:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_val)\n\nThen, find the maximum m.\n\nmax_m = 0\n\nfor m in range(len(fib)):\n\n    if (m + 2) >= len(fib):\n\n        break\n\n    if fib[m+2] <= n:\n\n        max_m = m\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nWait, wait. No, because for m=0, m+2=2; for m=1, m+2=3; etc.\n\nSo, the loop should run for all m where m+2 is within the fib list.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nmax_games = 0\n\nfor m in range(len(fib)):\n\n    if m + 2 >= len(fib):\n\n        break\n\n    if fib[m + 2] <= n:\n\n        max_games = m\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nWait, but wait: for m=0, fib[2] is 1.\n\nWhich is <=n if n >=1.\n\nBut for n=2, m=0: fib[2]=1<=2 → yes.\n\nm=1: fib[3]=2<=2 → yes.\n\nm=2: fib[4]=3>2 → break.\n\nSo, max_games is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut in the code above, for each m, we check whether fib[m+2] <=n. If yes, set max_games to m. Else, break.\n\nWait, but this will not always give the maximum m. Because for example, if n=8:\n\nfib is [0,1,1,2,3,5,8].\n\nLooking for m where fib[m+2]<=8.\n\nm=0: 1<=8 → yes.\n\nm=1: 2<=8 → yes.\n\nm=2:3<=8 → yes.\n\nm=3:5<=8 → yes.\n\nm=4:8<=8 → yes.\n\nm=5:13>8 → break.\n\nSo, the max m is 4.\n\nWhich is correct, as 8 is Fib(6), so m=4.\n\nIn the code, during the loop:\n\nm starts at 0.\n\nfib[2]=1 <=8 → max_games=0.\n\nm=1: fib[3]=2 <=8 → max_games=1.\n\nm=2: fib[4]=3 <=8 → max_games=2.\n\nm=3: fib[5]=5 <=8 → max_games=3.\n\nm=4: fib[6]=8 <=8 → max_games=4.\n\nm=5: fib[7]=13>8 → break.\n\nSo, the code correctly returns 4.\n\nBut the code as written uses 'else: break'. So for each m, it checks if fib[m+2] <=n. If yes, set max_games to m. Else, break.\n\nWait, no. Because once any m is found where fib[m+2] >n, we break, assuming that higher m's will also fail.\n\nBut that's not correct. Because for example, m=2 may have fib[m+2]=3 <=n, but m=3's fib[m+2]=5 may be <=n, but m=4's fib[m+2]=8 may be <=n, etc.\n\nSo the code as written will not correctly find the maximum m.\n\nAh, I see. So the code as written will only loop until the first m where fib[m+2] >n, and then stop, which is incorrect.\n\nSo that approach is wrong.\n\nInstead, the code should loop through all possible m and find the maximum.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to loop through all m from 0 up to len(fib)-2, and for each, check if fib[m+2] <=n. Then, keep track of the maximum m.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nmax_games = 0\n\nfor m in range(len(fib) - 1):\n\n    if fib[m + 2] <= n:\n\n        max_games = m\n\n    else:\n\n        pass\n\nBut no, because it's possible that higher m's may still satisfy.\n\nWait, no. Because the Fib sequence is increasing. So if fib[m+2] <=n, then all lower m's may also satisfy.\n\nWait, no, because m increases, fib[m+2] increases as well.\n\nWait, no, for m=0, fib[m+2]=1.\n\nm=1: 2.\n\nm=2:3.\n\nm=3:5.\n\nSo, as m increases, fib[m+2] increases.\n\nSo, the maximum m is the largest m where fib[m+2] <=n.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nmax_games = 0\n\nfor m in range(len(fib) - 1):\n\n    if fib[m + 2] <= n:\n\n        max_games = m\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nBecause once fib[m+2] exceeds n, all higher m's will have larger fib[m+2], so they will also be >n.\n\nThus, the code can break once fib[m+2] >n.\n\nSo, the code becomes:\n\nmax_games = 0\n\nfor m in range(len(fib) - 1):\n\n    if fib[m + 2] <= n:\n\n        max_games = m\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nThis way, for each m in order, we check if fib[m+2] is acceptable. As soon as it's not, we break and return the last m that was acceptable.\n\nThis should correctly find the maximum m.\n\nTesting this with n=10.\n\nfib is [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13].\n\nLoop:\n\nm=0: fib[2]=1 <=10 → max_games=0.\n\nm=1: fib[3]=2 <=10 → max_games=1.\n\nm=2: fib[4]=3 <=10 → max_games=2.\n\nm=3: fib[5]=5 <=10 → max_games=3.\n\nm=4: fib[6]=8 <=10 → max_games=4.\n\nm=5: fib[7]=13>10 → break.\n\nSo, max_games is 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test: n=7.\n\nfib up to 8.\n\nloop:\n\nm=0: 1<=7 → max_games=0.\n\nm=1: 2<=7 →1.\n\nm=2:3<=7 →2.\n\nm=3:5<=7 →3.\n\nm=4:8>7 → break.\n\nSo, max_games=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test: n=5.\n\nfib up to 5.\n\nloop:\n\nm=0:1<=5 →0.\n\nm=1:2<=5 →1.\n\nm=2:3<=5 →2.\n\nm=3:5<=5 →3.\n\nm=4:8>5 →break.\n\nSo, max_games=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nRead n.\n\nGenerate fib until next_val >n.\n\nLoop m from 0 to len(fib)-1:\n\n   if fib[m+2] <=n → update max_games.\n\n   else → break.\n\nFinally, print max_games.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfib = [0, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_val > n:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_val)\n\nmax_games = 0\n\nfor m in range(len(fib) - 1):\n\n    if fib[m + 2] <= n:\n\n        max_games = m\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nprint(max_games)\n\nWait, but let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\nSo, each n in the list is 2,3,4,10.\n\nSample Output is ['1','2','2','4'].\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=2:\n\nfib is [0,1,1,2].\n\nLoop:\n\nm=0: fib[2]=1 <=2 → max_games=0.\n\nm=1: fib[3]=2 <=2 → max_games=1.\n\nm=2: fib[4]=3>2 → break.\n\nSo, output is 1.\n\nn=3:\n\nfib is [0,1,1,2,3].\n\nLoop:\n\nm=0:1<=3 →0.\n\nm=1:2<=3 →1.\n\nm=2:3<=3 →2.\n\nm=3:5>3 →break.\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nn=4:\n\nfib is [0,1,1,2,3,5].\n\nLoop:\n\nm=0:1<=4 →0.\n\nm=1:2<=4 →1.\n\nm=2:3<=4 →2.\n\nm=3:5>4 →break.\n\nSo, output is 2.\n\nn=10:\n\nfib is [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13].\n\nLoop:\n\nm=0:1<=10 →0.\n\nm=1:2 →1.\n\nm=2:3 →2.\n\nm=3:5 →3.\n\nm=4:8 →4.\n\nm=5:13>10 →break.\n\nSo, output is 4.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\nOutput is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test: n=6.\n\nfib is [0,1,1,2,3,5,8].\n\nm=0:1<=6 →0.\n\nm=1:2→1.\n\nm=2:3→2.\n\nm=3:5→3.\n\nm=4:8>6 →break.\n\nOutput is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, following a specific rule where two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by no more than one. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the problem can be modeled using the Fibonacci sequence. Each time the winner plays a game, they must face an opponent who has either played the same number of games or one fewer. This structure is similar to how Fibonacci numbers are generated, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The maximum number of games the winner can play corresponds to the largest Fibonacci number such that the number of players required to achieve that many games does not exceed the given number of players, `n`.\n\n2. **Generate Fibonacci Numbers**: We generate Fibonacci numbers until the next number exceeds `n`. This helps us determine the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n3. **Determine Maximum Games**: Using the generated Fibonacci sequence, we find the largest number of games `m` such that the corresponding Fibonacci number (at position `m+2`) is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nfib = [0, 1]\nwhile True:\n    next_val = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n    if next_val > n:\n        break\n    fib.append(next_val)\nmax_games = 0\nfor m in range(len(fib) - 1):\n    if fib[m + 2] <= n:\n        max_games = m\n    else:\n        break\nprint(max_games)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n`, representing the number of players.\n2. **Generating Fibonacci Sequence**: We start with the initial Fibonacci values `[0, 1]` and keep generating the next Fibonacci number until it exceeds `n`.\n3. **Finding Maximum Games**: We iterate through the generated Fibonacci sequence to find the largest index `m` such that the Fibonacci number at position `m+2` is less than or equal to `n`. This index `m` gives the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of `n = 1018`.",
