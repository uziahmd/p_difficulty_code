She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a girl named Luba who has multiple tabs open in her browser and needs to close some of them as quickly as possible. \n\nHmm, let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the setup is that she has 'n' opened tabs, numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She wants to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. So, all other tabs outside this range need to be closed. \n\nEach second, she can perform one of two actions: move the cursor left or right, but not beyond the current available tabs (because once some are closed, the a and b change). Alternatively, she can close all tabs to the left or right of the current cursor position. \n\nThe goal is to find the minimum number of seconds needed to achieve this.\n\nAlright, let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, we need to consider the initial state. The initial a is 1, and b is n. Then, as she closes tabs, a and b adjust accordingly.\n\nLet me think about the steps she needs to take:\n\n1. She needs to decide which tabs to close. Those are the tabs less than l and greater than r.\n2. For each of these, she can close them by moving the cursor to a certain position and then performing a close operation.\n\nBut the order in which she does this matters because each action changes the available tabs, affecting the possible movements.\n\nWait, but perhaps the optimal strategy is to first move to the optimal position, then close all the necessary tabs in the least steps.\n\nSo, for example, if she needs to close all tabs to the left of l, she can move to position l, then close left. Similarly, for the right, she might want to move to r, then close right.\n\nBut sometimes, maybe she can do both in a single movement and close sequence.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n- Move to the leftmost position to close left tabs: l.\n- Close left (which takes 1 second).\n- Then, move to the rightmost position to close right tabs: r.\n- Close right (another second).\n\nPlus any movement time in between.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she can arrange the order differently to save steps.\n\nWait, but wait—each move is one second, each close is another.\n\nSo, the total steps would be the sum of the moves plus the closes.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to minimize the total.\n\nLet's break down the problem.\n\nWe have four possibilities based on whether we need to close left, right, both, or neither.\n\nCase 1: No tabs need to be closed. That's when l=1 and r=n. Then the answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: Only left needs to be closed. So she can move to l, then close left. The steps would be (distance from pos to l) + 1.\n\nCase 3: Only right needs to be closed. Similarly, move to r, close right. Steps: distance from pos to r + 1.\n\nCase 4: Both left and right need to be closed. So she needs to:\n\n- Move from pos to either l or r, then close that side, then move to the other end, then close again.\n\nBut which order is better? Maybe she can choose the best path.\n\nSo, for case 4, the minimal steps would be:\n\nOption A: Move to l, close left (cost: |pos - l| + 1), then move to r, close right (cost: |l - r| + 1). Total: |pos-l| + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = (|pos-l| + r - l) + 2.\n\nOption B: Move to r, close right (cost: |pos - r| + 1), then move to l, close left (cost: |r - l| + 1). Total: same as option A, since it's symmetric.\n\nOption C: Perhaps find a way to minimize the movement. Like, if she can reach both ends in a way that minimizes the sum.\n\nWait, but moving from pos to l, then to r is |pos-l| + (r-l) steps. Alternatively, moving from pos to r, then to l is |pos-r| + (r-l). So, the order of closing left then right or vice versa doesn't affect the movement steps between l and r, just the order in which the closes happen.\n\nSo, for case 4, the minimal steps would be the minimal of the options where she chooses which end to close first.\n\nWait, no, because she has to close both ends. So the steps are:\n\nMovement to l: |pos - l| steps.\n\nClose left: 1 step.\n\nMovement to r: (r - l) steps.\n\nClose right: ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves calculating the optimal sequence of movements and tab closures.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Need for Closing Tabs**: Determine if any tabs need to be closed. If the current open tabs are already within the segment [l, r], no action is needed.\n2. **Calculate Movement and Closure Steps**:\n   - **Only Left Needs Closing**: Move to position `l` and close all tabs to the left.\n   - **Only Right Needs Closing**: Move to position `r` and close all tabs to the right.\n   - **Both Sides Need Closing**: Calculate the steps required to move to `l`, close the left tabs, then move to `r` and close the right tabs, or vice versa. Choose the path with the minimal total steps.\n3. **Optimal Strategy**: For closing both sides, the optimal approach is to calculate the sum of movements and closures from either moving to `l` first or `r` first, whichever is shorter.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    left_close = False\n    right_close = False\n    if l > 1:\n        left_close = True\n    if r < n:\n        right_close = True\n\n    if not left_close and not right_close:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        if left_close and right_close:\n            # Option 1: go to l, close left, go to r, close right\n            steps1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n            # Option 2: go to r, close right, go to l, close left\n            steps2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n            min_steps = min(steps1, steps2)\n            print(min_steps)\n        elif left_close:\n            # Only close left\n            steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n            print(steps)\n        else:\n            # Only close right\n            steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n            print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Case 1**: If all tabs are within the segment [l, r], no actions are needed.\n- **Case 2**: If only left tabs need closing, move to `l` and close them.\n- **Case 3**: If only right tabs need closing, move to `r` and close them.\n- **Case 4**: If both sides need closing, compute the steps for both possible orders (closing left first or right first) and choose the minimal one.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the minimal steps required by considering all possible scenarios and choosing the optimal path.",
