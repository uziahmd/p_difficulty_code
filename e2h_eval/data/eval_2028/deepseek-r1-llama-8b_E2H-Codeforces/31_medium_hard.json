Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Cards.\" Hmm. Let me read the description carefully.\n\nSo, Vanya has some cards with numbers on them. Each number can be positive, negative, or zero, but their absolute value doesn't exceed x. Natasha hid all his cards, but he found n of them. He wants the sum of all the found cards to be zero. But right now, the sum isn't zero. So, he needs to find some more cards (from the infinite supply of -x to x) to add to the found ones so that the total sum is zero. Our task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nWait, but how do we determine which cards to add? Because each card can have any value from -x to x, but they have to make the sum zero. And we need the minimal number of such cards.\n\nHmm. Let me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this S. Then, we need to find a set of additional cards whose sum is -S. The goal is to minimize the number of cards used for this.\n\nBut each card can contribute at most x towards the sum. Wait, no. Each card can have a value up to x in absolute value. So, each additional card can contribute up to x (positive) or -x (negative), depending on which direction we need.\n\nSo, to achieve a required sum of T = -S, what is the minimal number of cards needed?\n\nLet me think: the minimal number would be when each card contributes as much as possible towards T. Because each card can contribute up to x (in absolute terms). So, the minimal number is the ceiling of |T| divided by x.\n\nWait, let's test this idea with the examples.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nThe sum S is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. So T is -2. The absolute value is 2. x is 2. So 2 / 2 is 1, so minimal 1 card.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nIn the second sample:\n\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nSum S is -4. So T is 4. x is 3. So 4 /3 is 1.333..., which rounds up to 2. So two cards, each contributing 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the given found cards.\n2. Compute T = -S.\n3. The minimal number of cards needed is the minimal k such that k * x >= |T|.\n   Which is the same as k = ceil(|T| / x).\n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? Then, no cards are needed. So that's an edge case to consider.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Calculate S.\n- If S is zero, output 0.\n- Else, compute |T| where T is -S.\n- Compute the minimal k as ceil(|T| / x).\n\nNow, how to implement this in code.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\nRead n and x from input. Then read the list of n integers.\n\nCompute S as the sum of these integers.\n\nIf S is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute T = -S. Compute absolute_T = abs(T).\n\nCompute the minimal number of cards as (absolute_T + x -1) // x. This is integer division rounded up.\n\nWait, let's see. For example, if absolute_T is 4 and x is 3, 4/3 is 1.333, so we need 2. Using (4 +3 -1) //3 = (6)//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: absolute_T=5, x=3: (5+3-1)/3=7/3=2.333 floored is 2, but wait 5/3 is 1.666, which requires 2 cards. So yes, (5 +3-1) //3=7//3=2. Correct.\n\nYes, that formula works.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the next line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute s = sum of the list.\n\nif s ==0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    t = abs(-s)\n    k = (t + x -1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the sum is 2, so t is 2. x is 2. So (2 +2-1)/2=3/2=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose sum is 3, x is 2. So t is 3. (3+2-1)/2=4/2=2. So 2 cards: 2 and 1 (but wait, 2*2=4, which is >=3. So two cards can give sum 4, but maybe one card of 2 and another of 1? Or perhaps 2 and 1, but since each card can be any between -x and x, including 1 and 2. So yes, two cards are enough.\n\nWait, but what about when t is exactly divisible by x? For example, t=4, x=2. 4/2=2, so two cards. That's correct.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nWhat about when t is zero? Then no cards are needed.\n\nSo, code-wise, the steps are:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list, compute sum.\n\nIf sum is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute t as absolute value of sum, then k = (t +x -1) // x.\n\nPrint k.\n\nThat's the plan.\n\nNow, considering edge cases.\n\nTest case 1: n=1, x=5. Found card is 3. Sum is 3. So t=3. x=5. So k=1. Because 3 <=5, so one card can be -3.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=3. Found card is 3. Sum is 3. So t=3. x=3. k=1.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, x=5. Found cards are 5 and 5. Sum is 10. t=10. x=5. 10/5=2, so two cards.\n\nAnother case: n=0? No, because according to input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: the first line contains two integers n and x. Constraints: 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000.\n\nSo n is always ≥1.\n\nAnother edge case: sum is very small.\n\nLike n=2, x=100. Found cards are 1 and 1. Sum is 2. So t=2. x=100. So k=1, because 2 ≤100, so one card of -2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code-wise, that's manageable.\n\nNow, implementing in Python.\n\nRead the first line as n and x. Then read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute sum.\n\nIf sum is zero, print 0.\n\nElse, compute t=abs(-sum). Or wait, no: t is the absolute value of sum. Because T is -sum, so |T|=|sum|. So t = abs(sum).\n\nThen compute k as (t + x -1) // x.\n\nPrint k.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be something like:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nif s ==0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    t = abs(s)\n    k = (t + x -1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first case's output is '1' and the second is '2'.\n\nTesting the code with the samples:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 3 2, cards [-1, 1, 2]\n\nsum is 2. t=2. x=2. (2+2-1)//2=3//2=1. Output 1.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput: 2 3, cards [-2,-2]. sum is -4. t=4. (4+3-1)//3=6//3=2. Output 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=5, cards [3]. sum is 3. t=3. (3+5-1)/5=7//5=1. Output 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x=3. t=5. (5+3-1)/3=7//3=2. So 2 cards.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 0. Output is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his found cards equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: If the current sum is not zero, we need the additional cards to make the total sum zero. Thus, the target sum for the additional cards is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Compute the Minimum Number of Cards**: The goal is to find the smallest number of cards such that their combined value equals the target sum. Each card can contribute at most x towards the target sum. Therefore, the minimum number of cards required is the ceiling of the absolute value of the target sum divided by x.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent_sum = sum(cards)\n\nif current_sum == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    target = abs(current_sum)\n    min_cards = (target + x - 1) // x\n    print(min_cards)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of found cards `n` and the maximum absolute value `x`. It then reads the list of integers representing the values on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed.\n3. **Check for Zero Sum**: If the sum is already zero, no additional cards are needed, so the output is 0.\n4. **Target Calculation**: If the sum is non-zero, the target sum for the additional cards is the absolute value of the negative of the current sum.\n5. **Determine Minimum Cards**: Using integer division, the code calculates the minimum number of cards required by dividing the target sum by x and rounding up to ensure we cover any remainder.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of cards needed using basic arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
