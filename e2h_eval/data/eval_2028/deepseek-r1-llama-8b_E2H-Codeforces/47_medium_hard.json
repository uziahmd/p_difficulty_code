    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Neko does Maths\" and the task is to find a non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple (LCM) of a+k and b+k is as small as possible. If there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, I have to choose the smallest one.\n\nHmm. So, given two integers a and b, I need to compute this k. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem with some examples. Like the sample input: 6 and 10. When k=2, 6+2=8 and 10+2=12. The LCM is 24. But why is that the best? Let's see if other k's give a better result.\n\nFor k=0: 6 and 10. LCM is 30.\nk=1: 7 and 11, LCM is 77.\nk=2: 8 and 12, LCM 24.\nk=3: 9 and 13, LCM 117.\nSo yes, 24 is the smallest here.\n\nAnother sample is 5 and 10. Choosing k=0 gives 5 and 10, whose LCM is 10. Which is the best possible because any higher k would make them larger, but wait, maybe not. Let me check:\n\nk=0: 5 and 10 → LCM 10.\nk=1: 6 and 11 → LCM 66.\nk=2: 7 and 12 → LCM 84.\nSo yes, k=0 is best.\n\nWait, but what about when a and b are equal? Like a = b = x. Then, for any k, a+k = b+k = x +k. So their LCM is x+k. To minimize this, we should choose k=0. Because any larger k would just make x+k larger.\n\nSo, the first thing I notice is that when a == b, the optimal k is 0.\n\nBut when a != b, things get more interesting.\n\nLet me think about the general case.\n\nThe key observation might be that adding the same k to both a and b doesn't change their difference. Because (a +k) - (b +k) = a - b. So the difference remains constant.\n\nWait, that's right. So the difference between a +k and b +k is the same as the original difference between a and b. So the LCM of two numbers depends on their greatest common divisor (GCD). Because LCM(x, y) = x*y / GCD(x,y).\n\nSo, to minimize the LCM, perhaps I should maximize the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k), since a larger GCD would reduce the LCM.\n\nBut wait, since (a +k) and (b +k) differ by d = |a - b|, the GCD of the two will be a divisor of d. Because any common divisor must divide their difference.\n\nSo, the maximum possible GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) is a divisor of d. So, perhaps, the optimal k is chosen such that a +k and b +k have a large GCD, which is a divisor of d.\n\nSo, the approach is to find all possible divisors of d, and for each divisor g, see if there exists a k such that g divides both a +k and b +k. Then, among these possibilities, find the one that gives the minimal LCM.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nLet d = |a - b|. Because the difference remains the same after adding k.\n\nSo, the two numbers are x and x + d, where x = a +k (assuming a >= b, but it doesn't matter because we can swap them if needed).\n\nWe need to find x such that GCD(x, x+d) is as large as possible, which would minimize the LCM.\n\nBecause the LCM(x, x+d) is (x*(x+d)) / GCD(x, x+d). So maximizing the GCD reduces the LCM.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding x where x and x + d have a large GCD. The maximum possible is d itself if x is a multiple of d.\n\nWait, wait. Let me see: suppose d is fixed. What is the maximum possible GCD of x and x +d?\n\nWell, the GCD of x and x +d is the same as the GCD of x and d. Because GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d).\n\nSo, to maximize the GCD, we want x to be a multiple of a divisor of d. Because then, the GCD becomes that divisor.\n\nWait, no. Let's take an example. Suppose d is 4. Then, the GCD of x and x+4 is the same as GCD(x,4). So, the maximum possible GCD is 4, achieved when x is a multiple of 4. For example, x=4: GCD(4,8)=4. x=8: GCD(8,12)=4. So yeah.\n\nSo, for each possible divisor g of d, we can try to find the smallest x such that x is congruent to 0 mod g. Because then, GCD(x, x +d) would be g, since d is a multiple of g (since g is a divisor of d).\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|. If d is zero, return k=0.\n\n2. Otherwise, find all the divisors of d. For each divisor g, find the minimal k such that (a +k) mod g == 0. Then compute the corresponding x (a +k) and calculate the LCM.\n\n3. Among all possible g's, select the one that gives the minimal LCM. If multiple g's give the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nBut wait, what if d is zero? Then a and b are equal, so any k will make a+k = b +k, so the LCM is a +k. To minimize this, set k=0.\n\nSo, step 1: if a == b, output k=0.\n\nElse, proceed with step 2.\n\nNow, the question is, how do I efficiently find all the divisors of d? Because d can be up to 1e9, but even that is manageable since the number of divisors is up to around 1e5 or so.\n\nWait, but for d up to 1e9, the number of divisors is O(sqrt(d)), which is about 3e4 or something like that. So it's manageable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute d = |a - b|.\n\nFind all the divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g of d, compute the minimal k such that (a +k) is divisible by g. Since a +k ≡ 0 mod g → k ≡ (-a) mod g. So the minimal non-negative k is (g - (a % g)) % g. Because a mod g can be zero, in which case k is zero.\n\nOnce we have k, compute x = a +k, y = b +k. The LCM is x * y / g, since GCD(x, y) = g.\n\nWe then track for each g, the minimal possible LCM and the corresponding k.\n\nBut wait, for each g, the k computed may not be the minimal possible. Or maybe it is? Because for a given g, the minimal k is the one that makes x divisible by g. So, that's the earliest point where the GCD becomes g.\n\nSo, for each divisor g, calculate k as (g - (a mod g)) % g. Then compute the LCM as (x * y)/g, where x = a +k, y = b +k.\n\nBut wait, for each g, the k is unique? Because for a particular g, the equation a +k ≡ 0 mod g has exactly one solution modulo g. So, the minimal non-negative k is (g - (a mod g)) % g. But since mod is always non-negative, (g - (a mod g)) % g is equivalent to ( -a ) mod g. Which is the same as (g - (a mod g)) when a mod g is not zero, else zero.\n\nSo, for each g, we can calculate k and then the LCM.\n\nThen, among all possible g's, including those beyond the divisors of d? Wait, no—because the maximum possible GCD is a divisor of d. So considering all divisors of d is sufficient.\n\nWait, but perhaps the optimal k isn't obtained through a divisor of d. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think again. The GCD of x and x +d is equal to the GCD of x and d. So, for x and x +d, their GCD can't be larger than any divisor of d. So, the maximum possible GCD is the maximum divisor of d.\n\nThus, to find the maximum possible GCD, we only need to consider the divisors of d.\n\nTherefore, the approach is correct.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nIf a == b, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute d = |a - b|\n\nGenerate all the divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g in the divisors, sorted in decreasing order (so that we can find the largest possible g first, but perhaps not necessary):\n\nCalculate the required k as (g - (a mod g)) % g.\n\nThen, compute x = a +k, y = b +k.\n\nCompute the LCM as (x * y) // g.\n\nTrack the minimal LCM value and the corresponding k. If multiple k's give the same LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nWait, but why process the divisors in any order? Because perhaps a smaller g could give a better LCM if the resulting k is smaller, even though the GCD is smaller. Hmm.\n\nWait, for example, let's say d=6. Divisors are 1,2,3,6.\n\nSuppose a=5, b=11. So d=6.\n\nFor g=6: k = (6 - (5 mod 6)) mod6 → 6-5=1 mod6=1. So x=6, y=12. LCM=6*12/6=12.\n\nFor g=3: k=(3 - (5 mod3)) mod3 → 5 mod3 is 2. 3-2=1 mod3=1. So x=6, y=12. Same as above.\n\nWait, but that's the same x and y as when g=6. So perhaps the LCM is same for different g's.\n\nWait, but in another example:\n\na=4, b=10 → d=6.\n\ng=6: k=(6-4%6) mod6 → 6-4=2 mod6=2. x=6, y=12 → LCM=12.\n\ng=3: k=(3 - (4 mod3)) mod3 → 4 mod3=1. 3-1=2 mod3=2. x=6, y=12 → same as before.\n\ng=2: k=(2 - (4 mod2)) mod2 → 4 mod2=0. So 2-0=2 mod2=0. So k=0. x=4, y=10. Their GCD is 2. LCM is 20.\n\nWhich is better than 12.\n\nAh, so sometimes a smaller g can lead to a smaller LCM.\n\nSo, the approach is to process all divisors, compute for each the corresponding k, the LCM, and then choose the one with the minimal LCM. If tie, choose the smallest k.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. If a == b, output k=0.\n\n2. Else, compute d = |a - b|.\n\n3. Find all the divisors of d.\n\n4. For each divisor g, compute k = (g - (a % g)) % g.\n\n   Also, since (a +k) could be less than (b +k), but it's not an issue because LCM is same regardless.\n\n5. Compute x = a +k, y = b +k. Compute current_gcd = GCD(x, y). But since x and y differ by d, current_gcd should be g, because GCD(x, x+d) = GCD(x, d). Since g divides d, and x is a multiple of g, the GCD is indeed g.\n\n6. Compute the LCM as (x * y) // g.\n\n7. Keep track of the minimal LCM and the minimal k in case of ties.\n\nBut wait, for each g, the k is determined uniquely as the minimal k to make a +k divisible by g. So, for each g, we can compute k, and then the LCM.\n\nSo, the plan is to generate all the divisors of d, compute for each the k and the corresponding LCM, then select the one with the smallest LCM. If multiple options have the same LCM, pick the smallest k.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about how to compute all the divisors of d.\n\nTo find all divisors of d, we can factorize d into its prime factors, then generate all possible products of the factors.\n\nAlternatively, we can iterate from 1 to sqrt(d), and collect all divisors.\n\nBut for d up to 1e9, iterating up to sqrt(d) is acceptable because sqrt(1e9) is 3e4, which is manageable.\n\nSo, code-wise, I can write a function to find all the divisors of d.\n\nOnce I have all the divisors, including 1 and d, I can loop through each, compute k, then compute the LCM, and track the best.\n\nWait, but for each g, it's a divisor of d, so when we process g, we can compute k as (g - (a % g)) % g.\n\nWait, but perhaps a is already larger than g? For example, a is 5, g is 3. 5 mod3 is 2, so 3-2=1, so k=1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when a is smaller than g? Like a=3, g=5. 3 mod5 is 3, so 5-3=2, so k=2. a +k =5, which is divisible by g=5.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, after computing k for each g, the x is a +k, which is divisible by g.\n\nBut the GCD of x and x +d is g, because x is a multiple of g, and x +d is also a multiple of g (since d is a multiple of g). So, the GCD is at least g. But since g is a divisor of d, the maximum possible GCD is g, so it's exactly g.\n\nSo, the LCM is (x*(x+d))//g.\n\nBut wait, x and x+d may share a larger GCD than g. Or am I wrong?\n\nNo, because the GCD of x and x +d is GCD(x, d). Since g is a divisor of d, and x is a multiple of g, the GCD is exactly g.\n\nWait, for example: x=6, d=6. x +d=12. GCD(6,12)=6.\n\nx=6, d=4. x +d=10. GCD(6,4)=2.\n\nBut 2 is a divisor of 4.\n\nSo, yes, the GCD is exactly g, which is a divisor of d.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this.\n\nBut wait, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 10 → d=4.\n\nDivisors of 4 are 1,2,4.\n\nFor each g:\n\ng=4: k=(4 - (6 mod4)) mod4 → 6 mod4 is 2. 4-2=2 → k=2.\n\nx=8, y=12. LCM= (8*12)/4 = 24.\n\ng=2: k=(2 - (6 mod2)) mod2 → 6 mod2=0 → 2-0=2 mod2=0. So k=0.\n\nx=6, y=10. LCM= (6*10)/2 = 30.\n\ng=1: k=(1 - (6 mod1)) mod1 → 6 mod1 is 0 → 1-0=1 mod1=0. So k=0.\n\nx=6, y=10. Same as above.\n\nSo, the minimal LCM is 24, achieved when k=2. So output 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: 21 31 → d=10.\n\nDivisors of 10: 1,2,5,10.\n\nFor each g:\n\ng=10: k = (10 - (21 mod10)) mod10 → 21 mod10=1 → 10-1=9 mod10=9.\n\nx=30, y=40. LCM= (30*40)/10=120.\n\ng=5: k=5 - (21 mod5)=5-1=4 mod5=4. x=25, y=35. LCM= (25*35)/5=175.\n\ng=2: k=2 - (21 mod2)=0 → k=0. x=21, y=31. LCM= (21*31)/1=651.\n\ng=1: k=1 - (21 mod1)=0 → k=0. Same as above.\n\nSo, the minimal LCM is 120, achieved at k=9. So output is 9.\n\nThird sample: 5 10 → d=5.\n\nDivisors: 1,5.\n\ng=5: k=5 - (5 mod5)=5-0=5 mod5=0. So x=5, y=10. LCM= (5*10)/5=10.\n\ng=1: k=1 - (5 mod1)=0 → x=5, y=10. Same as above.\n\nSo, the minimal LCM is 10, achieved at k=0. So output 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=7 → d=2.\n\nDivisors: 1,2.\n\ng=2: k=(2 -5 mod2)=2-1=1. x=6, y=8. LCM= (6*8)/2=24.\n\ng=1: k=0. x=5, y=7. LCM=35.\n\nSo, the minimal is 24, achieved at k=1.\n\nBut wait, what about k=0: 5 and 7, LCM is 35. So yes, choosing k=1 is better.\n\nAnother test case: a=8, b=12 → d=4.\n\ng=4: k=4-8 mod4=4-0=4. x=12, y=16. LCM=48.\n\ng=2: k=2-0=2. x=10, y=14. LCM=70.\n\ng=1: k=0. x=8, y=12. LCM=24.\n\nWait, but in this case, the minimal LCM is 24, achieved at k=0.\n\nSo according to our approach, for each g, compute k, then compute the LCM.\n\nWait, but wait: when g=1, k=0. So the LCM is (8*12)/1=96. Oh wait, no! Because when g=1, the LCM is (8+0)*(12+0) / 1 = 8*12=96. That's not better than when k=4.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis suggested that for g=4, the LCM is 48, which is smaller than 96.\n\nSo, why did I think earlier that for g=1, the LCM is 96, which is worse than 48.\n\nSo, the minimal is 48, achieved at k=4.\n\nSo, in this case, the approach correctly chooses the k=4.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I thought that for g=4, k is 4, leading to x=12, y=16. LCM is 48.\n\nBut when g=2, k is 2, x=10, y=14. GCD is 2, LCM is (10*14)/2=70, which is larger than 48.\n\nSo, the minimal is 48.\n\nSo, the approach correctly finds the best k.\n\nHmm, but in the initial example I thought of, when a=8, b=12, the minimal LCM is 48, achieved at k=4.\n\nSo, the approach seems to work.\n\nSo, now, the plan is to implement this.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nIf a == b, print 0.\n\nElse, compute d = abs(a - b).\n\nFind all divisors of d.\n\nSort them in some order, perhaps from largest to smallest, but it doesn't matter as we'll compute all.\n\nFor each divisor g in divisors:\n\n   compute rem = a % g.\n\n   k = (g - rem) % g → but since rem is in [0, g), (g - rem) mod g is same as (g - rem) if rem !=0, else 0.\n\n   So, k can be written as (g - (a % g)) % g.\n\n   Compute x = a +k\n\n   y = b +k\n\n   current_lcm = (x * y) // g\n\n   Compare with the current best.\n\nBut wait, in cases where a < b, but when we add k, a +k could be greater than b +k. But it's irrelevant because LCM is the same regardless of order.\n\nBut in code, x and y are just a +k and b +k, but since d is |a - b|, the difference is fixed.\n\nNow, for each g, compute k, x, y, and the LCM.\n\nWe need to track the minimal LCM, and the minimal k in case of ties.\n\nNow, to implement this, the code needs to:\n\n- Generate all divisors of d.\n\nImplementing a function to find all divisors of d.\n\nFunction to get all divisors:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) +1):\n        if n % i ==0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nWait, but for n=0, it's a problem, but in our case, d is |a -b|, and since a != b, d >=1.\n\nSo, this function is safe.\n\nBut for n=1, the divisors are {1}.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nOnce we have all the divisors, we can process them.\n\nNow, for each g in divisors:\n\ncompute rem = a % g\n\nk = (g - rem) % g → but rem can be 0, so k can be zero.\n\nThen, x = a +k, y = b +k.\n\nBut wait, what if a +k is negative? No, because a and b are at least 1, and k is non-negative. So, x and y are positive.\n\nSo, no problem.\n\nCompute current_lcm = (x * y) // g.\n\nCompare with the best.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nInitialize best_lcm as a very high value, say infinity.\n\nbest_k as None.\n\nfor each g in divisors:\n\n    rem = a % g\n\n    k = (g - rem) % g\n\n    x = a + k\n\n    y = b + k\n\n    current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)  # but as discussed, this should be g.\n\n    current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n\n    if current_lcm < best_lcm:\n\n        best_lcm = current_lcm\n\n        best_k = k\n\n    elif current_lcm == best_lcm:\n\n        if k < best_k:\n\n            best_k = k\n\nSo, after processing all g's, output best_k.\n\nWait, but why compute current_gcd? Because in theory, it should be g, but due to some edge cases, perhaps it's better to compute it directly.\n\nBut for the purpose of calculating the LCM, it's better to use the actual GCD.\n\nSo, compute current_gcd as math.gcd(x, y).\n\nSo, in code, it's better to compute it accurately.\n\nBut wait, for a=5, b=10, d=5.\n\ng=5: k=0. x=5, y=10. current_gcd is 5.\n\ncurrent_lcm=5*10 /5=10.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: a=5, b=7.\n\ng=2: x=6, y=8. current_gcd is 2. current_lcm= (6*8)/2=24.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, computing the current_gcd is necessary.\n\nSo, in code, after computing x and y, compute current_gcd as math.gcd(x, y).\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, let's think about the case when d is 0.\n\nIn code, if a == b, output 0.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nSo, the code will handle that.\n\nNow, what about when a > b?\n\nLike a=10, b=6.\n\nd=4.\n\nSame as earlier case.\n\nIt doesn't matter because the code uses absolute difference.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nSample input 6 10: code will compute d=4, divisors 1,2,4.\n\nProcessing g=4:\n\nrem=6 mod4=2. k=4-2=2.\n\nx=8, y=12. current_gcd=4. current_lcm=24.\n\nProcessing g=2:\n\nrem=6 mod2=0 →k=0.\n\nx=6, y=10. current_gcd=2. current_lcm=30.\n\nProcessing g=1:\n\nrem=6 mod1=0 →k=0.\n\nx=6, y=10. current_gcd=2. current_lcm=30.\n\nSo, the best is 24, achieved at k=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: a=5, b=7.\n\nd=2.\n\ndivisors 1,2.\n\ng=2:\n\nrem=5 mod2=1 →k=1.\n\nx=6, y=8. current_gcd=2. current_lcm=24.\n\ng=1:\n\nk=0.\n\nx=5, y=7. current_gcd=1. current_lcm=35.\n\nSo, 24 is better.\n\nNow, another test case: a=9, b=15 →d=6.\n\ndivisors:1,2,3,6.\n\ng=6: k= (6 -9 mod6) mod6 →9 mod6=3 →6-3=3 mod6=3. x=12, y=18. current_gcd=6. current_lcm=36.\n\ng=3: rem=9 mod3=0 →k=0. x=9, y=15. current_gcd=3. current_lcm=45.\n\ng=2: rem=9 mod2=1 →k=1. x=10, y=16. current_gcd=2. current_lcm= (10*16)/2=80.\n\ng=1: k=0. x=9, y=15. current_gcd=3. current_lcm=45.\n\nSo, the minimal LCM is 36, achieved at k=3.\n\nSo, output 3.\n\nSo, code seems to handle this.\n\nNow, what about the case where d is 1.\n\nFor example, a=3, b=4.\n\nd=1.\n\ndivisors:1.\n\ng=1.\n\nrem=3 mod1=0 →k=0.\n\nx=3, y=4. current_gcd=1. current_lcm=12.\n\nWhich is the minimal possible.\n\nBut wait, can we find a better k?\n\nWhat if k=1: x=4, y=5. LCM=20>12.\n\nk=2:5 and 6→30>12.\n\nSo, yes, 12 is the minimal.\n\nSo, code works.\n\nAnother case: a=1, b=2.\n\nd=1.\n\nOnly g=1.\n\nk=0.\n\nx=1, y=2. LCM=2.\n\nWhich is the minimal.\n\nNow, think about when d is a square.\n\nLike d=9.\n\ndivisors:1,3,9.\n\na=7, b=16.\n\nd=9.\n\ng=9: rem=7 mod9=7 →k=2.\n\nx=9, y=25. current_gcd=9. current_lcm= (9*25)/9=25.\n\ng=3: rem=7 mod3=1 →k=2.\n\nx=9, y=25. current_gcd=3. current_lcm=75.\n\ng=1: rem=7 mod1=0 →k=0.\n\nx=7, y=16. current_gcd=1. current_lcm=112.\n\nSo, the minimal is 25, achieved at k=2.\n\nSo, code correctly selects it.\n\nNow, the last thing to think about is time constraints.\n\nFor a and b up to 1e9, d can be up to 1e9.\n\nComputing the divisors is O(sqrt(d)), which is up to 3e4 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code should run within time limits.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\nCase 1: a =1, b=1 → output 0.\n\nCase 2: a=1, b=2 → output 0. Because LCM is 2.\n\nCase3: a=1e9, b=1e9+1 → d=1. So, output k=0.\n\nCase4: a=1e9-1, b=1e9+1 →d=2. So, the best k is 0: x=999,999,999, y=1e9+1. GCD is 1, LCM is 999,999,999 * 1e9+1.\n\nBut wait, for g=2: k= (2 - ( (1e9-1) mod 2 )) → 1e9-1 is odd, mod2 is 1. So 2-1=1 mod2=1. So k=1. x=1e9, y=1e9+2. current_gcd=2. current_lcm= (1e9 * (1e9+2))/2.\n\nWhich is bigger than the previous option.\n\nWait, no. Let's compute:\n\nFor k=0: x=999,999,999, y=1,000,000,001.\n\ncurrent_gcd = 1.\n\ncurrent_lcm = 999,999,999 * 1,000,000,001 ≈ 1e18.\n\nFor k=1: x=1e9, y=1e9+2.\n\ncurrent_gcd=2.\n\ncurrent_lcm= (1e9 * (1e9+2)) / 2 = (1e18 + 2e9)/2 = 5e17 + 1e9.\n\nWhich is much smaller than 1e18.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimal LCM is achieved when k=1.\n\nSo, the code should correctly choose k=1.\n\nSo, in this case, the code will process g=2, compute k=1, and the LCM is 5e17+1e9, which is better than when k=0.\n\nThus, the code will correctly choose k=1.\n\nAnother edge case: when d=0.\n\nSo, code correctly returns k=0.\n\nAnother edge case: when a=0, but the problem statement says 1 <= a, b <=1e9, so a and b can't be zero.\n\nWait, looking back, the problem statement says: 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1e9. So, a and b are at least 1.\n\nSo, no need to handle a=0 or b=0.\n\nAnother test case: a=2, b=3.\n\nd=1.\n\ng=1: k=0. x=2, y=3. LCM=6.\n\nIs there a better k? Let's see.\n\nk=1: 3 and4 → LCM=12>6.\n\nk=2:4 and5 →20>6.\n\nSo, no. So, output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: a=4, b=7.\n\nd=3.\n\ndivisors:1,3.\n\ng=3: rem=4 mod3=1 →k=2.\n\nx=6, y=9. current_gcd=3. current_lcm= (6*9)/3=18.\n\ng=1: rem=4 mod1=0 →k=0.\n\nx=4, y=7. current_gcd=1. current_lcm=28.\n\nSo, minimal is 18, achieved at k=2.\n\nSo, code will output 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, now, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nWe'll read a and b as integers.\n\nIf a == b: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute d = abs(a - b).\n\nFind all divisors of d.\n\nSort them in increasing or any order; doesn't matter.\n\nFor each g in divisors:\n\ncompute rem = a % g.\n\nk = (g - rem) % g.\n\nx = a +k.\n\ny = b +k.\n\ncurrent_gcd = math.gcd(x, y).\n\ncurrent_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd.\n\nCompare with best.\n\nNow, in Python, the math.gcd function returns the positive GCD.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nif a == b:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    d = abs(a - b)\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    best_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = None\n    for g in divisors:\n        rem = a % g\n        k = (g - rem) % g\n        x = a + k\n        y = b + k\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n        if current_lcm < best_lcm:\n            best_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k\n        elif current_lcm == best_lcm:\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n    print(best_k)\n\nWait, but in the code, the divisors are returned as a sorted list. Does the order matter? Because for each divisor, the code processes it and keeps track of the best. It doesn't matter whether the divisors are processed in increasing or decreasing order, because for each, it's considered.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 6 10 → Output 2.\n\nSample Input 2: 21 31 → Output 9.\n\nSample Input 3:5 10 → Output 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=2, b=3 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: a=4, b=7 → output 2.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=7 → output 1.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's test the case where a=1e9, b=1e9+1.\n\nd=1.\n\ndivisors:1.\n\ng=1:\n\nrem=1e9 %1=0 →k=0.\n\nx=1e9, y=1e9+1.\n\ncurrent_gcd=1.\n\ncurrent_lcm=1e9*(1e9+1) → which is 1e18+1e9.\n\nBut for g=1, it's the only option.\n\nWait, but wait, is there a better k?\n\nLike k=1e9+1 -1e9 =1.\n\nWait, but in the code, for g=1, k is 0.\n\nBut perhaps adding k=1 would make x=1e9+1, y=1e9+2.\n\nTheir GCD is 1.\n\ncurrent_lcm is (1e9+1)(1e9+2)/1 = ... which is larger than 1e18+1e9.\n\nSo, no improvement.\n\nSo, the code correctly outputs 0.\n\nWait, but wait, when d=1, the code only considers g=1.\n\nBut perhaps adding k=1 is better.\n\nNo, in that case, the LCM is (1e9+1)*(1e9+2) = (1e9+1.5e9 + 2) = 1.5e18 + 2, which is larger than 1e18+1e9.\n\nSo, code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=5. d=2.\n\ndivisors:1,2.\n\ng=2: rem=3 mod2=1 →k=1.\n\nx=4, y=6. current_gcd=2. current_lcm=12.\n\ng=1: rem=3 mod1=0 →k=0.\n\nx=3, y",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find a non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - The key observation is that adding the same \\( k \\) to both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) does not change their difference. Thus, the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) depends on their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n   - The GCD of two numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) (where \\( y = x + d \\)) is the same as the GCD of \\( x \\) and \\( d \\). Here, \\( d \\) is the absolute difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n2. **Divisors of \\( d \\)**:\n   - To maximize the GCD, we consider all divisors of \\( d \\). Each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\) can potentially be the GCD of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) for some \\( k \\).\n\n3. **Finding Optimal \\( k \\)**:\n   - For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), compute the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( (a + k) \\) is divisible by \\( g \\). This \\( k \\) is given by \\( (g - (a \\% g)) \\% g \\).\n   - Calculate the LCM for each valid \\( k \\) and track the minimum LCM and corresponding \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), the optimal \\( k \\) is 0 because the LCM of two equal numbers is the number itself.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nif a == b:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    d = abs(a - b)\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    best_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = None\n    for g in divisors:\n        rem = a % g\n        k = (g - rem) % g\n        x = a + k\n        y = b + k\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n        if current_lcm < best_lcm:\n            best_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k\n        elif current_lcm == best_lcm:\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n    print(best_k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Divisors Calculation**: The function `get_divisors` computes all divisors of a given number \\( n \\) efficiently by iterating up to the square root of \\( n \\).\n- **Main Logic**: After reading the input values \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), we handle the special case where \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\) by directly outputting 0. Otherwise, we compute the absolute difference \\( d \\) and find all its divisors.\n- **Optimal \\( k \\) Calculation**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), we determine the smallest \\( k \\) that makes \\( a + k \\) divisible by \\( g \\). We then compute the LCM for each valid \\( k \\) and keep track of the minimum LCM and the corresponding \\( k \\).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal \\( k \\) by leveraging the properties of divisors and GCD, ensuring the solution is both correct and efficient.",
