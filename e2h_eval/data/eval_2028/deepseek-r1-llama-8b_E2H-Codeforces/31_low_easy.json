Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Cards.\" Hmm. Let me read the description carefully.\n\nSo, Vanya has some cards with numbers on them. Each number can be positive, negative, or zero, but their absolute value doesn't exceed x. Natasha hid all his cards, but he found n of them. He wants the sum of all the found cards to be zero. But right now, the sum isn't zero. So, he needs to find some more cards (from the infinite supply of -x to x) to add to the found ones so that the total sum is zero. Our task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nWait, but how do we determine which cards to add? Because each card can have any value as long as its absolute value is at most x. So, for example, if the current sum is S, then the minimal number of cards needed would be determined by how far S is from zero, but considering that each added card can contribute up to x towards the sum.\n\nLet me think about the approach here. \n\nFirst, calculate the sum of the current found cards. Let's call this sum 'current_sum'. Then, the target is to make the total sum zero by adding some new cards. Let's denote the number of new cards as k. Each of these can contribute at most x towards the sum (since each card's value can be up to x in absolute value).\n\nSo, the maximum possible contribution from k cards is k * x. But wait, since each card can be positive or negative, the actual contribution could vary. Wait, no: because to reach a certain sum, you can choose the sign of each card. So, for the required sum, say 'required_sum', we need to find the minimal k such that |required_sum| <= k * x.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The current sum is S. We need to add some cards such that S + (sum of new cards) = 0. So the sum of new cards must be -S. Let's call this target T = -S.\n\nNow, T is the sum we need to achieve with the new cards. Each new card can contribute at most x (positive or negative). So, the minimal number of cards needed is the minimal k where |T| <= k * x. Because each card can contribute up to x towards T. \n\nBut wait, what if T is not divisible by x? Like, suppose T is 5 and x is 3. Then, 5 is greater than 3*1=3, but 5 is less than 3*2=6. So, 2 cards are needed because one card can't cover 5. So, the minimal k is the ceiling of |T|/x.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. For example, T = 5, x = 3. What's the minimal k?\n\nIf k=2, the maximum sum is 2*3=6 >=5, so it's possible. So yes, k is 2.\n\nAnother example: T=4, x=3. Then, 4/3 is approximately 1.333. So ceil(4/3) is 2. So again, k=2.\n\nWait, but what if T is zero? Then no cards are needed. That's a special case.\n\nSo, the steps I need to follow are:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the found cards.\n2. Compute T = -sum_found. Because we need the sum of new cards to be T.\n3. If T is zero, output 0.\n4. Else, compute the minimal k such that |T| <= k * x.\n   - That is, k is the ceiling of |T| / x.\n   - But wait, what if |T| is exactly divisible by x? Then, k is |T|/x. Otherwise, it's |T|/x +1, rounded up.\n\nSo, for example:\nIf T=3, x=3 → k=1.\nT=4, x=3 → k=2.\nT=0 → k=0.\n\nSo, how to calculate this in code?\n\nIn Python, to compute the ceiling of a division without using floating points, perhaps using integer operations. Because when |T| is divided by x, if there's a remainder, we add 1.\n\nWait, but for negative T? Well, the absolute value is taken, so it's okay.\n\nSo, first step: compute sum_found.\n\nThen, compute T = -sum_found.\n\nIf T is zero, return 0.\n\nElse, compute absolute value of T, then divide by x.\n\nIf the division is exact, then k is that quotient.\n\nElse, quotient + 1.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me test with examples.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his found cards equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: The target sum for the new cards is the negative of the current sum because adding this target sum will make the total sum zero.\n3. **Check for Zero Target Sum**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Compute Minimum Cards**: If the target sum is non-zero, calculate the absolute value of the target sum. The minimum number of cards required is the ceiling of the division of this absolute value by x. This ensures that each card contributes as much as possible towards reaching the target sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nfound = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_found = sum(found)\nT = -sum_found\n\nif T == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_T = abs(T)\n    k = (abs_T + x - 1) // x  # Equivalent to ceiling division\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Step 1**: Compute the sum of the found cards.\n- **Step 2**: Determine the target sum for the new cards, which is the negative of the current sum.\n- **Step 3**: If the target sum is zero, print 0 as no additional cards are needed.\n- **Step 4**: Calculate the minimum number of cards required using ceiling division. This is done by adding x - 1 to the absolute value of the target sum before performing integer division by x. This effectively rounds up the result to the nearest whole number, giving the minimum number of cards needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal number of additional cards required to balance the sum to zero, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
