Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Selling Souvenirs.\" Hmm, I need to find the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry without exceeding the weight limit m.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again carefully. So, we have n souvenirs, each with a weight wi and a cost ci. We need to select a subset where the sum of weights is <= m, and the sum of costs is as large as possible. Got it.\n\nThe constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Hmm, that's a pretty big size. So any solution with O(n*m) time complexity is definitely out of the question because 1e5 * 3e5 is 3e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nWait, but the weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3. Oh right, because each wi is between 1 and 3. That's an important detail. So maybe we can group the souvenirs by their weights and process them accordingly.\n\nSo here's the plan: since the weights are small (only 1, 2, 3), perhaps we can use dynamic programming based on the number of items of each weight. But how?\n\nLet me think about the dynamic programming approach. Normally, for the knapsack problem, when the weight is not bounded, we'd use a 1D DP array. But with the small weights, maybe we can optimize it.\n\nAnother idea is to split the souvenirs into groups based on their weight. For example, group all w=1 souvenirs together, all w=2, and all w=3. Then, for each group, sort them in descending order of cost. This way, when selecting, we take the most valuable items first within each group.\n\nBut how do we combine these groups optimally? Because the total weight from each group must add up to <= m.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this as a 3-dimensional DP, where dp[i][j][k] represents the maximum cost achievable by taking i items of weight 1, j items of weight 2, and k items of weight 3. But considering that n is up to 1e5, this might not be feasible because i, j, k could each be up to 1e5, leading to a 1e15 state space which is way too big.\n\nWait, but maybe we can precompute prefix sums for each weight group. Let's see.\n\nFor each weight w, we'll sort the souvenirs in descending order of cost. Then, compute the prefix sums for each group. So for w=1, the prefix sum array S1 will have S1[i] being the sum of the first i items' costs. Similarly for S2 and S3.\n\nOnce we have these prefix sums, the problem reduces to selecting a certain number of items from each group such that the total weight is <= m and the total cost is maximized. But how do we efficiently find the optimal selection?\n\nThis seems like a variation of the 0-1 knapsack problem with multiple item groups. Since each group contributes a fixed weight per item, we can model the problem as selecting x1, x2, x3 such that 1*x1 + 2*x2 + 3*x3 ≤ m, and we want to maximize S1[x1] + S2[x2] + S3[x3].\n\nNow, the challenge is to find the best x1, x2, x3 that satisfy the constraint and maximize the sum.\n\nBut with x1, x2, x3 potentially up to 1e5 each, trying all possibilities is impossible. We need a smarter way.\n\nAn alternative approach is to fix two variables and compute the third, but even that could be expensive. Alternatively, perhaps we can iterate over one variable and compute the best for the other two.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible maximums. For each group, the prefix sum arrays are non-decreasing. So for each possible x3, the maximum x2 and x1 can be found in O(1) time using binary search.\n\nBut x3 can be up to min(m // 3, the size of S3). Similarly for x2 and x1. So maybe we can loop through x3, then for each x3, loop through x2, and then find the maximum x1 that fits. But that would still be O(n^2), which is 1e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nHmm, maybe another angle. Since each group is sorted, perhaps we can consider that for a given x3, the remaining weight is m - 3*x3. Then, for this remaining weight, the maximum sum from the w=1 and w=2 groups is a 2-variable knapsack problem, but with the additional constraint that the sum of 1*x1 + 2*x2 <= rem_weight.\n\nWait, but even that is tricky because for each x3, we have to solve a 2-variable problem, which may be computationally heavy.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the weights are 1, 2, 3, maybe we can model the problem using a 4-dimensional DP, but that's probably not feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem as a 3-stage DP. Let's think of the state as (remaining weight). For each state, we can track the maximum cost possible by considering adding items of weight 1, then 2, then 3.\n\nWait, no. Maybe we can represent the DP as follows:\n\nWe can process the items in three steps: first process all w=1 items, then w=2, then w=3. But I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for each possible number of items taken from the w=3 group, say k, we can compute the maximum possible sum from the w=1 and w=2 groups given the remaining weight.\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\n1. Preprocess each group by sorting and computing prefix sums.\n\n2. Iterate over all possible k (number of items from w=3 group). For each k, calculate the maximum number of items we can take from the w=2 group (x2) such that 2*x2 ≤ rem_weight = m - 3*k.\n\n3. For each k and x2, compute the maximum x1 from the w=1 group such that x1 ≤ rem_weight - 2*x2.\n\nBut even this approach could be O(n^2), which is not feasible.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find for each k, the maximum x2 such that 2*x2 ≤ rem_weight, and then for the remaining weight rem_weight - 2*x2, find the maximum x1.\n\nBut how to compute x2 and x1 quickly.\n\nAh, right! Because the prefix sums are sorted, for a given rem_weight, the maximum x2 is the largest possible such that 2*x2 ≤ rem_weight, and also x2 doesn't exceed the number of items in the w=2 group.\n\nSo for each k, we can compute rem_weight = m - 3*k. If rem_weight <0, skip this k.\n\nThen, the maximum x2 is min(rem_weight//2, len(S2)-1). Wait, no. Because rem_weight is the maximum possible weight allowed for x2 and x1. So for x2, the maximum possible is floor(rem_weight / 2). But also, the number of items in the w=2 group is len(S2), so x2 can't exceed that.\n\nSo for each k, rem_weight = m - 3*k. If rem_weight <0, continue.\n\nCompute max_x2 = min(rem_weight // 2, len(S2)).\n\nBut wait, even if we have more than max_x2 items, perhaps some combination of x2 and x1 gives a better sum.\n\nWait, no. Because S2 is the prefix sum for w=2, sorted in descending order. So the maximum sum for x2 items is S2[max_x2]. Then, for the remaining weight, which is rem_weight - 2*x2, we can take as many x1 as possible.\n\nBut how to find the best x2 and x1 for a given k.\n\nAlternatively, for each k, the maximum x2 is the minimum between (rem_weight // 2) and len(S2). Then, for this x2, the weight used is 2*x2, leaving rem_weight_1 = rem_weight - 2*x2.\n\nThen, the maximum x1 is min(rem_weight_1, len(S1)).\n\nSo for each k, the total cost is S3[k] + S2[x2] + S1[x1], where x2 is min( (m-3k)//2, len(S2) ), and x1 is min( (m-3k - 2x2), len(S1) ).\n\nWait, but this approach might not always yield the optimal result. Because for a given k, perhaps choosing x2 less than the maximum possible allows for more x1, which could give a higher overall sum.\n\nSo, this approach might miss the optimal x2 and x1 for a particular k.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. How can we efficiently find the best x2 and x1 for each k?\n\nWait, but the prefix sums are non-decreasing. So for a fixed k, when x2 increases, the sum S2[x2] increases, but the remaining weight for x1 decreases.\n\nIt's a trade-off between the two. So for each k, the optimal x2 is somewhere between 0 and min( rem_weight//2, len(S2) ), and for each x2, we can take as much x1 as possible.\n\nBut checking all possible x2 for each k is O(n^2), which is too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: for each k, we can perform a binary search on x2 to find the optimal point where increasing x2 further does not lead to a better total.\n\nWait, but how? Because the total cost depends on both x2 and x1, which are interdependent.\n\nAnother angle: for each k, the best x2 is either the maximum possible x2 (i.e., min(rem_weight//2, len(S2))), or perhaps x2 is such that the last x1 taken is as much as possible. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a 2D problem for each k, where for the remaining weight, we find the maximum sum of x2 and x1, with x2*2 + x1 <= rem_weight.\n\nBut solving this for each k is O(1) with a clever approach.\n\nWait, the 2D problem is: given a maximum weight capacity R, and two sorted prefix sums S1 and S2, find the maximum sum S = S1[x1] + S2[x2], where x1 + 2x2 <= R.\n\nHow can we compute this efficiently for each k?\n\nThis seems similar to a bounded knapsack problem, but maybe with specific properties.\n\nLet me think about the 2D problem. For each R, find the maximum sum S1[x1] + S2[x2], with x1 + 2x2 <= R.\n\nWhat if we precompute for each possible R the maximum sum? But R can be up to 3e5, which is manageable.\n\nBut how to compute this for all R up to 3e5.\n\nAlternatively, for each R, we can try all possible x2 from 0 to min(R//2, len(S2)), and then take x1 as min(R - 2x2, len(S1)), and find the maximum sum.\n\nBut for each k, R can be up to 3e5, and len(S2) is up to 1e5, this is again O(1e10), which is way too slow.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a smarter way. Since S1 and S2 are sorted, perhaps we can find for each R the optimal x2 in O(log n) time.\n\nWait, perhaps for each R, the optimal x2 is the maximum possible x2 such that S1[x1] + S2[x2] is maximum, given x1 <= R - 2x2.\n\nBut it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, for each R, the maximum sum is achieved when x2 is as large as possible, but also allowing x1 to be as large as possible. So perhaps for each R, the optimal x2 is the maximum possible, and then x1 is filled to the remainder. Or perhaps not, because sometimes a slightly smaller x2 might allow more x1, which could be more valuable.\n\nWait, let's say R is fixed. For x2, the maximum possible is min(R//2, len(S2)). Let's call this x2_max. Then x1_max is min(R - 2x2_max, len(S1)).\n\nBut perhaps for x2 less than x2_max, the sum could be higher because S1 increases more.\n\nFor example, imagine that S2[x2_max] is low, but S1 is very high. Maybe a lower x2 allows for a much higher x1, which could compensate.\n\nSo for each R, it's not sufficient to just take x2_max and x1_max.\n\nHmm, but how can we find the optimal x2 quickly?\n\nPerhaps, for each R, we can perform a binary search on x2, but it's unclear how to define a condition that allows us to determine whether a higher x2 is better than a lower one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each R the maximum possible sum, but again, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal x2 for a given R is either the maximum possible x2, or the maximum possible x1. Or perhaps it's somewhere in between.\n\nWait, perhaps for each R, the maximum sum can be found by considering all possible x2 up to x2_max, and for each x2, take the maximum x1 possible. But that's O(R) for each R, which is again too slow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved when x2 is as large as possible, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a 1D DP for the 2-variable case.\n\nLet me think: for each R, the maximum sum is the maximum over all x2 (from 0 to x2_max) of (S2[x2] + S1[ min(R - 2x2, len(S1)) ]).\n\nWe can precompute for each R the maximum of this function.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nWait, maybe we can note that for each x2, the maximum x1 is R - 2x2. So the sum is S2[x2] + S1[ R - 2x2 ].\n\nSo for each R, the maximum is the maximum of S2[x2] + S1[ R - 2x2 ], for x2 ranging from 0 to x2_max.\n\nThis looks like a convolution, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each x2, the contribution is S2[x2] plus S1 up to R - 2x2.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each x2, we can compute the best x1 for a given R.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can precompute for each R the maximum sum as follows:\n\nInitialize an array dp where dp[r] is the maximum sum for weight r.\n\nFor each x2, for each possible r, update dp[r] = max(dp[r], dp[r - 2x2] + S2[x2]).\n\nBut this is the standard knapsack approach, but with 3e5 possible R and 1e5 x2, leading to 3e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nHmm, this is getting tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute for each possible R the maximum sum for the 2-variable case, and then for each k, we can add the sum from S3[k], and keep track of the overall maximum.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Sort and compute prefix sums for each weight group (w=1, 2, 3).\n\n2. Precompute for each R (0 to m) the maximum sum from the w=1 and w=2 groups, where the sum of weights is <= R.\n\n   Let's call this function f(R) = max{ S1[x1] + S2[x2] | x1 + 2x2 <= R }.\n\n3. Then, for each possible k (number of items from w=3 group, from 0 to min( m//3, len(S3) ) ), compute R = m - 3*k. If R >=0, then the maximum sum for this k is S3[k] + f(R).\n\n4. Find the maximum over all k of these values.\n\nSo the key is step 2: precomputing f(R) efficiently.\n\nHow can we compute f(R) for all R from 0 to m efficiently?\n\nHmm, considering that the maximum R is m = 3e5, and for each R, we need to compute f(R) in O(1) or O(log n) time.\n\nWait, let's think about the 2-variable problem: x1 + 2x2 <= R. We want to maximize S1[x1] + S2[x2].\n\nSince S1 and S2 are sorted, perhaps we can find for each R the optimal x2 and x1.\n\nLet me think about the possible approach for f(R):\n\nFor each possible x2, the maximum x1 is R - 2x2. So for each x2, we can take the maximum x1 possible, which is min(R - 2x2, len(S1)).\n\nBut to find the x2 that maximizes S2[x2] + S1[min(R-2x2, len(S1))].\n\nBut again, iterating through all x2 for each R is O(n*R), which is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For each R, the maximum x2 is min(R//2, len(S2)). Let's say x2_max = min(R//2, len(S2)).\n\nThen, for x2 in [x2_max, max_x2_possible], compute S2[x2] + S1[ R - 2x2 ].\n\nBut the problem is that x2 can vary, and for each x2, the corresponding x1 is determined. The maximum of these could be the answer.\n\nBut how to find the optimal x2 quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps for each R, the optimal x2 is either x2_max, or the x2 where the derivative of the function (S2[x2] + S1[R - 2x2]) changes direction.\n\nBut since the functions are discrete, it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each R, the optimal x2 is either x2_max or the x2 that allows the maximum x1. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model f(R) as a convex function and find the maximum using ternary search. But I'm not certain about the convexity of the function.\n\nWait, let's think about the function f(R) as the maximum of S2[x2] + S1[R - 2x2], for x2 in 0..x2_max.\n\nAs R increases, for each x2, the x1 increases, so S1[R-2x2] increases. So for a fixed x2, the function S2[x2] + S1[R-2x2] is non-decreasing as R increases.\n\nBut as x2 increases, S2[x2] increases, but R-2x2 decreases, so S1[R-2x2] decreases.\n\nSo the function f(R) is the maximum over x2 of (S2[x2] + S1[R - 2x2]).\n\nHmm, perhaps for a given R, the optimal x2 is somewhere around R/(2 + 1) or something like that. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each x2, the R at which it becomes optimal, and then for each R, find the best x2.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x2, the R where it's optimal is when R = 2x2 + x1, and x1 is such that S1[x1] is as large as possible.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Since both S1 and S2 are sorted in descending order, perhaps the optimal x2 is either x2_max or zero, but I don't think that's necessarily true.\n\nWait, let's take an example.\n\nSuppose S1 is [5,4,3,2,1], S2 is [10,9,8,7,6]. For R=5.\n\nIf x2_max is 2 (since 5//2=2).\n\nPossible x2 values are 0,1,2.\n\nFor x2=0: x1=5 → sum 5+10=15.\n\nx2=1: x1=3 → sum 9 + (sum of first 3 of S1) = 9 + (5+4+3)=17.\n\nx2=2: x1=1 → sum 8 +5=13.\n\nSo the maximum is 17 when x2=1.\n\nThus, in this case, the optimal x2 is 1, which is less than x2_max.\n\nSo the approach of just taking x2_max is not sufficient.\n\nHence, for each R, we need to find the x2 that maximizes S2[x2] + S1[ min(R-2x2, len(S1)) ].\n\nBut how to compute this quickly.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\nMaybe, for each x2, we can precompute the maximum R where taking x2 items from S2 and some x1 from S1 is optimal.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another Idea: Since S2 is sorted, for each x2, the best x1 is as large as possible. So for each x2, the best x1 for R is min(R-2x2, len(S1)).\n\nSo for each x2, the function is S2[x2] + S1[ min(R-2x2, len(S1)) ].\n\nSo for each R, the optimal x2 is the one that maximizes this function.\n\nBut how to find the optimal x2 for a given R.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x2, we can compute the R for which x2 is optimal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each x2, we can compute the range of R where x2 is the best choice.\n\nBut this feels complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each R, we can perform a binary search on x2 to find the x2 that gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut how would that work?\n\nWait, for a given R, the function f(x2) = S2[x2] + S1[ min(R-2x2, len(S1)) ].\n\nWe can see that as x2 increases, R-2x2 decreases, so S1[ ... ] decreases. However, S2[x2] increases.\n\nSo the function f(x2) could have a single peak, making it unimodal. If that's the case, ternary search could be applied.\n\nIs the function f(x2) unimodal?\n\nIn the example above, for R=5, f(x2) increased, reached a maximum at x2=1, then decreased. So yes, it's unimodal.\n\nIf this holds in general, then for each R, we can perform a ternary search on x2 to find the x2 that maximizes f(x2).\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nFor each R from 0 to m:\n\n   low = 0, high = min(R//2, len(S2))\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n      mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n      mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n\n      val1 = S2[mid1] + S1[ min(R - 2*mid1, len(S1)) ]\n\n      val2 = S2[mid2] + S1[ min(R - 2*mid2, len(S1)) ]\n\n      if val1 < val2:\n\n          low = mid1 + 1\n\n      else:\n\n          high = mid2 - 1\n\n   After the loop, the maximum is either at low, high, or mid1, mid2.\n\n   Compute f(R) as the maximum of these.\n\nBut for R up to 3e5, and for each R, a ternary search over 1e5 x2's, this would be O(R * log n) operations. 3e5 * 20 = 6e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nYes, this seems feasible.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n1. Read all the souvenirs, group them by weight (1, 2, 3).\n\n2. For each group, sort the items in descending order of cost, then compute the prefix sums.\n\n3. Precompute the function f(R) for R from 0 to m. For each R, perform a ternary search on x2 in 0..x2_max, and find the maximum sum of S2[x2] + S1[x1], where x1 = min(R - 2x2, len(S1)).\n\n4. For each possible k (number of items taken from S3), compute R = m - 3*k. If R >=0, then the total sum is S3[k] + f(R). Keep track of the maximum sum across all valid k.\n\nSo now, the steps to implement:\n\nFirst, process the input and group the souvenirs by weight.\n\nThen, for each group, sort and compute prefix sums.\n\nThen, precompute f(R) for all R from 0 to m.\n\nTo compute f(R), for each R, perform a ternary search on x2 in 0..x2_max, and compute the maximum sum.\n\nOnce f(R) is precomputed, loop through all possible k (from 0 to min(len(S3), m//3)), compute R = m -3*k, and add S3[k] to f(R), then track the maximum.\n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nCase 1: m is zero. Then, output is zero.\n\nCase 2: All souvenirs are too heavy. For example, m is 1, but all souvenirs have wi=2. Then, output is zero.\n\nCase 3: Only w=1 and w=2, no w=3.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nImplementing the ternary search for f(R):\n\nBut for each R, the x2 can vary, but the function is unimodal, so ternary search is applicable.\n\nBut wait, in Python, dealing with integers, so the ternary search needs to handle that.\n\nWait, perhaps for each R, we can loop through x2 from 0 to x2_max, but that's O(n) per R, which is 3e5 * 1e5 = 3e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo the ternary search approach is necessary.\n\nWait, but in the code, for each R, we need to compute f(R). So during the preprocessing step, for R from 0 to m, compute f(R) using the ternary search method.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlso, note that the f(R) can be precomputed for all R from 0 to m.\n\nBut for R beyond a certain point, say m, but in our case, R is up to m.\n\nWait, but the maximum R is m.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute S1, S2, S3.\n\n- For R in 0 to m:\n\n   x2_max = min(R // 2, len(S2))\n\n   if x2_max ==0:\n\n       f(R) = S1[ min(R, len(S1)) ]\n\n   else:\n\n       perform ternary search on x2 in [0, x2_max], find the x2 that maximizes S2[x2] + S1[ min(R-2x2, len(S1)) ]\n\nBut wait, what if R-2x2 is negative? Then, x1 is zero. So, the sum is S2[x2].\n\nSo, the code for f(R) should consider that.\n\nWait, no. Because x2 can't be larger than R//2, so 2x2 <= R.\n\nThus, R - 2x2 >= 0.\n\nSo, x1 can be at least zero.\n\nBut len(S1) could be less than R-2x2, so x1 is min(...).\n\nSo, the code for f(R) is:\n\nfor each x2 in 0..x2_max:\n\n   x1_max = min(R - 2x2, len(S1))\n\n   current_sum = S2[x2] + S1[x1_max]\n\nf(R) is the maximum of current_sum over all x2.\n\nSo, implementing this in code.\n\nNow, in code, for each R, we can loop through x2 from 0 to x2_max, but that's O(n) per R, which is too slow.\n\nThus, the ternary search approach is needed.\n\nImplementing ternary search for each R.\n\nSo, for each R:\n\nlow = 0\n\nhigh = x2_max\n\nmax_val = 0\n\nwhile low <= high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n   current_sum = S2[mid] + S1[ min(R - 2*mid, len_S1) ]\n\n   if current_sum > max_val:\n\n       max_val = current_sum\n\n       best_mid = mid\n\n   # Now, check mid+1 and mid-1 to see if we can get a better value.\n\n   if mid +1 <= high:\n\n       sum1 = S2[mid+1] + S1[ min(R - 2*(mid+1), len_S1) ]\n\n       if sum1 > max_val:\n\n           max_val = sum1\n\n   if mid -1 >=0:\n\n       sum2 = S2[mid-1] + S1[ min(R - 2*(mid-1), len_S1) ]\n\n       if sum2 > max_val:\n\n           max_val = sum2\n\n   # Now, adjust low and high based on whether sum1 or sum2 is better.\n\n   if sum1 > sum2:\n\n       low = mid +1\n\n   else:\n\n       high = mid -1\n\nWait, perhaps this isn't the best way to perform ternary search. Alternatively, perform a loop with low and high, and at each step, choose mid1 and mid2, compare, and narrow down the search space.\n\nAlternatively, implement the standard ternary search algorithm.\n\nWait, perhaps in code, for each R, we can compute x2_max = min(R//2, len(S2)).\n\nIf x2_max is zero, then f(R) = S1[ min(R, len(S1)) ].\n\nElse:\n\nlow = 0\n\nhigh = x2_max\n\nbest = 0\n\nwhile low <= high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n   current_sum = S2[mid] + S1[ min(R - 2*mid, len(S1)) ]\n\n   if current_sum > best:\n\n       best = current_sum\n\n   # Try to find a better x2 in the vicinity.\n\n   if mid +1 <= high:\n\n       sum1 = S2[mid+1] + S1[ min(R - 2*(mid+1), len(S1)) ]\n\n       if sum1 > best:\n\n           best = sum1\n\n   if mid -1 >=0:\n\n       sum2 = S2[mid-1] + S1[ min(R - 2*(mid-1), len(S1)) ]\n\n       if sum2 > best:\n\n           best = sum2\n\n   # Decide to move the search window.\n\n   if sum1 > sum2:\n\n       low = mid +1\n\n   else:\n\n       high = mid -1\n\nSo, after the loop, the best is the maximum sum.\n\nBut this is just a heuristic. It's possible that the maximum is found, but perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to implement a proper ternary search, which narrows down the search space logarithmically.\n\nBut in any case, this is manageable.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in code.\n\nAnother thing to note is that for each group, the prefix sums are computed as follows:\n\nFor S1, it's the sum of the top i items of w=1.\n\nSimilarly for S2 and S3.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen, for each of the n lines, read wi and ci.\n\nGroup them into lists for w=1, w=2, w=3.\n\nSort each list in descending order of ci.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each group.\n\nNow, for each group, the prefix sum is an array where prefix[i] is the sum of the first i items.\n\nSo, S1 is prefix_sums_w1, etc.\n\nNow, for each R in 0..m:\n\nCompute x2_max = min(R//2, len(S2)).\n\nIf x2_max ==0:\n\n   f(R) = S1[ min(R, len(S1)) ]\n\nelse:\n\n   perform ternary search on x2 in 0..x2_max to find the maximum sum.\n\nBut wait, S2 has len(S2) elements, so x2 can be up to len(S2).\n\nBut R//2 can be larger than len(S2), so x2_max is min(R//2, len(S2)).\n\nSimilarly for x1.\n\nNow, code outline.\n\nIn Python:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Read all souvenirs\n\nw1 = []\nw2 = []\nw3 = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    wi, ci = map(int, input().split())\n    if wi ==1:\n        w1.append(ci)\n    elif wi ==2:\n        w2.append(ci)\n    else:\n        w3.append(ci)\n\n# Sort each group in descending order and compute prefix sums\n\nw1.sort(reverse=True)\nprefix1 = [0]\ncurrent_sum =0\nfor c in w1:\n    current_sum +=c\n    prefix1.append(current_sum)\n\nw2.sort(reverse=True)\nprefix2 = [0]\ncurrent_sum =0\nfor c in w2:\n    current_sum +=c\n    prefix2.append(current_sum)\n\nw3.sort(reverse=True)\nprefix3 = [0]\ncurrent_sum =0\nfor c in w3:\n    current_sum +=c\n    prefix3.append(current_sum)\n\nlen1 = len(w1)\nlen2 = len(w2)\nlen3 = len(w3)\n\n# Precompute f(R) for R from 0 to m.\n\nmax_R = m\nf = [0]*(max_R +1)\n\nfor R in range(0, max_R+1):\n    x2_max = min(R //2, len2)\n    if x2_max ==0:\n        # No items from w=2\n        x1_max = min(R, len1)\n        f[R] = prefix1[x1_max]\n    else:\n        # Perform ternary search on x2 in [0, x2_max]\n        low =0\n        high = x2_max\n        best =0\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) //2\n            if mid > len2:\n                # mid exceeds the length of S2.\n                current_sum = prefix2[len2]\n                x1 = R - 2*mid\n                if x1 <0:\n                    x1 =0\n                x1_val = prefix1[x1]\n                total = current_sum + x1_val\n            else:\n                x1 = R - 2*mid\n                x1 = min(x1, len1)\n                total = prefix2[mid] + prefix1[x1]\n            if total > best:\n                best = total\n            # Check mid+1\n            if mid +1 <= high:\n                mid_p = mid +1\n                if mid_p > len2:\n                    current_sum = prefix2[len2]\n                else:\n                    current_sum = prefix2[mid_p]\n                x1_p = R - 2*mid_p\n                x1_p = min(x1_p, len1)\n                total_p = current_sum + prefix1[x1_p]\n                if total_p > best:\n                    best = total_p\n            # Check mid-1\n            if mid -1 >=0:\n                mid_m = mid -1\n                if mid_m > len2:\n                    current_sum = prefix2[len2]\n                else:\n                    current_sum = prefix2[mid_m]\n                x1_m = R - 2*mid_m\n                x1_m = min(x1_m, len1)\n                total_m = current_sum + prefix1[x1_m]\n                if total_m > best:\n                    best = total_m\n            # Adjust the search range\n            if (total_p > total_m):\n                low = mid +1\n            else:\n                high = mid -1\n        f[R] = best\n\n# Now, for each k, compute R = m -3*k, and sum S3[k] + f(R)\n\nmax_total =0\n\nmax_k = min( len3, m//3 )\n\nfor k in range(0, max_k +1):\n    R = m -3*k\n    if R <0:\n        continue\n    sum3 = prefix3[k]\n    sum_rest = f[R]\n    total = sum3 + sum_rest\n    if total > max_total:\n        max_total = total\n\nprint(max_total)\n\nWait, but in the code above, when computing for each R, the x2 is in [0, x2_max], but the code may go beyond the len(S2) when mid is too large.\n\nWait, no, because x2_max is min(R//2, len2), so mid can't be larger than len2.\n\nWait, no, len2 is the length of S2, which is the number of items in w=2 group.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry without exceeding a given weight limit. The problem is a variation of the knapsack problem where each item has a weight of either 1, 2, or 3.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Souvenirs by Weight**: Separate the souvenirs into three groups based on their weights (1, 2, and 3).\n2. **Sort and Compute Prefix Sums**: For each group, sort the souvenirs in descending order of their costs and compute prefix sums. This allows us to quickly determine the maximum cost for any number of items taken from each group.\n3. **Precompute Maximum Costs for Each Weight Capacity**: For each possible weight capacity up to the given limit, compute the maximum cost using a combination of items from the weight 1 and weight 2 groups. This is done using a ternary search to efficiently find the optimal number of items from the weight 2 group.\n4. **Combine with Weight 3 Items**: For each possible number of items taken from the weight 3 group, compute the remaining weight capacity and use the precomputed values to find the maximum total cost.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nw1 = []\nw2 = []\nw3 = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    wi, ci = map(int, input().split())\n    if wi == 1:\n        w1.append(ci)\n    elif wi == 2:\n        w2.append(ci)\n    else:\n        w3.append(ci)\n\n# Sort and compute prefix sums for each group\nw1.sort(reverse=True)\nprefix1 = [0]\ncurrent_sum = 0\nfor c in w1:\n    current_sum += c\n    prefix1.append(current_sum)\n\nw2.sort(reverse=True)\nprefix2 = [0]\ncurrent_sum = 0\nfor c in w2:\n    current_sum += c\n    prefix2.append(current_sum)\n\nw3.sort(reverse=True)\nprefix3 = [0]\ncurrent_sum = 0\nfor c in w3:\n    current_sum += c\n    prefix3.append(current_sum)\n\nlen1, len2, len3 = len(w1), len(w2), len(w3)\n\nmax_R = m\nf = [0] * (max_R + 1)\n\nfor R in range(max_R + 1):\n    x2_max = min(R // 2, len2)\n    if x2_max == 0:\n        # No items from w=2\n        x1_max = min(R, len1)\n        f[R] = prefix1[x1_max]\n    else:\n        low = 0\n        high = x2_max\n        best = 0\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if mid > len2:\n                current_sum = prefix2[len2]\n            else:\n                current_sum = prefix2[mid]\n            x1 = R - 2 * mid\n            x1 = min(x1, len1)\n            total = current_sum + prefix1[x1]\n            if total > best:\n                best = total\n            \n            # Check mid + 1\n            if mid + 1 <= high:\n                mid_p = mid + 1\n                if mid_p > len2:\n                    current_sum_p = prefix2[len2]\n                else:\n                    current_sum_p = prefix2[mid_p]\n                x1_p = R - 2 * mid_p\n                x1_p = min(x1_p, len1)\n                total_p = current_sum_p + prefix1[x1_p]\n                if total_p > best:\n                    best = total_p\n            \n            # Check mid - 1\n            if mid - 1 >= 0:\n                mid_m = mid - 1\n                if mid_m > len2:\n                    current_sum_m = prefix2[len2]\n                else:\n                    current_sum_m = prefix2[mid_m]\n                x1_m = R - 2 * mid_m\n                x1_m = min(x1_m, len1)\n                total_m = current_sum_m + prefix1[x1_m]\n                if total_m > best:\n                    best = total_m\n            \n            # Adjust the search range\n            if (total_p > total_m):\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n        f[R] = best\n\nmax_total = 0\nmax_k = min(len3, m // 3)\n\nfor k in range(0, max_k + 1):\n    R = m - 3 * k\n    if R < 0:\n        continue\n    sum3 = prefix3[k]\n    sum_rest = f[R]\n    total = sum3 + sum_rest\n    if total > max_total:\n        max_total = total\n\nprint(max_total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input and Grouping**: The input is read, and souvenirs are grouped by their weights into three lists.\n2. **Sorting and Prefix Sums**: Each list of souvenirs is sorted by cost in descending order, and prefix sums are computed to quickly determine the maximum cost for any number of items taken.\n3. **Precomputing Costs**: For each possible weight capacity, the maximum cost is precomputed using a combination of items from the weight 1 and weight 2 groups, leveraging a ternary search to efficiently find the optimal number of items from the weight 2 group.\n4. **Combining with Weight 3 Items**: For each possible number of items taken from the weight 3 group, the remaining weight capacity is used to look up the precomputed maximum cost, and the overall maximum cost is tracked.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles all edge cases, providing the optimal result within the given constraints.",
