Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Colored Boots.\" Hmm.\n\nSo, the setup is that there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color represented by a lowercase letter or a question mark. We need to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of one left and one right boot, and their colors are compatible.\n\nWhat counts as compatible? Two specific colors are compatible only if they're exactly the same. A question mark is compatible with any color, including another question mark. So, for example, '?' can pair with 'a', 'b', or '?'. But 'a' can't pair with 'b'.\n\nThe goal is to compute the maximum number of such pairs and list them. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nHmm. So, the approach here must involve figuring out which left and right boots can form compatible pairs and then selecting as many as possible without overlapping.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, I think we can represent each boot's color, considering the question marks as wildcards. For each left boot, we can consider it compatible with certain right boots.\n\nBut with n up to 150,000, we need an efficient way to compute this. Trying all possible pairs is O(n^2), which is definitely not feasible.\n\nSo, we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, maybe we can precompute for each possible color (including '?') the count of left boots and right boots that have those colors.\n\nThen, for each color, the maximum possible pairs between left and right of that color would be the minimum of the left count and right count. Then, sum all these, but also account for the question marks pairing with any.\n\nWait, but that might not capture all possibilities because some left boots with '?' can pair with any right, including those not accounted for in the specific color counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should handle the question marks separately.\n\nAnother idea: for each left boot, determine which right boots it can pair with. Then, model this as a bipartite graph where edges represent compatible pairs, and find the maximum matching.\n\nBut even that might be too slow for n=150,000.\n\nHmm. So, we need a way to count the maximum number of pairs efficiently without explicitly checking every possible pair.\n\nLet's break down the problem.\n\nEach pair consists of one left and one right boot. Their colors must be compatible.\n\nSo, for a left boot l_i and right boot r_j:\n\n- If l_i == r_j: compatible.\n- If l_i is '?': compatible.\n- If r_j is '?': compatible.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that two specific colors are compatible only if they are exactly the same. Indefinite (i.e., '?') is compatible with any other color (specific or indefinite).\n\nSo, the compatibility is as follows:\n\nl_i and r_j are compatible if:\n\n- l_i == r_j, OR\n- l_i is '?', OR\n- r_j is '?'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, more accurately: a pair is compatible if either both are '?', or one is '?' and the other is any, or both are the same specific character.\n\nSo, for l_i and r_j:\n\ncompatible = (l_i == r_j) or (l_i == '?') or (r_j == '?')\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, to model this, perhaps we can create a frequency table for the left and right boots, considering their colors, and then calculate the maximum possible pairs.\n\nLet me think about how to maximize the number of pairs.\n\nWe can categorize the left and right boots into three types:\n\n1. Left is a specific color (let's say 'a').\n2. Left is a question mark.\n3. Similarly for right.\n\nWait, perhaps we can group the left and right boots by their color, including a special group for question marks.\n\nFor example:\n\nLeft Boots:\n- For each specific color c, count how many left boots have color c.\n- Also, count how many left boots are '?'.\n\nRight Boots:\n- Similarly, count for each specific color and the '?'.\n\nThen, the maximum possible pairs can be computed as follows:\n\nCase 1: Both left and right are specific colors. Only if they are the same, the pair is compatible. So, for each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_c, right_c).\n\nCase 2: Left is a specific color, right is '?'. The number of pairs is left_c multiplied by the number of right '?'.\n\nCase 3: Right is a specific color, left is '?'. The number of pairs is right_c multiplied by the number of left '?'.\n\nCase 4: Both are '?'. The number of pairs is the minimum of left_? and right_?.\n\nBut wait, since each pair uses one left and one right, we can't just sum all these up because there could be overlaps. For example, a left '?' can pair with multiple right boots, but each can only be used once.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to first handle the specific color pairs, then handle the cross cases.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is equal to the sum of:\n\nmin(left_c, right_c) for each c,\n\nplus the number of left '?' multiplied by the number of right '?',\n\nplus the number of left '?' multiplied by the sum of right_c for all specific c,\n\nplus the number of right '?' multiplied by the sum of left_c for all specific c.\n\nWait, but that seems incorrect because some right specific c may already be paired with their own specific lefts.\n\nWait, no, because when you take min(left_c, right_c), you are using up some of the right_c's.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nCompute the total pairs as follows:\n\n1. For each color c, take as many pairs as possible between left_c and right_c. So, add min(left_c, right_c) to the total. Subtract these from left_c and right_c.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining left specific colors and right specific colors, plus the question marks, find how to pair them optimally.\n\nBut that's still vague.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: the maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\n- All possible specific pairs (c, c)\n- All possible pairs where left is '?'\n- All possible pairs where right is '?'\nBut we have to avoid double-counting or overcounting.\n\nAlternatively, let's model the problem as a bipartite graph where edges exist between left and right boots if they are compatible. The task is to find the maximum matching in this graph.\n\nBut with n up to 150,000, a standard maximum matching algorithm won't work because it's O(VE), which is way too slow.\n\nSo, we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the bipartition.\n\nLeft side: all left boots (n nodes)\n\nRight side: all right boots (n nodes)\n\nEdge exists between left i and right j if l_i and r_j are compatible.\n\nWe need to find the maximum matching.\n\nBut again, for n=150,000, this is impossible with standard methods.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be transformed into counting certain frequencies.\n\nAnother idea: group the left and right boots by their color (and whether they are '?'), then compute how many pairs can be formed between these groups.\n\nLet me define:\n\nFor left boots:\n\n- For each color c (a-z), count the number of left boots with color c: L[c]\n- Count the number of left '?' : QL\n\nSimilarly for right boots:\n\n- R[c] for each c\n- QR for the count of '?'\n\nThen, the maximum number of pairs can be computed as follows:\n\n1. Pairs where both are specific colors: sum over c of min(L[c], R[c]).\n\n2. Pairs where left is '?': QL * (QR + sum over c of R[c])\n\nWait, no. Because after pairing specific pairs, some right boots may be used, so this approach may not be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nTotal pairs = pairs from specific colors (sum min(L[c], R[c])) + pairs from left '?' (QL * available right non-specific) + pairs from right '?' (QR * available left non-specific) - but then subtract the overlap where both are '?' and have been counted twice.\n\nWait, no. Let's think step by step.\n\nAfter handling the specific color pairs:\n\nEach specific color c can contribute min(L[c], R[c]) pairs. So, for each c, subtract this from L[c] and R[c].\n\nAfter that, the remaining L[c] are left specific colors, and the remaining R[c] are right specific colors. Also, QL and QR remain.\n\nNow, the remaining left specific can pair with right '?' and vice versa.\n\nSo, the next step is to pair the remaining left specific with the right '?', and the remaining right specific with left '?'.\n\nBut since each can only use each other once, perhaps the maximum is the sum of:\n\nQL * (sum of R[c] remaining) + QR * (sum of L[c] remaining) + QL * QR.\n\nWait, but that might overcount.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nAfter step 1, for each c, L[c] and R[c] have been reduced by min(L[c], R[c]).\n\nSo, for the remaining:\n\nWe have:\n\n- For each c, L[c] is the number of left boots with color c that haven't been paired yet.\n- Similarly for R[c].\n- QL and QR are the number of left and right '?' that haven't been used.\n\nNow, the remaining left specific can pair with any right non-specific (which includes right '?'), and the same for right specific.\n\nAdditionally, the left '?' can pair with any remaining right, and right '?' can pair with any remaining left.\n\nSo, perhaps the next step is to find how much can we pair the remaining left specific with right non-specific (including right '?').\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps the next part is to compute:\n\n- The number of left specific remaining: S_L = sum over c of L[c]\n- The number of right specific remaining: S_R = sum over c of R[c]\n- The number of left '?': QL\n- The number of right '?': QR\n\nSo, the maximum number of additional pairs is:\n\npairs_from_left_specific = min(S_L, S_R + QR)\n\npairs_from_right_specific = min(S_R, S_L + QL)\n\npairs_from_question_marks = min( (S_L + QL) , (S_R + QR) )\n\nWait, no. Or perhaps, the maximum is the sum of:\n\nmin(S_L, S_R) + min(QL, S_R) + min(QR, S_L) + min( (S_L + QL), (S_R + QR) ) - ... Wait, maybe not.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs after step 1 is the sum of:\n\nQL * (QR + sum of R[c] after step 1) \n\nplus QR * (QL + sum of L[c] after step 1) \n\nbut minus the overlap where both are '?'.\n\nWait, no. Because each pair is a left and right, so perhaps the maximum possible is the sum of:\n\nQL * (QR + sum of R_non_question_after_step1) \n\nplus QR * (sum of L_non_question_after_step1) \n\nplus the remaining question marks.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is to pair as much as possible between the remaining specific left and right, and then pair the question marks with the rest.\n\nSo, after step 1:\n\nCompute the sum of remaining L[c]: S_L = sum L[c]\n\nsum of remaining R[c]: S_R = sum R[c]\n\nThen:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs between S_L and S_R is min(S_L, S_R). So, take that as step 2.\n\nThen, the remaining S_L - step2 and S_R - step2 can be used to pair with the question marks.\n\nSo, the pairs from step 2: step2_pairs = min(S_L, S_R).\n\nThe remaining S_L' = S_L - step2_pairs.\n\nThe remaining S_R' = S_R - step2_pairs.\n\nThen, the number of pairs from S_L' and S_R' is zero, because they can't pair with each other anymore (since we've taken as many as possible).\n\nWait, no. Because if S_L' is non-zero, it's because S_L < S_R, so all S_L' can't pair with S_R' anymore.\n\nSo, after step 2, we have:\n\n- S_L' = max(S_L - S_R, 0) = 0 if S_L >= S_R, else S_L - S_R.\n\nWait, no. Let me think:\n\nstep2_pairs = min(S_L, S_R). So, if S_L >= S_R, then step2_pairs = S_R, and S_L' = S_L - S_R.\n\nIf S_L < S_R, then step2_pairs = S_L, and S_R' = S_R - S_L.\n\nSo, after step 2, the remaining specific left is S_L' = S_L - step2_pairs, which is either 0 or S_L - S_R.\n\nSimilarly for S_R'.\n\nNow, the next step is to pair the remaining S_L' with the right question marks, and the remaining S_R' with the left question marks.\n\nBut also, the left and right question marks can pair among themselves.\n\nSo, the next step is:\n\npairs3 = min(S_L', QR) â†’ these are pairs of specific left and right question marks.\n\npairs4 = min(S_R', QL) â†’ specific right and left question marks.\n\npairs5 = min( (S_L' + S_R' ), (QL + QR) ) â†’ this is when we have some left and right question marks left, but perhaps not enough to pair all.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit tangled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after step 2, the remaining S_L' and S_R' can't form any more specific pairs. So, the only options are to pair them with question marks.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute step1_pairs = sum min(L[c], R[c]) for all c.\n\n   Subtract step1_pairs from L[c] and R[c].\n\n   Compute S_L = sum L[c]\n\n   Compute S_R = sum R[c]\n\n2. Compute step2_pairs = min(S_L, S_R).\n\n   Subtract step2_pairs from S_L and S_R.\n\n   Now, S_L and S_R are zero.\n\n3. Now, the remaining S_L and S_R are zero.\n\n4. Now, the remaining is:\n\n   QL: number of left question marks.\n\n   QR: number of right question marks.\n\n   Now, the remaining left specific (S_L is zero) can't form any more pairs except with question marks.\n\n   So, the remaining specific left (which is zero) can't contribute.\n\n   Similarly for right.\n\nSo, the remaining is to pair the question marks with each other and with the remaining specific.\n\nWait, perhaps the total is step1_pairs + step2_pairs + step3_pairs, where step3_pairs is the sum of:\n\nQL * QR + QL * (sum of remaining R after step 2) + QR * (sum of remaining L after step 2) ?\n\nNo, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, after step 2, the only thing left is:\n\n- The left question marks (QL) can pair with any of the remaining right boots (which are QR + sum R[c] after step 2).\n\nSimilarly, the right question marks can pair with any of the remaining left boots (QL + sum L[c] after step 2).\n\nWait, but after step 2, the sum L[c] is zero, because S_L is zero. So, the remaining left is only the question marks.\n\nSo, the remaining left is QL, and the remaining right is QR + sum R[c] after step 2.\n\nBut wait, sum R[c] after step 2 is S_R' = S_R - step2_pairs, which is zero because step2_pairs is min(S_L, S_R), and after that, either S_L or S_R is zero.\n\nWait, no. Because step2_pairs is min(S_L, S_R), so after step2_pairs, either S_L or S_R is zero.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose S_L is 5 and S_R is 3. Then step2_pairs is 3. So S_L' becomes 5-3=2, S_R' becomes 0.\n\nSo, after step2_pairs, S_L' is 2, S_R' is 0.\n\nSo, the remaining right is QR + sum R[c] (which is S_R') = QR.\n\nThe remaining left is QL + sum L[c] (which is S_L') = QL + 2.\n\nWait, no. After step 1, sum L[c] is S_L, and after step2_pairs, S_L' is S_L - step2_pairs.\n\nSo, after step 2, the remaining left specific is S_L', and the remaining right specific is S_R'.\n\nBut in this case, S_L' could be non-zero, while S_R' is zero.\n\nSo, the remaining right is S_R' (zero) plus QR.\n\nSo, the remaining right is QR.\n\nThe remaining left is S_L' + QL.\n\nWait, no. Because S_L' is the remaining specific left, and QL is the question mark left.\n\nSo, the remaining left is S_L' + QL.\n\nSimilarly, the remaining right is S_R' + QR.\n\nSo, for the next step:\n\nWe can pair the remaining left (S_L' + QL) with the remaining right (S_R' + QR).\n\nBut how?\n\nWell, the maximum number of such pairs is the minimum of (S_L' + QL, S_R' + QR).\n\nBut wait, perhaps we can model this as:\n\nThe number of pairs from question marks is the minimum of QL and QR.\n\nThen, the remaining QL' = max(0, QL - QR).\n\nAnd the remaining QR' = max(0, QR - QL).\n\nThen, the remaining left (S_L' + QL') can pair with the remaining right (S_R' + QR').\n\nThe maximum possible is the minimum of (S_L' + QL', S_R' + QR').\n\nSo, the total step3_pairs is:\n\nstep3_pairs = min( (S_L' + QL), (S_R' + QR) )\n\nThen, the overall maximum pairs is step1_pairs + step2_pairs + step3_pairs.\n\nWait, but step3_pairs could include some specific left and right, but since S_L' and S_R' are specific, and the question marks can pair with any, including specific.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach was wrong.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nCompute for all possible pairs, but group them smartly.\n\nLet me try to model this with the following variables:\n\nLet me compute:\n\n- For each color c, the number of left and right that are c.\n\nThen:\n\npairs_c = min(left_c, right_c) for each c. Sum all.\n\nAfter that, the remaining left_c is left_c - pairs_c.\n\nThe remaining right_c is right_c - pairs_c.\n\nSo, for the remaining, we have:\n\nsum_remaining_left = sum (left_c - pairs_c) â†’ call this S_L.\n\nsum_remaining_right = sum (right_c - pairs_c) â†’ call this S_R.\n\nThen, the question marks:\n\nQL = number of left '?'.\n\nQR = number of right '?'.\n\nNow, the remaining left can be S_L (sum of specific) + QL.\n\nThe remaining right can be S_R (sum of specific) + QR.\n\nNow, the maximum possible pairs from the remaining is the minimum of (S_L + QL, S_R + QR).\n\nBecause any remaining left can pair with any remaining right, as long as they are compatible.\n\nWait, but in reality, the remaining left specific (S_L) can pair with the remaining right specific (S_R) and the right question marks. Similarly, the left question marks can pair with any remaining right.\n\nSo, the maximum possible is indeed the minimum of (S_L + QL, S_R + QR).\n\nSo, the total pairs would be:\n\ntotal_pairs = sum(pairs_c) + min(S_L + QL, S_R + QR).\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWait, let's test this with an example.\n\nTake the sample input given:\n\nSample Input:\n10\ncodeforces\ndodivthree\n9\nbambarbia\nhellocode\n10\ncode?????? \n??????test\n\nWait, the sample output is 5 pairs.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nBut perhaps I should take a smaller example to test.\n\nSuppose n=2.\n\nLeft: \"a?\"\nRight: \"?b\"\n\nSo, l = ['a', '?'], r = ['?', 'b']\n\npairs_c: for color a, left has 1, right has 0 â†’ 0 pairs.\n\nSo, sum pairs_c is 0.\n\nS_L = 0 (because left_c for a is 1, but right_c for a is 0. So after step1, S_L is 1 (left_a) - 0 =1? No, wait, step1_pairs for a is 0, so S_L is left_a - 0 =1, and S_R is right_a -0=0.\n\nSo, S_L =1, S_R=0.\n\nQL is left '?' is 1.\n\nQR is right '?' is 1.\n\nSo, step3_pairs is min(1+1, 0+1) = min(2,1) =1.\n\nSo total_pairs =0+0+1=1.\n\nWhich is correct: the pairs are (1,1) and (2,2) would not be possible, but (2,1) is possible.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nBoots:\n\nLeft: 1 is 'a', 2 is '?'.\n\nRight: 1 is '?', 2 is 'b'.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\nPair 1 and 2: l='a' and r='?' â†’ compatible.\n\nPair 2 and 1: l='?' and r='?' â†’ compatible.\n\nSo, the maximum is 2 pairs.\n\nBut according to the formula, step1_pairs is 0, step2_pairs is min(1, 0) =0, step3_pairs is min( (1+1), (0+1) )=1. So total is 1. Which is wrong.\n\nHmm, so the formula is incorrect.\n\nSo, what went wrong?\n\nIn the above example, the correct maximum is 2 pairs, but the formula gives 1.\n\nSo, the formula isn't correct.\n\nThus, my approach is flawed.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the formula should be step1_pairs + step2_pairs + step3_pairs + step4_pairs.\n\nWhere step3_pairs is QL * QR, and step4_pairs is (S_L + S_R) * something.\n\nWait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to model the problem as follows:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\n1. For each color c, min(left_c, right_c).\n\n2. The number of left '?' multiplied by the number of right '?'.\n\n3. The number of left '?' multiplied by the sum of right_c for all c.\n\n4. The number of right '?' multiplied by the sum of left_c for all c.\n\nBut we have to subtract the overlaps.\n\nWait, no. Because in step3, pairing left '?' with right_c may have already included some that are covered in step1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nmax_pairs = sum(min(left_c, right_c)) + (QL * QR) + (QL * sum_right_non_questionmark) + (QR * sum_left_non_questionmark).\n\nBut this also doesn't seem right because some of these may have been counted in the sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate:\n\nsum_min = sum(min(left_c, right_c)).\n\nsum_q_pairs = QL * QR.\n\nsum_s_pairs = (QL * sum_right_non_questionmark) + (QR * sum_left_non_questionmark).\n\nBut this can lead to double-counting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is sum_min + QL * QR + (QL * sum_right_non_questionmark + QR * sum_left_non_questionmark) - sum_min * something.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a bipartite graph and the maximum matching can be found using the Hungarian algorithm, but for large n, that's impractical.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem requires a different approach.\n\nAnother thought: for each right boot, determine how many left boots are compatible with it.\n\nThen, the problem becomes finding the maximum bipartite matching, which can be done with a greedy approach if the graph has certain properties.\n\nBut again, for n=15e4, that's not feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph where edges are based on color compatibility, and the maximum matching can be found using the fact that the graph is a collection of complete bipartite graphs.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum matching can be determined by grouping the left and right boots by their color (and question mark) and then computing the maximum possible within those groups.\n\nFor example:\n\nGroup 1: left is 'a', right is 'a' â†’ can form pairs.\n\nGroup 2: left is 'a', right is 'b' â†’ no edge.\n\nGroup 3: left is '?', right is anything â†’ can form pairs.\n\nSo, the maximum matching is the sum of the minimum in each group plus the maximum possible in the groups involving '?'.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to model the problem as a bipartition where:\n\n- Left nodes are grouped by their color, including '?'.\n\n- Right nodes are similarly grouped.\n\nThen, edges exist between groups if there's any compatibility.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because a left 'a' can only connect to right 'a's, but a left '?' can connect to any right.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum matching can be found by:\n\n1. For each color c, take min(left_c, right_c) pairs.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining left_c and right_c, we can only pair them with question marks.\n\nBut perhaps the way to model this is:\n\n- For each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_c, right_c).\n\n- Then, the remaining left_c (after step 1) is added to the pool of left specific.\n\n- Similarly for right_c.\n\n- Then, the question marks can be used to pair with any remaining.\n\nSo, step 2: the number of pairs is min(left Specific remaining + QL, right Specific remaining + QR).\n\nBut wait, in the earlier example, this approach didn't work.\n\nIn that example:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\nsum_min = 0.\n\nsum_remaining_left = 1 (from 'a') + 1 ('?') â†’ 2.\n\nsum_remaining_right = 0 ('a') + 1 ('b') â†’ 1.\n\nSo, step 2: min(2, 1) =1. So, step1_pairs + step2_pairs = 0 +1=1. But the actual maximum is 2.\n\nAh, so the approach is missing the possibility of pairing the left '?' with right '?'.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\nCompute:\n\n- The number of pairs where left is specific and right is '?'.\n\n- The number of pairs where right is specific and left is '?'.\n\n- The number of pairs where both are '?'.\n\nThese can be added to the total.\n\nSo, the formula becomes:\n\ntotal = step1_pairs + step2_pairs + step3_pairs + step4_pairs.\n\nWhere:\n\nstep2_pairs: left specific (after step1) * right '?'.\n\nstep3_pairs: right specific (after step1) * left '?'.\n\nstep4_pairs: left '?' * right '?'.\n\nBut wait, in the earlier example:\n\nAfter step1:\n\nstep1_pairs = 0.\n\nleft specific remaining: 1 ('a').\n\nright specific remaining: 0.\n\nright '?' is 1.\n\nleft '?' is 1.\n\nSo, step2_pairs =1*1=1.\n\nstep3_pairs =0*1=0.\n\nstep4_pairs =1*1=1.\n\nSo, total is 0+1+0+1=2. Which matches the example.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nCompute step1_pairs as sum of min(left_c, right_c).\n\nCompute step2_pairs as (sum of left specific after step1) * QR.\n\nCompute step3_pairs as (sum of right specific after step1) * QL.\n\nCompute step4_pairs as QL * QR.\n\nBut wait, in this case, step2_pairs and step3_pairs could be overlapping with step4_pairs.\n\nWait, no. Because step4_pairs is the pairs of left '?' and right '?'.\n\nstep2_pairs is the left specific (after step1) paired with right '?'.\n\nstep3_pairs is the right specific (after step1) paired with left '?'.\n\nSo, all these are separate.\n\nThus, the total is step1_pairs + step2_pairs + step3_pairs + step4_pairs.\n\nBut wait, in the earlier example, the step4_pairs is 1, which is correct.\n\nSo, let's see how to compute this.\n\nImplementing this, the steps are:\n\n1. For each color c, compute pairs_c = min(left_c, right_c). Sum all pairs_c.\n\n2. Compute sum_left_spec = sum of left_c for all c.\n\n   sum_right_spec = sum of right_c for all c.\n\n3. Compute step2_pairs = sum_left_spec * QR.\n\n4. Compute step3_pairs = sum_right_spec * QL.\n\n5. Compute step4_pairs = QL * QR.\n\n6. Total = pairs_c + step2_pairs + step3_pairs + step4_pairs.\n\nBut wait, is this possible? Because in the earlier example, it works.\n\nBut what about when some left specific and right specific are paired in step2 and step3, but that may not be optimal.\n\nWait, perhaps step2_pairs and step3_pairs can be added without considering that some right specific could have been used in step2 or step3.\n\nWait, in the earlier example, step2_pairs is 1*1=1 (sum_left_spec is 1, QR is 1). step3_pairs is 0*1=0. step4_pairs is 1*1=1. So total is 0 +1 +0 +1=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=2, l = \"??\", r=\"??\".\n\nstep1_pairs: for all c, min(left_c, right_c) is 0.\n\nsum_left_spec =0, sum_right_spec=0.\n\nstep2_pairs = 0*2=0.\n\nstep3_pairs=0*2=0.\n\nstep4_pairs=2*2=4.\n\nTotal is 0+0+0+4=4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: l has 1 'a' and 1 '?'; r has 1 'a' and 1 '?'.\n\nstep1_pairs: a has min(1,1)=1.\n\nsum_left_spec after step1: 0.\n\nsum_right_spec after step1:0.\n\nstep2_pairs: 0 * 1=0.\n\nstep3_pairs:0 *1=0.\n\nstep4_pairs:1*1=1.\n\nTotal is 1+0+0+1=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, seems like this formula works.\n\nBut wait, another case: l has 3 'a's, r has 2 'a's and 1 '?'.\n\nstep1_pairs: 2.\n\nsum_left_spec after step1:1.\n\nQR is 1.\n\nstep2_pairs:1 *1=1.\n\nstep3_pairs: 2 *3 =6? No, wait:\n\nsum_right_spec after step1 is 0 (since right_a is 2, after step1, right_a is 0.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, after step1, for color a, left_c is 3, right_c is 2. So, step1_pairs is 2. So, sum_left_spec after step1 is 3-2=1.\n\nsum_right_spec after step1 is 0.\n\nQR is 1.\n\nQL is 0.\n\nstep2_pairs: sum_left_spec (1) * QR (1) =1.\n\nstep3_pairs: sum_right_spec (0) * QL (0)=0.\n\nstep4_pairs: QL (0) * QR (1)=0.\n\nSo, total is 2+1+0+0=3.\n\nWhich is correct: 2 pairs from a-a, and 1 pair from a-?.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: l has 3 'a's, r has 1 'a' and 2 '?'.\n\nstep1_pairs:1.\n\nsum_left_spec:3-1=2.\n\nsum_right_spec:0.\n\nQR=2.\n\nQL=0.\n\nstep2_pairs:2 *2=4.\n\nstep3_pairs:0*0=0.\n\nstep4_pairs:0*2=0.\n\nTotal:1+4=5.\n\nWhich is correct: 1 a-a pair, and 4 a-? pairs.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold.\n\nThus, the approach is:\n\nCompute step1_pairs as the sum of min(left_c, right_c) for all c.\n\nCompute sum_left_spec after step1: sum left_c - step1_pairs.\n\nCompute sum_right_spec after step1: sum right_c - step1_pairs.\n\nCompute step2_pairs = sum_left_spec * QR.\n\nCompute step3_pairs = sum_right_spec * QL.\n\nCompute step4_pairs = QL * QR.\n\nTotal = step1_pairs + step2_pairs + step3_pairs + step4_pairs.\n\nWait, but wait: what about the case where after step1, sum_left_spec and sum_right_spec are both positive, but some of them could have overlapped in step2 and step3.\n\nBut in the formula, step2_pairs and step3_pairs are independent and are added.\n\nBut in the previous examples, it worked.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each color c, compute the number of pairs as min(left_c, right_c).\n\n- Sum these to get step1_pairs.\n\n- Compute the remaining left specific (sum_left_spec) and right specific (sum_right_spec).\n\n- Compute step2_pairs = sum_left_spec * QR.\n\n- Compute step3_pairs = sum_right_spec * QL.\n\n- Compute step4_pairs = QL * QR.\n\n- Total is step1_pairs + step2_pairs + step3_pairs + step4_pairs.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example where n=2, l = ['a', '?'], r=['?', 'b'].\n\nstep1_pairs: for 'a', min(1,0)=0.\n\nsum_left_spec:1.\n\nsum_right_spec:0.\n\nQR:1.\n\nQL:1.\n\nstep2_pairs:1*1=1.\n\nstep3_pairs:0*1=0.\n\nstep4_pairs:1*1=1.\n\nTotal: 0+1+0+1=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2.\n\nl = ['a', 'a']\n\nr = ['a', 'a']\n\nstep1_pairs: min(2,2) =2.\n\nsum_left_spec:0.\n\nsum_right_spec:0.\n\nQR=0.\n\nQL=0.\n\nstep2_pairs=0.\n\nstep3_pairs=0.\n\nstep4_pairs=0.\n\nTotal is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3.\n\nl = ['a','a','?'].\n\nr = ['a','?','?'].\n\nstep1_pairs: min(2,1)=1.\n\nsum_left_spec: 2-1=1.\n\nsum_right_spec:1-1=0.\n\nQR:2.\n\nQL:1.\n\nstep2_pairs:1*2=2.\n\nstep3_pairs:0 *1=0.\n\nstep4_pairs:1*2=2.\n\nTotal:1+2+0+2=5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to work.\n\nThus, the approach is to implement this.\n\nNow, the next step is to code this.\n\nSo, the steps for the code are:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read l and r.\n\n3. Compute for each color in l and r:\n\n   - count the number of times each color appears, including '?'.\n\n   For example, create a dictionary for left_counts and right_counts.\n\n4. Compute step1_pairs: sum of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) for all c.\n\n5. Compute sum_left_spec = sum of left_counts[c] for all c, minus step1_pairs.\n\n6. sum_right_spec = sum of right_counts[c] for all c, minus step1_pairs.\n\n7. Compute QL = left_counts['?'].\n\n   QR = right_counts['?'].\n\n8. Compute step2_pairs = sum_left_spec * QR.\n\n9. step3_pairs = sum_right_spec * QL.\n\n10. step4_pairs = QL * QR.\n\n11. total_pairs = step1_pairs + step2_pairs + step3_pairs + step4_pairs.\n\n12. Now, collect the pairs.\n\nWait, but now we need to collect which pairs are selected.\n\nSo, this adds a new challenge: how to track which left and right boots are used in each step.\n\nBecause, for the step1_pairs, we have to select pairs from the specific colors.\n\nBut the order in which we select them doesn't matter as long as the maximum is achieved.\n\nBut for the output, we need to list all the pairs.\n\nSo, the problem is to not only compute the maximum number of pairs but also to track which ones are chosen.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nSo, the approach is to:\n\n- For step1_pairs: for each color c, take the min of left_c and right_c.\n\n   So, for each c, we can take as many pairs as possible, pairing the earliest possible left and right.\n\nBut how to track which left and right indices are used.\n\nAlternatively, for each color c, the left indices are the positions where l[i] = c.\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nSo, for each c, we can take the first min(left_count, right_count) pairs.\n\nBut how to track which ones.\n\nThis requires for each color c:\n\n   Take the first k = min(left_count, right_count) pairs.\n\n   For each of these k pairs, select the left index and right index.\n\nBut how to choose which ones.\n\nPerhaps, for each color c, the left",
