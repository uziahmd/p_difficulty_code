Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, Valera has an array 'a' with 'n' integers. He also has a function f(x) that's calculated using the binary representation of x. The goal is to find the maximum value of f(x) for all x between 0 and m, inclusive.\n\nWait, the function f(x) is a sum where each bit in x contributes a specific a_i. Oh right, the formula is a0 multiplied by bit 0 of x (which is the least significant bit), a1 times bit 1, and so on up to a(n-1) times bit (n-1). So f(x) is essentially adding up a subset of the array a based on the bits set in x.\n\nSo the task is to find the maximum possible f(x) where x is within [0, m]. The challenge here is to compute this efficiently because n can be up to 105, which suggests that a brute-force approach might not work due to time constraints.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Each bit in x contributes a certain a_i if that bit is set. So the maximum f(x) would be the sum of the largest possible a_i's. But since x is limited by m, we can't just take all a_i's because that might require x to be larger than m.\n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal x is the one that sets the highest possible bits first, selecting as many of the larger a_i's as possible without exceeding m. So maybe a greedy approach could work here.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to represent m in binary and then decide for each bit whether to include it or not, ensuring that the resulting number doesn't exceed m. For each bit position from the highest to the lowest, we check if setting that bit would still allow us to set higher bits in such a way that the total x is <= m.\n\nWait, but how does that translate into selecting which a_i's to include? Because each a_i corresponds to a specific bit. So for each bit i, we can choose to include a_i or not. The question is, which combination of a_i's will give the maximum sum without the corresponding x exceeding m.\n\nSo perhaps the problem reduces to selecting a subset of bits (each representing an a_i) such that the binary number formed by those bits is as large as possible without exceeding m. And the sum of the selected a_i's should be maximized.\n\nBut how do we model this selection? It's similar to the knapsack problem, but with a twist. Instead of weights, each item has a 'bit position', and we can only select items whose bits form a number less than or equal to m.\n\nWait, yes! So it's like a variation of the 0-1 knapsack where each item has a weight (the value a_i) and a 'cost' which is 2^i (since each bit contributes to the value of x). But wait, no, because the cost isn't the same as the weight. Or perhaps, each a_i can be taken or not, and the sum of the a_i's is the value we want to maximize, while the sum of the 2^i's (for the bits taken) must be <= m.\n\nYes! So it's a knapsack-like problem where each item has a weight (2^i) and a value (a_i). We need to select a subset of items where the total weight is <= m, and the total value is maximized.\n\nBut the standard knapsack approach might not be feasible here because m can be up to 2^105, which is a huge number. So a dynamic programming approach with O(m) time complexity is impossible.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, but n is up to 105, which means that the maximum number of bits we have is 105. So perhaps we can model this as a bitmask problem where each bit represents whether to include a_i or not, but the sum of the 2^i's must be <= m.\n\nBut again, with 105 bits, the possible combinations are 2^105, which is way too big. So that's not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: The maximum possible sum is achieved when we select the largest possible a_i's, provided their corresponding bits don't make the x exceed m.\n\nSo perhaps we can process the a_i's in descending order of a_i, and for each a_i, check if including it (i.e., setting its bit) would still allow the x to be <= m.\n\nWait, but the order in which we process them might matter. For example, choosing a lower a_i with a high bit might prevent us from choosing a higher a_i with a lower bit.\n\nHmm, maybe we can build the solution bit by bit, starting from the highest bit down to the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of a function \\( f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in the range from 0 to \\( m \\).
