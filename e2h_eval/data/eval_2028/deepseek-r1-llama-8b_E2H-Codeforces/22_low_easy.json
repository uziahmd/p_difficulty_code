After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem says that we have a group of students and their grades in various subjects. For each subject, a student is considered the best if they have the highest mark for that subject. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. We need to find the number of such successful students.\n\nHmm, right. So the input gives n students and m subjects. Each student has m marks, one for each subject. Each mark is a character from 1 to 9.\n\nSo, the plan is: for each subject, determine which student(s) have the highest mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the top in at least one subject. Count how many such students there are.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input. The first line is two integers, n and m. Then, there are n lines, each representing a student's grades. Each line is a string of m characters, each being a digit from 1-9.\n\nWait, the example input shows something like '3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112'—so the first line after n and m is the data for the first student, next line the second, etc.\n\nSo, I'll need to process each of these strings into a list of marks per student.\n\nOnce I have all the marks, I need to process each subject across all students.\n\nFor each subject (from 0 to m-1, since Python is zero-indexed), I can collect all the marks from each student in that subject. Then, find the maximum mark in that subject. Then, note which student(s) have that maximum mark.\n\nBut wait, for each subject, only the students with the maximum mark are considered best for that subject. So, for each subject, I can keep track of the maximum value and the students who achieved it.\n\nOnce I have, for each subject, the set of students who are the best, then for each student, I check if they are in any of those sets. If yes, they're successful.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n2. Read n strings, each of length m. Convert each string into a list of integers (or just keep as characters, but probably better to convert to integers for easier processing).\n3. For each of the m subjects:\n   a. Collect all the marks from each student for that subject.\n   b. Find the maximum mark in that subject.\n   c. Record which students have this maximum mark.\n4. For each student, check if they are in any of the best sets for any subject.\n5. Count the number of students who are successful.\n\nNow, let's think about data structures to use.\n\nFor each subject, perhaps a dictionary where the key is the subject index, and the value is a list of student indices (like 0-based or 1-based?) who are the best in that subject.\n\nAlternatively, for each subject, have a variable storing the max mark and a list of students who have that.\n\nWait, maybe for each subject, I can create a list where each element is the mark for that subject of each student. Then, for each subject, find the maximum value, then collect all students whose mark equals the maximum.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n- Read n, m.\n- For each of the n students, read their grade string. Split into individual characters, then convert each to int, creating a list of lists. Like, student_marks[i][j] is the j-th subject's mark of student i.\n\nWait, but in the input, each student's line is a string of m characters, each representing a subject. So for each student, the first character is subject 0, second subject 1, etc.\n\nSo, for example, the first sample input has three students:\n\nStudent 1: \"223\" → [2,2,3]\nStudent 2: \"232\" → [2,3,2]\nStudent 3: \"112\" → [1,1,2]\n\nSo for subject 0 (first column), the marks are 2,2,1. Max is 2, achieved by student 0 and 1. So in subject 0, students 0 and 1 are best.\n\nSimilarly, for subject 1: marks are 2,3,1. Max is 3, achieved by student 1.\n\nSubject 2: 3,2,2. Max is 3, achieved by student 0.\n\nThen, for each student, check if they are in any of the subject's best lists.\n\nStudent 0: in subject 0 and 2 → successful.\nStudent 1: in subject 0 and 1 → successful.\nStudent 2: not in any → not successful.\nTotal 2.\n\nSo the output is 2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks across multiple subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** First, read the number of students `n` and the number of subjects `m`. Then, read each student's grades, which are provided as a string of characters.\n2. **Convert Grades to Numerical Values:** Convert each character in the grade string to an integer for easier comparison.\n3. **Track Best Performers per Subject:** For each subject, determine the highest mark achieved by any student. Record which students achieved this highest mark.\n4. **Determine Successful Students:** Check each student to see if they are among the best performers in any subject. Count these successful students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    s = input().strip()\n    students.append([int(c) for c in s])\n\nsubject_best = {}\nfor subj in range(m):\n    max_mark = -1\n    best_students = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        mark = students[i][subj]\n        if mark > max_mark:\n            max_mark = mark\n            best_students = [i]\n        elif mark == max_mark:\n            best_students.append(i)\n    subject_best[subj] = best_students\n\nsuccessful = set()\nfor i in range(n):\n    for subj in subject_best:\n        if i in subject_best[subj]:\n            successful.add(i)\n            break\n\nprint(len(successful))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The first line contains `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). Each subsequent line represents a student's grades for `m` subjects.\n2. **Grade Conversion:** Each student's grades are converted from strings to integers for numerical comparison.\n3. **Subject Analysis:** For each subject, iterate through all students' marks to find the maximum mark and identify which students achieved this mark.\n4. **Identifying Success:** For each student, check if they are among the top performers in any subject. If so, they are marked as successful.\n5. **Output Result:** The count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging simple loops and set operations, making the solution both clear and efficient.",
