String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vasily the Bear and Beautiful Strings.\" Hmm, sounds interesting.\n\nSo, the task is to count the number of beautiful strings based on certain criteria. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nA string is considered beautiful if it meets these conditions:\n1. It consists only of 0s and 1s.\n2. The number of 0s is exactly n, and the number of 1s is exactly m.\n3. We can obtain the character g (either 0 or 1) from the string through some modifications.\n\nWait, what's a modification? Oh right, a modification replaces the last two characters with one character. If both are 0s, replace them with a 0. Otherwise, replace with a 0. So each modification reduces the length by 1.\n\nAnd the initial string's length must be at least 2 because you can't modify a string shorter than that.\n\nThe goal is to find the number of such beautiful strings modulo 1e9+7.\n\nHmm, okay. So for each possible string of 0s and 1s with exactly n 0s and m 1s, we need to determine whether it can be modified down to a single character 'g' after some number of steps.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think about the process of modifications. Each modification step takes the last two characters and replaces them with one. So the order in which we perform these operations affects the outcome.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a way to model the possible end states based on the counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nLet me consider that each modification reduces the length by 1. So the initial length is n + m. After k modifications, the length becomes (n + m - k). We want this to eventually become 1, so k must be (n + m - 1) - 1 = n + m - 2 steps, but wait no: each modification reduces the length by 1, so to reach 1, you need (length -1) steps. So for a string of length L, you need L-1 modifications to get down to a single character.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial string is length s = n + m. Each modification reduces s by 1. So to reach a single character, you need s-1 modifications. But the problem allows any number of modifications, possibly zero, as long as the resulting string can be obtained. So for the string to be able to reach a single character, it must have at least length 2, but when we perform enough modifications, it can get down to 1.\n\nBut wait, the condition is that after some modifications, the string can be reduced to g. So the initial string must be reducible to a single character g through a series of modifications.\n\nBut how do these modifications affect the count of 0s and 1s?\n\nHmm, perhaps each modification step changes the number of 0s and 1s in a certain way.\n\nWait, let's think about the effect of a single modification. When you modify the last two characters:\n\nCase 1: both are 0 → replace with 0. So the count of 0s decreases by 1 (since two 0s are removed and one 0 is added). So the new count of 0s is (current_0 -1), and the count of 1s remains the same.\n\nCase 2: both are 1 → replace with 1. So the count of 1s decreases by 1.\n\nCase 3: one is 0 and the other is 1 → replace with 0. So the count of 0s increases by 0 (two are replaced with one 0: net change is -1 for 0?), wait no. Original counts: suppose you have x 0s and y 1s. After replacing two 0s, it's x-1 and y. Or if you replace two 1s, it's x and y-1. Or if you replace 0 and 1, it's x-1 and y-1, but then you add one 0, so x becomes x-1 +1 = x, and y becomes y-1.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the last two are 0 and 0: after replacement, they become 0. So the total 0s was (count_0) → now it's (count_0 - 2 + 1) = count_0 -1.\n\nSimilarly, if last two are 1 and 1: after replacement, count_1 becomes count_1 - 2 + 1 = count_1 -1.\n\nIf last two are 0 and 1: replace with 0. So count_0 was (count_0 - 2 + 1) → count_0 -1. Because we lost two 0s and 1, and gained one 0. So net loss of one 0 and one 1.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, in the case of 0 and 1: the two are being replaced by one 0. So the 0 count goes from c0 to c0 -1 (because we had one 0 and one 1, so subtracting 1 from 0 and 1). The 1 count is c1 -1 as well.\n\nSo each modification affects the counts in different ways.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's another way to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final character depends on the parity of certain counts.\n\nWait, considering that each modification reduces the length by 1, and the process continues until we have one character left.\n\nWhat's the key here? For a given string to be reducible to g, perhaps the sum of 0s and 1s after a certain number of steps must meet some condition.\n\nWait, but each modification can change the count of 0s and 1s. So perhaps the parity of certain counts matters.\n\nWait, another approach: think about the minimal possible and maximal possible transformations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using dynamic programming, where for each possible state (number of 0s, number of 1s, current length) and for each possible last two characters, we track whether it's possible to reach that state.\n\nBut given that n and m can be up to 105, that could be manageable.\n\nWait, but the initial string has exactly n 0s and m 1s. So the state is (a, b), where a is the number of 0s, and b is the number of 1s. The length is a + b.\n\nEach modification step changes a and b based on the last two characters.\n\nBut how do we model the last two characters? Because the last two could be 00, 01, 10, or 11.\n\nWait, but for the purpose of determining the possible transitions, perhaps we can model the state as (a, b, last_char). But since the last_char can only be 0 or 1, that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not. Because the last two characters could influence the next transition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state should include the last character, because when we perform a modification, the next state depends on the last two.\n\nHmm, this seems tricky. Let's think about the problem differently.\n\nWhat's the final character after all possible modifications? It's g. So the question is: can we, through a series of modifications, reduce the string to g?\n\nEach modification step reduces the length by 1. So for a string of length l, after l-1 modifications, it's reduced to one character.\n\nBut how does the sequence of modifications affect the counts?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final character depends on the number of times certain operations are applied.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to look at the initial counts of 0s and 1s and see whether it's possible to reach g through some sequence of modifications.\n\nLet me consider that each modification can be thought of as merging two adjacent characters into one, which depends on their values.\n\nEach time you merge two 0s, you decrease 0 count by 1 (because two are removed, one added). Similarly, merging two 1s decreases 1 count by 1. Merging a 0 and a 1 leads to a 0, which decreases 0 count by 1 and 1 count by 1.\n\nWait, but the merging can be done anywhere in the string, as long as it's the last two characters each time.\n\nSo perhaps the order in which the modifications are performed affects the outcome. But perhaps there's a way to model this without considering the order.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother angle: the final character is determined by the way the modifications are applied. For example, each modification step can be seen as a kind of reduction, and the overall effect is a combination of these reductions.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern yet.\n\nLet me try to think about small examples.\n\nTake the first sample input: n=1, m=1, g=0.\n\nPossible beautiful strings are \"01\" and \"10\". Both can be modified once to get \"0\" or \"1\", but wait wait. Wait, no, the problem says that the initial string must be beautiful, and then through some modifications, it must be possible to reach g.\n\nWait, no: the string is beautiful if it meets the criteria (exactly n 0s, m 1s), and also, the string can be modified (possibly zero times) to reach g.\n\nSo for the first sample, the beautiful strings are \"01\" and \"10\".\n\nWait, but why can't the string be longer than 2 and still be beautiful?\n\nAh, because the string must be beautiful regardless of its length. No, wait no. The beautiful string is defined as a string that satisfies the 0 and 1 counts, and can be modified to reach g.\n\nWait, the beautiful string is exactly the string that has n 0s and m 1s, and can be modified (some number of times, including zero) to reach g.\n\nSo the initial string is of length n + m, but through modifications, it can be reduced to a single character g.\n\nWait, but the initial string may be of any length >=1, but to perform a modification, it must be of length >=2. So for a string to be reducible to g, it must have length >=1, but to perform at least one modification, it needs to be at least 2.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"some (possibly zero) number of modifications\". So if the string is already of length 1, then it's either 0 or 1, and thus if g equals that, it's acceptable.\n\nSo for a string of length 1, it's acceptable if it equals g.\n\nSo the beautiful strings are those with n 0s and m 1s, and either:\n\n- They are of length 1, and equal to g.\n\nOR\n\n- They can be reduced (through some modifications) to a single character equal to g.\n\nSo for the first sample, n=1, m=1. The strings are \"01\" and \"10\", each of length 2. Each can be modified once to become \"0\" or \"1\", but wait:\n\nWait, modifying \"01\" would take the last two characters (0 and 1), replace them with 0. So the result is \"0\", which is g=0. So yes, that's allowed.\n\nSimilarly, modifying \"10\" would take the last two, which are 1 and 0, replace with 0. So the string becomes \"0\", which is g=0.\n\nThus both are beautiful.\n\nIn the second sample, n=2, m=2, g=0. The beautiful strings are four in total.\n\nWait, the four strings are \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\". Let's see why.\n\nEach of these can be modified to 0. How?\n\nFor example, \"0011\": let's see. It's of length 4.\n\nWe can perform 3 modifications:\n\nModify last two 1s → replace with 1 → string becomes \"001\".\n\nThen, modify last two 0s → replace with 0 → string becomes \"00\".\n\nThen, modify last two 0s → replace with 0 → string becomes \"0\". So yes, ends at 0.\n\nSimilarly, \"1001\" can be modified as follows:\n\nModify the last two 0 and 1 → replace with 0 → string becomes \"100\".\n\nThen, modify last two 0 and 0 → replace with 0 → string becomes \"10\".\n\nThen, modify last two 1 and 0 → replace with 0 → string becomes \"0\".\n\nYes.\n\nSo each of these four strings can be reduced to 0.\n\nSo the problem is to count all such strings with n 0s and m 1s, and can be reduced to g via some modifications.\n\nNow, the challenge is to model this in code.\n\nHmm. So for a given n and m, how many binary strings with exactly n 0s and m 1s can be reduced to g through some sequence of modifications.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled using dynamic programming, where the state includes the current counts of 0s and 1s, along with some information about the last character(s).\n\nBut given that n and m can be up to 105, the DP state needs to be manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps the state can be represented by the current counts of 0s (a) and 1s (b), and the last character (c), which can be 0 or 1.\n\nAdditionally, the length is a + b, which decreases by 1 with each modification.\n\nSo the idea is to model the possible transitions between these states.\n\nBut since the modifications can be done in any order, but each step depends on the last two characters, perhaps the last character is sufficient to model the state.\n\nWait, but the last two characters could influence the next modification step. However, perhaps the state can be represented by the current a, b, and the last character.\n\nBecause the next modification depends on the last two, which is the last character and whatever comes before it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the state as (a, b, last_char), where last_char represents the last character of the current string.\n\nEach modification step will change a and b based on the last two characters, which depends on the current last_char and the previous to last character.\n\nBut wait, the previous to last character is not part of the state. So this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state can be (a, b, last_char), and for each step, when performing a modification, we consider the possible next last_char based on the current last_char and the previous character.\n\nBut this seems challenging.\n\nWait, maybe an alternative approach is to realize that the order in which we perform the modifications doesn't matter in the end—only the sequence of choices made during each modification affects the final outcome.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the final character depends on the initial count of 0s and 1s, and the way the modifications are applied.\n\nFor instance, if the initial count of 0s is even or odd, perhaps that influences whether we can end up with a certain character.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the parity of the count of 0s and 1s.\n\nWait, let's think about what happens when we perform a modification:\n\nCase 1: Modify two 0s → 0 count decreases by 1. So parity of 0 count flips.\n\nCase 2: Modify two 1s → 1 count decreases by 1. Parity flips.\n\nCase 3: Modify 0 and 1 → 0 count decreases by 1, 1 count decreases by 1. So parities of both flip.\n\nHmm, interesting. So each modification changes the parity of one or both counts.\n\nThis suggests that the parities of a and b (number of 0s and 1s) play a role in determining the possible outcomes.\n\nMoreover, the initial counts a and b must satisfy certain parity conditions to reach g.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be broken down into checking whether it's possible to reach g given the initial a and b, and then counting the number of valid strings that can be reduced accordingly.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the possible final character after all modifications.\n\nSuppose the initial a and b are such that after some number of modifications, the final character is g.\n\nWhat's the condition for that?\n\nEach modification reduces the length by 1, so the number of modifications is (initial_length - 1). Since initial_length is a + b, the number of modifications is (a + b - 1).\n\nEach modification changes the counts as per the cases above.\n\nBut since the order of modifications affects the outcome, perhaps it's hard to model directly.\n\nAlternative approach: think recursively. For a string of a 0s and b 1s, and ending with some last character, can it be reduced to g?\n\nBut with a and b up to 105, this could be manageable.\n\nLet me model this as a memoization problem.\n\nWe can represent the state as (a, b, last_char), where last_char is 0 or 1.\n\nThe base case is when a + b == 1: then the only possible character is last_char. So if last_char is g, then this state is valid; else, it's not.\n\nFor other cases, we can consider all possible ways to modify the last two characters, leading to a new state, and see if any of those paths lead to a valid state.\n\nWait, but how do we model the possible transitions?\n\nEach modification step depends on the last two characters. So for a state (a, b, c), where c is the last character, the previous character (before the last) could be either 0 or 1, depending on the prior steps.\n\nBut this seems difficult because the previous character is not part of the state.\n\nHmm, perhaps the state should include more information, such as the last two characters. But that would make the state size too large.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state can include the last character, and the possible transitions can be considered based on that.\n\nWait, but for a state (a, b, c), the next modification step would require knowing the previous character to determine what operation is being performed.\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nAlternative idea: the process of modifications can be viewed as building the string in reverse. That is, starting from the single character g and adding characters step by step, ensuring that each addition is compatible with the modifications.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the minimal and maximal possible ways to reach g.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nLet me think about what the initial string must satisfy.\n\nAfter all modifications, the string must be reduced to g. Each modification step reduces the length by 1, so the initial string must have a length of at least 1 (but more precisely, to perform any modifications, it must be at least 2). But since the initial string is beautiful, it's of length n + m, which is >=1.\n\nSo for the initial string to be reducible to g, it must be possible to perform a series of modifications such that after (n + m -1) steps, the string is reduced to g.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial string can be modified any number of times, not necessarily all the way to 1. So the initial string can be modified any number of times, including zero, as long as after those modifications, the string is of length 1 and equals g.\n\nWait, no. Because the string can be modified to any length >=1, but to reach g, it's necessary that after some modifications, the string is reduced to exactly g.\n\nSo for example, if the initial string can be modified to have length 3, and that string can be further modified to length 2, and then to length 1, which is g.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows: the initial string must be reducible to a single character g, which can be achieved via any number of modifications. So for each initial string, we need to check if it can be reduced to g.\n\nBut how to model that.\n\nPerhaps we can model the possible a and b counts, along with some information about the last character, and see if there's a way to reach g.\n\nSo, let's think about a DP table where dp[a][b][last_char] represents the number of ways to have a 0s and b 1s with last_char as the last character, and being able to be reduced to g.\n\nThe transitions would be as follows:\n\nFor each state (a, b, c), where c is the last character, we can consider all possible previous characters (d) that could be before c in the string.\n\nWait, but this seems complicated because the previous character could be anything.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each state (a, b, c), we can consider all possible pairs (d, e) that could have been the last two characters before c.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to realize that the parity of the number of 0s and 1s must allow certain conditions.\n\nWait, let's think about the final character.\n\nThe final character is g. So for the string to be reducible to g, the sum of 0s and 1s must satisfy certain parity conditions.\n\nWait, perhaps the final character is determined by the initial counts and the way the modifications are applied.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think about the process in reverse. Starting from the character g, and trying to build the original string by adding characters in reverse order.\n\nEach step in the reverse process would involve adding a new character at the end, which would correspond to a modification step in the forward process.\n\nBut how?\n\nIn the reverse process:\n\n- We start with g.\n- Each step adds a new character to the end (left side in the forward process).\n- The added character must satisfy the modification rule: if the new character and the previous one form a pair that could have been modified.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, in the reverse process, each step adds two characters that were merged into one in the forward process.\n\nSo for each modification in the forward process, in the reverse process, we add two characters that were merged into one.\n\nFor example, in the forward process, merging 00 gives 0. In the reverse process, to create this, we would add 0 to the end, which was previously a 0.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting somewhere.\n\nSo, in the reverse process, each step adds two characters to the string, which could have been the result of a forward modification.\n\nThus, the reverse process builds the original string by adding pairs of characters, where each pair could have been the last two before a modification.\n\nSo, the reverse process starts with g, and for each step, adds a new pair of characters at the end, according to certain rules.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nWell, perhaps each addition of a pair (x, y) must satisfy the condition that, in the forward process, merging x and y would result in the previous character.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the pair (x, y) must have been the last two characters before a modification, and when merged, resulted in the current last character.\n\nWait, perhaps the pair (x, y) must satisfy that merging them would produce the current last character.\n\nIn the forward process, the last two are merged into one, which becomes the new last character.\n\nSo, in the reverse process, given the current last character c, the previous pair must have been such that merging x and y would produce c.\n\nSo, for each c, the possible pairs (x, y) that, when merged, give c are:\n\n- If x and y are 00: merged into 0 → so c must be 0. So the pair is (0,0).\n- If x and y are 11: merged into 1 → so pair is (1,1).\n- If x and y are 01 or 10: merged into 0 → so pair is (0,1) or (1,0).\n\nThus, in the reverse process, for a given current last character c, the possible pairs (x, y) are:\n\n- If c is 0: possible pairs are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0).\n- If c is 1: possible pairs are (1,1).\n\nWait, no. Because when merging 0 and 1, the result is 0, not 1. So the pair (0,1) would lead to 0, not 1.\n\nSo for c=1, the only possible pair is (1,1), because merging them results in 1.\n\nFor c=0, possible pairs are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), because merging any of these pairs produces 0.\n\nSo in the reverse process, each step involves adding a pair (x, y) to the end, such that the last character of the current string is c, and the pair (x, y) when merged produces c.\n\nSo the reverse process starts with g, and each step adds a pair (x, y) that could have been merged to produce the current last character.\n\nBut how do the counts of 0s and 1s change in the reverse process?\n\nEach step adds two characters, so a and b increase by 1 or 2, depending on x and y.\n\nWait, no: in the reverse process, each step adds two characters, so a and b are incremented by the number of 0s and 1s in x and y.\n\nSo for each possible pair (x, y):\n\n- If x is 0 and y is 0 → a increases by 2, b remains same.\n- If x is 0 and y is 1 → a increases by 1, b increases by 1.\n- If x is 1 and y is 0 → a increases by 1, b increases by 1.\n- If x is 1 and y is 1 → b increases by 2, a remains same.\n\nSo, for each state (a, b, c) in the reverse process, the next states are determined by adding a pair (x, y) that, when merged, produces c.\n\nThus, the reverse process can be modeled as a BFS where each node is (a, b, c), and edges represent adding a pair (x, y) that leads to c.\n\nThe goal is to reach a state where a = n and b = m, regardless of c.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Initialize a queue with (0, 0, g). This represents the initial state with 0 zeros, 0 ones, and last character g.\n\n2. For each state in the queue, generate all possible next states by adding a valid pair (x, y) as per the reverse process.\n\n3. For each possible pair, compute the new a, b, and new last character.\n\n4. Check if the new state (new_a, new_b, new_c) has a <= n, b <= m, and a + b is within the initial constraints.\n\n5. Continue this process until we reach a state where a = n and b = m.\n\n6. Sum all the ways to reach (n, m, c) for any c.\n\nWait, but this is a bit vague. Let me think again.\n\nThe reverse process builds the original string by adding pairs, and the final string must have exactly n 0s and m 1s.\n\nSo, in the reverse process, each step adds a pair (x, y) that, when merged, produced the current last character.\n\nThe initial state is (g), which is (0,0, g).\n\nThen, each step adds a pair, increasing a and b accordingly.\n\nWe need to find all possible ways to reach (n, m, c) for any c.\n\nSo, the DP state can be represented as (a, b, c), and for each state, we can consider all possible pairs (x, y) that could have been merged to produce c.\n\nEach such pair contributes to the new state (a + dx, b + dy, new_c), where dx and dy are the changes in 0s and 1s due to (x, y).\n\nWait, but in the reverse process, the new state's last character is c, and the pair (x, y) must merge to c.\n\nSo, for each (a, b, c), the possible transitions are:\n\n- Add pair (0, 0): this requires c = 0. New a += 2, b remains same. New last character is 0 (since merging 0 and 0 gives 0).\n- Add pair (0, 1): requires c = 0. New a +=1, b +=1. Last character becomes 0.\n- Add pair (1, 0): requires c = 0. New a +=1, b +=1. Last character becomes 0.\n- Add pair (1, 1): requires c = 1. New a remains same, b +=2. Last character becomes 1.\n\nSo, for each state (a, b, c), the possible transitions are as follows:\n\nIf c is 0:\n\n- Add (0,0) → new_a = a + 2, new_b = b, new_c = 0.\n- Add (0,1) → new_a = a +1, new_b = b +1, new_c = 0.\n- Add (1,0) → same as above.\n\nIf c is 1:\n\n- Add (1,1) → new_a = a, new_b = b + 2, new_c = 1.\n\nSo, for each state, we can generate up to three or one transitions, depending on c.\n\nThus, the DP can be built by starting from (0,0,g) and expanding to all possible (a, b, c) until we reach (n, m, any c).\n\nThe value of dp[a][b][c] represents the number of ways to reach a 0s, b 1s, and last character c.\n\nThe answer is the sum of dp[n][m][0] and dp[n][m][1], modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but wait: in the reverse process, each step adds a pair (x, y) that could have been merged to produce the current last character.\n\nSo the initial state is (0, 0, g). Then, each step adds a pair, increasing a and b.\n\nBut the original string must have exactly n 0s and m 1s. So in the reverse process, the final state must have a = n and b = m.\n\nThus, the DP should track all possible (a, b, c) and accumulate the count for each.\n\nBut considering the constraints, n and m can be up to 105, so the DP table size is manageable: 106 * 106 * 2 = around 22k entries.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Initialize dp[0][0][g] = 1.\n\n- For each state (a, b, c) in the DP, process all possible transitions:\n\n   For c=0:\n\n      For each possible pair that leads to c:\n\n         Add (0,0) → new_a = a+2, new_b = b.\n\n         Add (0,1) → new_a = a+1, new_b = b+1.\n\n         Add (1,0) → same as above.\n\n   For c=1:\n\n      Only pair (1,1) → new_a = a, new_b = b+2.\n\n   For each transition, check if new_a and new_b exceed n and m, respectively.\n\n   If new_a > n or new_b > m, skip.\n\n   Else, add the current count to dp[new_a][new_b][new_c], where new_c is the result of the merge.\n\nWait, but what is new_c? For example, when adding (0,0), the new_c is 0.\n\nWhen adding (0,1), the new_c is 0.\n\nWhen adding (1,1), new_c is 1.\n\nSo, for each transition, the new_c is known based on the pair added.\n\nWait, but in the reverse process, the new_c is the result of merging x and y.\n\nSo, for each pair (x, y), the new_c is:\n\nif x == y == 0 → new_c = 0.\n\nif x == y == 1 → new_c = 1.\n\nif x and y are different → new_c = 0.\n\nThus, for each pair, the new_c can be computed.\n\nThus, the transitions can be handled as:\n\nFor each state (a, b, c):\n\n   if c is 0:\n\n      // can add (0,0)\n\n      new_a = a + 2\n\n      new_b = b\n\n      new_c = 0\n\n      if new_a <= n and new_b <= m:\n\n          dp[new_a][new_b][new_c] += dp[a][b][c]\n\n      // can add (0,1)\n\n      new_a = a + 1\n\n      new_b = b + 1\n\n      new_c = 0\n\n      if new_a <= n and new_b <= m:\n\n          dp[new_a][new_b][new_c] += dp[a][b][c]\n\n      // can add (1,0)\n\n      new_a = a + 1\n\n      new_b = b + 1\n\n      new_c = 0\n\n      if new_a <= n and new_b <= m:\n\n          dp[new_a][new_b][new_c] += dp[a][b][c]\n\n   else:\n\n      // c is 1\n\n      // can add (1,1)\n\n      new_a = a\n\n      new_b = b + 2\n\n      new_c = 1\n\n      if new_a <= n and new_b <= m:\n\n          dp[new_a][new_b][new_c] += dp[a][b][c]\n\nSo, the DP transitions can be implemented as such.\n\nNow, the initial state is (0, 0, g) with count 1.\n\nBut wait, what if g is 0 and the initial state is (0, 0, 0)? Then, adding a pair (0,0) would lead to (2, 0, 0).\n\nBut for the original string, a=2, b=0. Can this be a beautiful string? Only if it can be reduced to g=0.\n\nYes, because it's \"00\", which can be modified to 0.\n\nThus, the DP correctly captures this.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize the DP table with dp[0][0][g] = 1.\n\n2. For each possible a and b, and for each c in {0, 1}, if dp[a][b][c] is non-zero, process the transitions.\n\n3. For each transition, compute the new_a, new_b, new_c, and add the count to the new state.\n\n4. Continue until no more transitions are possible.\n\nFinally, sum dp[n][m][0] and dp[n][m][1], which gives the total number of beautiful strings.\n\nBut wait, in the reverse process, each step adds a pair, so the a and b counts are increased by the number of 0s and 1s in the pair.\n\nThus, the DP correctly models the reverse process.\n\nNow, the next thing is to implement this in Python.\n\nWe'll use a 3-dimensional DP array: dp[a][b][c], where a ranges from 0 to n, b from 0 to m, and c is 0 or 1.\n\nWe can represent this as a dictionary or a 3D list.\n\nGiven that n and m can be up to 105, a 3D list is feasible.\n\nInitialize dp[0][0][g] = 1.\n\nThen, for each a from 0 to n:\n\n   for each b from 0 to m:\n\n      for each c in 0, 1:\n\n          if dp[a][b][c] is 0, skip.\n\n          process the transitions as described.\n\nBut to manage the transitions, perhaps we can process the states in a BFS-like manner, using a queue to track which states need to be processed.\n\nAlternatively, since the transitions only depend on smaller a and b, we can iterate a and b in increasing order.\n\nBut perhaps the best way is to use a BFS approach, processing each state once.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Use a queue to process each state in the order they are discovered.\n\n- For each state (a, b, c), generate all possible next states as per the transitions, and add them to the queue if not already visited.\n\nBut to avoid revisiting the same state multiple times, we can mark a state as visited once it's processed.\n\nBut since each transition only increases a and/or b, and we're processing a and b in a certain order, perhaps we can manage without a visited set.\n\nWait, since a and b can only increase in the reverse process, because each step adds a pair, so a and b can never decrease. Thus, once a state (a, b, c) is processed, any future states derived from it will have a higher a or b, so they can be processed in order.\n\nThus, perhaps we can process a and b in increasing order, and for each a and b, process the transitions.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nInitialize a 3D array dp[a][b][c] to 0.\n\nSet dp[0][0][g] = 1.\n\nFor a in 0 to n:\n\n   for b in 0 to m:\n\n      for c in 0, 1:\n\n          current = dp[a][b][c]\n\n          if current == 0: continue\n\n          if c == 0:\n\n              // add (0,0) pair\n\n              new_a = a + 2\n\n              new_b = b\n\n              if new_a <= n and new_b <= m:\n\n                  dp[new_a][new_b][0] += current\n\n                  dp[new_a][new_b][0] %= MOD\n\n              // add (0,1) pair\n\n              new_a = a + 1\n\n              new_b = b + 1\n\n              if new_a <= n and new_b <= m:\n\n                  dp[new_a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be reduced to a specific character `g` through a series of modifications. A beautiful string is defined as a string consisting of exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones, and it can be transformed into the character `g` using the allowed modifications.\n\n### Approach\nThe solution involves using dynamic programming (DP) to model the possible states of the string after each modification. Each state is represented by the counts of zeros (`a`), ones (`b`), and the last character (`c`). The goal is to determine how many ways we can reach the state where there are exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones.\n\n1. **State Representation**: Use a 3D DP array `dp[a][b][c]` where `a` is the count of zeros, `b` is the count of ones, and `c` is the last character (0 or 1).\n2. **Transitions**: For each state `(a, b, c)`, consider all possible pairs of characters that could have been merged to produce `c`. Each pair will transition to a new state with updated counts of zeros and ones.\n3. **Initialization**: Start from the state where the last character is `g` and no modifications have been performed.\n4. **Modifications**: For each state, compute the next possible states by adding valid pairs of characters, ensuring the counts do not exceed `n` and `m`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\nmax_a = n\nmax_b = m\n\n# Initialize DP table\ndp = [[[0] * 2 for _ in range(max_b + 1)] for __ in range(max_a + 1)]\ndp[0][0][g] = 1\n\nfor a in range(n + 1):\n    for b in range(m + 1):\n        for c in [0, 1]:\n            current = dp[a][b][c]\n            if current == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # Process transitions for c=0\n            if c == 0:\n                # Add (0,0)\n                new_a = a + 2\n                new_b = b\n                if new_a <= n and new_b <= m:\n                    dp[new_a][new_b][0] = (dp[new_a][new_b][0] + current) % MOD\n                \n                # Add (0,1)\n                new_a = a + 1\n                new_b = b + 1\n                if new_a <= n and new_b <= m:\n                    dp[new_a][new_b][0] = (dp[new_a][new_b][0] + current) % MOD\n                \n                # Add (1,0)\n                new_a = a + 1\n                new_b = b + 1\n                if new_a <= n and new_b <= m:\n                    dp[new_a][new_b][0] = (dp[new_a][new_b][0] + current) % MOD\n            \n            else:\n                # c is 1, can only add (1,1)\n                new_a = a\n                new_b = b + 2\n                if new_a <= n and new_b <= m:\n                    dp[new_a][new_b][1] = (dp[new_a][new_b][1] + current) % MOD\n\n# Sum the results for a = n, b = m\nresult = (dp[n][m][0] + dp[n][m][1]) % MOD\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start with the initial state where the string is just `g`, so `dp[0][0][g] = 1`.\n- **Transitions**: For each state `(a, b, c)`, we consider all valid pairs that could have been merged to produce `c`. Each pair leads to a new state with updated counts of zeros and ones.\n- **Modifications**: Each modification step increases the length of the string by one, but since we are working in reverse, each step effectively adds characters to the string.\n- **Result Calculation**: After processing all possible states, the result is the sum of the states where the counts of zeros and ones match `n` and `m`, respectively.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the problem using dynamic programming and ensures that all possible transformations are considered, leading to the correct count of beautiful strings modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).",
