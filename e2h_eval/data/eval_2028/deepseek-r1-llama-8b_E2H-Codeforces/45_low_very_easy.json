There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a tennis tournament where players are eliminated in each game, and the tournament grid isn't fixed yet. But there's a specific rule: two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. My task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in.\n\nHmm, right. So the winner needs to play as many games as possible while following that rule. Let me think about how the tournament could be structured to maximize this.\n\nLet's consider some examples first. Like the sample input:\n\nFor n=2, the winner plays once. That's straightforward.\n\nn=3: The winner plays two games. How? Maybe the initial structure has them beat two opponents, but wait, how does that work? Oh, because after the first game, the winner has 1 game. Then, in the next round, they can play someone who also has 1 game (since their difference is 0). So total of two games.\n\nWait, but for n=4, the output is 2. Because the tournament can be arranged so that the winner plays two games. For example, the bracket is like (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), then 1 vs whoever wins between 2 and 3. Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Because after the first game, player 1 has 1 game. Suppose in the second round, he plays another player, say 2, who has 1 game (from their own match). So 1 has 2 games. But then, in the third round, he would need to face someone who has either 1 or 2 games. But since all other players have lost, maybe it's not possible. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example.\n\nWait, the note says that for n=4, the maximum is 2. So how does that happen? Oh, perhaps the tournament is arranged such that the winner plays two matches. So the structure is like:\n\nRound 1: 1 vs 2 → 1 wins.\nRound 2: 1 vs 3 → 1 wins.\nBut wait, that's two games. But what about the other players? Oh right, because the tournament is knockout, each loss eliminates someone. So 2 and 3 lose in the first round. But that leaves only 4. So after the second round, 1 has played two games. But then there's the final against 4? Wait, but 4 hasn't played any games. So 1 has played two, and 4 has zero. Their game counts differ by two, so that's not allowed. So the maximum is two.\n\nSo the idea is that the winner can't play more than a certain number of games based on the structure.\n\nI think the key here is to model the maximum number of games the winner can play as the largest k such that the sum of Fibonacci numbers up to k+2 is less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps it's related to the Fibonacci sequence. Because each time the winner plays, the opponent must have played either the same number of games or one less. So the number of required players grows exponentially.\n\nFor example, let's say the winner plays k games. Then, each time, the opponent in each game must have played either k-1 or k-2 games. Wait, maybe I should model this recursively.\n\nLet me think: the winner plays k games. Each game requires that the opponent has played either k-1 or k-2 games. So for each game in the k-th step, we need a certain number of players.\n\nWait, perhaps it's similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Let me try to model it.\n\nSuppose f(k) is the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play k games.\n\nThen, f(1) = 2: two players play once.\n\nf(2) = 3: the winner plays two games. In the first game, they play someone (needs 1 opponent). Then, in the next game, they play someone else who has already played once. So total 3 players.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for f(2), the winner plays two games. So in the first round, they play someone, which is the first game. Then, in the second game, they play someone else. But that someone else must have played exactly one game before. So the total number of players needed is 3: 1 (winner), 2 (opponent in first game), and 3 (opponent in second game).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nFor f(3): the winner plays three games.\n\nEach game after the first must be against someone with the same or one less game.\n\nThe third game: the opponent must have played either 2 games or 1.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given a specific rule about the difference in the number of games played by two opposing players.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the number of players required for the winner to play `k` games follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. This is because each game the winner plays must be against an opponent who has either played the same number of games or one fewer game.\n\n1. **Fibonacci-like Sequence**: The minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games can be represented by a series where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms. This series helps us determine the maximum number of games based on the total number of players.\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: We iteratively calculate the number of players needed for each possible number of games until we find the largest `k` such that the number of players does not exceed the given `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef max_games(n):\n    if n == 2:\n        return 1\n    k = 0\n    a, b = 2, 3\n    while True:\n        k += 1\n        next_val = a + b\n        if next_val > n:\n            break\n        a, b = b, next_val\n    return k\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(max_games(n))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start with the smallest cases where the winner plays 1 game, which requires exactly 2 players.\n2. **Iterative Check**: Using a loop, we calculate the number of players required for the winner to play `k` games by maintaining two variables `a` and `b` which represent the Fibonacci-like sequence.\n3. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when the next value in the sequence exceeds the given number of players `n`. The largest valid `k` is then returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of games the winner can play by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence and iterating until the required number of players exceeds the given input.",
