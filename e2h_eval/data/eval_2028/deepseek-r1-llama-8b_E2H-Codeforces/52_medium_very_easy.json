Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Vasily has some candles and can create new ones from the stubs. The goal is to find out how many hours he can keep the room lit. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nHmm, the problem says that each candle burns for one hour before going out. Then, b of these stubs can be made into a new candle. So the process is: burn as many candles as possible, collect the stubs, exchange them for new candles, and repeat until you don't have enough stubs left to make any more.\n\nLet me take the example given. For input 4 2: initially, 4 candles. They burn for 4 hours. Then, he takes those 4 stubs and makes 2 new candles. He burns those, adding 2 hours, making total 6. Then, he has 2 stubs again, which he uses to make another candle. That's another hour, totaling 7. Now, he only has one stub, which isn't enough to make another candle. So the answer is 7.\n\nSo the approach is to simulate this process step by step. Start with the initial number of candles 'a'. Burn all of them, add 'a' to the total hours. Then, collect 'a' stubs. Exchange them for (a // b) new candles. The remaining stubs are a % b. Add the new candles to the total, and then burn them, adding their count to the total hours. The stubs from these new candles are added to the existing ones.\n\nWait, no. Wait: when you exchange stubs for new candles, you get (current_stubs // b) new candles. Each new candle is burned, contributing +1 to the total. Also, each new candle produces a stub after burning, so the stubs increase by the number of new candles.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize total_hours = 0\n2. current_stubs = a\n3. While current_stubs >= b:\n   a. new_candles = current_stubs // b\n   b. total_hours += new_candles\n   c. current_stubs = (current_stubs % b) + new_candles  # because each new candle gives a stub when burned\n4. Return total_hours\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each time you make new candles, you add their count to the total, and then the stubs from them plus any leftover stubs are carried over.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample: a=4, b=2.\n\nStep 1: current_stubs =4\n4 >=2? Yes.\nnew_candles=2\ntotal becomes 2.\ncurrent_stubs =4%2=0 +2=2.\n\nNext iteration: 2>=2? Yes.\nnew_candles=1. total=3.\ncurrent_stubs=0 +1=1.\n\nNow, 1<2. Stop. Total is 3+2=5? Wait wait, no. Wait the first step adds 2, making total 2. Second step adds 1, making total 3. But wait, in the sample, the output is 7. Oh right, I think I'm missing the initial a.\n\nWait, initial a is 4, which contributes 4 hours. Then, the first exchange gives 2 new candles, which contribute 2 more hours. Then, those 2 become stubs, but after burning, they add 2 stubs. Then, exchange again: 2 stubs make 1 new candle, which contributes 1 hour. So the total is 4 +2 +1=7.\n\nWait, so my initial approach is wrong. Because I didn't account for the initial a. Oh right! Because when you start with 'a' candles, you burn them all, contributing 'a' hours. Then, the stubs are a, which can be converted into new candles.\n\nSo the correct steps should be:\n\n- total_hours starts at 0.\n- while current_stubs >=b:\n   new_candles = current_stubs //b\n   total_hours += new_candles\n   current_stubs = (current_stubs %b) + new_candles\n- But also, we must add the initial a hours.\n\nWait no. Because the initial a is the first set of candles burned. So the process is:\n\nBurn all a candles: add a to total. Then, for the stubs, do the exchanging.\n\nSo the correct algorithm is:\n\ntotal = a\ncurrent_stubs = a\nwhile current_stubs >=b:\n    new = current_stubs //b\n    total += new\n    current_stubs = (current_stubs %b) + new\nreturn total\n\nAh, okay, that makes sense. Because the initial a is the first burn, and then every new candle made adds its own hour.\n\nSo let's rework the steps with the first sample:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal starts as 4.\n\ncurrent_stubs=4.\n\nLoop: 4 >=2.\n\nnew=2. total becomes 6.\n\ncurrent_stubs =0 +2=2.\n\nAgain, 2>=2.\n\nnew=1. total becomes7.\n\ncurrent_stubs=0 +1=1.\n\nLoop ends.\n\nSo total is 7. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: input 6 3.\n\na=6, b=3.\n\ntotal=6.\n\ncurrent_stubs=6.\n\n6//3=2. total=8.\n\ncurrent_stubs =0 +2=2.\n\nNow 2 <3. So loop ends.\n\nTotal is 8, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the algorithm is correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute the total as a plus the sum of new candles obtained each time.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead a and b.\n\ntotal = a\n\ncurrent = a\n\nwhile current >= b:\n\n    new = current //b\n\n    total += new\n\n    current = (current %b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nCase when a=1, b=2: total is 1, since 1<2.\n\nCase when a=5, b=5: initial total is5. current=5.\n\nnew=1. total=6. current=0 +1=1. Loop ends.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=3.\n\nInitial: 10. total=10.\n\ncurrent=10.\n\n10//3=3, total=13.\n\ncurrent=1 +3=4.\n\n4//3=1, total=14.\n\ncurrent=1 +1=2.\n\nLoop ends. So 10+3+1=14.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, writing the Python code.\n\nRead the input as two integers.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a single line with two integers, perhaps as a string like '4 2'. So in Python, we can split the input line.\n\nSo code:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute as above.\n\nPrint the total.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\ncurrent = a\nwhile current >= b:\n    new = current // b\n    total += new\n    current = (current % b) + new\nprint(total)\n\nYes, that's the code.\n\nLet me test it with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 4 2 → output 7.\n\nSample 2:6 3 →8.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about a=0? But the constraints say a is at least 1.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5.\n\nAs above: total 5 +1=6.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test: a=2, b=2.\n\nInitial total is2. current=2.\n\nnew=1. total=3. current=0+1=1. Loop ends.\n\nSo 3.\n\nWhich is correct: burn 2, make 1, burn 1, total 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has and the stubs from burned-out candles. Each candle burns for exactly one hour before going out. Additionally, every `b` stubs can be converted into a new candle, which can then be burned to provide more light.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a`, which will burn for `a` hours.\n2. **Recycle Stubs**: After burning all initial candles, collect the stubs. For every `b` stubs, we can create a new candle. Each new candle will also produce a stub when burned.\n3. **Iterative Process**: Continue converting stubs into new candles until we have fewer than `b` stubs left. Each time we create new candles, add their burn time to the total hours and update the count of stubs accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\ncurrent_stubs = a\nwhile current_stubs >= b:\n    new_candles = current_stubs // b\n    total += new_candles\n    current_stubs = (current_stubs % b) + new_candles\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the integers `a` and `b` from the input, representing the initial number of candles and the number of stubs needed to make a new candle, respectively.\n2. **Initial Burn**: The initial number of candles `a` is burned, contributing `a` hours to the total.\n3. **Recycling Process**: Using a loop, the code repeatedly converts stubs into new candles until there are not enough stubs left to form a new candle. Each iteration calculates how many new candles can be made, adds their burn time to the total, and updates the count of stubs to include both the leftover stubs and the new ones produced by burning these candles.\n4. **Output**: Finally, the total number of hours the candles can keep the room illuminated is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently utilize every possible stub to maximize the illumination time, adhering to the constraints and providing an optimal solution.",
