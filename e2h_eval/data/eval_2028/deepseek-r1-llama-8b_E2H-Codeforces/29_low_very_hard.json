Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem statement says that Andrew and Eugene are playing a game where they manipulate a string of digits through a series of substitution queries. After processing all the queries, we need to compute the resulting number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nHmm. So the initial string is s, and each query is of the form di → ti. This means that every occurrence of digit di in the current string is replaced by ti. For example, if s is '123123' and the query is \"2→00\", then replacing all '2's with '00' gives '10031003'. Another example is when a query is \"3→\", which replaces all '3's with empty strings, so the string becomes '1212'.\n\nWait, but the order of the queries matters. Each query is processed in the order given. So the first query is applied, then the second, etc.\n\nThe output is the remainder when the final string is treated as a number divided by 1e9+7. Also, leading zeros are ignored, except when the entire string is zero—then it's considered as zero.\n\nSo how do I approach this? Well, the straightforward way would be to process each query in order, updating the string accordingly. But wait—the problem has a maximum string length of 105, and the sum of ti lengths is 105. So for n up to 105, this approach might be manageable.\n\nBut wait, what if the same digit is replaced multiple times in different ways? Like, suppose one query replaces '2' with '3', and another replaces '3' with '4'. So the order matters a lot.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n2. For each query, replace all occurrences of di in the current string with ti.\n3. After all queries, compute the numerical value of the resulting string, ignoring leading zeros unless the string is empty (which is treated as zero).\n4. Return the result modulo 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, for large numbers, treating the string as a number directly could cause issues because Python handles big integers, but converting a potentially 105-character string into an integer might not be a problem. However, for the modulo part, maybe there's a smarter way to compute it without having to build the entire number, especially since the modulo is fixed at 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that we ignore leading zeros except when the entire string is zero. So after processing all queries, we need to remove leading zeros but keep any non-zero digits. For example, if the string is '000123', the numerical value is 123, so modulo 1e9+7 would be 123.\n\nBut if the string is empty, it's treated as zero.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n- Process each query in order, replacing di with ti in the current string.\n- Once all queries are done, process the resulting string to compute its numeric value mod 1e9+7.\n\nNow, the challenge is how to efficiently handle these substitutions, especially considering that each substitution can potentially change the string's structure, which affects future substitutions.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a query that replaces '0' with '123', and then a later query that replaces '1' with '45'. The first substitution will add '123's wherever '0's were, and then the next substitution will replace any '1's in those '123's with '45's, turning them into '453'.\n\nSo the substitution must be done correctly, taking into account previous substitutions.\n\nThe key point is that each substitution is applied to the current state of the string. So for each query, we need to scan the entire string and replace all occurrences of di with ti.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently?\n\nOption 1: For each query, create a new string by replacing every occurrence of di in the current string with ti. Since the maximum length is 105, and for each query, the replacement could take O(N) time where N is the current string's length, and the sum of ti lengths across all queries is 105, the total operations should be manageable.\n\nYes, because 105 * 105 is 11,025 operations, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nSo, the steps in code would be:\n\n- Read the initial string s.\n- Read the number of queries n.\n- For each of the next n lines:\n   - Split the line into di and ti. For example, split on \"->\" to get parts before and after.\n   - Then, in the current string, replace every occurrence of di with ti.\n- After all queries, process the final string.\n\nNow, how to process the final string to compute the numeric value mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the string could be very long, up to 105 characters.
