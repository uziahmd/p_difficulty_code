After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about determining the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. Hmm.\n\nSo, each student has marks for m subjects. A student is considered the best at a subject if no one else has a higher mark for that subject. And a student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. My task is to find out how many such students there are.\n\nLet me think about the input. The first line gives n and m. Then there are n lines, each representing a student's grades. Each grade is a string of m characters, each being a digit from 1 to 9. So for example, a line like '223' would mean the student scored 2, 2, 3 in three subjects.\n\nThe output is a list of numbers, each indicating the count of successful students for each test case. Wait, wait, looking back at the sample input, the input seems to have two test cases. Oh right, because the sample input shows two lines after the first line, which probably represent two separate cases. But in the problem statement, the input is given as a single string, but in the code, I'll need to process each test case separately.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the sample input, it's written as ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111'], which suggests that the input is a list of two test cases. So my code needs to handle multiple test cases, or perhaps just process each group correctly.\n\nBut the problem statement says, \"the following is a competitive programming problem.\" So I think the input will consist of multiple test cases, each with n and m followed by n lines of m digits.\n\nSo the approach is: For each test case, read n and m, then read n lines, each line being a string of m digits. For each student, determine if they are the best in any subject. If yes, count them.\n\nHow to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFor each student, for each subject, check if their mark is the maximum in that subject across all students. If for any subject, their mark is the maximum, then the student is successful.\n\nSo, for each subject, I need to find the maximum mark among all students. Then, for each student, compare their marks in each subject to the max for that subject. If any of them equals the max, then the student is successful.\n\nWait, but the condition is that the student is the best in a subject if no one has a higher mark. So, the max for the subject is the highest mark. So if a student has the max in that subject, they are the best.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each test case:\n   a. Read n and m.\n   b. Read n strings, each of length m. Each character is a digit.\n   c. For each subject (from 0 to m-1), collect all the marks of that subject from all students. Find the maximum mark for that subject.\n   d. For each student, check for each of their m subjects whether their mark is equal to the max for that subject. If any subject satisfies this, the student is successful.\n   e. Count the number of successful students.\n\nSo, the steps for each test case:\n\n- Collect all the marks per subject.\n\nHow to represent the data? Maybe a list of lists, where each inner list represents a subject's marks across all students.\n\nFor example, for m=3 subjects, we can have a list of m lists. The first list contains the marks of all students for subject 1, the second for subject 2, etc.\n\nSo for each subject j (from 0 to m-1), create a list that holds the j-th character of each student's string.\n\nThen, for each j, find the maximum value in that list.\n\nOnce I have the max for each subject, for each student, iterate through their m marks. If any mark is equal to the corresponding max, then the student is successful.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nIn Python, I can read the input as follows:\n\nFirst, read the entire input as a single string, split into lines, then process each line.\n\nWait, but the input may have multiple test cases. So, the first line is n and m for the first test case. Then n lines follow. Then another test case starts with n and m again, followed by n lines, and so on.\n\nSo, the code should loop until all test cases are processed.\n\nSo, perhaps, read all lines at once, then process each test case in a loop.\n\nAlternatively, process each test case in a while loop until EOF.\n\nHmm, perhaps using sys.stdin to read lines.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor each test case:\n    read n, m\n    read n lines, each line is a string of m digits\n    for each subject j in 0..m-1:\n        collect all the j-th characters from each student's string\n        find the maximum mark in this subject\n    then, for each student:\n        for each subject j:\n            if student's mark == max for j:\n                mark this student as successful\n                break\n        count += 1 if successful\n    print(count)\n\nWait, but wait. How do I process each test case when the input comes in as a stream? Because in the sample input, it's given as a list of two test cases, but in reality, the input is given via standard input, which is read line by line.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead the first line as n and m for the first test case.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a student's marks.\n\nThen, process those n students.\n\nThen, read the next line, which is n and m for the next test case.\n\nAnd so on until there are no more lines.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    while ptr < len(input):\n        # Read n and m\n        n = int(input[ptr])\n        m = int(input[ptr+1])\n        ptr +=2\n        students = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            s = input[ptr]\n            ptr +=1\n            students.append(s)\n        # Now process this test case\n        # For each subject, get the max\n        subject_max = [0]*m\n        for j in range(m):\n            max_mark = 0\n            for s in students:\n                mark = int(s[j])\n                if mark > max_mark:\n                    max_mark = mark\n            subject_max[j] = max_mark\n        # Now for each student, check if they have any mark equal to subject_max\n        count = 0\n        for s in students:\n            is_successful = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if int(s[j]) == subject_max[j]:\n                    is_successful = True\n                    break\n            if is_successful:\n                count +=1\n        print(count)\n\nWait, but wait. What about leading zeros? No, the problem states that each mark is from 1 to 9, so no leading zeros. Also, each student's string is exactly m characters.\n\nWait, but in the code above, when we read each student's string, it's read as input[ptr], which is a string. So, for each character in s, s[j] is a character, which we convert to int.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nTesting with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n3 5\n91728\n11828\n11111\n\nFirst test case:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\nstudents = ['223', '232', '112'].\n\nFor each subject j (0,1,2):\n\nj=0: '2','3','1' → max is 3.\nj=1: '2','3','1' → max is 3.\nj=2: '3','2','2' → max is 3.\n\nsubject_max = [3,3,3].\n\nCheck each student:\n\nStudent 1: '223'\nj=0: 2 == 3? No.\nj=1: 2 ==3? No.\nj=2: 3 ==3 → yes. So successful.\n\nStudent 2: '232':\nj=0: 2 !=3.\nj=1: 3 ==3 → yes. Successful.\n\nStudent3: '112':\nj=0:1<3.\nj=1:1<3.\nj=2:2<3. No. Not successful.\n\nSo count is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nn=3, m=5.\n\nstudents are '91728', '11828', '11111'.\n\nCompute subject_max for each of 5 subjects.\n\nSubject 0: '9','1','1' → max 9.\nSubject1: '1','1','1' → max 1.\nSubject2: '7','8','1' → max 8.\nSubject3: '2','8','1' → max 8.\nSubject4: '8','8','1' → max 8.\n\nWait wait, let's see:\n\nEach student's string is 5 characters.\n\nWait for the second test case, the students are:\n\ns1: '91728' → positions 0-4: 9,1,7,2,8.\n\ns2: '11828' → 1,1,8,2,8.\n\ns3: '11111' → 1,1,1,1,1.\n\nSo for each subject j:\n\nj=0: all students' j=0 marks are 9,1,1 → max 9.\n\nj=1: all are 1,1,1 → max 1.\n\nj=2: 7,8,1 → max 8.\n\nj=3: 2,2,1 → max 2.\n\nWait wait, no, wait:\n\nWait s1's j=3 is '2', s2's j=3 is '2', s3's is '1'. So max is 2.\n\nj=4: s1 has 8, s2 has 8, s3 has 1. Max is 8.\n\nSo subject_max is [9,1,8,2,8].\n\nNow, check each student.\n\nStudent1: '91728'\n\nCheck each subject:\n\nj=0:9==9 → yes. So successful.\n\nStudent2: '11828'\n\nj=0:1 <9 → no.\n\nj=1:1 ==1 → yes. Successful.\n\nStudent3: '11111'\n\nj=0:1 <9.\n\nj=1:1 ==1 → yes. Successful.\n\nSo all 3 students are successful. Hence output is 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle this correctly.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nTest case where n=1, m=1.\n\nInput: '1 1\\n9'\n\nOutput: 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStudents:\n\n91\n\n99\n\nSubject 0: 9 and 9 → max 9.\n\nSubject1: 1 and 9 → max 9.\n\nCheck each student.\n\nStudent1: 9 in subject0, 1 in subject1.\n\nHe is best in subject0.\n\nStudent2: 9 in both, so best in both.\n\nSo count is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStudents:\n\n12\n\n22\n\nSubject0: max 2.\n\nSubject1: max 2.\n\nStudent1: 1 <2 and 2 ==2 → yes.\n\nStudent2: 2 ==2 in both → yes.\n\nCount is 2.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=5.\n\nOnly one student. So he is best in all subjects. So count is 1.\n\nWhat about a student who is not the best in any subject?\n\nLike in the first sample, student3.\n\nSo code correctly counts 0 for him.\n\nAnother edge case: when all students have the same marks in all subjects.\n\nSay, n=3, m=2.\n\nAll students have '11' as their marks.\n\nThen, for each subject, the max is 1.\n\nEach student's mark is 1 in both. So each is successful.\n\nSo count is 3.\n\nAnother case: n=3, m=2.\n\nStudents:\n\n22\n\n21\n\n30\n\nWait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, but the marks are from 1 to 9. So 30 is allowed, since 3 and 0? Wait no, wait: the problem says each character is a number from 1 to 9. Oh wait, the problem says, \"each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9.\" So no zero. So the third student cannot have '30' because '0' is not allowed. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, but the problem says, \"each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9.\" So all the digits in the strings are between 1 and 9, inclusive.\n\nSo in code, no need to handle 0.\n\nSo, what about a student with a mark of 9 in some subject, others have lower.\n\nSo, that student is successful.\n\nWhat about when a subject has multiple students with the same max?\n\nLike, in a subject, two students have 5 as the maximum. Then both are considered best in that subject.\n\nWait, according to the problem statement, a student is the best in a subject if no one has a higher mark. So if two students have the same max, they are both best.\n\nSo, in that case, each of them contributes to their success.\n\nSo, in code, for each subject, the max is the highest. Any student with that mark is a best.\n\nSo the code correctly finds all students who have a mark equal to the max in that subject.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, I think I can proceed to write the code as outlined.\n\nWait, but in the code, I have to read the input correctly. Because in the sample input, it's provided as a list, but in reality, the input is a sequence of lines.\n\nWait, the code I wrote earlier reads the input as a list of tokens. Let's see:\n\nWhen the input is read as sys.stdin.read().split(), each token is separated by whitespace.\n\nSo for example, the first test case input is:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nWhich, when read as split(), becomes ['3','3','223','232','112'].\n\nSo, in the code, for each test case, I read n=int(input[ptr]), m=int(input[ptr+1]), then read n lines, each line is the next token.\n\nWait, no. Because the code reads the first two tokens as n and m, then for the next n tokens, each is a student's string.\n\nSo for the first test case, the code reads 3 3, then 223, 232, 112. So the code correctly processes these.\n\nBut what if the input is like:\n\n3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\n\nWhich is read as a single line with a newline? Probably not, because the input is read as a single string, then split into tokens, which would split on any whitespace, including newlines.\n\nWait, no. When you do input = sys.stdin.read().split(), it splits on any whitespace, including newlines. So for the first line '3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', the split() would produce ['3','3','223','232','112'].\n\nSo the code correctly picks them up.\n\nBut what if a student's line has leading or trailing spaces? According to the problem statement, each line is a string of m characters, so no leading or trailing spaces. So the code is safe.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, testing another scenario.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, m=2.\n\nStudents:\n\n12\n31\n\nSo, for subject 0, the marks are 1 and 3. Max is 3.\n\nSubject1: 2 and 1. Max is 2.\n\nStudent1: 1 in subject0 (less than 3), 2 in subject1 (equal to max). So he is successful.\n\nStudent2: 3 in subject0 (max), 1 in subject1 (less than 2). So he is successful.\n\nSo count is 2.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, m=2.\n\nStudents:\n\n22\n22\n\nBoth are max in both subjects. So each is successful. So count is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=4, m=2.\n\nStudents:\n\n19\n18\n17\n16\n\nSubject0: 1,1,1,1 → max 1.\n\nSubject1:9,8,7,6 → max 9.\n\nEach student's subject1 marks are 9,8,7,6.\n\nSo for each student:\n\nStudent1: 1 in subject0 (max), 9 in subject1 (max). So he is successful.\n\nStudent2: 1 in subject0, 8 <9 → so he is successful only in subject0.\n\nSimilarly for the rest.\n\nSo all students are successful.\n\nSo count is 4.\n\nSo the code should return 4.\n\nYes.\n\nI think this covers the possible scenarios.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the input values which include multiple test cases. Each test case consists of the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m), followed by n lines where each line represents a student's marks for m subjects.\n2. **Subject-wise Maximum Marks Calculation**: For each subject, determine the maximum mark achieved by any student. This helps in identifying which students are the best in each subject.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have a mark equal to the maximum mark in any subject. If they do, they are marked as successful.\n4. **Count Successful Students**: Count the number of successful students for each test case and print the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    while ptr < len(input):\n        n = int(input[ptr])\n        m = int(input[ptr + 1])\n        ptr += 2\n        students = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            s = input[ptr]\n            ptr += 1\n            students.append(s)\n        # Determine max for each subject\n        subject_max = [0] * m\n        for j in range(m):\n            max_mark = 0\n            for s in students:\n                mark = int(s[j])\n                if mark > max_mark:\n                    max_mark = mark\n            subject_max[j] = max_mark\n        # Check each student\n        count = 0\n        for s in students:\n            is_successful = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if int(s[j]) == subject_max[j]:\n                    is_successful = True\n                    break\n            if is_successful:\n                count += 1\n        print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single string and split into tokens for easier processing. Each test case is processed by reading the number of students and subjects, followed by the marks of each student.\n2. **Maximum Marks Calculation**: For each subject, iterate through all students to find the highest mark. This is stored in an array where each index corresponds to a subject.\n3. **Identifying Successful Students**: For each student, compare their marks with the maximum marks for each subject. If a student's mark matches any maximum mark, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all students in a test case, the count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the number of successful students by leveraging maximum marks per subject and checking each student's performance against these maxima.",
