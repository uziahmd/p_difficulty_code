Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Vasily has some candles and can create new ones from the stubs. The goal is to find out how many hours he can keep the room lit. Hmm.\n\nLet me read the problem again. So, initially, he has 'a' candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour and becomes a stub. Then, he can take 'b' stubs and make a new candle. This new candle can then be burned again, adding another hour. The process continues until he doesn't have enough stubs to make more candles.\n\nSo, the approach is to calculate how many additional candles he can make from the stubs and add that to the initial burn time.\n\nWait, let's think with an example. Like the sample input: 4 2.\n\nHe starts with 4 candles. They burn for 4 hours. Then, the stubs are 4. He can exchange 4/2=2 new candles. Those burn for 2 more hours, adding to 4+2=6. Now he has 2 stubs from those (since each of the 2 candles gave one stub). But 2 is less than b=2, so he can make one more candle? Wait, wait, no. Because when you make a new candle from b stubs, it's exactly b stubs per candle. So if he has 4 stubs, he can make 4//b candles. So for 4 and 2, that's 2 candles. Then, after burning them, he gets 2 stubs, which is equal to b=2, so he can make another candle. That gives him 1 more hour. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 =7 hours. Oh right, that's why the sample output is 7.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n- Total = a (initial)\n- While the number of stubs >= b:\n   - new_candles = stubs // b\n   - total += new_candles\n   - stubs = (stubs % b) + new_candles (because each new candle, when burned, adds a stub)\n   Repeat.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize the total as a.\n2. Initialize stubs as a, because all a candles will become stubs after burning.\n3. Loop while stubs >= b:\n   a. Calculate how many new candles can be made: new = stubs // b.\n   b. Add new to total.\n   c. Update stubs: the remainder is stubs % b, plus new (since each new candle gives one stub when burned).\n4. Return the total.\n\nWait, let me test with the sample. For 4 and 2:\n\nStubs =4.\nLoop: 4 >=2 → yes.\nnew =4//2=2 → total becomes 4+2=6.\nstubs =4%2=0 +2=2.\n\nNow, stubs is 2 ≥2 → loop again.\nnew=1 → total 6+1=7.\nstubs =0 +1=1 <2 → loop ends.\n\nSo yes, correct.\n\nAnother sample: 6 3.\n\nInitial total=6, stubs=6.\nFirst iteration:\nnew=6//3=2 → total 8.\nstubs =0 +2=2 <3 → loop ends.\nSo output is 8.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nWhat about when a is less than b? Like a=5, b=10. Then, stubs=5 <10, so no more candles. So total is 5.\n\nWhat if a is 10, b=3?\n\nInitial total=10. stubs=10.\n10 >=3: new=3 → total 13. stubs=10%3=1 +3=4.\n4 >=3: new=1 → total 14. stubs=4%3=1 +1=2 <3. So total is 14.\n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\nStart with 10 candles → 10 hours.\n\nAfter burning, 10 stubs.\n\nMake 3 new candles (3//3=3). Burn them, 3 more hours. Now stubs are 10-3*3=1, plus 3 new stubs from the new candles. So 1+3=4.\n\n4 stubs: make 1 new candle. Burn, 1 more hour. Stubs now 4-1*3=1, plus 1 (from new candle) → 2 stubs.\n\nNo more can be made. Total is 10+3+1=14.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nSo in code, I'll read a and b. Then compute as above.\n\nHow to structure this in Python.\n\nRead the input as two integers. Maybe split the input line into two parts.\n\nThen,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has. Each candle burns for an hour and then becomes a stub, which can be reused to make new candles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`, which will burn for `a` hours.\n2. **Stub Conversion**: After burning all initial candles, convert the stubs into new candles. The conversion is done by dividing the number of stubs by `b`, where `b` is the number of stubs needed to create a new candle.\n3. **Iterative Process**: Continue converting stubs into new candles until there are not enough stubs left to make another candle. Each time new candles are made, add the number of new candles to the total hours and update the number of stubs accordingly.\n4. **Termination**: The process stops when the number of stubs is less than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be made.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new_candles = stubs // b\n    total += new_candles\n    stubs = (stubs % b) + new_candles\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial number of candles) and `b` (number of stubs needed to create a new candle).\n2. **Initial Burn**: The initial number of candles `a` gives `a` hours of light and `a` stubs after burning.\n3. **Loop for Conversion**: While there are enough stubs (`>= b`) to make new candles:\n   - Calculate how many new candles can be made from the current stubs.\n   - Add these new candles to the total hours.\n   - Update the number of stubs to reflect both the remainder of stubs after making new candles and the stubs from the newly burned candles.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total number of hours the room can be illuminated.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum hours by iteratively converting stubs into new candles until no more conversions are possible, ensuring optimal use of resources.",
