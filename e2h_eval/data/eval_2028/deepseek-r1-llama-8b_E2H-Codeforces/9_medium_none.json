Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Selling Souvenirs.\" Hmm, I need to find the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry without exceeding the weight limit m.\n\nLet me read the problem statement carefully. Oh right, each souvenir has a weight wi and a cost ci. We need to select a subset where the total weight is <= m, and the total cost is as large as possible. So it's a classic knapsack problem but with some constraints.\n\nWait, looking at the input constraints: n can be up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Oh, that's a big n. So a standard dynamic programming approach with O(nm) time complexity is definitely out of the question because for n=1e5 and m=3e5, that would be 3e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nHmm, so I need a more efficient approach. What's special here? Oh, the weights are only 1, 2, or 3. That's a crucial point. So each item's weight is either 1, 2, or 3. That probably allows us to group items by their weight and process them in a way that's more efficient.\n\nSo let's think: since the weights are small, maybe we can count how many items there are for each weight category. Like, count the number of items with weight 1, 2, and 3. Then, for each of these, we can determine how many to take, considering their individual costs.\n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just about taking as many as possible because higher cost items might be better. For example, an item with weight 1 and cost 1000 is better than two items of weight 1 and cost 500 each. So it's not just about the quantity; we need to consider which items to pick based on their value (cost per unit weight) or perhaps their absolute cost.\n\nSo, the approach should involve sorting and then selecting the optimal combination of 1s, 2s, and 3s.\n\nLet me outline a plan:\n\n1. Separate the items into three groups based on their weight: group1 (weight 1), group2 (weight 2), group3 (weight 3).\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost. This way, when we take items from a group, we take the most valuable ones first.\n\n3. Now, for each possible number of items taken from group1, group2, and group3, we need to compute the total weight and cost, ensuring the sum is within m. But since the numbers can be up to 1e5, iterating through all possibilities directly is not feasible.\n\nWait, but since the weights are small, maybe we can use a dynamic programming approach that takes into account the counts of each group.\n\nLet me think: the state could be the number of items taken from each group, but that seems too broad. Alternatively, for each possible number of group1 items, and for each possible number of group2 items, compute the maximum possible group3 items, and track the maximum cost.\n\nBut even that might not be efficient enough. Because group1 can have up to 1e5 items, and group2 up to 1e5 as well. So if we loop through all possible combinations, it's O(a*b) where a and b are up to 1e5, which is 1e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nHmm, that's not going to work. So I need another idea.\n\nAnother thought: the maximum possible weight is m. So for each group, we can precompute the prefix sums for their sorted lists. Then, for any selection of k1 items from group1, k2 from group2, and k3 from group3, the total weight is k1 + 2*k2 + 3*k3, and the total cost is sum1[k1] + sum2[k2] + sum3[k3].\n\nWe need to find the maximum sum where k1 + 2k2 +3k3 <= m.\n\nSo perhaps we can iterate over possible k1 and k2, and compute the maximum possible k3.\n\nBut again, with k1 up to 1e5 and k2 up to 1e5, this is still too slow.\n\nWait, but the sum of k1 + 2k2 +3k3 must be <=m. So perhaps for each possible k3, we can find the best k1 and k2 that fit within the remaining weight.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight is additive, and the weights are 1, 2, 3, maybe we can find a way to model this using a DP that considers the counts in a clever way.\n\nWait, another angle: for each possible number of group3 items, we can calculate the remaining weight and then find the maximum sum from group1 and group2 that fits into the remaining weight.\n\nBut group3 can have up to min(k_max, m//3). Since m can be up to 3e5, the maximum k3 is up to 1e5. So for each k3, we can compute the remaining weight as rem = m - 3*k3. Then, for this rem, we need to select a combination of group1 and group2 items such that their total weight is <= rem, and their cost is maximized.\n\nBut group1 and group2 can be handled together. So perhaps we can precompute for group1 and group2 the best way to fill a certain weight capacity.\n\nWait, group1 is sorted, so the prefix sum is non-decreasing. Same for group2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each possible k3, compute the maximum sum of group1 and group2 that fits into rem = m -3*k3.\n\nHow can we compute that efficiently?\n\nLet me think of group1 and group2 as a combined set. For any given weight limit W, the maximum cost is the sum of the top i group1 items and j group2 items such that i + 2j <= W. How can we compute this quickly?\n\nThis sounds like a variation of the unbounded knapsack problem, but since the items are sorted, perhaps we can find a way to precompute the best for each possible W.\n\nWait, but for group1 and group2, the maximum possible W is m, which is 3e5. So perhaps we can precompute a DP array for group1 and group2.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nLet’s create a DP array where dp[w] represents the maximum cost achievable by taking items from group1 and group2, with total weight exactly w.\n\nWait, but the initial state is dp[0] = 0. Then, for each item in group1 (sorted), we can update the dp array. Similarly, for each item in group2 (sorted), we can update the dp array.\n\nWait, but group1 and group2 are independent. So perhaps we can compute the DP for group1 and group2 combined as follows:\n\nFirst, compute the maximum cost for group1 alone for all possible weights. Then, compute the maximum cost for group2 alone for all possible weights. Then, combine them optimally.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can compute a combined DP where for each possible weight w, we have the maximum cost from group1 and group2 that doesn't exceed w.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each possible weight w, we can track the best way to get to w using group1 and group2.\n\nLet's see: the DP can be built as follows:\n\nInitialize dp as an array of size (max_possible_weight + 1), filled with -infinity except dp[0] = 0.\n\nThen, for each item in group1 (which is weight 1 and has a certain cost), we iterate through the DP array from high to low (to avoid reusing the same item multiple times). For each possible current weight w, if we can add this item, we update dp[w + 1] to be the maximum of its current value and dp[w] + item's cost.\n\nSimilarly, for each item in group2 (weight 2), we iterate from high to low, and for each w, if adding this item's weight is possible, we update dp[w+2].\n\nWait, but group1 and group2 are separate. So after processing group1, the DP will represent the best way to get any weight using group1 items. Then, processing group2 items will allow combining both.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nOnce we have this DP array, for each possible k3 (number of group3 items taken), the remaining weight is m' = m - 3*k3. If m' < 0, skip this k3. Otherwise, look up the maximum cost in the DP array up to m' (i.e., the maximum cost for weight w <= m') and add it to the sum of the top k3 group3 items.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Sort group1, group2, group3 in descending order of cost.\n\n2. Compute the prefix sums for each group.\n\n3. Precompute the DP for group1 and group2.\n\n4. For each possible k3 (from 0 to min(total_group3_items, m//3)), calculate the remaining weight rem = m - 3*k3. If rem <0, break. Then, find the maximum cost from DP up to rem, and add the sum of the first k3 group3 items. Keep track of the maximum total cost across all k3.\n\nBut wait, the DP is built for group1 and group2, so for each k3, rem is the weight available for group1 and group2. The maximum cost for group1 and group2 in rem is dp[rem], but wait, no—dp is the maximum for exactly rem weight, but perhaps a smaller weight could give a higher cost. Or is it the maximum for any weight up to rem?\n\nWait, no. The way the DP is built, dp[w] is the maximum cost for exactly weight w using group1 and group2. So to find the maximum for weight up to rem, we need to take the maximum of dp[0...rem]. But that could be computationally expensive if done naively.\n\nAlternatively, during the DP computation, we can keep track of the maximum cost for each possible weight, and for each step, for each possible w, store the maximum cost for w and also for w+1, etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the DP should be designed differently. Instead of tracking exact weights, maybe track the maximum cost for up to weight w.\n\nSo, perhaps the DP array will represent the maximum cost achievable with weight <=w.\n\nLet me rethink the DP setup:\n\n- Initialize dp as an array where dp[w] is the maximum cost achievable with a total weight of at most w.\n\nInitially, dp[0] = 0, and for w >0, dp[w] = -infinity.\n\nFor each group1 item (c1, w1=1):\n\n   for w in reverse from current_max_w down to w1:\n       if dp[w - w1] + c1 > dp[w]:\n           dp[w] = dp[w - w1] + c1\n\nBut this way, after processing all group1 items, dp[w] is the maximum cost for weight up to w using group1 items.\n\nWait, but group2 has weight 2. So after processing group1, we can process group2.\n\nWait, perhaps the DP needs to be built in a way that for each step, we process group1 and then group2, updating the dp accordingly.\n\nSo the overall approach is:\n\n- Process group1 and group2 items, building a DP array where dp[w] is the maximum cost for weight w.\n\nWait, but for group1, each item contributes weight 1, so for each possible weight, we can choose whether to take the item or not.\n\nSo the process is similar to the 0-1 knapsack problem for group1, then do the same for group2.\n\nYes, but since group1 and group2 are separate, the DP needs to be built in two steps.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Sort group1 in descending order of cost.\n\n2. Compute the prefix sums for group1.\n\n3. Sort group2 in descending order of cost.\n\n4. Compute the prefix sums for group2.\n\n5. Initialize dp array where dp[w] is the maximum cost achievable with group1 and group2 items, with total weight exactly w. But to optimize, perhaps we can compute dp as the maximum cost for up to w.\n\nWait, perhaps the DP can be built as follows:\n\n- Start with dp[0] = 0.\n\n- For each item in group1 (sorted in descending order):\n\n   for w from current_max_possible_w down to 1:\n       if dp[w-1] + c > dp[w]:\n           dp[w] = dp[w-1] + c\n\n- Then, for each item in group2 (sorted in descending order):\n\n   for w from current_max_possible_w down to 2:\n       if dp[w-2] + c > dp[w]:\n           dp[w] = dp[w-2] + c\n\nAfter this, dp[w] is the maximum cost for exactly w weight using group1 and group2.\n\nThen, for each possible k3 (number of group3 items taken), the remaining weight is rem = m - 3*k3.\n\nIf rem is negative, skip.\n\nOtherwise, the maximum cost from group1 and group2 is the maximum of dp[0..rem], plus the sum of the first k3 group3 items.\n\nWait, but computing the maximum of dp[0..rem] for each k3 could be expensive if done naively.\n\nHmm, but perhaps we can precompute a max_dp array where max_dp[w] is the maximum value of dp[0..w], and then for a given rem, the maximum is max_dp[rem].\n\nYes, that's a good idea. So during the DP step, after building the dp array, we can compute the max_dp array, where for each w, max_dp[w] is the maximum value in dp[0..w].\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Compute group1 and group2's sorted lists and prefix sums.\n\n- Build the dp array for group1 and group2.\n\n- Compute max_dp array, where max_dp[w] is the maximum of dp[0..w].\n\n- Compute the prefix sums for group3.\n\n- Iterate over k3 from 0 to min(group3_count, m//3):\n\n   rem = m - 3*k3\n\n   if rem <0: break\n\n   current_cost = sum3[k3] + max_dp[rem]\n\n   if current_cost > best: best = current_cost\n\nSo the key points are:\n\n- The DP for group1 and group2 is manageable because the maximum weight for group1 and group2 combined is m, which is up to 3e5.\n\nWait, but group1 and group2 can each have 1e5 items, leading to 1e5 * 3e5 = 3e10 operations, which is way too much.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because for each item in group1, processing group1 would require O(m) operations. Since group1 can have up to 1e5 items, this would lead to 1e5 * 3e5 = 3e10 operations, which is way beyond what can be processed in acceptable time.\n\nSo this approach won't work due to time constraints.\n\nHmm, so I need a smarter way to handle group1 and group2.\n\nWait, but group1 consists of items with weight 1. So when building the dp for group1, it's equivalent to taking as many as possible of the highest cost items, because each additional item adds 1 to the weight and adds its cost.\n\nSimilarly, group2 consists of items with weight 2, each adding 2 to the weight and their cost.\n\nWait, but if I have group1 sorted in descending order of cost, then the best way to take items is to take as many as possible starting from the highest cost, until adding more would exceed the weight limit.\n\nWait, no, because group1 is items of weight 1, so the maximum number you can take is the one that gives the highest cost per unit weight.\n\nWait, perhaps for group1, the best way is to take the top k items, where k is the maximum possible, but considering that each adds 1 to the weight.\n\nWait, but group1 is already sorted, so for any weight w allocated to group1, the maximum cost is the sum of the top min(w, len(group1)) items.\n\nWait, that's correct because each group1 item is weight 1 and sorted by cost, so taking as many as possible from the top is optimal.\n\nSimilarly for group2: for any weight allocated to group2, the maximum cost is the sum of the top j items, where j is the maximum possible (group2's count) such that 2j <= allocated weight.\n\nWait, so maybe instead of building a DP for group1 and group2, I can precompute for all possible w, the maximum cost from group1 and group2 by considering all possible splits of w into group1 and group2.\n\nThat's a different approach. So for a given weight w, the maximum cost is the sum of the top a group1 items (a can be 0 to w) and the top b group2 items (b can be 0 to w//2). The total weight is a*1 + b*2 = a + 2b <= w.\n\nBut even this approach requires trying all possible a and b for each w, which is again O(w^2), which is not feasible for w up to 3e5.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can find a way to represent the maximum cost for group1 and group2 for any weight w as the sum of the maximum possible group1 and group2 for that w.\n\nWait, but group1 and group2 can be considered separately. So for any weight w, the maximum cost is the maximum of:\n\nsum_group1[a] + sum_group2[b], where a + 2b <= w.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently for all possible w?\n\nAnother idea: for each possible a (number of group1 items taken), compute the maximum b (number of group2 items) that can be taken given a. Then, for each a, find the maximum b such that 2b <= (w - a). Then, the total cost is sum_group1[a] + sum_group2[b].\n\nBut again, this would require looping through all a and b, which is O(n^2) and not feasible.\n\nWait, but group2 is sorted, so for a fixed a, the maximum b is floor( (w - a) / 2 ). So for each a, the best b is the maximum possible such that 2b <= (w -a), which is sum_group2 up to that b.\n\nSo for a given w, the maximum cost is the maximum over a of (sum_group1[a] + sum_group2[floor( (w -a)/2 ) ] ), where a can range from 0 to w (but a can't exceed the number of group1 items, and (w -a) must be >=0, so a can't exceed w).\n\nBut trying this for each w is O(w) per w, which is again O(3e5 * 3e5) = 9e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nHmm, so this approach is not feasible either.\n\nI need another way.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that group1 and group2 can be represented as their prefix sums, and for a given w, the maximum cost is sum_group1[a] + sum_group2[b], where a + 2b <=w.\n\nSo the problem is to find, for a given w, the maximum a + 2b <=w, with a<=len(g1), b<=len(g2), such that sum_g1[a] + sum_g2[b] is maximized.\n\nThis is similar to a two-dimensional optimization.\n\nBut how to compute this for all possible w efficiently?\n\nAnother approach is to precompute for each possible w, the maximum a and b that can be taken, but again, this seems computationally heavy.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible a, we can compute the maximum possible b for varying w, and then for each w, keep track of the maximum sum.\n\nBut I'm not seeing how to do this efficiently.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWhat if we precompute for each possible a, the maximum possible b that can be taken for all possible w, and then for each w, the maximum sum is the maximum of sum_g1[a] + sum_g2[b] where a + 2b <=w.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible a, we can compute the maximum sum for all possible w by adding the corresponding b's.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model this as follows:\n\nFor each possible a (number of group1 items taken), the maximum possible b is floor( (w -a) / 2 ), but this is for each a and w.\n\nBut for each a, the maximum sum is sum_g1[a] + sum_g2[ floor( (w -a)/2 ) ].\n\nSo for each a, we can compute a function f_a(w) = sum_g1[a] + sum_g2[ floor( (w -a)/2 ) ].\n\nWe can then find the maximum f_a(w) for each w.\n\nBut to compute this for all w up to m, it's again O(n*w), which is not feasible.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each a, the function f_a(w) increases until a certain point and then remains flat or decreases. Maybe we can find the maximum contribution of each a and then combine them.\n\nAlternatively, for each a, the function f_a(w) is piecewise linear and can be represented in segments. But I'm not sure how to find the maximum across all a for each w.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet’s think about the maximum possible a and b for a given w.\n\nThe maximum a can be min(len(g1), w). For each a, the maximum b is min( len(g2), (w -a) // 2 ).\n\nSo for each w, the best a is somewhere between 0 and min(len(g1), w), and for each a, the corresponding b is (w -a)//2.\n\nSo perhaps for each w, we can iterate a from 0 to the maximum possible, compute b, and track the maximum sum.\n\nBut this would be O(w * a_max) for each w, which is 3e5 * 1e5 = 3e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nWait, but group1 and group2 may have a lot of items, but maybe the a can be considered in a way that for each a, the function f_a(w) is known, and for all w, the maximum can be found by considering all a's.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible a, we can compute the function f_a(w) and then for each w, collect all possible a's that could contribute to the maximum.\n\nBut I'm not seeing how to make this efficient.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWhat if I precompute for each possible a, the maximum sum when taking a group1 items and as many group2 items as possible.\n\nWait, but that would be for each a, the maximum b is the largest possible that 2b <= (w -a). But w varies.\n\nHmm, perhaps for a fixed a, the maximum contribution is sum_g1[a] + sum_g2[ b ], where b is floor( (w -a)/2 ). So for each a, the function is a linear function in terms of w. Wait, no, because as w increases, the number of group2 items that can be taken increases.\n\nBut for each a, the function f_a(w) is non-decreasing because as w increases, more group2 items can be added.\n\nSo for each a, f_a(w) is a non-decreasing function.\n\nNow, the overall function for each w is the maximum of f_a(w) for all a.\n\nSince each f_a(w) is non-decreasing, the maximum across all a is also non-decreasing.\n\nThus, the maximum function is non-decreasing.\n\nBut how does this help?\n\nWell, perhaps for each w, we can find the optimal a that maximizes f_a(w).\n\nBut finding this a efficiently for each w is the challenge.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think about the possible a's for a given w.\n\na can vary from 0 to min( len(g1), w ), and for each a, the corresponding b is (w - a) // 2.\n\nSo for each w, the optimal a is somewhere between 0 and min(g1, w).\n\nBut trying all a for each w is too slow.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to compute the optimal a for each w without checking every possibility.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nSince group1 and group2 are sorted, perhaps for a given w, the optimal a is such that increasing a further would not give a better sum.\n\nWait, for a fixed w, as a increases, the sum_g1[a] increases, but the sum_g2[b] decreases because b is (w -a)//2.\n\nSo the function f_a(w) = sum_g1[a] + sum_g2[ (w -a)//2 ] may have a single peak, which is the a that maximizes f_a(w).\n\nSo perhaps for each w, the optimal a can be found by binary search.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each w, the optimal a can be found in a certain range, and then we can check the a's around that point to find the maximum.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given w, the optimal a is in a certain range where adding or subtracting a increases or decreases the sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each w, the optimal a can be found by considering that increasing a beyond a certain point reduces the number of group2 items, which might decrease the sum more than the increase from group1.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nWhat if I precompute for each possible a, the maximum possible b as a function of a, and then for each a, create a line in terms of w. Then, for each w, the maximum sum is the maximum of all lines evaluated at w.\n\nBut this seems abstract.\n\nWait, perhaps for each a, we can compute the maximum possible b for any w, and then for each w, the maximum sum is the maximum over a of sum_g1[a] + sum_g2[ (w -a) // 2 ].\n\nBut again, evaluating this for each w is O(1e5 * 3e5) operations, which is way too slow.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that group1 is sorted, so for group1, the sum_g1[a] is strictly increasing with a. Similarly for group2, sum_g2[b] is strictly increasing with b.\n\nSo for a given w, as a increases from 0 to w, the sum_g1[a] increases, but sum_g2[b] decreases because b decreases as a increases.\n\nSo the function f_a(w) may have a single maximum point. Thus, for each w, the optimal a can be found by checking a few candidates around a certain point.\n\nBut how to find that point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each a, the best w for which this a is optimal can be determined, and then for all w, the optimal a is known.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe for each a, the optimal w is such that increasing a further would not improve the sum. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal a for a given w is such that the marginal gain from adding an a+1 is offset by the loss from reducing b.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nPerhaps I should try to find another approach.\n\nLet me think about the problem again.\n\nGiven that the weights are 1, 2, 3, and that each group is sorted, perhaps the solution can be approached greedily.\n\nWait, but greedy approaches usually don't work for knapsack problems because the optimal choice depends on future items.\n\nBut given that the weights are small, perhaps the problem can be simplified.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal solution can be found by trying all possible combinations of taking some group1, group2, and group3 items, and for each possible k3, find the best possible a and b.\n\nBut again, with 1e5 items, this is challenging.\n\nWait, but what if I precompute the prefix sums for group1 and group2, and then for each possible k3, compute rem = m -3*k3, and then compute the best a and b such that a + 2b <= rem.\n\nBut how to compute a and b quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps for each rem, I can find the maximum a and b such that a + 2b <= rem.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding the maximum a + b, where a is from group1, b from group2, and a + 2b <= rem.\n\nBut even this is tricky.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nSince group1 and group2 are sorted, perhaps for each rem, the best a and b can be found by trying all possible b's and then finding the best a for each b.\n\nBut again, for each rem, this could be O(1e5) operations, which multiplied by 1e5 k3's is 1e10 operations—too slow.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps for a fixed rem, the maximum a is min( len(g1), rem ), and the maximum b is min( len(g2), rem // 2 ).\n\nBut this isn't necessarily the optimal choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given rem, the optimal a and b can be found by trying all possible b's up to a certain limit.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nPerhaps the problem can be transformed into a 3D space, but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to precompute for each possible a, the maximum possible b that can be taken given a, and then for each a, compute the total weight and cost.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible weight that can be used for group1 and group2. It's m, since group3's weight is 3.\n\nSo for group1 and group2, the maximum weight is m.\n\nSo the DP for group1 and group2 can be built once, and then for each k3, rem = m -3*k3.\n\nThe maximum cost for group1 and group2 in rem weight is the maximum sum for any a and b where a + 2b <= rem.\n\nSo perhaps the DP for group1 and group2 can be optimized.\n\nWait, but building the DP for group1 and group2 is O( (n1 + n2) * m ), which is O(1e5 * 3e5) = 3e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo that's not feasible.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, but group1 and group2 can be considered separately. So for group1, the maximum a is the number of items we can take, and for group2, the maximum b is the number of items we can take given a.\n\nBut again, for each rem, finding the best a and b is difficult.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWhat if I precompute the best a and b for each possible rem?\n\nBut rem can be up to 3e5, and for each rem, trying all a is O(1e5), which is again 3e10 operations.\n\nNot feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nMaybe the problem can be viewed as a variation of the knapsack problem where each item has a weight of 1, 2, or 3, but with the constraints that the items are divided into groups of 1, 2, 3.\n\nIn such cases, perhaps a branch-and-bound approach or some form of memoization can be used, but it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the total weight is m, and the maximum cost is the sum of the top group1 items, top group2 items, and top group3 items, but in a way that the total weight is <= m.\n\nBut that's only true if the items are taken in a way that the sum of their weights is <=m.\n\nBut how to maximize the sum of group1, group2, and group3 items under this constraint.\n\nWait, another Idea:\n\nWe can model the problem as choosing any number of group1, group2, and group3 items, such that the sum of their weights is <= m.\n\nEach group is sorted, so the maximum sum for group1 is the sum of the top a items, group2 top b, group3 top c.\n\nSo the objective is to maximize sum1[a] + sum2[b] + sum3[c], subject to a + 2b + 3c <= m.\n\nBut how to find a, b, c that satisfy this.\n\nBut with a, b, c up to 1e5, it's impossible to iterate through all possibilities.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWe can iterate over c (number of group3 items taken), and for each c, compute the maximum sum from group1 and group2 within the remaining weight rem = m - 3*c.\n\nAs before, this is manageable because c can be up to 1e5, but rem is up to 3e5.\n\nSo for each c, rem is known, and the problem reduces to finding the maximum sum from group1 and group2 with total weight <= rem.\n\nBut how to compute this quickly for each c.\n\nWait, perhaps for group1 and group2, we can precompute for each possible rem the maximum sum.\n\nBut rem can be up to 3e5, and group1 and group2 can have up to 1e5 items each.\n\nSo for each rem, the maximum sum is the sum of a group1 items and b group2 items, a + 2b <= rem.\n\nWe need to find a and b that maximize sum1[a] + sum2[b].\n\nBut again, for each rem, how to compute this quickly.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWhat if I precompute for each possible a (number of group1 items), the maximum b such that 2b <= rem -a, and then for each a, the sum is sum1[a] + sum2[b].\n\nBut this is O(1e5) operations per c, and since c can be up to 1e5, this is 1e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, but group1 and group2 are sorted, so perhaps for each c, the best a and b can be found with binary search.\n\nWait, let me think. For a given rem, the maximum sum is the maximum of sum1[a] + sum2[b], where a + 2b <= rem.\n\nSo for each a, the maximum possible b is floor( (rem -a) / 2 ). So for each a, the sum is sum1[a] + sum2[ floor( (rem -a)/2 ) ].\n\nBut the a can be up to min( len(g1), rem ), which is up to 1e5.\n\nSo for each c, rem = m -3c, and for each a in 0 to min( len(g1), rem ), compute the sum.\n\nBut again, this is O(1e5) per c, which is 1e10 operations.\n\nNot feasible.\n\nSo, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem can be simplified by noting that for group1 and group2, the maximum sum is achieved by taking as many high-value items as possible, regardless of their weight.\n\nBut this isn't necessarily true because group2 has higher weight per item than group1.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps for group1 and group2, the optimal way is to take as many as possible of the highest value items, and the order in which they are taken depends on their cost per unit weight.\n\nSo perhaps group1's items are better than group2's if their cost is higher per unit weight.\n\nWait, for group1, each item has weight 1, so cost per unit is cost. For group2, cost per unit is cost/2.\n\nSo for group1, if an item's cost is higher than twice the cost of a group2 item, then it's better to take group1 items first.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal strategy is to take as many of the highest cost items as possible, prioritizing group1 and group2 items based on their cost per unit weight.\n\nBut this is just a heuristic and may not always yield the optimal solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can merge group1 and group2 into a single list, sorted by cost per unit weight, and then try to take the top items in that order, but this is again a greedy approach and may not work for the problem.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nSince group1 and group2 have small weights, perhaps we can find for each possible weight w, the best combination of group1 and group2 items that sum up to w, and keep track of the maximum cost.\n\nBut again, with w up to 3e5, and group1 and group2 having 1e5 items each, this would be O( (1e5 + 1e5) * 3e5 ) = 6e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by using a sliding window technique or some other mathematical method to find the optimal a and b for each rem.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck on finding an efficient way to compute the maximum sum for group1 and group2 for any rem.\n\nMaybe I should think about the problem differently.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe problem is to select items from group1, group2, group3, such that their total weight is <=m, and the total cost is maximized.\n\nSince group3's weight is 3, and group1 and group2's is 1 and 2 respectively, perhaps the optimal approach is to take as many high-value group3 items as possible, then group2, then group1.\n\nBut this is again a greedy approach and may not yield the optimal solution.\n\nBut perhaps it's worth trying, given that the problem's constraints are tight.\n\nBut the sample input shows that sometimes a combination of group2 and group1 is better than just group3.\n\nLike in the second sample input, the output is 3, which comes from taking a group2 item (weight 2, cost 3) and a group1 item (weight 1, cost 3) for a total weight of 3 and cost 6? Wait, no,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry without exceeding a given weight limit. The problem is a variation of the knapsack problem with specific constraints on the weights of the items.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each souvenir has a weight of either 1, 2, or 3. This allows us to group the souvenirs by their weights and process them efficiently.\n\n1. **Grouping Souvenirs**: Separate the souvenirs into three groups based on their weights (1, 2, or 3).\n\n2. **Sorting and Prefix Sums**: For each group, sort the souvenirs in descending order of their cost.
