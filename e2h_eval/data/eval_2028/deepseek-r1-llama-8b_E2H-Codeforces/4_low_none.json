The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is a variation of Rock-Paper-Scissors between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They play n rounds, and in each round, the winner gives the loser a pinch, which leaves a red spot. We need to calculate how many red spots each has after all the rounds.\n\nHmm. So the key here is that both players have their own sequences for choosing their moves. For each round, they each pick the next move in their respective sequences, cycling through them. And based on the outcome of each round, one gets a point (a red spot), the other doesn't.\n\nWait, no, actually, the loser gets a red spot. So for each round, if A wins, B gets a spot. If B wins, A gets a spot. If it's a draw, no one gets a spot.\n\nSo the task is to simulate each round, determine who loses, and increment their count accordingly.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2e5, which is 200,000. And the sequences A and B can be up to 1000 characters each. So we need an efficient way to find, for each round i, what move A and B are making.\n\nLet me think: for each player, their sequence repeats cyclically. So for the i-th round, A's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for B, it's B[i % k], with k being the length of B.\n\nBut wait, since the rounds are from 0 to n-1 or 1 to n? Well, in code, probably 0-based. So for each round number from 0 to n-1, we get A's move as A[(i) % len_A], same for B.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read the input: n, then string A, then string B.\n\n2. For each round i in 0..n-1:\n\n   a. Get A_move = A[i % lenA]\n\n   b. Get B_move = B[i % lenB]\n\n   c. Determine who loses:\n\n      - If A_move beats B_move: B loses, so Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\n      - Else if B_move beats A_move: A loses, so Nikephoros gets a spot.\n\n      - Else: no one gets a spot.\n\n3. After processing all rounds, output the counts.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this efficiently. Since n can be 2e5, and each step is O(1), the total time should be acceptable.\n\nBut let's think about how to represent the moves and the outcomes. For each possible pair of moves, we can precompute who would win.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, compute the outcome on the fly.\n\nI think the straightforward approach is manageable.\n\nSo, first, read n, then A, then B.\n\nInitialize two counters: a = 0, b = 0.\n\nThen loop for i in range(n):\n\n   a_move = A[i % lenA]\n\n   b_move = B[i % lenB]\n\n   determine who loses.\n\n   if a_move beats b_move:\n\n       b +=1\n\n   elif b_move beats a_move:\n\n       a +=1\n\n   else:\n\n       pass\n\nSo the core is determining whether A's move beats B's move.\n\nHow to represent the beats? Let's create a function or a dictionary that tells us for any two moves, who wins.\n\nFor example:\n\nrock ('R') beats scissors ('S')\n\nscissors ('S') beats paper ('P')\n\npaper ('P') beats rock ('R')\n\nIf both are same, it's a draw.\n\nSo, perhaps a helper function could determine this.\n\nAnother way is to use a lookup table. Let's see:\n\nFor a given a_move and b_move:\n\nif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') → A wins.\n\nif (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') → A wins.\n\nif (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R') → A wins.\n\nElse, check if B's move beats A's move.\n\nElse, it's a draw.\n\nSo, code-wise, for each i:\n\nget a_move and b_move.\n\nif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') → a does not lose, so B gets a point.\n\nelif (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') → same as above.\n\nelif (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R') → same.\n\nelse, check if B wins:\n\nif (b_move == 'R' and a_move == 'S') → B wins, so A gets a point.\n\nelif (b_move == 'S' and a_move == 'P') → B wins.\n\nelif (b_move == 'P",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, after they play a series of Rock-Paper-Scissors games. Each round is played according to cyclic sequences of moves chosen by each player.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B` from the input.\n2. **Initialization**: Initialize counters for the red spots on both players.\n3. **Cyclic Move Determination**: For each round, determine the move each player makes using their respective sequences. Since the sequences are cyclic, we use modulo operations to cycle through the sequences.\n4. **Determine Winner**: For each round, check if the move of one player beats the move of the other. If so, the loser gets a red spot. If it's a draw, no one gets a spot.\n5. **Update Counters**: Based on the outcome of each round, update the red spot counters accordingly.\n6. **Output Results**: After processing all rounds, print the counts of red spots for both players.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\na_spots = 0\nb_spots = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a_move = A[i % len(A)]\n    b_move = B[i % len(B)]\n    \n    if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n        b_spots += 1\n    elif (b_move == 'R' and a_move == 'S') or (b_move == 'S' and a_move == 'P') or (b_move == 'P' and a_move == 'R'):\n        a_spots += 1\n    # else: draw, do nothing\n\nprint(a_spots, b_spots)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n` and two strings representing the move sequences of the players.\n- **Cyclic Move Handling**: Using modulo operations, we cycle through each player's move sequence efficiently.\n- **Winning Conditions**: We check if the current move of one player beats the move of the other. If true, the corresponding player gets a red spot.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution processes each round in constant time, making it efficient even for the upper limit of input constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly simulate each round and accurately count the red spots for both players, providing the correct result efficiently.",
