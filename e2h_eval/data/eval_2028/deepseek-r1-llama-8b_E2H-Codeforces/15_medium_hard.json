They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about a playoff tournament with 2^n teams. The tournament has multiple phases, and in each phase, certain rules determine which teams progress to the next round. Each phase is determined by the string s, where each character represents whether higher or lower skill wins in that phase.\n\nThe goal is to find all winning integers x, meaning all x such that there exists a permutation p of the skills 1 to 2^n where team x becomes the champion after the entire tournament.\n\nHmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to model the tournament structure. The tournament has n phases. In each phase i (from 0 to n-1), the number of games is 2^(n - i - 1). For example, the first phase (i=0) has 2^(n-1) games, then phase i=1 has 2^(n-2) games, and so on until the last phase i = n-1, which is just one game.\n\nEach phase depends on the corresponding character in the string s. So for phase i, s[i] is either '0' or '1'. If s[i] is '0', then in each match of that phase, the lower-skilled team wins. If it's '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a second. No, actually, the description says that s_i is the result of games in the i-th phase. So for each match in that phase, if s_i is 0, the lower-skilled team wins; else, the higher-skilled.\n\nSo, for each phase, the matches are grouped into pairs from the previous winners. Like, the first phase pairs 1 vs 2, 3 vs4, etc. Then the winners proceed to the next phase, where they pair up again, but in a different way.\n\nBut how exactly do the pairings work in each subsequent phase? Like, phase i=0 (the first phase) has 2^{n-1} games. Then phase i=1 has 2^{n-2} games, which are the winners of each group of four in phase 0. But how are these groups formed?\n\nWait, the problem says: in the second phase, the winners of the first phase's games are arranged as follows. The first game is between the winner of 1 vs 2 and the winner of 3 vs4. The second game is between the winner of 5 vs6 and 7 vs8, and so on.\n\nAh, right. So the tournament structure is a binary tree. Each phase i corresponds to a level in the tournament bracket. The first phase (i=0) is the leaves, and each subsequent phase is the parents of those nodes.\n\nSo, the key is to model each match in each phase based on the given s string. For each phase, we have a certain rule (0 or 1) that determines which team wins each match.\n\nOur task is to find all x such that there's a permutation p where x is the overall winner.\n\nHmm, how can we model this? It seems like a recursive problem, but n can be up to 18, which means 2^18=262144 teams. So any brute-force approach is impossible.\n\nWait, but 2^18 is about 260k, which is manageable for some dynamic programming approaches. But considering that each phase depends on the permutation, this might get tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a bitmask problem. Since each team can be represented by a bit in a number, and we can track which teams are possible at each stage.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a DP approach where for each phase, we track the possible winners for each group.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For each phase, the teams are grouped into matches, and each match produces a winner based on the current phase's rule. The winners then form the next phase's participants.\n\nSo, for phase i, the matches are determined by the structure of the tournament. Each match in phase i is between two winners from phase i-1.\n\nBut wait, no. Because phase 0 is the first phase, which has 2^{n-1} matches, each between consecutive pairs. Phase 1 has 2^{n-2} matches, each between the winners of two phase 0 matches. And so on.\n\nSo, for each phase i, the matches are between the top 2^{n-i} groups of two matches from phase i-1.\n\nWait, perhaps the tournament can be viewed as a binary heap, where each node has two children that are the winners of their respective sub-tournaments.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the binary representation of the tournament.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent each phase as a set of intervals. For example, phase 0 matches are [1,2], [3,4], ..., [2^k-1, 2^k], where k increases as we go deeper.\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate because each phase's groupings depend on the previous phase's groupings.\n\nWait, perhaps for phase i, the matches are formed by taking the winners from phase i-1, and pairing them as follows: the first winner with the second, third with fourth, etc. Or wait, noâ€”phase i's matches are between the winners of two consecutive matches from phase i-1.\n\nWait, the problem statement says for phase i, the games are as follows: the first game is between the winners of 1 vs2 and 3 vs4, the next is between 5 vs6 and 7 vs8, and so on.\n\nAh, right! So the matches in phase i are grouped in blocks of size 2^{i+1}, and within each block, the first two matches are combined into a single match.\n\nFor example, phase 0 has matches between 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, etc. Phase 1 has matches between the winners of 1-2 vs 3-4, 5-6 vs 7-8, etc.\n\nSo the structure is that each phase i is built by combining the results of phase i-1's matches in a way that groups every two matches into a larger match.\n\nThis suggests that for each phase i, the matches are formed by taking every two consecutive matches from phase i-1 and combining them into a new match in phase i.\n\nSo, to model this, perhaps for each phase, we can represent the possible winners of each match, and then for the next phase, combine these winners accordingly.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 18, 2^18 is manageable for some bitmask approaches, but the exact method is unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to model the tournament as a series of layers, and for each layer, track the possible winners. Each layer corresponds to a phase, and the possible winners are determined by the rules of that phase.\n\nSo, starting from the initial phase 0, each match can produce a winner based on the rule (s[0]). Then, phase 1 is built from the winners of phase 0, and so on.\n\nBut how can we represent the possible winners at each phase?\n\nWait, maybe using a binary trie or some kind of state representation. Alternatively, since each phase's winners are determined by the previous phase's winners, perhaps a memoization approach can help.\n\nAnother approach: The tournament can be viewed as a binary tree. Each node represents a match, and the leaves are the initial matches of phase 0. Each internal node represents the match in a higher phase.\n\nEach match in a phase depends on the two matches that fed into it (their winners). So, for each match in phase i, its outcome depends on the outcomes of two matches in phase i-1.\n\nWait, but the matches in phase i are determined by the groupings, so for each phase, the matches are fixed as per the tournament structure.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each phase, the matches are determined, and the winner of each match is computed based on the current rule and the winners of the two sub-matches.\n\nSo, for each phase, the matches are processed in order, and for each match, we compute the possible winners based on the current rule and the two sub-winners.\n\nThus, the process is:\n\n1. For phase 0: Each initial match (like 1v2, 3v4, etc.) is processed. For each, if s[0] is '0', the lower-numbered team wins; else, the higher.\n\n2. These winners form the participants for phase 1.\n\n3. For phase 1: Each match is between the first and second winners of phase 0, then third and fourth, etc. For each such match, apply the rule s[1], and determine the winner.\n\n4. This continues until phase n-1, which has only one match, whose winner is the champion.\n\nSo, the structure is a binary tree where each node has two children (the two sub-matches that feed into it).\n\nGiven this, the key is to model for each match in each phase, which teams can possibly win that match, given the rules and the possible winners of the sub-matches.\n\nBut wait, the permutation p is a permutation of the numbers 1 to 2^n. So, each team has a unique skill level, and the outcome of a match depends on the relative skill levels.\n\nBut when considering possible permutations, the arrangement must satisfy all the match outcomes.\n\nThis sounds like a problem where for each match, we can define constraints on the permutation.\n\nBut since the permutation is unknown, we need to find all x such that x can be the root of this tournament structure, i.e., x can be the winner through all phases.\n\nHmm, but modeling this directly seems difficult.\n\nAnother thought: The problem is similar to building a binary decision tree where each node is a match, and each edge represents the choice of which team wins. The leaves are the initial matches, and the root is the final champion.\n\nWe need to assign the teams to the leaves in such a way that the constraints imposed by each match's rule are satisfied, and the path from a leaf to the root correctly selects the winner according to the rules.\n\nBut even so, the problem is to find all x that can be the root of such a tree, given the constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model for each match, which team can possibly win it, given the rules of that phase and the structure of the tournament.\n\nBut since the tournament structure is fixed, each match in each phase is known, and the winner of each match depends on the rule and the two sub-winners.\n\nSo, perhaps for each match, we can determine the possible winners based on the phase's rule, and then recursively determine the possible winners for higher phases.\n\nThis suggests a dynamic programming approach where for each match, we track which teams can win it, given the possible winners of the two sub-matches and the phase's rule.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nEach match can be represented by a tuple of its left and right sub-match indices. For example, a match M in phase i is composed of two sub-matches S1 and S2 from phase i-1.\n\nFor each such M, the possible winners are determined by the rule s[i]. So, if s[i] is '0', the winner is the one with the lower number (since lower skill would mean they win). Wait, waitâ€”no. Wait, s[i] being 0 means that in each match of phase i, the lower-skilled team wins. So, for a match M in phase i, the winner is the team with lower skill, provided s[i] is '0'. If s[i] is '1', the winner is the higher-skilled team.\n\nWait, but the skill levels are a permutation of 1..2^n. So, the actual skill values are determined by p, which is unknown. So, for each match, the winner is determined by the rule and the relative skill levels of the two sub-winners.\n\nBut in the permutation, the numbers are unique, so for two teams a and b, one is higher than the other.\n\nWait, but for the purpose of determining the winner of a match, the actual values don't matter, only their relative ordering. So, for two teams, their order is determined by the permutation.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to arranging the permutation such that for each match, the winner is selected according to the rule, and the chain leads to x being the overall winner.\n\nBut how can we model this? It seems challenging because the permutation is a global arrangement.\n\nAn alternative approach: Think of the tournament as a binary tree, where each non-leaf node is a match that depends on its two children. For each node, the winner is determined by the rule and the winners of the two children.\n\nSo, for each node, the possible winners are constrained based on the rule and the possible winners of the children.\n\nBut again, this is tricky because the permutation isn't known.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to model for each match, the set of possible teams that can reach it as a winner, considering the phase's rule and the possible winners of the sub-matches.\n\nThis can be done recursively. For each match, the possible winners are determined by the rule and the possible winners of the two sub-matches.\n\nSo, for a match M in phase i, which is composed of two sub-matches S1 and S2, the possible winners for M are the intersection of the possible winners of S1 and S2, filtered by the rule.\n\nWait, no. Because for each possible winner of S1 and S2, the winner of M is determined by the rule. So, for each possible a âˆˆ winners(S1) and b âˆˆ winners(S2), if the rule is '0', then the winner of M is min(a, b), else it's max(a, b). But wait, the actual winner could be either a or b, depending on the rule and their relative strengths.\n\nWait, perhaps for each match M, the possible winners are determined by the rule and the possible winners of S1 and S2.\n\nSo, for match M, the possible winners are the union of all possible a and b where a is a winner of S1, b is a winner of S2, and the rule applied to a and b gives a certain winner.\n\nWait, no. Because the rule is applied to the two sub-winners, and the winner is determined. So for each combination of a and b, we can compute the winner of M, which is either a or b, depending on the rule.\n\nThus, for each match M, the possible winners are the set {w | w is the winner of M for some a âˆˆ W1, b âˆˆ W2}, where W1 is the possible winners of S1, W2 is the possible winners of S2, and w is determined by applying the rule to a and b.\n\nSo, the algorithm would involve:\n\n1. For each match, compute the possible winners based on the current phase's rule and the possible winners of its two sub-matches.\n\n2. Starting from the leaves (phase 0), which each have only one possible winner (since they are the initial matches, but their winners depend on the rule), build up the possible winners for each match in higher phases.\n\nWait, but the leaves are the initial matches in phase 0. For each such match, the possible winners are the teams that could have been in that match and won according to the rule.\n\nWait, for phase 0, each match is between two consecutive teams. So, for the match between team 2k-1 and 2k, the possible winner is either team 2k-1 or 2k, depending on the rule.\n\nWait, no. Because the rule s[0] determines which team wins each match. So, for each match in phase 0:\n\nIf s[0] is '0', the winner is the team with the lower number. So, for the match between 1 and 2, the winner is 1. For the match between 3 and4, the winner is 3, and so on.\n\nIf s[0] is '1', the winner is the team with the higher number. So, for 1 vs2, the winner is 2; for 3 vs4, it's4, etc.\n\nThus, for phase 0, each match's possible winner is fixed. So, for phase 0, the possible winners are known.\n\nThen, for phase 1, each match is between two winners from phase 0. For each such pair of phase 0 winners, the possible winner is determined by s[1].\n\nSo, for phase 1's first match, which is between the winners of 1-2 and 3-4, the possible winner is either a or b, where a is the winner of 1-2 and b is the winner of 3-4. The rule s[1] determines which one wins.\n\nWait, but wait: the possible winners for each phase 0 match are fixed. So, for example, if s[0] is '0', then the winner of 1-2 is 1, the winner of 3-4 is3, etc. So, for phase 1, the first match is between 1 and3. Then, according to s[1], if s[1] is '0', the winner is min(1,3) which is 1. Else, it's max(1,3) which is 3.\n\nThus, for phase 1, the possible winners for each match are either a or b, based on the rule.\n\nSo, the approach is to process each phase step by step, starting from phase 0, then phase 1, and so on, until phase n-1.\n\nAt each phase, for each match, we compute the possible winners based on the rule and the possible winners of the two sub-matches.\n\nThis suggests that we can model the possible winners for each match using a memoization table or a dynamic programming approach.\n\nNow, the key is to represent the possible winners for each match in a way that allows us to compute the next phase's possible winners.\n\nSo, let's think of each match as a node in a binary tree. The leaves are the initial matches in phase 0. Each internal node represents a match in a higher phase, composed of two child matches.\n\nFor each internal node, the possible winners are determined by the rule of its phase and the possible winners of its two children.\n\nSo, the algorithm would proceed as follows:\n\n- Start with phase 0. For each match in phase 0, determine the winner based on s[0]. So, for each match, the possible winner is either the lower or higher team, depending on s[0].\n\n- Then, for phase 1, process each match, which is composed of two consecutive matches from phase 0. For each such pair, take their possible winners and apply the rule s[1] to determine the possible winner of the phase 1 match.\n\n- Repeat this process for each phase, building up the possible winners for each match in the next phase.\n\n- Finally, for the root match (phase n-1), collect all possible winners. These are the possible champions x.\n\nThe question is, how to represent the possible winners for each match efficiently.\n\nAn approach is to represent the possible winners for each match as a set of integers. For each phase, we can process all the matches in that phase, and for each, compute the possible winners based on their two children's possible winners and the current phase's rule.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Represent the tournament as a binary tree. Each node is a match. The leaves are the initial matches of phase 0.\n\n2. For each node, compute the possible winners based on the rule of its phase and the possible winners of its two children.\n\n3. After processing all phases, the root node's possible winners are the possible x's.\n\nBut implementing this requires knowing the structure of the tournament as a binary tree, where each node knows its two children.\n\nSo, the first thing is to construct the binary tree structure. Each node has a left and right child, which are the two matches that feed into it.\n\nHow to construct this tree? Well, for each phase i, the number of matches is 2^{n-i}. Each match in phase i is composed of two matches from phase i-1.\n\nThe way to pair them is that the first match in phase i is composed of the first two matches of phase i-1, the next match is composed of the next two, and so on.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- Phase 0 has m = 2^{n-1} matches. They are numbered 0 to m-1.\n\n- Phase 1 has m = 2^{n-2} matches. Each match j in phase 1 is composed of matches 2j and 2j+1 from phase 0.\n\n- Phase 2 has m = 2^{n-3} matches. Each match j in phase 2 is composed of matches 2*(2j) and 2*(2j+1) from phase 1, which correspond to 4j, 4j+1, 4j+2, 4j+3 from phase 0.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThus, for any phase i, the match j is composed of matches 2^i * (2j) and 2^i * (2j + 1) from phase i-1.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, each match in phase i is built by grouping two consecutive matches from phase i-1. So, for phase i, the first match is made from phase i-1's matches 0 and 1, the next from 2 and3, etc.\n\nThus, for phase i, the matches are in pairs of two from phase i-1, grouped consecutively.\n\nSo, the way to construct the tree is to represent each match in phase i as a parent of two matches from phase i-1.\n\nTherefore, the tree can be constructed recursively.\n\nOnce the tree is built, we can process each node in a BFS manner, starting from the leaves (phase 0), and moving up to higher phases.\n\nEach node will store a set of possible winners, which is the union of all possible winners based on the rule of its phase and the possible winners of its two children.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Build the tournament tree structure, where each node knows its phase and the phase of its children.\n\n- For each node, starting from the leaves, compute the possible winners.\n\n- For each node in phase i, if it's a leaf (phase 0), its possible winners are determined by the initial match's rule.\n\n- For internal nodes, the possible winners are computed by considering all possible combinations of the two children's winners, applying the phase's rule, and collecting the resulting winners.\n\nBut how to represent the sets? For efficiency, perhaps using bitmask integers, where each bit represents whether a team is possible.\n\nBut with 2^18 teams, that's 262,144 bits, which is manageable as a Python integer.\n\nWait, but for each match, the possible winners can be represented as a bitmask. For example, if a match can be won by team 1 or 3, the mask would have bits 0 (for 1) and 2 (for 3) set.\n\nThus, for each match, we can represent the possible winners as a bitmask. Then, for a node in phase i, its possible winners are computed by:\n\n- For each possible winner a of the left child.\n\n- For each possible winner b of the right child.\n\n- Compute the winner of the current match based on s[i].\n\n- Add this winner to the current node's possible winners.\n\nThus, for each node, the possible winners are the union of all possible outcomes based on the children's possible winners and the current rule.\n\nThis approach can be implemented using memoization or a BFS-like processing.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n and s.\n\n2. Construct the tournament tree. Each node is identified by its position in the phase and its index in the tree.\n\n3. For each node, determine its phase and its two children.\n\n4. Process each node starting from the leaves (phase 0), then moving up the tree.\n\n5. For each node, compute the possible winners based on its phase's rule and the children's possible winners.\n\n6. Once all nodes are processed, the root node's possible winners are the set of possible champions.\n\n7. Collect all x where x is in the root's possible winners.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet's think about the data structures.\n\nEach node can be represented as an object or a dictionary with:\n\n- phase: the phase number (0-based, from 0 to n-1)\n\n- left_child: index of the left child match\n\n- right_child: index of the right child match\n\nBut since we're dealing with a binary tree, perhaps it's easier to represent the tree as a list of dictionaries, where each entry represents a node, with its phase, children, etc.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to precompute for each node its phase, left, and right children.\n\nAlternatively, during the tree construction, each node can be built recursively, and for each node, we can keep track of its phase, left, and right children.\n\nBut in code, representing the tree may be a bit involved. So, perhaps we can represent each node as an index in a list, and for each node, store its phase, left, and right children.\n\nLet me think about how to build the tree.\n\nThe tree has n levels (phases), starting from 0 to n-1.\n\nThe number of nodes per phase is 2^{n - i} for phase i.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the number of matches per phase is 2^{n - i}, but the number of nodes in the tree is 2^n - 1, which is correct.\n\nEach node is a match, and the tree is a binary tree with height n, and 2^n -1 nodes.\n\nThe leaves are the initial matches in phase 0. Their number is 2^{n-1}.\n\nWait, for example, if n=3, phase 0 has 4 matches, phase 1 has 2 matches, phase 2 has 1 match.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, to build the tree:\n\n- The root is the match in phase n-1, which is the final match.\n\n- Its children are the two matches in phase n-2 that feed into it.\n\nWait, perhaps the tree is built in reverse.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tree is built by considering that for each match in phase i, it is composed of two consecutive matches from phase i-1.\n\nSo, for phase i, the number of matches is m_i = 2^{n - i}.\n\nEach match j in phase i is composed of matches 2j and 2j+1 from phase i-1.\n\nWait, no. Because for phase i, each match is formed by grouping two consecutive matches from phase i-1.\n\nSo, for phase i, the first match is composed of matches 0 and 1 of phase i-1, the second of matches 2 and 3, etc.\n\nThus, for each match j in phase i, it is composed of matches 2j and 2j+1 from phase i-1.\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nThus, the root is the match in phase n-1, which is 0 (since there's only one match in the last phase). Its left child is match 0 in phase n-2, and its right child is match 1 in phase n-2.\n\nWait, but in phase n-2, there are 2^{n - (n-2)} }= 2^2=4 matches. So, the root's children are the first two matches of phase n-2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should represent the tree as a binary heap, where each node has a left and right child, which are the two matches that compose it.\n\nBut how to represent this in code.\n\nPerhaps, for each phase i, the matches can be stored in a list, and each match j in phase i is composed of matches 2j and 2j+1 from phase i-1.\n\nWait, perhaps the tree can be built by starting from the leaves and building upwards.\n\nWait, perhaps the tree can be built as a list of lists, where for each phase i, the matches are stored in a list, and each match j in phase i is composed of matches 2j and 2j+1 from phase i-1.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- Phase 0: matches are 0 to 2^{n-1}-1.\n\n- Phase 1: matches are 0 to 2^{n-2}-1. Each match j is composed of phase0[2j] and phase0[2j+1].\n\n- Phase 2: matches are 0 to 2^{n-3}-1. Each match j is composed of phase1[2j] and phase1[2j+1], which correspond to phase0[4j], phase0[4j+1], phase0[4j+2], phase0[4j+3].\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThus, the tree can be built recursively, where each node in phase i has left and right children in phase i-1.\n\nIn code, perhaps we can represent the tree as a list of lists, where each element is a list of possible winners (as a bitmask) for that match.\n\nSo, for each phase i, and for each match j in that phase, we can compute the possible winners based on the rule s[i] and the possible winners of its two children.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize a list of sets for each phase and match.\n\n2. For phase 0, each match is between two consecutive teams. So, for each match j in phase 0:\n\n   a. If s[0] is '0', the winner is the lower-numbered team.\n\n      So, if the match is between team a and b, where a < b, then the winner is a.\n\n      Else, if a > b, the winner is b.\n\n      Wait, no. Wait, the match is between 2j+1 and 2j+2.\n\n      Wait, no. Wait, for phase 0, the matches are 1-2, 3-4, etc. So, for match j in phase 0 (0-based), the teams are 2j+1 and 2j+2.\n\n      So, for match j in phase 0:\n\n      if s[0] == '0', the winner is min(2j+1, 2j+2).\n\n      if s[0] == '1', the winner is max(2j+1, 2j+2).\n\n      So, for phase 0, each match j has a single possible winner.\n\n3. For phase 1, each match j is composed of two matches from phase 0, 2j and 2j+1.\n\n   So, for match j in phase 1:\n\n   a. Take the possible winners of phase0[2j] and phase0[2j+1].\n\n   b. Apply the rule s[1]. For each possible a in phase0[2j]'s winners and b in phase0[2j+1]'s winners:\n\n      if s[1] is '0', the winner is min(a, b).\n\n      else, it's max(a, b).\n\n   c. Collect all possible winners for this match.\n\n4. Repeat this for all phases until phase n-1.\n\nOnce all phases are processed, the root (match 0 in phase n-1) will have a set of possible winners, which are the x's we need to output.\n\nSo, in code, we can represent each phase as a list of sets (or bitmasks), where each set contains the possible winners for that match.\n\nBut storing sets for each match may be memory-intensive, especially for large n. So, using bitmasks is more efficient.\n\nEach bitmask can be represented as an integer, where the i-th bit indicates whether team i+1 can be a winner (assuming 1-based numbering). For example, for a match that can be won by team 3 and 5, the mask would be 0b1001, which is 9 in decimal.\n\nThus, for each match, we can store a bitmask indicating which teams can win it.\n\nNow, the initial step is to process phase 0.\n\nPhase 0:\n\nEach match j in phase 0 is between 2j+1 and 2j+2.\n\nFor s[0] == '0', the winner is the smaller team.\n\nSo, for j in 0..(2^{n-1} -1):\n\n   a = 2j + 1\n\n   b = 2j + 2\n\n   if a < b:\n\n       winner = a\n\n   else:\n\n       winner = b\n\nSo, for each match j in phase 0, the possible_winner_mask is 1 << (winner - 1).\n\nWait, because team numbers are 1-based, but the bitmask uses 0-based bits.\n\nWait, for example, team 1 is bit 0, team 2 is bit 1, etc.\n\nSo, for a team x, the corresponding bit is (x-1)th bit.\n\nThus, for a match where the winner is x, the mask is (1 << (x-1)).\n\nSo, for phase 0, each match j has a mask of (1 << (winner-1)).\n\nNow, for phase 1, each match j is composed of two matches from phase 0: 2j and 2j+1.\n\nFor each such j in phase 1, we need to consider all possible a in phase0[2j] and b in phase0[2j+1], and compute the winner based on s[1].\n\nSo, for each a and b, if s[1] is '0', the winner is min(a, b). Else, it's max(a, b).\n\nWe need to collect all possible winners for this match.\n\nBut wait, for each a and b, the winner is either a or b, depending on the rule.\n\nThus, for phase1[j], the possible winners are the union of all a and b where a is a possible winner of phase0[2j], b is a possible winner of phase0[2j+1], and the rule is applied.\n\nBut if the rule is '0', then the winner is min(a, b), which could be either a or b.\n\nSimilarly for '1'.\n\nWait, no. Because if the rule is '0', the winner is the lower of a and b. So, for a particular a and b, the winner is fixed.\n\nBut across all possible a and b, the possible winners can vary.\n\nWait, but phase0[2j] has a set of possible winners, and phase0[2j+1] has a set of possible winners. For each a in phase0[2j], and each b in phase0[2j+1], the winner is either a or b, depending on the rule.\n\nThus, for phase1[j], the possible winners are the union of all possible winners for all combinations of a and b.\n\nSo, for phase1[j], the possible winners are the union of {min(a, b) if s[1] is '0' else max(a, b) for a in A, b in B}, where A is the possible winners of phase0[2j], and B is the possible winners of phase0[2j+1}.\n\nThus, for each j in phase1, the possible winners can be computed as follows:\n\nmask = 0\n\nfor a in phase0[2j]:\n\n   for b in phase0[2j+1]:\n\n       if s[1] == '0':\n\n           w = min(a, b)\n\n       else:\n\n           w = max(a, b)\n\n       mask |= (1 << (w-1))\n\nphase1[j] = mask\n\nBut wait, for each a and b, the winner is either a or b. So, for all possible combinations, the possible winners are the union of a and b, subject to the rule.\n\nWait, but this approach is O(4^{k}), where k is the number of possible winners in each phase. For n=18, 2^18 is 262,144, but the masks can have up to 2^18 bits, which is manageable.\n\nBut even for phase1, if each of phase0's matches has 2 possible winners, then phase1 could have up to 4 possible winners per match.\n\nWait, but for phase0, each match has exactly one possible winner (because s[0] is fixed as either 0 or 1, leading to either the lower or higher team being the winner). So, phase0 has 2^{n-1} matches, each with a single possible winner.\n\nThus, for phase1, each match j is composed of two phase0 matches, each with a single possible winner. So, phase1[j] will have either one or two possible winners, depending on the rule s[1].\n\nFor example, if s[1] is '0', then for a phase1 match j composed of phase0 matches a and b (with a and b being the fixed winners of those phase0 matches), the winner is min(a, b), which could be a or b.\n\nSimilarly, if s[1] is '1', the winner is max(a, b).\n\nThus, phase1[j] can have either one or two possible winners.\n\nThis suggests that for each phase, the number of possible winners per match can grow exponentially, but perhaps with the constraints of the phase's rule, it's manageable.\n\nBut for higher phases, the number of possible winners can increase significantly.\n\nWait, but for each phase, the number of matches is 2^{n-i}, and for each match, the possible winners are a subset of 2^{n-i} teams. So, for n=18, the number of possible winners per match could be up to 2^{n-i}, which for i=0 is 2^17=131072. But for n=18, the total number of matches is 2^18-1, which is 262,143. That's a lot, but each phase's matches are processed in order.\n\nBut wait, for each phase i, the number of matches is 2^{n-i}, and each match can have up to 2^{n-i} possible winners. But this would make the total possible winners across all matches very high, which could be computationally expensive.\n\nHmm, this suggests",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all possible winning integers x such that there exists a permutation of team skills where team x wins the tournament. The tournament structure is defined by a series of matches in phases, each with specific rules for determining the winner of each match.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament can be viewed as a binary tree where each node represents a match. The leaves of the tree are the initial matches in phase 0, and each internal node represents a match in a higher phase composed of two sub-matches from the previous phase.\n2. **Phase Processing**: Each phase has a rule (given by the string `s`) that determines the winner of each match in that phase. For each phase, we process each match to determine the possible winners based on the winners of the two sub-matches from the previous phase.\n3. **Bitmask Representation**: Use bitmasks to efficiently track which teams can win each match. Each bit in an integer represents whether a particular team can be a winner.\n4. **Recursive Processing**: Starting from the initial matches (phase 0), compute the possible winners for each subsequent phase until the root of the tree (the final match) is reached. The possible winners of the root match are the potential champions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    phase_matches = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        m = 2 ** (n - i)\n        phase_matches.append([0] * m)\n    \n    # Initialize phase 0\n    for j in range(2 ** (n-1)):\n        a = 2 * j + 1\n        b = 2 * j + 2\n        if s[0] == '0':\n            winner = min(a, b)\n        else:\n            winner = max(a, b)\n        phase_matches[0][j] = 1 << (winner - 1)\n    \n    # Process each phase from 1 to n-1\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        current_phase = i\n        prev_phase = current_phase - 1\n        m_prev = len(phase_matches[prev_phase])\n        m_current = m_prev // 2\n        for j in range(m_current):\n            left_idx = 2 * j\n            right_idx = 2 * j + 1\n            left_mask = phase_matches[prev_phase][left_idx]\n            right_mask = phase_matches[prev_phase][right_idx]\n            if s[i] == '0':\n                # Winner is min of any a and b\n                min_mask = 0\n                a_teams = [k+1 for k in range(64) if (left_mask & (1 << k))]\n                b_teams = [k+1 for k in range(64) if (right_mask & (1 << k))]\n                for a in a_teams:\n                    for b in b_teams:\n                        w = min(a, b)\n                        min_mask |= 1 << (w - 1)\n                phase_matches[i][j] = min_mask\n            else:\n                # Winner is max of any a and b\n                max_mask = 0\n                a_teams = [k+1 for k in range(64) if (left_mask & (1 << k))]\n                b_teams = [k+1 for k in range(64) if (right_mask & (1 << k))]\n                for a in a_teams:\n                    for b in b_teams:\n                        w = max(a, b)\n                        max_mask |= 1 << (w - 1)\n                phase_matches[i][j] = max_mask\n    \n    root_mask = phase_matches[n-1][0]\n    winning_teams = []\n    for x in range(1, 2**n):\n        if (root_mask >> (x-1)) & 1:\n            winning_teams.append(x)\n    \n    # Group the results as per the output format\n    result = []\n    index = 0\n    while index < len(winning_teams):\n        count = min(len(winning_teams) - index, 2**18)\n        result.append(' '.join(map(str, winning_teams[index:index+count])))\n        index += count\n    \n    print('\\n'.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Read the input values and initialize the structure to store possible winners for each match in each phase.\n2. **Phase 0 Processing**: Determine the possible winners for each match in phase 0 based on the given rule.\n3. **Subsequent Phases**: For each subsequent phase, compute the possible winners for each match by considering the winners of the two sub-matches from the previous phase and applying the current phase's rule.\n4. **Bitmask Operations**: Use bitwise operations to efficiently track possible winners using bitmasks.\n5. **Result Compilation**: After processing all phases, collect the possible winners for the root match and format the output accordingly.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each phase using dynamic programming and bitwise operations, ensuring that the solution handles the constraints effectively.",
