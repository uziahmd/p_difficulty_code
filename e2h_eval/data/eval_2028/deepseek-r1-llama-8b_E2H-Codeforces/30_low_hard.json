Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"TV Game,\" and from the description, I need to find a sequence of moves for Homer and Marge that maximizes their total prize. \n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step. The game involves two players taking turns picking digits from a string A. Each player makes exactly n moves. On each turn, the current player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their number. Then that digit is removed from A. Initially, both S1 and S2 are empty. At the end, S1 gives Homer some dollars, and S2 gives Marge some. We need to maximize the sum of these two numbers.\n\nWait, but how do we determine the maximum sum? Oh right, because the order in which the digits are picked affects the numerical values of S1 and S2. So our goal is to assign digits to either Homer or Marge in such a way that when we compute S1 and S2 as numbers, their sum is as large as possible.\n\nHmm, but how do I model this? Because the choice at each step affects the future choices. It feels like a dynamic programming problem where the state depends on how many digits have been taken so far and the current state of A.\n\nLet me think: since each move alternates between the players, the decision at each step is whether the next digit goes to the current player or not. But wait, no—since the players alternate, after each move, the next player is determined. So the sequence is fixed in terms of whose turn it is based on the move count.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that before each turn, the players determine who will make the next move. So perhaps the players can choose who goes next, but each must make exactly n moves. Hmm, that complicates things. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nAh, right: Before each turn, players determine who will make the next move. So they can choose to switch or not. But each must make exactly n moves. So the selection of who plays when affects the assignment of digits.\n\nWait, that seems tricky. Because the players can choose to let the other play next. So the order of players isn't fixed; it's determined by their choices each time. So the problem is to arrange the sequence of H and M such that each occurs exactly n times, and the resulting S1 and S2 (interpreted as numbers) sum to the maximum possible.\n\nSo the key is to decide, for each digit in A, whether it's assigned to S1 or S2, with the constraint that exactly n digits go to each. But also, the order in which they are added matters because the leading digits contribute more to the number.\n\nSo the first digit contributes 10^(n-1) to S1 if assigned to him, depending on when it's taken. Similarly for S2.\n\nBut the problem is that the order in which the digits are taken affects the place value of each digit. For example, if a higher digit comes earlier, it contributes more to the total sum.\n\nSo the optimal strategy would be to assign the highest available digits to the earliest possible positions in either S1 or S2, ensuring that each gets exactly n digits.\n\nWait, but how to balance the assignment between S1 and S2 to maximize the sum. Because each digit's contribution is based on its position in the respective S's number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal approach is to sort all the digits in descending order and then assign them alternately to S1 and S2. But that might not always work because the order in which they're taken from the original string A is fixed. We can't rearrange the digits; we can only take the leftmost digit each time.\n\nWait, no. The digits are taken from A in the given order. So the initial A is a string, and each step we remove the first character. So the order of digits is fixed as per the input. So the problem isn't about selecting digits in any order, but about deciding for each digit whether it goes to S1 or S2, subject to the fact that each player must make exactly n moves.\n\nBut how? Because the assignment of a digit to S1 or S2 depends on when it's taken. For example, the first digit is taken by the first player, the second by the second, and so on, but the players can choose to swap turns after each move.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify: the players determine who makes the next move before each turn. So the initial player is either H or M, but after each turn, the next player is chosen by them.\n\nBut the problem requires that each player makes exactly n moves. So the sequence of turns must consist of exactly 2n steps, with exactly n H and n M, but the order of H and M can vary, as",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for two players, Homer and Marge, to maximize their total prize in a TV game. The game involves taking turns to pick digits from a given string, with each player making exactly `n` moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of the numbers formed by the digits each player accumulates.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - The problem can be modeled as a dynamic programming (DP) problem where the state depends on the number of digits taken so far and the current state of the remaining digits.\n   - Each move alternates between the two players, but the order of play can be controlled by the players themselves, allowing them to switch turns as needed.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming State**:\n   - Use a DP table `dp[i][j][k]` where `i` represents the number of digits taken so far, `j` represents the number of digits assigned to Homer, and `k` represents the number of digits assigned to Marge.\n   - The value of `dp[i][j][k]` will store the maximum possible sum achievable with `i` digits taken, `j` digits assigned to Homer, and `k` digits assigned to Marge.\n\n3. **Transition**:\n   - For each digit, decide whether it should go to Homer or Marge based on the current state of the DP table.\n   - Update the DP table accordingly to keep track of the maximum possible sum.\n\n4. **Optimization**:\n   - Use memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant computations.\n   - Convert the problem into a decision-making process where each digit is assigned optimally to either player to maximize the sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # We'll represent the state as (position, h, m), where h is the number of digits assigned to H, m to M\n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(pos, h, m):\n        if pos == 2 * n:\n            return 0\n        res = 0\n        current_digit = A[pos]\n        # Assign current_digit to either H or M\n        # Option 1: assign to H\n        option1 = 0\n        if h < n:\n            # Compute the value if this digit is added to H's number\n            option1 = int(current_digit) * (10 ** (n - (h + 1)))\n            # Recurse for the next position\n            option1 += dp(pos + 1, h + 1, m)\n        # Option 2: assign to M\n        option2 = 0\n        if m < n:\n            option2 = int(current_digit) * (10 ** (n - (m + 1)))\n            option2 += dp(pos + 1, h, m + 1)\n        # Choose the better option\n        return max(option1, option2)\n    \n    # Now, we also need to determine the order of H and M assignments to maximize the sum,\n    # but the initial approach only computes the maximum sum.
