    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The task is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about the examples they gave. For 'abcd', the output is 0. That makes sense because all substrings are unique since each character is different. For 'ababa', the output is 3. Looking at it, the substring 'aba' appears at positions 0-2 and 2-4, right? So that's two occurrences. And for 'zzz', the output is 2 because 'zz' appears twice, overlapping in the middle.\n\nSo the approach here is to check all possible substrings, starting from the longest possible down to length 1, and see if any of them appear more than once. Once we find the maximum such length, we return it.\n\nHow do I implement this efficiently?\n\nFirst, I need to consider all possible substrings of the string. But checking every possible substring directly might be time-consuming, but since the maximum string length is 100, it's manageable.\n\nI think the way to go is to loop through possible substring lengths from the largest possible down to 1. For each length l, check all possible substrings of that length. If any substring appears again, then l is our answer.\n\nWait, but how to check if a substring appears more than once. Maybe for each l, generate all substrings of length l, store them in a set or a dictionary, and see if adding a new one already exists. If yes, return l as the answer.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Iterate l from len(s) -1 down to 1 (since for a string of length n, the maximum possible substring that can appear at least twice must have a length of at most n-1, like in the case of 'aaaaa' where the entire string minus one character can appear multiple times).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the maximum possible substring that appears at least twice can be up to the entire string. Wait, no. Because for example, in a string of length 5, the entire string is of length 5. It can appear only once. So the maximum possible l is 4, because a substring of length 4 could appear twice, like in 'ababa' where 'aba' is length 3 and appears twice.\n\nWait, let me correct that. For a string of length n, the maximum possible l is n-1. Because the substring of length n-1 can appear twice, each starting at position 0 and 1, for example, in a string like 'abab'.\n\nWait, in 'abab', the substring 'aba' starts at 0 and 1, so length 3. So for a string of length 5, the maximum possible l is 4? Or 5?\n\nWait, no. Let's take 'aaaaa' as an example. Substrings of length 5 are just the whole string, which appears once. So for l=5, it's not possible. But for l=4, substrings are 'aaaa' starting at 0 and 1. So l=4 is possible.\n\nSo for any string s, the maximum possible l is len(s)-1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in a string of length n, the maximum possible l is n-1 because you can't have a substring longer than that appearing more than once unless it's the same substring. Wait, no, maybe. Let me think: suppose the string is 'abcde'. The maximum possible l is 4, but in that case, is there a substring of length 4 that appears at least twice? No, because all are unique. So for a string with all unique substrings of length l, we can't have a higher l.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop l from the maximum possible (n-1) down to 1.\n\nFor each l, collect all substrings of length l. If any substring occurs more than once, return l as the answer.\n\nOnce found, we can break and return l.\n\nIf after checking all l down to 1, none satisfy, return 0.\n\nWait, but wait: for l = len(s), the substring is the entire string. It can only occur once, so for l = len(s), the answer is 0. But since we start from l = len(s)-1, that's taken care of.\n\nSo let's outline the code.\n\nRead the input string.\n\nCompute the maximum possible l as len(s) - 1.\n\nFor l in range(max_l, 0, -1):\n\n    create a set to keep track of substrings.\n\n    for i in range(0, len(s) - l + 1):\n\n        current_sub = s[i:i+l]\n\n        if current_sub is already in the set:\n\n            return l\n\n        else:\n\n            add it to the set\n\n    continue\n\nAfter all l's are checked, return 0.\n\nWait, but wait: in the loop, for each l, we process all possible starting positions. For each substring, we check if it's in the set. If it is, we return l. Otherwise, add it to the set.\n\nWait, but wait: for a particular l, the first occurrence is added to the set. Then, when another occurrence comes, it will be detected.\n\nBut wait, the loop is from 0 to len(s) - l. So for i=0, i=1, etc., each substring is considered.\n\nSo for example, in 'ababa', for l=3, the substrings are:\n\ni=0: 'aba'\n\ni=1: 'bab'\n\ni=2: 'aba'\n\nWhen i=0, 'aba' is added to the set.\n\nAt i=2, 'aba' is generated again. At that point, we detect that it's already in the set, so return l=3.\n\nThat works.\n\nNow, what about the case where the same substring occurs in different positions but the code doesn't catch it. Wait, no, because for each l, we're checking all substrings and using a set, so any duplicate will be caught.\n\nSo the code structure is:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nmax_len = len(s) - 1\n\nfor l in range(max_len, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(len(s) - l + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(l)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but wait: what about the case where the maximum possible l is len(s)-1, but for some reason, no substring of that length repeats. So the code will proceed to l-1, and so on.\n\nThis seems solid.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\nTest case 1: 'abcd' has len 4. max_len is 3.\n\nCheck l=3:\n\nsubstrings are 'abc', 'bcd'. Are they duplicates? No. So proceed.\n\nl=2: substrings 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'. All unique.\n\nl=1: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' — all unique. So output is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nTest case 2: 'ababa' len is 5. max_len is 4.\n\nCheck l=4: substrings are 'abab', 'baba' — no duplicates.\n\nl=3: first substr is 'aba' (i=0). Add to set. Next, i=1: 'bab' not in set. i=2: 'aba' — already in set. So return 3. Correct.\n\nTest case 3: 'zzz' len 3. max_len is 2.\n\nCheck l=2: substrings are 'zz' (i=0) and 'zz' (i=1). So when i=0, add to set. When i=1, substr is 'zz', which is in the set. So return 2.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa' len 5.\n\nmax_len is 4.\n\nCheck l=4:\n\nsubstrings 'aaaa' (i=0), 'aaaa' (i=1). So when i=0, add to set. When i=1, substr is 'aaaa' which is present. So return 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'ababab' len 6.\n\nmax_len is 5.\n\nCheck l=5: substrings are 'ababa', 'baban' — no duplicates.\n\nl=4: substrings 'abab', 'baba', 'abab' (i=2). So when i=0, add 'abab'; i=2: substr is 'abab' — in set. Return 4.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about a string where the maximum is 1? Like 'abba'.\n\nWait, 'abba' — for l=3, substrings are 'abb' and 'bba' — no duplicates.\n\nl=2: 'ab', 'bb', 'ba'.\n\n'bb' appears once, others are unique.\n\nl=1: 'a', 'b', 'b', 'a' — both 'a's and 'b's appear at least twice. So the maximum is 1.\n\nSo the code would check l=3, then 2, then 1. For l=1, the substrings are 'a', 'b', 'b', 'a'. When i=0, 'a' is added. i=1: 'b' added. i=2: 'b' is in set, so return 1.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about a string of length 1? According to the input constraints, the string is non-empty, but its length can be 1. So in that case, max_len is 0. So the loop from 0 down to 1 won't run, and the code returns 0. Which is correct because the substring is only once.\n\nAnother edge case: empty string. But according to the problem statement, the string is non-empty, so no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: two same characters, e.g., 'aa' — len 2. max_len is 1.\n\nCheck l=1: 'a' appears twice. So return 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given a string and need to find the longest substring that appears at least twice. The key insight is to check substrings of decreasing lengths starting from the maximum possible down to 1. This ensures that we find the longest valid substring as soon as possible.\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible length `l` (starting from the maximum possible, which is the length of the string minus one), we generate all substrings of that length and check if any of them appear more than once. If we find such a substring, we return its length immediately.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a brute-force approach with a slight optimization by checking substrings from the longest possible length downwards. This allows us to exit early as soon as we find the longest valid substring.\n4. **Complexity Consideration**: Given the constraints (string length up to 100), the brute-force approach is efficient enough. For each length `l`, we check all possible substrings, which results in a time complexity of O(n^2) for the worst case, where n is the length of the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nmax_len = len(s) - 1\n\nfor l in range(max_len, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize `max_len` to the length of the string minus one, as the longest possible substring that can appear at least twice must be shorter than the entire string.\n3. **Loop Over Lengths**: We loop over possible substring lengths from `max_len` down to 1.\n4. **Check Substrings**: For each length `l`, we generate all substrings of that length and store them in a set. If a substring is found in the set more than once, we print the length `l` and exit.\n5. **Output Result**: If no valid substring is found after checking all lengths down to 1, we print 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring by leveraging a set to track seen substrings and exiting early upon finding the first occurrence of a duplicate.",
