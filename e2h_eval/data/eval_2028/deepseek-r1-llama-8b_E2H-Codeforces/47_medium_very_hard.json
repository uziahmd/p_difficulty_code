    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Neko does Maths\" and the task is to find a non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple (LCM) of a+k and b+k is as small as possible. If there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, I have to choose the smallest one.\n\nHmm. So, given two integers a and b, I need to compute this k. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem with some examples. Like the sample input: 6 and 10. When k=2, 6+2=8 and 10+2=12. The LCM is 24. But why is that the best? Let's see if other k's give a better result.\n\nFor k=0: 6 and 10. LCM is 30.\nk=1: 7 and 11, LCM is 77.\nk=2: 8 and 12, LCM 24.\nk=3: 9 and 13, LCM 117.\nSo yes, 24 is the smallest here.\n\nAnother sample is 5 and 10. Choosing k=0 gives 5 and 10, whose LCM is 10. Which is the smallest possible because any higher k would make them larger, but wait, maybe not. Let me check:\n\nk=0: 5 and 10 → LCM 10.\nk=1: 6 and 11 → LCM 66.\nk=2: 7 and 12 → LCM 84.\nSo yes, k=0 is best.\n\nWait, but what about when a and b are equal? Like a = b = x. Then, for any k, a+k = b+k = x +k. So their LCM is x+k. To minimize this, we should choose k=0, since any larger k would increase the value.\n\nSo, the first thing I notice is that when a == b, the answer is k=0.\n\nBut when a != b, things get more interesting.\n\nLet me think about the properties of LCM. Remember that LCM(a, b) = (a*b)/GCD(a,b). So, the LCM depends on the product of the two numbers and their GCD.\n\nIn our problem, the two numbers after adding k are a +k and b +k. Let me denote d = GCD(a, b). Then, a = d * m, b = d * n, where m and n are coprime (since we divided by the GCD).\n\nSo, a + k = d*m +k, b +k = d*n +k. Let's compute their GCD.\n\nWhat's the GCD of (d*m +k) and (d*n +k)? Hmm, let's subtract them: (d*m +k) - (d*n +k) = d*(m -n). So, the GCD of (d*m +k) and (d*n +k) must divide d*(m -n). Also, since (d*m +k) and (d*n +k) share a GCD that also divides both terms, it's possible that the GCD is a divisor of d*(m -n), but perhaps also influenced by other factors.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to think about the difference between a and b. Let's see: (a +k) and (b +k) have a difference of (a - b). Because (a +k) - (b +k) = a - b. So, the difference is fixed as (a - b), but wait no—wait, no, because a and b are given, so their difference is fixed. Wait, no: when you add k to both, their difference remains the same as a - b.\n\nSo, the two numbers a +k and b +k differ by (a - b). So, the GCD of these two numbers must divide their difference, which is (a - b). Therefore, the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) is a divisor of |a - b|.\n\nThat's an important observation. So, the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) is a divisor of the absolute difference of a and b. Let's denote g = GCD(a, b). Then, the difference is |a - b|. Let me denote s = a - b (but since GCD is always positive, perhaps taking the absolute value into account is needed).\n\nSo, the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) must be a divisor of |a - b|.\n\nThis suggests that the optimal k is such that the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) is as large as possible, which in turn would minimize the LCM, since LCM is proportional to (a +k)*(b +k)/g, where g is the GCD.\n\nWait, because LCM(x, y) = x*y / GCD(x,y). So, to minimize LCM, we can maximize the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k), or equivalently, maximize the GCD.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding a k such that GCD(a +k, b +k) is as large as possible. Because a larger GCD will lead to a smaller LCM.\n\nBut how do we find such a k?\n\nLet me think about it differently. Let me denote d = GCD(a +k, b +k). Then, d must divide (a +k) and (b +k). So, d must also divide their difference, which is (a - b). So, d is a divisor of |a - b|.\n\nMoreover, since d is a divisor of |a - b|, the maximum possible d is |a - b|, but only if a +k and b +k are multiples of |a -b|. Or, more precisely, if |a -b| divides both (a +k) and (b +k), which is equivalent to |a -b| dividing (a +k) - (b +k) = a -b, which is already true.\n\nWait, no. Because (a +k) and (b +k) have a GCD that divides their difference, which is a -b (assuming a >= b). So, the GCD is a divisor of (a -b).\n\nSo, the possible values of d are the divisors of (a - b). So, to maximize d, we can look for the largest possible divisor of (a -b) such that (a +k) is divisible by d.\n\nBecause then, (b +k) will automatically be divisible by d as well.\n\nSo, the approach is: find all the divisors of (a -b), including 1 and the number itself. For each such divisor d, in descending order, check whether there exists a k >=0 such that (a +k) mod d == 0. Then, among all possible d's, the one that gives the maximum d (so that the LCM is minimized) is our target.\n\nWait, but how do we find such a k for each d?\n\nLet me consider d as a divisor of (a -b). Then, (a +k) must be divisible by d. So, (a +k) mod d == 0 → k ≡ (-a) mod d. So, k can be written as k = t*d - a', where a' is a mod d.\n\nWait, maybe another way: Let me express k as k = (d - a mod d) mod d. Because a +k must be divisible by d. So, k = (d - (a % d)) % d. But wait, that may not always be correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the congruence equation: (a +k) ≡ 0 mod d → k ≡ (-a) mod d. So, the smallest non-negative k satisfying this is k0 = (-a) mod d.\n\nBut wait, if a mod d is zero, then k0 is zero.\n\nSo, for each divisor d of (a -b), we can compute the required k0, which is (d - (a % d)) % d. Then, we need to see if this k0 makes (b +k0) divisible by d as well.\n\nWait, because d is a divisor of (a -b), then (a -b) is divisible by d. So, (a +k0) is divisible by d, and (b +k0) = (a +k0) - (a - b) + (b +k0) ? Wait, no, perhaps better to note that since (a -b) is divisible by d, and (a +k0) is divisible by d, then (b +k0) is also divisible by d.\n\nYes, because (b +k0) = (a +k0) - (a - b) → since both a +k0 and a -b are divisible by d, their difference (b +k0) is also divisible by d.\n\nSo, for each d that divides (a -b), the k0 is (d - (a % d)) % d. And this k0 ensures that both (a +k0) and (b +k0) are divisible by d.\n\nSo, for each such d, the maximum possible d is the best option because it will give the minimal LCM.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the difference s = a - b. Take absolute value, since we're considering divisors.\n\nWait, no, because a could be less than b, but s could be negative. However, since we're considering all divisors of |a -b|, it doesn't matter. So, s = abs(a - b).\n\n2. Find all the divisors of s.\n\n3. For each divisor d (sorted in descending order), compute k0 = (d - (a % d)) % d.\n\n4. Check if k0 is non-negative. Since (d - (a %d )) %d is always non-negative.\n\n5. For each such k0, compute the LCM of (a +k0) and (b +k0). The minimal LCM across all possible d's is the desired one.\n\n6. Among all d's that give the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nWait, but how? Because for different d's, the k0 might vary, but perhaps the same LCM can be achieved with different d's.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Enumerate all possible d's, which are the divisors of s = |a -b|.\n\n- For each d, compute k0 as (d - a mod d) mod d. This is the minimal k for which (a +k0) is divisible by d.\n\n- Then, compute the LCM of (a +k0) and (b +k0). Since both are divisible by d, the GCD is at least d. So, the LCM would be (a +k0)*(b +k0) / GCD(a +k0, b +k0), but since GCD is at least d, the LCM could be as low as (something based on d).\n\nWait, but since d is a divisor of s, and s is a -b, and since a +k0 and b +k0 are both multiples of d, their GCD is exactly d multiplied by some other factors. Hmm, not sure.\n\nBut regardless, for each d, compute the corresponding k0 and then the LCM.\n\nWe need to track the minimal LCM found and the corresponding k0. Among those, if multiple k0's give the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest k0.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\nCompute s = abs(a - b)\nIf s is zero:\n    return k = 0\nElse:\n    Generate all divisors of s in descending order\n    For each divisor d:\n        k0 = (d - (a % d)) % d\n        compute current_lcm = LCM(a +k0, b +k0)\n        keep track of the minimal current_lcm and the minimal k0 if current_lcm is the same.\n    After checking all d's, return the minimal k0.\n\nBut wait, what about d=1? Well, that's always a divisor, so the loop will handle that.\n\nBut generating all divisors of s can be time-consuming if s is large, but s can be up to 1e9, so the number of divisors is manageable.\n\nWait, but s can be up to 1e9. What is the maximum number of divisors a number can have? For 1e9, which is 2^9*5^9, the number of divisors is (9+1)^2=100. So, even for s=1e9, the number of divisors is manageable.\n\nSo, the key steps are:\n\n1. Compute s = abs(a - b)\n\n2. If s is zero, output k=0.\n\n3. Else, generate all the divisors of s.\n\n4. Sort the divisors in descending order.\n\n5. For each d in this sorted list:\n\n   a. Compute k0 = (d - (a mod d)) % d.\n\n   b. Compute x = a + k0, y = b + k0.\n\n   c. Compute current_gcd = GCD(x, y). Since d is a divisor of s = |x - y|, the GCD(x, y) is at least d? Or no, because x and y could have a larger GCD.\n\n   Wait, no. Because x and y are (a +k0) and (b +k0). Since d is a divisor of x and y, the GCD of x and y must be at least d. But it could be larger if x and y have a common factor beyond d.\n\n   So, the current_gcd could be larger than d, which would affect the LCM.\n\n   Hmm, this complicates things. Because when we choose d, the k0 ensures that x and y are both divisible by d, but their GCD could be higher.\n\n   So, the initial approach of trying to find d as a divisor of s and choosing the maximum possible d may not directly lead to the minimal LCM.\n\n   Because sometimes, a larger d may result in a higher GCD, leading to a lower LCM.\n\n   So, perhaps the initial approach is insufficient.\n\n   Hmm, so this requires a rethink.\n\n   Let me think about the problem differently. The LCM of x and y is (x * y) / GCD(x, y). To minimize this, we need to maximize GCD(x, y) and possibly minimize x and y.\n\n   So, perhaps the optimal k is such that x and y have the highest possible GCD.\n\n   How can we achieve that?\n\n   Let's see, the GCD of x and y is the same as the GCD of x and (y - x) since y - x is a constant (s = a - b, which is fixed).\n\n   Because GCD(x, y) = GCD(x, y - x).\n\n   So, for x = a +k, y = b +k, y -x = s.\n\n   So, GCD(x, y) = GCD(x, s).\n\n   But x = a +k, so GCD(a +k, s).\n\n   So, the GCD is the same as the GCD of (a +k) and s.\n\n   So, to maximize this, we want (a +k) to share as many factors with s as possible.\n\n   So, the optimal k is such that a +k is a multiple of a divisor of s.\n\n   So, the approach is to find a k such that a +k is divisible by a divisor of s, and we pick the divisor that maximizes the GCD, thus minimizing the LCM.\n\n   So, the process is similar to the earlier approach, but perhaps considering all possible divisors of s, and for each, compute the required k, then compute the LCM.\n\n   So, the plan is:\n\n   For each divisor d of s:\n\n       compute k0 = (d - (a % d)) % d\n\n       x = a +k0\n\n       y = b +k0\n\n       current_gcd = GCD(x, y) → which is GCD(x, s) since y = x + s.\n\n       current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n\n       track the minimal current_lcm and the smallest k0 that achieves it.\n\n   Additionally, we have to consider k=0, which corresponds to d=1. So, perhaps including all divisors is the way to go.\n\n   Wait, but what about cases where s is zero? Then, a and b are equal. So, the LCM is just a +k, which is minimized when k=0.\n\n   So, the plan is:\n\n   - Compute s = |a - b|.\n\n   - If s is zero: return k=0.\n\n   - Else: generate all the divisors of s, including 1 and s.\n\n   - Sort the divisors in descending order.\n\n   - For each d in this list:\n\n       compute k0 = (d - (a %d )) %d\n\n       compute x = a +k0, y = b +k0\n\n       compute current_gcd = GCD(x, y)\n\n       current_lcm = (x*y) // current_gcd\n\n       compare with the current minimal lcm and k0.\n\n   - After processing all d's, select the minimal current_lcm, and among those, the smallest k0.\n\n   So, the algorithm involves:\n\n   1. Finding all the divisors of s.\n\n   2. For each d, compute k0 and the resulting LCM.\n\n   3. Choose the k0 that gives the smallest LCM, and if tie, the smallest k0.\n\n   Now, the question is, how to implement this efficiently.\n\n   Let's outline the steps in code:\n\n   Read a and b.\n\n   Compute s = abs(a - b).\n\n   If s == 0: print 0 and exit.\n\n   Else:\n\n       Generate all divisors of s.\n\n       Sort them in descending order.\n\n       Initialize variables to track the minimal LCM and the corresponding k.\n\n       For each d in divisors:\n\n           if d is 0: continue (but s is non-zero, so d can't be zero)\n\n           k0 = (d - (a %d)) %d\n\n           x = a +k0\n\n           y = b +k0\n\n           current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n\n           current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n\n           if current_lcm is less than current_min_lcm, or if it's equal but k0 is smaller:\n\n               update current_min_lcm and current_min_k.\n\n       After all divisors, also consider k=0 (but wait, is that covered by d=1?)\n\n       Because for d=1, k0 is (1 - a%1) %1 = 0. So yes, k0=0 is considered.\n\n       So, after processing all d's, the current_min_k is the answer.\n\n   So, the main parts are:\n\n   - Generating all divisors of s.\n\n   - Iterating through them in descending order.\n\n   Now, how to generate all divisors of s.\n\n   An efficient way is to find all the prime factors of s, then generate all possible products of the exponents.\n\n   But for s up to 1e9, trial division is feasible.\n\n   So, function to find all divisors:\n\n   def get_divisors(n):\n\n       divisors = set()\n\n       i = 1\n\n       while i*i <=n:\n\n           if n%i ==0:\n\n               divisors.add(i)\n\n               divisors.add(n//i)\n\n           i +=1\n\n       return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)\n\n   Wait, but for n=0, but in our case, s is non-zero.\n\n   So, in code:\n\n   import math\n\n   a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n   s = abs(a - b)\n\n   if s ==0:\n\n       print(0)\n\n       exit()\n\n   # else, find divisors of s\n\n   def get_divisors(n):\n\n       divisors = set()\n\n       for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) +1):\n\n           if n %i ==0:\n\n               divisors.add(i)\n\n               divisors.add(n//i)\n\n       return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)\n\n   divisors = get_divisors(s)\n\n   min_lcm = float('inf')\n\n   best_k = 0\n\n   for d in divisors:\n\n       k0 = (d - (a %d )) %d\n\n       x = a + k0\n\n       y = b + k0\n\n       current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n\n       current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n\n       if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k0 < best_k):\n\n           min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n           best_k = k0\n\n   print(best_k)\n\n   Wait, but wait. Is the order of processing the divisors in descending order correct? Because for larger d's, the current_gcd could be larger, leading to smaller LCM. So, perhaps we should process the divisors in descending order to find the minimal LCM early and avoid unnecessary checks.\n\n   For example, if a larger d leads to a smaller LCM, then once we find that, we can potentially break early, but it's not guaranteed. So, perhaps processing in descending order is still necessary.\n\n   But in the code above, we are not breaking early; we process all divisors, but for each, we keep track of the minimal LCM and the best k.\n\n   So, the code seems correct.\n\n   Let me test it against the sample inputs.\n\n   Sample Input 1:\n\n   6 10 → s=4.\n\n   Divisors of 4 are 4, 2, 1.\n\n   For each d:\n\n   d=4:\n\n       k0 = (4 -6%4) mod4 → 6 mod4 is 2 → 4-2=2 mod4=2.\n\n       x=6+2=8, y=10+2=12.\n\n       GCD(8,12)=4.\n\n       LCM= (8*12)/4=24.\n\n   d=2:\n\n       k0= (2-6%2) mod2 →6 mod2 is 0 →2-0=2 mod2=0.\n\n       x=6+0=6, y=10+0=10.\n\n       GCD(6,10)=2.\n\n       LCM=6*10/2=30.\n\n   d=1:\n\n       k0= (1-6%1) mod1 →6 mod1 is 0 →1-0=1 mod1=0.\n\n       x=6+0=6, y=10+0=10.\n\n       Same as above, LCM=30.\n\n   So, the minimal LCM is 24, achieved when d=4, k=2.\n\n   So, the code returns 2. Which matches the sample.\n\n   Another sample: 21 31 → s=10.\n\n   Divisors of 10: 10,5,2,1.\n\n   Let's process each:\n\n   d=10:\n\n       k0 = (10 -21%10) mod10 →21 mod10 is 1 →10-1=9 mod10=9.\n\n       x=21+9=30, y=31+9=40.\n\n       GCD(30,40)=10.\n\n       LCM=30*40/10=120.\n\n   d=5:\n\n       k0 = (5 -21%5) mod5 →21 mod5 is 1 →5-1=4 mod5=4.\n\n       x=21+4=25, y=31+4=35.\n\n       GCD(25,35)=5.\n\n       LCM=25*35/5=175.\n\n   d=2:\n\n       k0 = (2 -21%2) mod2 →21 mod2 is 1 →2-1=1 mod2=1.\n\n       x=22, y=32.\n\n       GCD(22,32)=2.\n\n       LCM=22*32/2= 352.\n\n   d=1:\n\n       k0= (1 -21%1) mod1 →0.\n\n       x=21, y=31.\n\n       GCD=1.\n\n       LCM=21*31=651.\n\n   So, the minimal is 120, achieved with d=10, k=9.\n\n   Which matches the sample.\n\n   Third sample:5 10 → s=5.\n\n   Divisors of 5:5,1.\n\n   d=5:\n\n       k0= (5 -5%5) mod5 →5 mod5=0 →5-0=5 mod5=0.\n\n       x=5+0=5, y=10+0=10.\n\n       GCD(5,10)=5.\n\n       LCM=5*10/5=10.\n\n   d=1:\n\n       k0=0.\n\n       same as above.\n\n   So, minimal LCM is 10, k=0.\n\n   Which matches the sample.\n\n   Now, what about edge cases?\n\n   Case where a=1, b=2.\n\n   s=1.\n\n   Divisors:1.\n\n   k0= (1 -1%1) mod1=0.\n\n   x=1, y=2. LCM=2.\n\n   So, output is 0.\n\n   Another case: a=3, b=6.\n\n   s=3.\n\n   Divisors:3,1.\n\n   For d=3:\n\n       k0=(3 -3%3) mod3=0.\n\n       x=3, y=6.\n\n       GCD=3. LCM=6.\n\n   For d=1:\n\n       same.\n\n   So, k=0.\n\n   Another case: a=4, b=6 → s=2.\n\n   Divisors:2,1.\n\n   d=2:\n\n       a mod2=0 →k0= (2-0) mod2=0.\n\n       x=4, y=6.\n\n       GCD=2. LCM=12/2=6.\n\n   d=1:\n\n       same.\n\n   So, minimal LCM is 6.\n\n   Now, another case where multiple d's can give same LCM but different k's.\n\n   Let me think of a scenario.\n\n   Suppose a=8, b=12. s=4.\n\n   Divisors:4,2,1.\n\n   For d=4:\n\n       k0= (4 -8%4) mod4 →8 mod4=0 →4-0=4 mod4=0.\n\n       x=8, y=12. GCD=4, LCM= (8*12)/4=24.\n\n   For d=2:\n\n       k0= (2 -8%2) mod2 →8 mod2=0 →2-0=2 mod2=0.\n\n       x=8, y=12 → same as above. LCM=24.\n\n   So, both d=4 and d=2 give the same LCM, but k=0.\n\n   So, the code would choose k=0.\n\n   Wait, but what if another d gives a different k but same LCM.\n\n   Let me construct such a case.\n\n   Suppose a=7, b=14.\n\n   s=7.\n\n   Divisors:7,1.\n\n   For d=7:\n\n       k0= (7 -7%7) mod7 →0.\n\n       x=7, y=14 → GCD=7. LCM=14.\n\n   For d=1:\n\n       same.\n\n   So, minimal LCM is 14, k=0.\n\n   Another case: a=12, b=18. s=6.\n\n   Divisors:6,3,2,1.\n\n   For d=6:\n\n       k0= (6 -12%6) mod6 →0.\n\n       x=12, y=18 → GCD=6. LCM=36.\n\n   For d=3:\n\n       k0= (3 -12%3) mod3 →0.\n\n       x=12, y=18 → GCD=6. LCM=36.\n\n   So, both d=6 and d=3 give same LCM, but same k=0.\n\n   So, the code would correctly return k=0.\n\n   Another case: a=2, b=6. s=4.\n\n   Divisors:4,2,1.\n\n   d=4:\n\n       k0= (4 -2%4) mod4 →2 mod4 is 2 →4-2=2 mod4=2.\n\n       x=4, y=8 → GCD=4. LCM=32/4=8.\n\n   d=2:\n\n       k0= (2 -2%2) mod2 →0.\n\n       x=2, y=6 → GCD=2. LCM=6.\n\n   Oh, wait. So, for d=2, the LCM is 6, which is better than d=4's 8.\n\n   So, in this case, processing d=4 first, the code would set min_lcm=8, best_k=2.\n\n   Then, processing d=2, compute LCM=6, which is better. So, min_lcm becomes 6, best_k=0.\n\n   So, the code correctly finds that k=0 is better.\n\n   So, the code seems to handle that.\n\n   So, the code seems solid.\n\n   Now, let's think about the code.\n\n   Wait, in the code, for each d, we compute k0 as (d - a mod d) mod d. But is that correct?\n\n   Because (a +k0) mod d should be 0.\n\n   So, k0 is the minimal non-negative integer such that (a +k0) is divisible by d.\n\n   So, yes, k0 = (-a) mod d. Which is (d - (a %d )) %d.\n\n   That part is correct.\n\n   Now, another test case: a=9, b=15.\n\n   s=6.\n\n   Divisors:6,3,2,1.\n\n   For d=6:\n\n       k0= (6 -9%6) mod6 →9 mod6=3 →6-3=3 mod6=3.\n\n       x=12, y=18 → GCD=6 → LCM= 36.\n\n   For d=3:\n\n       k0= (3 -9%3) mod3 →0.\n\n       x=9, y=15 → GCD=3 → LCM= 45.\n\n   So, d=6 gives better LCM.\n\n   So, the code correctly chooses k=3.\n\n   Now, another test case where a=5, b=7. s=2.\n\n   Divisors:2,1.\n\n   For d=2:\n\n       k0= (2 -5%2) mod2 →5 mod2=1 →2-1=1 mod2=1.\n\n       x=6, y=8 → GCD=2 → LCM=24.\n\n   For d=1:\n\n       k0=0.\n\n       x=5, y=7 → GCD=1 → LCM=35.\n\n   So, the code chooses k=1.\n\n   So, correct.\n\n   So, the code works for these cases.\n\n   Now, what about when s is a prime number, like s=3.\n\n   a=1, b=4.\n\n   s=3.\n\n   Divisors:3,1.\n\n   d=3:\n\n       k0= (3 -1%3) mod3 →1 mod3 is 1 →3-1=2 mod3=2.\n\n       x=3, y=6 → GCD=3 → LCM=6.\n\n   d=1:\n\n       k0=0.\n\n       x=1, y=4 → GCD=1 → LCM=4.\n\n   So, the code would choose k=0, because LCM is 4, which is less than 6.\n\n   So, yes.\n\n   So, the code correctly finds that for d=1, the LCM is 4, which is better.\n\n   So, the code works.\n\n   So, I think the code is correct.\n\n   Now, let's think about the efficiency.\n\n   For s up to 1e9, the number of divisors is up to around 1e5 for highly composite numbers, but typically much less, like 100 as in 1e9.\n\n   So, the code will run quickly.\n\n   Now, the code needs to read a and b, compute s, then find all divisors, sort them in descending order, then iterate through each, compute k0, compute x and y, compute GCD, compute LCM, and track the minimal.\n\n   So, the code should be acceptable.\n\n   Now, let's code this.\n\n   Also, note that in Python, for handling very large numbers, we have to be careful, but since the calculations are within Python's integer limits, it's okay.\n\n   So, the code:\n\n   Read a and b.\n\n   Compute s.\n\n   If s is zero, output 0.\n\n   Else, find all divisors of s.\n\n   Sort in descending order.\n\n   For each d in the sorted list:\n\n       compute k0 = (d - (a %d )) %d.\n\n       x = a +k0.\n\n       y = b +k0.\n\n       current_gcd = gcd(x, y).\n\n       current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd.\n\n       if current_lcm is less than min_lcm or same but k0 is smaller:\n\n           update min_lcm and best_k.\n\n   Finally, output best_k.\n\n   So, the code is:\n\n   import math\n\n   a, b = map(int, input().split())\n   s = abs(a - b)\n   if s == 0:\n       print(0)\n       exit()\n\n   def get_divisors(n):\n       divisors = set()\n       for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n           if n % i == 0:\n               divisors.add(i)\n               divisors.add(n // i)\n       return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)\n\n   divisors = get_divisors(s)\n   min_lcm = float('inf')\n   best_k = 0\n\n   for d in divisors:\n       remainder = a % d\n       k0 = (d - remainder) % d\n       x = a + k0\n       y = b + k0\n       current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n       current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n\n       if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k0 < best_k):\n           min_lcm = current_lcm\n           best_k = k0\n\n   print(best_k)\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find a non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - The goal is to minimize the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\).\n   - The difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is crucial because the LCM of two numbers is influenced by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) must be a divisor of the absolute difference \\( |a - b| \\).\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - The optimal \\( k \\) can be found by considering divisors of \\( |a - b| \\). For each divisor \\( d \\), we compute \\( k \\) such that both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) are divisible by \\( d \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute the absolute difference \\( s = |a - b| \\).\n   - Generate all divisors of \\( s \\).\n   - For each divisor \\( d \\), compute the smallest non-negative \\( k \\) such that \\( a + k \\) is divisible by \\( d \\).\n   - Calculate the LCM for each valid \\( k \\) and track the minimum LCM along with the corresponding \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Complexity**:\n   - Generating divisors of \\( s \\) involves iterating up to \\( \\sqrt{s} \\), which is efficient even for large values of \\( s \\) up to \\( 10^9 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ns = abs(a - b)\nif s == 0:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)\n\ndivisors = get_divisors(s)\nmin_lcm = float('inf')\nbest_k = 0\n\nfor d in divisors:\n    remainder = a % d\n    k0 = (d - remainder) % d\n    x = a + k0\n    y = b + k0\n    current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n    current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n\n    if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k0 < best_k):\n        min_lcm = current_lcm\n        best_k = k0\n\nprint(best_k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n- **Difference Calculation**: It computes the absolute difference \\( s \\).\n- **Divisor Generation**: It generates all divisors of \\( s \\) using a helper function.\n- **Optimal \\( k \\) Calculation**: For each divisor \\( d \\), it calculates the smallest \\( k \\) that makes \\( a + k \\) divisible by \\( d \\). It then computes the LCM for this \\( k \\) and tracks the minimum LCM and corresponding \\( k \\).\n- **Output**: The smallest \\( k \\) that results in the minimal LCM is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal \\( k \\) by leveraging the properties of divisors and GCD, leading to an optimal solution in terms of both time and space complexity.",
