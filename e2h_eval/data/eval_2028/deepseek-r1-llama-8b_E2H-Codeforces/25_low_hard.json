При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about determining whether a given string could have resulted from an error in message transmission between servers. The error occurs when two identical messages are sent one after another, and due to a bug, they get concatenated in a specific way. \n\nHmm, the task is to check if the given string t could be such a result. If yes, I need to find one possible original message s that could have caused this error. Otherwise, output NO.\n\nFirst, let's understand the error scenario. When two identical messages are sent, their concatenation happens by overlapping as much as possible. But wait, no, more precisely, the error is that two identical messages are sent consecutively, but due to the bug, they are merged by overlapping as much as possible, but only at the end of the first and the start of the second. So, for example, if the first message is 'abc' and the second is 'abc', the bug would merge them into 'abccbc'? Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the example says that sending two 'abrakadabra's might result in 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' or 'abrakadabrakadabra'. Oh right, because the overlapping can vary. So the error is that two same messages are sent one after another, and during transmission, their ends and beginnings overlap. The amount they overlap depends on how much the ends match the beginnings.\n\nSo the resulting string is formed by taking the first message, then adding the second message starting from the point where the end of the first matches the beginning of the second. So for two messages s, the result would be s + s' where s' is s shifted by some k characters. But wait, the shift must be such that the last k characters of s are equal to the first k characters of s.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Suppose we have two messages s and s. When they are sent, the server tries to concatenate them, but the end of the first overlaps with the beginning of the second. So the resulting string t is formed by taking s[0...n-1 -k] + s[k ... n-1] + s[k ... m], but since both are the same s, perhaps t is s concatenated with s shifted by k positions, where k is the maximum possible where s ends with the prefix of s.\n\nWait, maybe the correct way to model it is: t = s + s', where s' is the second message which is s shifted by some k, but s must end with the prefix of s of length k. So the maximum possible k where the last k characters of s equal the first k characters of s.\n\nWait, no. Because when two identical messages are sent, the first is s, the second is s. So the error is that the two messages are concatenated, but with overlapping as much as possible. So the resulting string is s followed by s, but the end of the first and the beginning of the second are overlapped as much as possible.\n\nSo for example, if s is 'aaa', then sending it twice would result in 'aaaaaa' (since the entire end of the first and the entire beginning of the second are the same). Wait, but according to the example, sending 'abrakadabra' twice could result in 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (overlapping by 1 character) or 'abrakadabrakadabra' (overlapping by 4 characters).\n\nWait, in the first case, the two messages are s = 'abrakadabra', which has length 11. So when they are sent, the first is followed by the second, but overlapping by 1 character. So the result is s + s[1:] → 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'? No, wait, the example shows that the result is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'—wait, that's 22 letters. Hmm, 11+11=22. So perhaps the overlapping is 0? Because that would mean the two are just concatenated without any overlap.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the error condition. The problem statement says that two identical messages are sent, and due to an error, they are merged by overlapping as much as possible. The amount of overlap must be positive, and less than the length of the message.\n\nSo for example, if s is 'aaa', then the maximum possible k is 2 (since the last 2 characters of s are 'aa', which is the first 2 of s). So the merged message is s + s[k:] → 'aaa' + 'a' → 'aaaa'.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So for s of length n, the maximum possible k is the largest value",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have resulted from an error in message transmission between servers. The error occurs when two identical messages are sent consecutively and their ends overlap with the beginnings of each other as much as possible. If such an error is possible, we need to find one possible original message that could have caused this error.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Overlapping Points**: For the given string `t`, check if it can be split into two equal parts where the second part starts at some position `k` after the first part ends. This means the last `k` characters of the first part must match the first `k` characters of the second part.\n2. **Check Validity**: Ensure that the overlap `k` is positive and less than the length of the string. If such an overlap exists, the string is formed by concatenating two identical messages with the maximum possible overlap.\n3. **Construct Possible Original Message**: If a valid overlap is found, construct the possible original message `s` by taking the first part of `t` up to the point before the overlap starts and then appending the remaining part of the second message starting from the overlap point.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef find_original_message(t):\n    n = len(t)\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        if k >= n:\n            continue\n        # Check if the last k characters of the first half match the first k of the second half\n        if t[:n - k] == t[n - k : n]:\n            # Now, check if t can be split into s + s shifted by k\n            # So the first s is t[:n -k], and the second s is t[n -k : n]\n            # We need to verify that s is the same as t[:n -k], but due to possible shifts, perhaps not.\n            # Wait, no: in the error scenario, the two messages are the same s, but the second is shifted by k, but only if the end of the first matches the beginning of the second.\n            # So the resulting t would be s followed by s[k:] but with the maximum possible k.\n            # But wait, in our approach, for a given k, t is constructed as s + s[k:], but s must be equal to both parts.\n            # So t should be s + s[k:]. But since t is formed by the error, s must be such that the first part is s, and the second part is s[k:].\n            # Therefore, for our purposes, the first part is s, and the second part is s[k:], which makes the entire t = s + s[k:].\n            # So to get s, we can take the first part as s_candidate = t[:n -k], and the second part must be s_candidate[k:].\n            # So the entire t should be s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n            # But also, the second part (s_candidate[k:]) must be equal to the latter part of t.\n            # Let's compute s_candidate and see if the rest of t matches.\n            s_candidate = t[:n -k]\n            if len(s_candidate) * 2 == n and t[n -k : ] == s_candidate[k:]:\n                return s_candidate\n    return None\n\nt = input().strip()\nresult = find_original_message(t)\nif result is not None:\n    print(\"YES\")\n    print(result)\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution works by checking each possible overlap length `k` for the given string `t`. For each `k`, it verifies if the string can be split into two equal parts where the second part starts at `k` positions after the first part ends. If such a split is found, it constructs the possible original message `s` and returns it. If no valid split is found, it returns \"NO\". This approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible overlaps and construct the correct original message if it exists.",
