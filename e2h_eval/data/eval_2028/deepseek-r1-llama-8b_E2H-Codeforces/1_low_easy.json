    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Golden Plate,\" and from the description, I need to calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding k rings. Each ring is like a border around the plate, getting smaller each time.\n\nHmm, let's break down the problem. The plate is divided into w rows and h columns. We have to add k gilded rings. The first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, and so on. Each ring is one cell wide.\n\nWait, how do the rings work? Like, the i-th ring is the border of a rectangle that's (w -4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). Oh right, because each ring reduces both width and height by 4. Because for each ring, we lose one cell on each side—left, right, top, bottom. So 2 cells on each dimension per ring.\n\nSo for each ring from 1 to k, I need to calculate the perimeter of that particular rectangle, but not the area. Wait, no, because each ring is the perimeter of the inner rectangle. But wait, the perimeter for a rectangle is 2*(width + height) -4. Because each corner is counted twice if we just do 2*(w + h), so subtract 4 to correct that.\n\nFor example, if the rectangle is 3x3, the perimeter is 8. Which matches the first sample input where 3x3 gives 8 cells.\n\nAnother example: the second sample is 7x9 and k=1. So the perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 32 -4=28, which matches the output.\n\nAnd when k=2, the next ring would be on a 3x5 rectangle. Wait, 7-4*1=3, 9-4*1=5. So the perimeter is 2*(3+5)-4=16-4=12. Adding to the previous 28 gives 40, which is the third sample's output.\n\nSo the approach is to sum up the perimeters of each of the k rings.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each ring i from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute the current width as w - 4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute the current height as h -4*(i-1)\n   c. If either width or height is less than or equal to 0, we can't form the ring. But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that this doesn't happen. So we don't need to handle that case.\n   d. Compute the perimeter: 2*(width + height) -4\n   e. Add this to the total.\n\n2. Sum all these perimeters to get the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. How about when i=1, the rectangle is w x h. The perimeter is 2*(w + h) -4. That makes sense because it's the outer ring.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\nRead w, h, k from input.\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nLoop i from 1 to k:\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n   current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n   total += perimeter\n\nPrint total.\n\nThat should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 3 3 1\n\ni=1: current_w=3, current_h=3 → perimeter = 2*(6) -4 = 12-4=8. Total is 8. Correct.\n\nSample 2: 7 9 1 → perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 32-4=28. Correct.\n\nSample 3: 7 9 2.\n\ni=1: 7,9 → 28. i=2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5 → perimeter is 2*(3+5)-4= 16-4=12. Total 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if k is larger?\n\nWait, according to the input constraints, k is at most floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). So for example, if w=7, h=9, min is 7. (7+1)/4=2, so k can be 2. Which is what the sample uses.\n\nWhat if w=5, h=5, k=1:\n\nPerimeter is 2*(5+5) -4=20-4=16.\n\nIf k=2, then current_w=5-4=1, current_h",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells that will be gilded on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is a border around the plate, and each subsequent ring is placed two cells inward from the previous one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring forms a border around the plate. The first ring is along the edge of the plate, the second ring is two cells inward, and so on. Each ring reduces both the width and height of the plate by 4 cells (2 cells from each side).\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle formed by that ring. The perimeter of a rectangle with dimensions `w` and `h` is given by `2 * (w + h) - 4`, which accounts for the four corners being counted twice if we simply add the width and height.\n3. **Summing Perimeters**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, calculate the perimeter of the corresponding rectangle and sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the dimensions of the plate (`w` and `h`) and the number of rings (`k`).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, it calculates the current width and height of the rectangle that would form the ring.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each rectangle, it computes the perimeter using the formula `2 * (width + height) - 4`.\n4. **Sum Perimeters**: The perimeters of all rings are summed up to get the total number of gilded cells.\n5. **Output Result**: Finally, the total number of gilded cells is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required result by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly based on the problem constraints.",
