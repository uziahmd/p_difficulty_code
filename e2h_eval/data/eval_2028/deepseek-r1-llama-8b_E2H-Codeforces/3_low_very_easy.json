Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Lanterns.\" Hmm.\n\nSo, the setup is that Vanya is walking along a straight street of length l. There are n lanterns placed along this street. Each lantern can light all points within a distance d from it. The goal is to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nWait, right. So each lantern covers a segment of the street. The union of all these segments needs to cover the entire [0, l] interval. And we need the smallest possible d.\n\nHow do I approach this? Hmm.\n\nLet me think about the process. For a given d, each lantern i will cover a range from a_i - d to a_i + d. But since the street starts at 0 and ends at l, any coverage beyond 0 or l isn't needed. So the effective coverage for each lantern is max(0, a_i - d) to min(l, a_i + d).\n\nThe problem then reduces to finding the smallest d such that the union of all these intervals covers [0, l].\n\nBut how do I compute this d efficiently?\n\nI think binary search would be a good approach here. Because as d increases, the coverage can only increase, so there's a monotonic relation between d and whether the street is fully covered.\n\nYes, so the plan is:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because when sorted, it's easier to see the gaps between the coverage areas.\n2. Perform a binary search on the possible values of d. The lower bound can be 0, but realistically, we might have to set it based on the first and last lanterns. Wait, no: because if a lantern is at position x, the minimal d for it to cover some part is zero, but in our case, we need to cover the entire street, so d must be large enough to bridge the gaps between the lanterns' coverage.\n\nWait, but when binary searching, we can start with low=0 and high=l (since even with d = l, the first lantern at 0 would cover up to l, but perhaps that's overkill). Or maybe higher than necessary.\n\nWait, another way: the maximum distance needed is the maximum of the rightmost point each lantern can cover. Or perhaps the minimal d is determined by the largest gap between two consecutive lanterns after sorting.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Because the coverage depends on the sum of their individual ranges overlapping.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the sorted lantern positions. After sorting, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, the distance between them could be a factor. But also, the beginning and end points.\n\nFor example, the first lantern's left coverage must reach 0, and the last lantern's right coverage must reach l. So for the first lantern, a_1 - d <=0, which implies d >= a_1. Similarly, for the last lantern, a_n +d >= l, so d >= l - a_n.\n\nWait, no. Because if a lantern is at a_i, then for it to cover up to 0, d must be at least a_i (so that a_i -d <=0). Similarly, to cover l, d must be at least l - a_i.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's correct that. If a_i is at position x, then for it to reach 0, x -d <= 0 => d >= x. Similarly, to reach l, x +d >= l => d >= l -x.\n\nSo for each lantern, the minimal d required for that lantern alone is max(a_i, l -a_i). But since they are multiple lanterns, the overall minimal d is the maximum of all the gaps between the coverage of consecutive lanterns, plus the minimal d required by the first and last lanterns.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: imagine all the lanterns are sorted. Then, the street is divided into regions between 0 and the first lantern, between the lanterns, and between the last lantern and l.\n\nFor the entire street to be covered, each of these regions must be covered by at least one lantern.\n\nSo, for each region, the distance between two points (the end of the previous lantern's coverage and the start of the next) must be <= 2d, because the two lanterns' coverages may overlap. Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal d is determined by the maximum of:\n\n- The distance from 0 to the first lantern's coverage. That is, the first lantern's left coverage is a_1 -d. To cover 0, a_1 -d must be <=0, so d >= a_1. Similarly, the last lantern's right coverage is a_n +d, which must be >=l, so d >= l -a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns on a street of length \\( l \\) cover the entire street. Each lantern lights up a segment of the street centered at its position with radius \\( d \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns. This helps in efficiently determining the gaps between consecutive lanterns and their coverage areas.\n2. **Determine Coverage Gaps**: The minimal \\( d \\) must be large enough to cover the entire street. This includes covering from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). Additionally, it must cover any gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Binary Search for Minimum \\( d \\)**: We use binary search to find the smallest \\( d \\) that satisfies the coverage requirements. The search range is between 0 and \\( l \\), as these are the extremes where \\( d \\) would either be too small or too large.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef compute_min_d(n, l, a):\n    a = sorted(a)\n    \n    def is_covered(d):\n        # Check the beginning\n        if a[0] - d > 0:\n            return False\n        # Check the end\n        if a[-1] + d < l:\n            return False\n        # Check the gaps between consecutive lanterns\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            prev = a[i-1] + d\n            curr = a[i] - d\n            if curr > prev:\n                return False\n        return True\n    \n    left = 0.0\n    right = l\n    eps = 1e-9\n    for _ in range(100):\n        mid = (left + right) / 2\n        if is_covered(mid):\n            right = mid\n        else:\n            left = mid\n    return right\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    l = float(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    ptr +=n\n    a = [x / l for x in a]\n    min_d = compute_min_d(n, l, a)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(min_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting Lanterns**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate easier gap calculations between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Coverage Check Function**: The function `is_covered(d)` checks if a given \\( d \\) covers the entire street by ensuring the first lantern covers from 0 and the last lantern covers up to \\( l \\). It also checks that there are no gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Binary Search**: Using binary search over the possible values of \\( d \\), we efficiently narrow down the minimum \\( d \\) needed. This approach ensures that we handle even the largest possible input sizes within a reasonable time frame.\n\nThis method ensures that we find the minimal \\( d \\) accurately and efficiently, adhering to the problem constraints and providing the required precision.",
