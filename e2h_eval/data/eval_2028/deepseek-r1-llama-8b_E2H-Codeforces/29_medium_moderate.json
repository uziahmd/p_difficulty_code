Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem statement says that Andrew and Eugene are playing a game where they manipulate a string of digits through a series of substitution queries. After processing all the queries, we need to compute the resulting number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nHmm. So the initial string is s, and each query is of the form di → ti. This means that every occurrence of digit di in the current string is replaced by ti. For example, if s is '123123' and the query is \"2→00\", then replacing all '2's with '00' gives '10031003'. Another example is when a query is \"3→\", which replaces all '3's with empty strings, so the string becomes '1212'.\n\nWait, but the order of the queries matters. Each query is processed in the order given. So the substitutions are applied sequentially, each one modifying the string further based on the previous changes.\n\nThe output should be the number represented by the final string after all substitutions, modulo 1e9+7. Also, leading zeros are ignored when interpreting the number. But wait, the note says that leading zeros are not removed from the string. Oh, right, because the problem says, for example, in the third sample, the string after substitution has leading zeros, but when converted to a number, those zeros are considered as part of the number. Wait, no. Wait, the note clarifies that when you represent s as a decimal number, leading zeros are ignored. So for example, if the string is \"00012\", the number is 12. But wait, in the third sample, the output is 777, implying that the string is \"777\" which doesn't have any leading zeros. So the way the substitution works, perhaps leading zeros are preserved, but when converting to a number, leading zeros are ignored.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals zero.\" So, the actual numeric value is computed by ignoring leading zeros. So for example, if the string becomes \"00123\", the number is 123.\n\nBut for our processing, we need to process the substitutions correctly, including any leading zeros, but when computing the number, ignore them.\n\nSo, how to model this? Let's think.\n\nEach substitution is a mapping from a single character (digit) to another string. So the idea is to build a substitution map where each digit can be replaced by some string.\n\nBut since substitutions can be applied in any order, we have to make sure that when processing the queries, each substitution is applied correctly.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the queries are applied in the order given. So the first query is processed first, then the next, etc. So we can't pre-process the substitutions; we have to apply them step by step.\n\nSo, for example, if a substitution changes a digit into multiple digits, including other digits, then the next substitution will affect those new digits as well.\n\nSo, for example, suppose we have a substitution for '2' → '34', and then a substitution for '3' → '5', '4' → '6'. Then applying the first substitution would replace '2's with '34's. Then, the next substitution would process '3's to '5's and '4's to '6's, resulting in '56's in place of the original '2's.\n\nSo the order is crucial.\n\nSo the approach is to process each query in order, updating the substitution map each time.\n\nWait, but the substitution map can't be built once; it needs to be updated as each query comes in.\n\nHmm, so for each query, we need to replace all occurrences of di in the current string with ti.\n\nSo the way to model this is to process each query step by step, modifying the string accordingly.\n\nBut wait, the initial string is s, and each query modifies it. So after each query, the string changes.\n\nBut for n up to 105, and the sum of lengths of ti up to 105, the total length of the string could be up to something like 1e2 * 1e2 = 1e4 or more, but manageable.\n\nBut if we process each substitution naively by replacing the string each time, for n=105 steps, each potentially modifying the string up to 1e5 characters, that might be manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Because each substitution is a mapping from a single character to a string, perhaps we can represent the string as a sequence of transformations, and then compute the final string efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this with a substitution automaton, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, let's think about the data structures.\n\nWe can represent the string as a list, but perhaps more efficiently, we can track the transformations using a dictionary that maps each character to its replacement string.\n\nBut wait, each substitution may change multiple characters. So the substitution process is not just a one-time mapping but dynamic.\n\nSo perhaps we can model the string as a state that is transformed by each query.\n\nWait, but each query is a substitution of a specific digit to a specific string. So for each query, for each occurrence of di in the current string, we replace it with ti.\n\nSo processing each query requires scanning the entire current string and replacing each occurrence of di with ti.\n\nThis seems straightforward but may be time-consuming for large strings.\n\nBut given the constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n\n2. Read each of the n queries, storing them as a list of tuples, each tuple being (di, ti).\n\n3. For each query in order, perform the substitution on the current string.\n\n   a. For each character in the current string, if it equals di, replace it with ti.\n\n4. After processing all queries, compute the numeric value of the resulting string, ignoring leading zeros, and output it modulo 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that during substitution, the ti can contain other digits, which may have been substituted in earlier steps. So for example, if a substitution replaces 'a' with 'b', and later substitution replaces 'b' with 'c', the second substitution affects the result of the first substitution.\n\nSo processing each query step by step is necessary.\n\nNow, the question is: How to efficiently process each substitution.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code.\n\nIn Python:\n\n- Read s from input.\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Read n lines, each line is a query of the form \"d->t\".\n\n- Process each query:\n\n   For each query, split into di and ti. Then, for the current string, replace every occurrence of di with ti.\n\nSo, for example:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nquery1: '2->00' → replace '2's with '00' → new s is '10031003'\n\nquery2: '3->' → replace '3's with '' → s becomes '10010003'\n\nWait, no, in the example given, the first query transforms '123123' into '10031003' because 2 is replaced by 00, so each 2 becomes two 0s. Then the second query is 3→, which replaces 3's with nothing. So the string becomes '10031003' → replacing 3's with nothing gives '10010003'? Wait, no. Wait the initial string after first substitution is '10031003', which has 3 at the end. Replacing 3 with empty string makes it '10010003'? Or wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, the initial string is '123123'.\n\nFirst query is 2→00: the string becomes '10031003' because each '2' is replaced by '00'. So the string is '1' followed by '00' (from the first '2'), then '3' remains, then '1' remains, then '2' becomes '00', then '3' remains.\n\nWait, wait, the initial string is '123123' → indices 0:1, 1:2, 2:3, 3:1, 4:2, 5:3.\n\nAfter substitution, each 2 is replaced by 00. So positions 1 and 4 (the 2's) are replaced. So the string becomes:\n\n1 followed by 00, then 3, then 1, followed by 00, then 3 → '10031003'.\n\nThen the second query is '3→', which replaces all 3's with empty string. So looking at '10031003', the 3's are at positions 2 and 5.\n\nReplacing each 3 with '' results in the string '10010003'? Or wait, let's see:\n\nOriginal after first substitution: 1 00 3 1 00 3 → replacing 3's with empty, so the string becomes 1 00 1 1 00 → '100100'? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the initial string after first substitution is '10031003'. So the structure is:\n\npositions: 0:1, 1:0, 2:0, 3:3, 4:1, 5:0, 6:0, 7:3.\n\nWhen we process the second query (3→), each '3' is replaced by nothing. So the string becomes:\n\n1 followed by 00, then 3 is removed, so between 3 and 1, it's now 1, but wait, position 3 is '3' → replaced by nothing, so the string becomes:\n\n1 00 1 00 3 → wait, no, perhaps I'm not reconstructing correctly.\n\nWait, let me think step by step.\n\nThe string is '1','0','0','3','1','0','0','3'.\n\nAfter replacing each '3' with '', we get:\n\n'1','0','0', (replace '3' with '') → so after position 3, the next is '1' at position 4.\n\nSo the new string is '1','0','0','1','0','0', followed by the '3' at position 7 being removed. So the final string is '100100'? Or is it '1001 00'?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to process the string as a list and replace each character as needed.\n\nSo, for the second query, the string is '10031003'.\n\nWe iterate over each character, and for each '3' found, replace it with nothing.\n\nSo:\n\nindex 0: '1' → remains.\n\nindex 1: '0' → remains.\n\nindex 2: '0' → remains.\n\nindex 3: '3' → replace with empty.\n\nindex 4: '1' → remains.\n\nindex 5: '0' → remains.\n\nindex 6: '0' → remains.\n\nindex 7: '3' → replace with empty.\n\nSo after processing, the new string is '1' + '0' + '0' + '1' + '0' + '0' → '100100'? Wait, that can't be right because the length would be 6 instead of 8.\n\nWait, no, the original string is '10031003' (length 8). After replacing the two '3's with empty, the new string is '1001 00' → length 6.\n\nWait, yes. So the string becomes '100100'.\n\nWait, but that's not matching the example given in the problem statement. Let me check.\n\nIn the problem statement, the example after the first two queries is:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', ...]\n\nSo the first query transforms s to '10031003', the second query transforms it to '1212'.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my previous reasoning.\n\nAh! Oh right, I think I made a mistake. Wait, the second query is '3→'—so in the first query, the string becomes '10031003', which has 3's at positions 3 and 7. So when we replace each 3 with nothing, the string becomes '100100'?\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, after the second query, the string is '1212'. Hmm, that suggests that the second substitution somehow removes all 3's and turns it into 12.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem statement. Let's look back.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nIn the first example, the first query is '2→00' which transforms '123123' into '10031003'. The second query is '3→', which transforms it into '1212'.\n\nWait, how does that happen?\n\nWait, '10031003' → after replacing 3's with nothing.\n\nBreaking down '10031003':\n\nLooking for '3's:\n\n- The third character is '0', fourth is '3' → replace with nothing.\n\n- The seventh character is '0', eighth is '3' → replace with nothing.\n\nSo the string becomes '1 00 1 00'.\n\nWhich is '100100' → which is six characters long. But the problem's example says the string becomes '1212' after the second query.\n\nWait, that's confusing. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the substitution.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the substitution steps.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nFor example, if s is 123123, then query \"2→00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3→\" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s=1212.\n\nWait, how?\n\nSo after the first substitution, s is 10031003.\n\nThen, the second substitution is 3→, which replaces all '3's with empty.\n\nSo the string becomes:\n\n1 00 3 1 00 3 → after substitution, the 3's are removed.\n\nSo the string becomes 1 00 1 00 → '100100'.\n\nWait, but that's '100100', which is six characters. So why is the output '1212'?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the substitution is done in a way that each substitution is processed in a way that allows overlapping replacements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substitution is processed in a way that the ti can contain other digits that have been substituted in previous steps.\n\nWait, perhaps in the second substitution, the 3's are replaced with nothing, but perhaps the 00's in the string could have been affected by earlier substitutions. But in this case, the substitution is only for '3's.\n\nSo I'm a bit confused about how the example leads to '1212' after the second substitution.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is incorrect, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting the substitutions.\n\nWait, let's recompute:\n\nOriginal string after first substitution: '10031003' → that's 1, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 3.\n\nNow, the second substitution is '3→', so each 3 is replaced with nothing.\n\nSo the string becomes:\n\n1,0,0, (3 replaced by nothing), 1,0,0, (3 replaced by nothing) → so the string is '100100', which is 6 characters.\n\nWait, that's not '1212'. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substitution is done in reverse order or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the substitution is done on the entire string, and when ti is a longer string than di, it can introduce new digits that may have their own substitutions in future steps.\n\nBut in the example, after the first substitution, the string is '10031003', which has 3's at the end.\n\nThe second substitution is '3→', which replaces all 3's with nothing, leaving '100100', which is '100100', but the problem says it becomes '1212'.\n\nThat doesn't add up. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the substitution process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substitution is done in a way that the ti can include other substitutions. No, because each substitution is applied in the order given.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in the substitution, the di is replaced by ti, which can be any string, including digits that may themselves be subject to substitution in future steps.\n\nBut in the given example, the second substitution is '3→', which is processed after the first substitution, which added 3's. So the 3's are replaced, giving the string as '100100', but the problem says the string becomes '1212'.\n\nSo I'm clearly missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the substitution is done recursively or in a way that all possible substitutions are applied, not just the ones in the current query.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substitution is processed in such a way that during the replacement, any new digits are also subject to substitution in the same query.\n\nBut that's not the case, as each query is processed in order.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should read the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\".\n\nSo each occurrence of di is replaced by ti. So for the string '10031003', each 3 is replaced by nothing, so the string becomes '100100' as before.\n\nBut the problem's example says that after the second substitution, the string is '1212'.\n\nWait, that suggests that the second substitution somehow turns '10031003' into '1212'.\n\nWait, perhaps the substitution is not just for the digit '3' but for any occurrence of '3' in the string, regardless of how it was formed.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the substitution is global for all instances of the digit di in the current string.\n\nSo in the example, after the first substitution, the string is '10031003'.\n\nThen, the second substitution is '3→' → so all 3's in the string are replaced with empty.\n\nLooking at '10031003', the 3's are at positions 3 and 7.\n\nSo replacing them with nothing gives:\n\n1, 0, 0, (3 replaced by nothing), 1, 0, 0, (3 replaced by nothing) → '100100'.\n\nWait, but that's not '1212'. So perhaps the example is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substitution is being applied in a way that the ti can contain other digits, and those digits are subject to substitution in the same step.\n\nWait, but the substitution for a query is applied once, in the order given.\n\nI think I'm stuck here. Perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach, assuming that each substitution is applied as described, and see if the code can handle it.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each query, replace every occurrence of di with ti.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut for n=105, and each query possibly requiring a scan of a string that can be up to 1e5 characters, it's manageable.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead s.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead each of the n queries, and store them as a list of tuples (di, ti).\n\nProcess each query in order:\n\nFor each query (di, ti):\n\n   create a new string by replacing every occurrence of di in the current s with ti.\n\n   set s to this new string.\n\nOnce all queries are processed, compute the numeric value of s, ignoring leading zeros.\n\nCompute mod 1e9+7.\n\nOutput the result.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this efficiently.\n\nBut in Python, strings are immutable, so each substitution would require creating a new string, which for a string of length L takes O(L) time. For n=105 and each substitution taking O(L) time, and L up to say 1e5, that's 1e7 operations, which should be manageable.\n\nBut perhaps for larger n and larger L, it could be slow, but given the constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, the next part is handling leading zeros.\n\nSo, after processing all queries, the string is s. We need to compute the numeric value, which is the integer represented by s, ignoring leading zeros. If s is empty, the value is 0.\n\nBut the problem says that leading zeros are ignored, so '00012' is treated as 12.\n\nSo, in code, after processing all substitutions, we need to process the string to extract the numeric value.\n\nSo, first, strip leading zeros, then if the resulting string is empty, return 0, else convert it to an integer.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the leading zeros are ignored when representing the number. So for the string '000', the number is 0.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nstrip_leading = s.lstrip('0')\n\nif len(strip_leading) == 0:\n\n   number = 0\n\nelse:\n\n   number = int(strip_leading)\n\nThen, compute number mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, for very long strings, converting to integer may cause issues, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large.\n\nSo, for example, if the string is 1e5 characters long, it's manageable.\n\nBut what about mod 1e9+7? Well, the mod operation can be applied as we process the string digit by digit, which is more efficient.\n\nYes, that's a good point. Instead of converting the entire string into an integer (which could be very large), perhaps we can compute the mod on the fly.\n\nBecause for very long strings (like 1e5 digits), converting directly to an integer is feasible in Python, but for even longer strings, it's better to compute the mod incrementally.\n\nBut given the constraints (s is up to 1e5 in length), even for 1e5 digits, converting to an integer is manageable in Python.\n\nSo, perhaps the easiest way is to process the string into an integer and then take mod.\n\nBut wait, what if the string is empty? Then the number is zero.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nmod = 10**9 +7\n\nif s.strip() == '':  # all zeros stripped\n   print(0)\nelse:\n   num = int(s)\n   print(num % mod)\n\nBut wait, if s is '0000', then s.strip() is empty, so num is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, no: s.strip() removes leading and trailing whitespace, but in our case, the string is composed of digits, so '0000'.lstrip('0') is ''.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif not s:\n\n   result = 0\n\nelse:\n\n   stripped = s.lstrip('0')\n\n   if not stripped:\n\n       result = 0\n\n   else:\n\n       result = int(stripped) % mod\n\nSo that's how we get the result.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRead s.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead each query, split into di and ti.\n\nProcess each query in order, replacing di with ti in s.\n\nOnce all queries are done, process the resulting s.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input provided.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, actually, the input is presented as a list of lines. So the first line is the initial s, the second is n, and the next n lines are the queries.\n\nSo the sample input is:\n\nLine 1: '123123' → s = '123123'\n\nn = 1 → wait, no. Wait, the sample input shows four lines, but that's probably a formatting issue.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nThe first line is the initial s.\n\nThe second line is n.\n\nThen n lines follow, each being a query.\n\nIn the sample, the output is four entries, which suggests that the input has four lines, but perhaps it's a typo.\n\nBut regardless, the code should read s as the first line, n as the next, then n queries.\n\nSo, let's look at the sample input in the problem statement:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, perhaps this is a representation of the input as a list of strings, each representing a line.\n\nSo, the first element is '123123\\n1\\n2->00' → which would be the first line, which is s='123123' followed by n=1, then the query '2->00'.\n\nBut that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nThe first line is '123123'.\n\nThe second line is 1.\n\nThe third line is '2->00'.\n\nSo, n=1, one query.\n\nAfter processing the query, the string becomes '10031003'.\n\nThen the output is '10031003'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement's sample output, after the first query, the string is '10031003'.\n\nThen the second query is '3->', which transforms it into '1212'.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input has four lines because the first line is s, then n=1, then three lines of queries. But that's not clear.\n\nPerhaps it's better to proceed with writing the code, ensuring that each query is processed correctly.\n\nAnother test case: the third sample.\n\nInput:\n\n222\n\n2\n\n2->0\n\n0->7\n\nSo, initial s is '222'.\n\nFirst query: 2→0 → s becomes '000'.\n\nSecond query: 0→7 → replace all 0's with '7's → '777'.\n\nSo the output is 777.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should handle this correctly.\n\nAnother test case: after substitution, the string is empty.\n\nE.g., initial s is '3', n=1, query '3→'.\n\nThen s becomes empty, which is treated as 0.\n\nSo the code should output 0.\n\nAnother case: initial s is '0', n=1, query '0→1'.\n\nThen s becomes '1', which is 1 mod 1e9+7.\n\nSo code should output 1.\n\nSo, the code logic seems sound.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n- Empty string after substitution.\n\n- Leading zeros after substitution.\n\n- Substitution that introduces new digits which are then substituted.\n\nTesting:\n\nLet's see how the code would process the sample given in the problem.\n\nSample Input:\n\nLine 1: s = '123123'\n\nn=1.\n\nQuery: '2->00' → replace all 2's with 00.\n\nResulting s: '10031003'.\n\nSo output is 10031003 → 10031003 mod 1e9+7 is 10031003.\n\nBut the problem's sample shows that after processing the first query, the output is '10031003'.\n\nThen, the second query is '3->', which transforms the string into '1212'.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input has more than one query.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\ns is '123123'\n\nn=2.\n\nQueries:\n\n2->00\n\n3->\n\nSo, after first substitution, s becomes '10031003'.\n\nAfter second substitution, replace all 3's with nothing → s becomes '100100'.\n\nBut the sample output says it's '1212'.\n\nSo I'm clearly missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement's sample is wrong, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substitution is done in a way that the ti can contain other digits, which are subject to substitution in the same query.\n\nWait, perhaps the substitution is done in a breadth-first manner, allowing multiple substitutions within a single query.\n\nBut that's not how the problem statement describes it.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substitution is applied to the entire string, including the ti's, in a way that any di in ti is also replaced.\n\nBut the problem statement says each query is of the form di→ti, meaning replace all digits di in the string with ti.\n\nSo, in a single query, all occurrences of di in the current string are replaced by ti. Any di in ti will be processed in subsequent queries.\n\nSo, for example, if a query replaces 2→34, then in the next substitution, 3 and 4 will be replaced if there are any queries for them.\n\nThus, in the sample where after first substitution, the string is '10031003', and the next query is 3→, which replaces all 3's with nothing, the string becomes '100100', not '1212'.\n\nSo I'm not seeing how the sample output is achieved.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is different. Let's re-examine the sample input.\n\nThe sample input is written as:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWhich may indicate that the first line is the initial s, then the next lines are the queries.\n\nBut perhaps each line is a separate input line.\n\nSo, let's parse it as:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn = 1\n\nqueries:\n\n'2->00'\n\nThen, s is transformed to '10031003' → output is 10031003.\n\nBut the sample output shows that after the first query, the output is '10031003', then the second query, which is '3->', transforms it into '1212'.\n\nWait, but according to the sample input, it's written as a list of four elements. Perhaps the first line is the initial s, then n=1, then the first query, and then perhaps the other lines are additional queries.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nLine 1: s = '123123'\n\nLine 2: n = 1\n\nLine 3: '2->00'\n\nSo, after processing, s is '10031003'.\n\nBut the sample output is four outputs, suggesting that there are four queries, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is misrepresented, and the actual input is:\n\nThe first line is '123123'.\n\nThe second line is 1.\n\nThe third line is '2->00'.\n\nThe fourth line is '3->'.\n\nThe fifth line is '222'.\n\nThe sixth line is 2.\n\nThe seventh line is '2->0'.\n\nThe eighth line is '0->7'.\n\nThe ninth line is '1000000008'.\n\nThe tenth line is 0.\n\nBut that's not matching the sample output either.\n\nHmm.\n\nWell, perhaps I should proceed with writing the code as per the initial plan, and see if it passes the test cases, including the sample.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead s from stdin.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of queries.\n\nProcess each query in order, replacing di with ti.\n\nFinally, compute the number.\n\nSo, the code.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first query is '2->00', which is processed, then the second query is '3->', which is processed.\n\nSo, for the sample, the code should process both queries.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the second query transforms the string into '1212'.\n\nWait, how?\n\nPerhaps the initial string after first substitution is '10031003'.\n\nThen, the second substitution is '3→', which replaces all 3's with empty.\n\nSo the string becomes '100100'.\n\nBut sample output after the second query is '1212'.\n\nSo perhaps I'm misunderstanding the substitution process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substitution is applied in a way that all possible substitutions are done for all possible digits in the ti.\n\nBut that's not how the problem statement describes it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substitution is done for the entire string, and during substitution, any occurrence of di in ti is replaced as well.\n\nBut that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substitution is done in a loop until no more substitutions can be made.\n\nBut the problem statement says that each query is processed in the order given, and each query is applied to the current string.\n\nSo, perhaps the sample has more than two queries.\n\nWait, the sample output shows four outputs, which implies that four substitutions were done.\n\nSo, perhaps the sample input is:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn = 4.\n\nQueries:\n\n1. 2→00 → s becomes 10031003.\n\n2. 3→ → s becomes 100100.\n\n3. 222 → perhaps, but that's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn=2.\n\nQueries:\n\n2→00\n\n3→\n\nThen, after first substitution, s is 10031003.\n\nAfter second substitution, replace all 3's with nothing → s becomes 100100.\n\nBut the sample output after this is 100100.\n\nBut the sample output shows that after the second query, it's 1212.\n\nSo, perhaps the sample input is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement has a mistake in the sample explanation.\n\nWell, regardless, the code should process each substitution as per the problem description.\n\nSo, the code proceeds as follows.\n\nTesting the code with the third sample:\n\nInput:\n\n222\n\n2\n\n2→0\n\n0→7\n\nSo, initial s is '222'.\n\nFirst query: replace 2 with 0 → s becomes '000'.\n\nSecond query: replace 0 with 7 → s becomes '777'.\n\nSo output is 777.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case:\n\ns = '3'\n\nn=1\n\nquery: '3→' → s becomes empty → output is 0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\ns = '0'\n\nn=1\n\nquery: '0→1' → s becomes '1' → output is 1.\n\nAnother test case:\n\ns = '111'\n\nn=2\n\nquery1: '1→2'\n\nquery2: '2→3'\n\nSo, after first substitution, s is '222'.\n\nAfter second substitution, s is '333' → output 333 mod 1e9+7 is 333.\n\nSo the code should handle this.\n\nAnother test case:\n\ns = '1234'\n\nn=3\n\nquery1: '1→ab', which may have letters, but di is a single digit, so perhaps the input ensures that di is a digit, so in the code, we can assume that di is a single character and a digit.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, di is exactly one digit, so in the code, di is a single character, and ti can be any string.\n\nSo, in the code, for each query, di is a single character, and ti can be any string.\n\nSo, for example, a query '3→abc' would replace 3 with 'abc'.\n\nSo, the code should handle that.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nRead s.\n\nRead n.\n\nqueries = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n   line = input().strip()\n\n   di, ti = line.split('->')\n\n   queries.append( (di, ti) )\n\ncurrent_s = s\n\nfor di, ti in queries:\n\n   new_s = ''\n\n   for c in current_s:\n\n       if c == di:\n\n           new_s += ti\n\n       else:\n\n           new_s += c\n\n   current_s = new_s\n\nThen, process current_s into a number.\n\nSo, the code is straightforward.\n\nTesting this code on the third sample:\n\nProcessing '222' with queries '2→0' and '0→7'.\n\nAfter first substitution, current_s becomes '000'.\n\nAfter second substitution, each '0' is replaced with '7', so current_s becomes '777'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn=1\n\nquery '2→00'\n\ncurrent_s becomes '10031003'.\n\nn=1, so processing stops.\n\nSo, the output is 10031003.\n\nBut according to the problem statement's sample, after the first query, it's 10031003, then after the second query, it's 1212.\n\nWhich suggests that the sample has more than one query.\n\nSo, perhaps the sample input is:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn=2.\n\nqueries: '2→00', '3→'.\n\nSo, after first substitution: 10031003.\n\nAfter second substitution: 100100.\n\nBut sample output is 1212.\n\nThus, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the substitution process.\n\nWait, perhaps the substitution is done in a way that the ti can contain other di's.\n\nWait, for example, if in a query, di is '2' and ti is '33', then any '3's in ti would be subject to substitution in the same query.\n\nBut that's not the case, as each query is processed once, in order.\n\nNo, the problem statement says that each query is applied to the current string, replacing all occurrences of di with ti.\n\nThus, in the second query, ti may contain digits, but those digits are only replaced in subsequent queries.\n\nThus, the sample's output must have a different substitution path.\n\nBut without further information, perhaps it's best to proceed with writing the code as per the initial understanding.\n\nThus, the code is as described.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on an initial string of digits. Each query specifies replacing all occurrences of a specific digit with a given substring. After processing all queries, we compute the numeric value of the resulting string modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the initial string and the number of queries.\n2. **Process Queries**: For each query, replace every occurrence of the specified digit in the current string with the given substring.\n3. **Compute Result**: After processing all queries, convert the resulting string into a numeric value, ignoring leading zeros, and compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\n\nqueries = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    parts = line.split('->')\n    di = parts[0]\n    ti = parts[1]\n    queries.append((di, ti))\n\ncurrent_s = s\nfor di, ti in queries:\n    new_s = []\n    for c in current_s:\n        if c == di:\n            new_s.append(ti)\n        else:\n            new_s.append(c)\n    current_s = ''.join(new_s)\n\nif not current_s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    stripped = current_s.lstrip('0')\n    if not stripped:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        num = int(stripped)\n        print(num % MOD)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from the input.\n2. **Processing Queries**: Each query is processed by iterating over each character in the current string. If the character matches the digit specified in the query, it is replaced with the corresponding substring.\n3. **Result Computation**: After all queries are processed, the resulting string is converted into a numeric value. Leading zeros are ignored, and if the resulting string is empty, the value is zero. The result is then computed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) and printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that each substitution is applied correctly and efficiently, even for longer strings, by iterating through each character and building the new string incrementally.",
