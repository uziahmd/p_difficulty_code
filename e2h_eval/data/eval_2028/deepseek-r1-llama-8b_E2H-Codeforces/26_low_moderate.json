Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles that satisfy certain conditions based on given integers A, B, C, D.\n\nHmm, let me read the problem statement carefully again. Oh right, the triangle has sides x, y, z where A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle must be non-degenerate, meaning x + y > z. Because for a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x <= y <= z, the main condition we need to check is x + y > z. Because if that holds, the other inequalities (like x + z > y and y + z > x) will automatically be satisfied because z is the largest.\n\nSo, the plan is: find all possible triplets (x, y, z) where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], z is in [C, D], with x <= y <= z, and x + y > z.\n\nBut wait, considering that the constraints are A <= B <= C <= D, but how can we efficiently compute the number of such triplets without iterating through all possibilities, which would be way too slow given the upper limit of 5e5?\n\nI think the approach should involve some mathematical calculations rather than brute-forcing each possible triplet. Let's break down the problem.\n\nFirst, let's note that for each possible z, we can determine the range of x and y that satisfy x <= y <= z and x + y > z.\n\nBut since x is at least A, and y is at least B, but also x <= y, perhaps we can model this by fixing y and then finding the valid x and z ranges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to iterate over possible y values and then for each y, find the possible x and z that meet the conditions.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about how to structure the loops or the ranges.\n\nAnother idea: for a fixed y, the x can vary from A to min(y, B), but wait no—since x is between A and B, and y is between B and C. So x can't exceed B, and y is at least B, but y can go up to C.\n\nWait, maybe for each possible y in [B, C], we can find the possible x and z ranges that satisfy x >= A, x <= B, x <= y (since x <= y), and z >= max(y, C). Also, for each y, z can be from C up to D, but must also satisfy z < x + y.\n\nWait, but z has to be at least C, because z is in [C, D]. So for each y, the minimal z is C, and the maximum is D, but also z must be less than x + y.\n\nSo for each y, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the possible x in [A, min(B, y)].\n   Wait, no. Since x can be up to B, but y is at least B, so x can be from A up to B, but y is at least B, so x is always <= y, because x is <= B and y is >= B.\n\n2. For each x in [A, B], and y in [B, C], we need to have z >= C and z <= D, and z < x + y.\n\nBut wait, this seems like it's going to be O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)) operations, which could be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's consider that for each possible y, we can find the range of x and the range of z that contribute to the count.\n\nSo for a fixed y, x can be from A to B, but x must also be <= y, which is already satisfied because y >= B >= A. So x is from A to B.\n\nBut z must be >= C, and z must be >= y (since z >= C >= y, as y <= C). Wait, no, z is >= C, and y can be up to C, so z is always >= y.\n\nSo for a fixed y, the possible z is from C to min(D, x + y - 1).\n\nBecause z must be less than x + y, so the maximum z is x + y - 1.\n\nSo for each y, and for each x in [A, B], the number of z's is the number of integers from C to min(D, x + y - 1), inclusive.\n\nBut again, this approach may be too slow if done naively because for each y and x, we'd calculate the number of z's.\n\n",
