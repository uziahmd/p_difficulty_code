    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The task is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about the examples they gave. For 'abcd', the output is 0. That makes sense because all substrings are unique since each character is different and the string isn't repeated anywhere. But for 'ababa', the output is 3. Oh right, because the substring 'aba' appears starting at index 0 and again at index 2. And they overlap by one character.\n\nSo how do I approach this? Well, the brute-force way would be to check all possible substrings, keep track of those we've seen, and then find the maximum length where a substring appears more than once.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum possible substring length? It's the length of the string minus one. Because the smallest possible substring is two identical characters. So for a string of length n, we can have substrings of lengths from 1 up to n-1.\n\nHmm, but checking all possible substrings might be computationally expensive, but given the constraints (string length up to 100), it's manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible substring lengths, starting from the largest possible down to 1.\n2. For each length l, generate all possible substrings of that length.\n3. Check if any substring appears more than once.\n4. As soon as we find such an l, return it as the answer.\n\nThis way, we can optimize by checking longer substrings first, so the first l we find that satisfies the condition is the maximum possible, and we can stop early.\n\nSo how do I implement this?\n\nI'll loop l from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n   for l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n       collect all substrings of length l\n       check if any substring occurs more than once.\n\nIf for a particular l, any substring appears more than once, return l as the answer.\n\nOtherwise, continue to smaller l.\n\nIf no such l exists except 0 (which is when all substrings are unique), then the answer is 0.\n\nWait, but according to the sample input 'zzz', the output is 2. Because the entire string 'zzz' doesn't repeat, but the substrings 'zz' appear multiple times. So the maximum is 2.\n\nWait, no, in 'zzz' the substrings of length 2 are 'zz' (positions 0-1), 'zz' (positions 1-2). So yes, it appears twice. So the maximum is 2.\n\nSo for each l, we need to check if there's any substring of length l that appears more than once.\n\nSo for each l, we can use a set to store the substrings. If adding a substring to the set already exists, then return l.\n\nWait, but sets only store unique elements. So for each substring of length l, we add it to a set. If during this process, we find a duplicate, then we can immediately return l as the maximum length.\n\nSo the algorithm could look like this:\n\nmax_len = 0\nfor l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(0, len(s) - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            return l\n        seen.add(substr)\nif max_len == 0:\n    return 0\nelse:\n    return max_len\n\nWait, but wait. The loop will go from len(s)-1 down to 1. For each l, check all substrings. If any substring is found in the set before, then we can return l immediately because we're checking from largest to smallest.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow let's test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 'abcd' has all substrings unique. So for l=3, substrings are 'abc', 'bcd'. No duplicates. Then l=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'—no duplicates. l=1: 'a','b','c','d'—all unique. So the answer is 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' has length 5. We check l=4: substrings are 'abab', 'baba'. No duplicates. Then l=3: 'aba' (i=0), 'bab' (i=1), 'aba' (i=2). When i=2, substr is 'aba' which is already in the set. So return 3.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz' has length 3. l=2: 'zz' (i=0), 'zz' (i=1). So when i=0",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Iterate Over Substring Lengths**: We start by checking the longest possible substrings first and work our way down to shorter ones. This ensures that we find the maximum length as quickly as possible.\n2. **Check for Duplicates**: For each substring length, generate all possible substrings of that length and use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, we immediately return the current length as the result.\n3. **Edge Cases**: If no such substring exists, the result will be 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging a set for quick lookups, ensuring that we only continue checking if no duplicates are found for the current substring length.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n- **Loop Through Lengths**: Starting from the longest possible substring (length `n-1`), we check each possible substring length down to 1.\n- **Substring Generation and Check**: For each length, generate all substrings of that length and use a set to track duplicates. If a duplicate is found, print the current length and exit.\n- **Result**: If no duplicates are found for any substring length, print 0.\n\nThis method ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring with minimal computational overhead, making it suitable for strings up to the given constraint of length 100.",
