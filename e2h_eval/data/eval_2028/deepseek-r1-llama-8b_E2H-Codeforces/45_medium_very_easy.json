There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a tennis tournament where players are eliminated in each game, and the tournament grid isn't fixed yet. But there's a specific rule: two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. My task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in.\n\nHmm, right. So the winner needs to play as many games as possible while following that rule. Let me think about how the tournament could be structured to maximize this.\n\nLet's consider some examples first. Like the sample input:\n\nFor n=2, the winner plays once. That's straightforward.\n\nn=3: The winner plays two games. How? Maybe the initial structure has them beat two opponents, but wait, how does that work? Oh, because after the first game, the winner has 1 game. Then, in the next round, they can play someone who also has 1 game (since their difference is 0). So total of two games.\n\nWait, but for n=4, the output is 2. Because the tournament can be arranged so that the winner plays two games. For example, the bracket is like (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), then 1 vs whoever. So the winner plays two games.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Because the way the tournament proceeds is in rounds—each round halves the number of players until the final. So in a knockout tournament with n players, the maximum number of games a player can play is log2(n), but here the rule might restrict that.\n\nBut the problem says that the organizers are arranging the grid according to that rule, not necessarily a binary tree structure. So perhaps the optimal way isn't a binary tree, but some other arrangement that allows the winner to play more games than the binary tree would allow.\n\nSo the key is to model how the winner can accumulate the maximum number of games, considering that each opponent must have played either the same number or one less than the winner before facing them.\n\nLet's think recursively. Suppose the winner has k games. Each game they play must be against someone who has either k-1 or k-2 games, since the difference can't exceed one.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when they face someone, the other player's current number of games must differ by at most one from theirs. So before the match, the winner has m games, the opponent has m or m±1.\n\nSo to maximize the number of games the winner plays, we need to arrange the opponents in such a way that each time, the opponent has as many games as possible without violating the condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal path is when the winner's number of games increases by one each step, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of games the winner can play is equal to the floor of (n + 1)/2. Or wait, let's see:\n\nWait, for n=10, the output is 4. Let's see: 10 players.\n\nIf the winner plays 4 games, that would require that each time, the opponent has either 3, 2, 1, or 0 games. Hmm, but wait, the initial game is the first, then each next game requires that the opponent has one less.\n\nSo for 4 games, the opponent counts would be 3, 2, 1, 0. That means the winner must have beaten four players, each requiring a certain number of wins.\n\nWait, but each opponent must have exactly one fewer game count. Because if the winner has k games, each opponent before that game must have k-1, k-2, etc., down to 0.\n\nWait, but the initial game is the first for both players. So each opponent must have a number of games that is either equal to the winner's current count minus one or the same.\n\nSo, for the winner to play k games, he must have beaten k opponents. Each of those opponents must have played a certain number of games before facing him.\n\nLet me model this as a sequence. Let's say the winner's games are g_1, g_2, ..., g_k, where each g_i is the number of games before the i-th game. So g_1 is 0, since before the first game, the winner hasn't played any. Wait, no, wait: before the first game, the winner has played zero games. Then, after the first game, he's played one.\n\nSo the opponent in the first game must have played zero games as well, because their difference is zero (since the winner has played zero before the game, and the opponent has also zero before that game).\n\nWait, no. Because when the winner starts the first game, the other player has also just started, so they both have zero games before that match. So yes, their game counts are equal.\n\nThen, for the second game, the winner has played one game. The opponent must have played either one or zero games. So the opponent could have come from a previous game (so one game) or is playing in their first game.\n\nWait, but if the opponent had played one game, then he must have won that. So in that case, the opponent's game count is one, and the winner's is one as well. So their difference is zero, which is allowed.\n\nSo, for the second game, the opponent can have one game, which implies that the winner's game count is 1, and the opponent's is 1. Then, in the third game, the winner's count is 2, the opponent's can be 2 or 1. If it's 2, then the opponent has played two games, meaning he must have won his previous game. So the structure can continue.\n\nSo the idea is to build a chain where each subsequent opponent has one fewer game than the winner at that point. So the maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by how many such opponents can be arranged.\n\nLet's try to model this.\n\nThe winner must have a sequence of games where each opponent's game count is one less than the winner's current count. So the number of games the winner can play is determined by how long such a chain can be built, given that each opponent requires a certain number of previous games.\n\nWait, but the opponent's game count is determined by their own progression through the tournament. So each opponent in the winner's path must themselves have a similar path, leading up to the game against the winner.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming. Let's think about f(k) as the minimum number of players required for the winner to have played k games.\n\nWe can think of f(0) = 1 (no games, just the winner). For each k >= 1, the winner plays one game, which requires an opponent. The opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games?\n\nWait, wait, no. When the winner has played k-1 games, he is going into the k-th game. The opponent in the k-th game must have played either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when the winner is about to play his k-th game, he has played k-1 games before. So the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games before this match.\n\nBut the opponent could have been in a situation where they have played k-1 games. How?\n\nWait, maybe each opponent in the winner's path must themselves have a path that allows them to reach the stage where they can play against the winner.\n\nSo, for each opponent, the number of games they played before facing the winner is either equal to the winner's current count minus one or same.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games is the sum of the Fibonacci sequence up to k+2. Or something like that.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. To have the winner play k games, each opponent in the (i-th) game must have played i-1 games. Because the winner's i-th game is against someone who has either i-1 or i-2 games.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Let's think step by step.\n\nLet me define f(k) as the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have played k games.\n\nThen, for k=0, f(0)=1 (the winner alone).\n\nFor k=1, the winner plays one game. He needs one opponent. So f(1) = 2.\n\nFor k=2: The winner's first game is against someone who has 0 games. Then, in the second game, the winner's opponent must have played 1 or 0 games. To get the maximum possible, perhaps the opponent in the second game has 1 game. So the opponent must have won a prior game.\n\nWait, so to have the second opponent have 1 game, that opponent must have beaten someone else. So for the second game, the winner has 1 game, the opponent has 1. So for the second game, we need two players: the winner and the opponent. But the opponent's path requires that he has one game, which implies that he came from a previous game. So the opponent's one game was against someone else.\n\nSo, the total number of players required for k=2 is f(1) + 1 (the initial opponent for the first game) plus another opponent for the second game. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2).\n\nWait, that rings a bell. Because each new opponent in the k-th game requires that they have k-1 games, which implies that they themselves had a sub-tournament of size f(k-1). And the initial opponent for the first game is f(0) = 1, but adding that in.\n\nWait, maybe the recurrence is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) + 1.\n\nWait, let's test it.\n\nk=1: f(1)=2.\n\nk=2: f(2) = f(1) + f(0) +1? Or perhaps f(2) = f(1) + (f(1) - 1) ?\n\nNo, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think differently.\n\nEach time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have played either the same number of games or one less. To maximize the number of games, the opponent should have played the maximum possible number, i.e., same number of games as the winner before the match.\n\nWait, but that would mean that each opponent in the winner's path must have played as many games as the winner before facing him. Which would require that each opponent has their own chain of games.\n\nSo, for the winner to have k games, each opponent in the i-th game must have played i-1 games. Because when the winner is about to play the i-th game, he has i-1 games under his belt. The opponent must have played either i-1 or i-2 games. But to have the maximum number of games, perhaps the opponent has i-1 games, which requires that he has a path of i-1 games.\n\nWait, that suggests that for each opponent in the i-th game, they must have a sub-tournament that allows them to have i-1 games. So the number of players needed for the i-th game's opponent is f(i-1).\n\nBut the winner's first game is against someone who has 0 games. So for the first game, the opponent comes from a sub-tournament of size f(0) = 1.\n\nSo, for each k, f(k) is the sum of f(i-1) for i from 1 to k, plus 1 (the winner).\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's calculate for small k.\n\nk=1: f(1) = 1 (winner) + f(0) = 1+1=2.\n\nk=2: f(2) = f(1) + f(0) + 1? Or wait, perhaps the recurrence is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) + 1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nf(1) = 2.\n\nf(2) = f(1) + f(0) + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 =4. But in the sample input, for n=4, the maximum is 2 games. So f(2) would be 4, but n=4, which is exactly f(2). So that's consistent.\n\nWait, but for k=3, f(3) would be f(2)+f(1)+1=4+2+1=7. So for n=7, the maximum is 3 games.\n\nBut what about the sample input n=3, the output is 2. For k=2, f(2)=4. But n=3 is less than 4. So in that case, the maximum k would be 2, but f(2) is 4>3. So perhaps the recurrence is not correct.\n\nHmm, maybe my initial approach is flawed.\n\nAlternative approach: For the winner to have k games, the number of players required is f(k) = 2*f(k-1) +1.\n\nWait, let's test that.\n\nf(0)=1.\n\nf(1)=2*1 +1=3.\n\nBut earlier, for k=1, we needed 2 players. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal number of players f(k) needed for the winner to have k games is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) + 1.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nf(0)=1.\n\nf(1)=1+1=2.\n\nf(2)=2+1 +1=4.\n\nf(3)=4+2+1=7.\n\nf(4)=7+4+1=12.\n\nWait, for n=10, the maximum k is 4. So f(4)=12>10, which would mean that the maximum possible k is 3. But the sample output for n=10 is 4. So this can't be right.\n\nHmm, this suggests that my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of players required is actually the (k+1)-th Fibonacci number.\n\nBecause the Fibonacci sequence goes 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc. For k=1, f(1)=2, which is Fib(3)=2.\n\nk=2, f(2)=3 (Fib(4)).\n\nWait, but according to the sample, for n=4, the maximum is 2, which would imply f(2)=4, which is Fib(5)=5.\n\nNo, that doesn't align.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest k such that f(k) ≤ n, where f(k) is the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games.\n\nWhat is f(k)?\n\nWhen the winner plays k games, the number of players needed is the sum of the first k terms of the Fibonacci sequence, starting with F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc. Or perhaps f(k) = Fib(k+2).\n\nWait, let's think about the process again. For each game the winner plays, he must have beaten someone who has a certain number of games. Let's model this as a binary tree where each node represents a game. The root is the final game, and each child is a game that happened before.\n\nEach node (game) must have children that correspond to the previous games the winner played.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of players required is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. Let's see:\n\nFor k=1, the minimal players are 2, which is Fib(4) = 3? No, wait Fib(3) is 2.\n\nHmm, maybe f(k) = Fib(k+2). Let's check:\n\nk=1: Fib(3)=2 → yes.\n\nk=2: Fib(4)=3 → but in the sample, n=4, the maximum is 2. So 3>4? No, wait n=4 is 4, which is greater than 3. So for k=2, f(k)=3, which is <=4. So the maximum is 2.\n\nWait, but for k=3, Fib(5)=5. So if n=5, can the winner play 3 games?\n\nYes, because f(3)=5.\n\nSo the idea is that for a given n, find the largest k such that Fib(k+2) ≤n.\n\nWait, let's test this hypothesis.\n\nSample Input 1: n=2.\n\nFind the largest k where Fib(k+2) ≤2.\n\nFib(3)=2 → k+2=3 →k=1. So output is 1. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: n=3.\n\nLargest k where Fib(k+2) ≤3.\n\nFib(4)=3 → k=2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: n=4.\n\nFib(4)=3 ≤4, Fib(5)=5>4. So k=2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 4: n=10.\n\nFib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13>10. So the largest k where Fib(k+2) ≤10 is k=4, since Fib(6)=8<=10.\n\nSo for n=10, the output is 4. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=7.\n\nFib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8>7. So largest k where Fib(k+2)<=7 is Fib(6)=8>7, so k=4 (Fib(6)=8>7, so no. Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting the indices wrong.\n\nWait, let me list out the Fibonacci numbers:\n\nF(1) = 1\n\nF(2) = 1\n\nF(3) = 2\n\nF(4) = 3\n\nF(5) = 5\n\nF(6) = 8\n\nF(7) = 13\n\nF(8)=21...\n\nWait, so Fib(k+2) for k=1 is Fib(3)=2.\n\nk=2: Fib(4)=3.\n\nk=3: Fib(5)=5.\n\nk=4: Fib(6)=8.\n\nSo for n=7:\n\nLooking for largest k where Fib(k+2) ≤7.\n\nCheck:\n\nk=3 → Fib(5)=5 ≤7.\n\nk=4 → Fib(6)=8>7. So maximum k is 3.\n\nThus, for n=7, output is 3.\n\nSo the pattern seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, the approach is to find the largest k such that Fib(k+2) ≤n, where Fib is the Fibonacci sequence with Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to n=1018.\n\n2. For the given n, find the maximum k where Fib(k+2) ≤n.\n\n3. Output k.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the point where Fib(m) exceeds 1018.\n\nOnce that's done, for each test case n, find the maximum k where Fib(k+2) <=n.\n\nSo, for example, for n=1018:\n\nCompute Fib(m) until it exceeds 1018.\n\nLet me compute the Fib sequence:\n\nF(1)=1\n\nF(2)=1\n\nF(3)=2\n\nF(4)=3\n\nF(5)=5\n\nF(6)=8\n\nF(7)=13\n\nF(8)=21\n\nF(9)=34\n\nF(10)=55\n\nF(11)=89\n\nF(12)=144\n\nF(13)=233\n\nF(14)=377\n\nF(15)=610\n\nF(16)=987\n\nF(17)=1597>1018.\n\nSo the maximum m is 16, Fib(16)=987.\n\nThus, for n=1018, the maximum k is 14, because Fib(14+2)=Fib(16)=987<=1018, and Fib(15+2)=Fib(17)=1597>1018.\n\nSo the output is 14.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Precompute Fib up to when Fib(m) > 1018.\n\n- For each n, find the maximum k where Fib(k+2) <=n.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nIn Python, I can precompute a list of Fib numbers, then for each input n, loop through the list to find the maximum k.\n\nSo, let's write code.\n\nRead n from stdin.\n\nCompute Fib until Fib(m) >n.\n\nThen, iterate through the Fib list to find the maximum k where Fib(k+2) <=n.\n\nWait, but the Fib list starts at F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc.\n\nWait, for each Fib(m), m starts from 1.\n\nWait, in the code, perhaps it's better to index the Fib list as follows:\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\nfor i in range(2, max_m):\n\n    next_val = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_val > 1018:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_val)\n\nThen, for n, find the largest m where fib[m] <=n, then k = m-2.\n\nWait, because Fib(m) is Fib(k+2).\n\nSo for Fib(m) = Fib(k+2), then k = m-2.\n\nSo, for example, Fib(3)=2 corresponds to k=1.\n\nThus, the code will:\n\n- Precompute fib as above.\n\n- For each n in input, find the largest m where fib[m] <=n.\n\n- Then, k = m-2.\n\nBut wait, what if n is smaller than Fib(3)=2? Like n=1.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, n is at least 2.\n\nWait, the input constraints are 2 ≤ n ≤ 1018.\n\nSo for n=2, the maximum is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute the fib list as [1,1], and then keep adding until the next value would exceed n.\n\nWait, but for n=1018, the last Fib(m) is 987.\n\nSo, perhaps the code is:\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_f = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_f > 1018:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_f)\n\nThen, for each n, find the largest m where fib[m] <=n.\n\nThen, k = m-2.\n\nBut for n=4, fib list up to 3 is [1,1,2,3,5]. Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, initial fib is [1,1].\n\nThen, next is 2, added.\n\nnext is 3, added.\n\nnext is 5, added.\n\nthen 8, added, etc.\n\nWait, for n=4, the fib list is [1,1,2,3,5]. So, the values in the list are 1,1,2,3,5.\n\nLooking for the largest m where fib[m] <=4.\n\nThe list is:\n\nfib[0]=1 (m=1?), or wait, perhaps I should index the list as starting from index 0 as m=1, index 1 as m=2, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the fib list is stored as [F(1), F(2), F(3), ...].\n\nSo for the initial list, fib[0]=1=F(1), fib[1]=1=F(2), fib[2]=2=F(3), fib[3]=3=F(4), etc.\n\nSo, for n=4, the list is [1,1,2,3,5]. So the largest m where F(m) <=4 is m=4, since F(4)=3<=4, and F(5)=5>4.\n\nThus, k = m-2=4-2=2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo, in code, for each n, find the largest m in the fib list where fib[m] <=n.\n\nThen, k = m-2.\n\nBut wait, what if n is exactly equal to a Fib(m) value.\n\nLike n=3: Fib(4)=3. So m=4, k=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo now, the code.\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute the fib list as [1,1,2,3,5,8,...] until adding next would exceed n.\n\nThen, for the given n, find the largest m where fib[m] <=n.\n\nThen, k = m-2.\n\nBut wait, what if the fib list doesn't include a value larger than n? For example, n=1, but according to problem statement, n is >=2.\n\nSo for n=2, the fib list is [1,1,2]. So the largest m where fib[m] <=2 is 2 (fib[2]=2). Thus, k=0. Wait, no, 2-2=0. But n=2, the maximum is 1.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, what is Fib(3)=2, which is the third term. So m=3, fib[3]=2.\n\nSo for n=2, the largest m is 3, so k=3-2=1. Which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, the fib list is being generated as [1,1,2,3,5, ... ].\n\nSo for n=2, the list includes 2, which is F(3). So the largest m where F(m) <=2 is m=3. So k=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, in code, for each n, we can find the maximum m where fib[m] <=n.\n\nBut the way the fib list is built, each new element is added as long as it's <=1018.\n\nSo the code for finding k is:\n\nmax_m = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(fib)):\n\n    if fib[i] <=n:\n\n        max_m = i\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nk = max_m - 2\n\nBut wait, no. Because for n=5, fib[4]=5, which is F(5). So m=5, k=3.\n\nWhich is correct because the maximum games is 3.\n\nWait, no, for n=5, the maximum k is 3.\n\nBecause the Fib sequence is F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5.\n\nSo for n=5, the largest m where F(m) <=5 is m=5. So k=5-2=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should:\n\nLoop through the fib list, and for each element, if it's <=n, set max_m to i (the index), else break.\n\nThen k = max_m-2.\n\nBut wait, in the fib list, fib[0] is F(1)=1, fib[1] is F(2)=1, fib[2] is F(3)=2, etc.\n\nSo the indexes are 0-based, but the m is the position in the sequence.\n\nSo, for each fib[i], it's F(i+1), since the list starts at F(1).\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nThe list is initially [1,1], which are F(1) and F(2).\n\nThen, each new element is the sum of the previous two.\n\nSo fib[0] = F(1) = 1.\n\nfib[1] = F(2) = 1.\n\nfib[2] = F(3) = 2.\n\nfib[3] = F(4) =3.\n\nfib[4] = F(5) =5.\n\nSo, for the ith element in the list, it's F(i+1).\n\nThus, for fib[i] = F(i+1).\n\nSo, to find the largest m where F(m) <=n, we're looking for the largest j such that F(j) <=n.\n\nSince F(j) is stored in fib[j-1], because fib[j-1] = F(j).\n\nSo, for each i in the fib list, F(i+1) is fib[i].\n\nSo, to find the largest j where F(j) <=n, we can loop through the fib list and for each i, check if fib[i] <=n.\n\nOnce we find the largest i where fib[i] <=n, then j=i+1.\n\nWait, because fib[i] is F(i+1).\n\nSo, for example, n=2.\n\nfib[0]=1 (F1), fib[1]=1 (F2), fib[2]=2 (F3).\n\nSo, for each i:\n\ni=0: F1=1 <=2 → yes.\n\ni=1: F2=1 <=2 → yes.\n\ni=2: F3=2 <=2 → yes.\n\ni=3: F4=3>2 → no.\n\nSo, the largest i is 2, which corresponds to F3=2.\n\nThus, j=3.\n\nSo, k = j-2 =1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code for finding j is:\n\nmax_j = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(fib)):\n\n    if fib[i] <=n:\n\n        max_j = i+1\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nThen, k = max_j -2.\n\nWait, but wait, in the code, for i in range(len(fib)), which is 0-based, and for each i, fib[i] is F(i+1).\n\nSo, the maximum j where F(j) <=n is the maximum i+1 where fib[i] <=n.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nmax_j = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(fib)):\n\n    if fib[i] <=n:\n\n        max_j = i+1\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nk = max_j -2\n\nBut wait, in the sample where n=3, the maximum j is 4, since F4=3.\n\nThus, k=4-2=2, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=4.\n\nfib list is [1,1,2,3,5].\n\nLooking for j where Fj <=4.\n\ni=0: 1<=4 → j=1.\n\ni=1: 1<=4 → j=2.\n\ni=2:2<=4 → j=3.\n\ni=3:3<=4 →j=4.\n\ni=4:5>4 → stop.\n\nSo j=4.\n\nk=4-2=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5.\n\nj=5, k=3.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test case: n=8.\n\nfib list up to 8 is [1,1,2,3,5,8].\n\ni=0:1<=8 → j=1.\n\ni=1:1 → j=2.\n\ni=2:2→ j=3.\n\ni=3:3→ j=4.\n\ni=4:5→ j=5.\n\ni=5:8 → j=6.\n\ni=6:13>8 → stop.\n\nmax_j=6.\n\nk=6-2=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe code will:\n\n- Read the input line as a string, split into parts.\n\n- Convert each part into integer.\n\n- For each n in the list, compute the maximum k.\n\n- Print each k.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    fib = [1, 1]\n\n    while True:\n\n        next_f = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n        if next_f > 1018:\n\n            break\n\n        fib.append(next_f)\n\n    # Now, read input\n\n    input_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    n_list = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n\n    for n in n_list:\n\n        max_j = 0\n\n        for i in range(len(fib)):\n\n            if fib[i] <= n:\n\n                max_j = i + 1\n\n            else:\n\n                break\n\n        k = max_j - 2\n\n        print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nWait, but let's test for n=2.\n\nfib is [1,1,2,3,5,8,13, etc.]\n\nLooping through i:\n\ni=0: fib[0]=1 <=2 → max_j=1.\n\ni=1: fib[1]=1 <=2 → max_j=2.\n\ni=2: fib[2]=2 <=2 → max_j=3.\n\ni=3: fib[3]=3>2 → break.\n\nThus, max_j=3.\n\nk=3-2=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3.\n\nmax_j=4.\n\nk=2. Correct.\n\nn=4.\n\nmax_j=4 →k=2.\n\nn=5: max_j=5 →k=3.\n\nn=8: max_j=6 →k=4.\n\nn=10: fib list up to 13.\n\ni runs up to where fib[i] <=10.\n\ni=0:1 → j=1.\n\ni=1:1 →j=2.\n\ni=2:2→j=3.\n\ni=3:3→j=4.\n\ni=4:5→j=5.\n\ni=5:8→j=6.\n\ni=6:13>10 → break.\n\nmax_j=6.\n\nk=6-2=4. Correct.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nAnother test case: n=6.\n\nfib list includes 1,1,2,3,5,8.\n\nFor n=6:\n\ni=0:1 →j=1.\n\ni=1:1 →j=2.\n\ni=2:2 →j=3.\n\ni=3:3 →j=4.\n\ni=4:5 →j=5.\n\ni=5:8>6 → break.\n\nmax_j=5.\n\nk=5-2=3.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nFor n=6, can the winner play 3 games?\n\nLet me see.\n\nThe required number of players is F(5) =5.\n\nSo 5<=6.\n\nThus, yes.\n\nSo the winner can play 3 games.\n\nThus, code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given that two players can only face each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the number of games the winner can play is determined by a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence. This is because each game the winner plays must be against an opponent who has either the same number of games or one less than the winner. The minimal number of players required for the winner to play `k` games is given by the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number.\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Calculation**: We precompute the Fibonacci sequence up to the point where the value exceeds 1018, as the maximum number of players `n` can be up to 1018.\n2. **Determine Maximum Games**: For each input `n`, find the largest `k` such that the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Precompute Fibonacci numbers up to the maximum possible n (1018)\n    fib = [1, 1]\n    while True:\n        next_f = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n        if next_f > 1018:\n            break\n        fib.append(next_f)\n    \n    # Read input\n    input_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n_list = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n    \n    # Process each n to find the maximum number of games\n    for n in n_list:\n        max_j = 0\n        for i in range(len(fib)):\n            if fib[i] <= n:\n                max_j = i + 1\n            else:\n                break\n        k = max_j - 2\n        print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: We generate the Fibonacci sequence starting from 1 and 1 until the next number exceeds 1018. This helps us quickly determine the minimal number of players required for any given number of games.\n2. **Find Maximum Games for Each Input**: For each input `n`, we iterate through the precomputed Fibonacci sequence to find the largest number `max_j` such that the Fibonacci number at `max_j` is less than or equal to `n`. The maximum number of games the winner can play is then `max_j - 2`.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using precomputation and linear search, ensuring that the solution is both optimal and easy to understand.",
