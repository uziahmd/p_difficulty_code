His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem statement says that Vasya participated in an Olympiad, and his teacher knows that his total points from both tours are at least x. But the teacher has the results of the first and second tours, but they're not linked to the participants' names. So the task is to determine the best and worst possible places Vasya could have gotten based on the sum of the points.\n\nHmm. So the input gives me n participants, and each has a score a_i for the first tour and b_j for the second. But the way they are given is in arbitrary order—so I don't know which a corresponds to which b. My job is to find the best and worst possible rankings Vasya could achieve.\n\nWait, but how? Because the a and b arrays are not necessarily in any order. So for each participant, their total is a[i] + b[j], but since the lists are not sorted or linked, I need to consider all possible pairings where a[i] is paired with some b[j], but each a and b can only be used once per participant.\n\nWait no, no. Because each participant took part in both tours, but the a's and b's are given in arbitrary order. So perhaps each participant's a and b are in two different lists, but the correspondence isn't known. So for each participant, their a and b are a pair, but we don't know which a_i goes with which b_j.\n\nSo the key is that for each possible pairing (each permutation of the b array matched to a), compute the sum of each participant, then sort them, and find Vasya's best and worst possible positions.\n\nBut wait, that's computationally impossible for n=105 because there are 105! permutations. So that approach isn't feasible.\n\nSo I need a smarter way to model this.\n\nLet me think about what determines the rank of Vasya. The best case is when his sum is as large as possible, and others' sums are as small as possible. The worst case is when his sum is as small as possible, given that his sum is at least x, and others' sums are arranged to make him as low as possible.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the sum is the total points, and participants are ranked in decreasing order of sum. If two have the same sum, the jury can arrange them in any order. So for the best possible position, I want Vasya to have the maximum possible sum, and for others to have as low as possible sums. For the worst possible, I want his sum to be the minimum possible (but at least x), and others as high as possible.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem states that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. So for the worst case, we need to find the minimal possible rank he can get given that his sum is >=x.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Find all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. These are the possible sums Vasya could have.\n\n2. For each possible sum s (>=x), compute the minimal possible rank and the maximal possible rank that Vasya can have.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible position is when Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and other participants' sums are as low as possible.\n\nSimilarly, the worst possible position is when Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but at least x), and other participants' sums are as high as possible.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because for the best position, we want Vasya to have the highest possible sum, and others to have lower sums. That way, he is as high as possible.\n\nFor the worst position, perhaps it's when his sum is as low as possible (still >=x), and others have as high sums as possible, making him as low as possible in the ranking.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank:\n\n- We need to maximize Vasya's sum. So for each possible a_i and b_j, their sum is as large as possible.\n\nWait, but since each a can be paired with any b, but each a and b can be used once per participant, the maximum sum for Vasya would be the maximum of a_i + b_j, for any i,j. Then, for all other participants, their a and b are taken from the remaining a's and b's, trying to form as small sums as possible.\n\nWait, but if we choose the maximum possible sum for Vasya, then for the rest, we can pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that minimizes their sums.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst case, we need to choose the minimal possible sum for Vasya (at least x), and pair the remaining a's and b's to maximize their sums.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute the best possible rank:\n\n1. Find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have, which is max(a_i + b_j) for any i,j.\n\n2. Then, create a list of the remaining a's and b's, and compute the maximum possible sum for each participant by pairing a's and b's optimally.\n\nWait, but how do I compute the maximum sum for each participant after assigning one a_i and b_j to Vasya?\n\nAlternatively, for the best case:\n\nWe need to select a pair (a_p, b_q) for Vasya such that a_p + b_q is as large as possible. Then, for the other participants, assign the remaining a's and b's such that their sums are as small as possible.\n\nThis way, Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, and others are as small as possible, leading to the best possible rank.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst case:\n\nWe need to select a pair (a_p, b_q) for Vasya such that a_p + b_q is as small as possible, but still >=x. Then, assign the remaining a's and b's to others in a way that their sums are as large as possible. This would minimize Vasya's rank.\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor best possible rank:\n\n- Iterate through all possible (i,j) pairs where a_i + b_j is >=x.\n\nWait, no. Because for the best possible rank, Vasya's sum should be as large as possible. So among all possible (i,j) that could form Vasya's sum, pick the one where a_i + b_j is the maximum possible.\n\nOnce that is chosen, assign the remaining a's and b's to other participants in a way that their sums are as small as possible.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Because the way you pair the remaining a's and b's affects the sum of others.\n\nSimilarly for the worst case.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the best possible rank.\n\nFirst, find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have, given that his sum must be at least x. Wait, but the problem says that the sum is at least x, so for the best case, we can take the maximum possible sum.\n\nSo the maximum sum is the maximum of a_i + b_j for all i,j.\n\nOnce we've chosen that, we need to assign the remaining a's and b's to the other participants in such a way that their sums are as small as possible. So that Vasya's rank is as high as possible.\n\nHow do we do that? Because after choosing a_i and b_j for Vasya, the other participants will have their a's and b's from the remaining pool.\n\nWait, perhaps to minimize the sum of others, we can pair the largest a's with the smallest b's, and vice versa.\n\nWait, no. Wait, to minimize the sum of the other participants, perhaps we should pair the largest a's with the smallest b's, which would lead to smaller sums. Or maybe the opposite.\n\nWait, let's think: for two participants, if we have a1 > a2 and b1 < b2, which pairing gives a smaller sum?\n\nIf a1 is paired with b1: a1 + b1.\n\nIf a2 is paired with b2: a2 + b2.\n\nAlternatively, if a1 is paired with b2, and a2 with b1: a1 + b2 and a2 + b1.\n\nWhich is better? It depends.\n\nWait, but in general, to minimize the sum of all other participants, perhaps we should pair the a's in decreasing order with the b's in increasing order. Because that way, larger a's are paired with smaller b's, resulting in smaller sums.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for a set of a's and b's, sorting a in descending order and b in ascending order and pairing them would give the minimal sum for the participants.\n\nSo, for the best case:\n\n1. Find the maximum possible sum s_max = max(a_i + b_j) for any i,j.\n\n   But wait, also ensuring that s_max >=x. Because the problem says that Vasya's sum is at least x.\n\n2. Once s_max is found, assign it to Vasya.\n\n3. Then, for the other participants, pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that their sums are as small as possible. This is done by sorting a's in descending order and b's in ascending order and pairing them accordingly.\n\n4. Compute the sum for each of these pairs, then count how many participants have a sum greater than or equal to s_max. Because if someone else has a sum >=s_max, they would be ranked higher than Vasya, giving him a worse rank.\n\nWait, no. Because s_max is the maximum possible, no other participant can have a sum higher than s_max. So in this case, Vasya is the first place.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because if another participant also has the same sum as s_max, then depending on the jury's decision, Vasya could be placed anywhere between first and that participant.\n\nWait, but for the best possible rank, we want to minimize the number of participants who have a sum >= s_max. So if Vasya's sum is s_max, and no one else has a sum >= s_max, then he is first.\n\nOtherwise, if others have sum equal to s_max, he might share the first place.\n\nBut for the best possible rank, we can assume that he is first.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to think that in the best case, Vasya is first.\n\nBecause, even if others have the same sum, the jury can place him first.\n\nSo for the best case, the rank is 1.\n\nWait, but looking at the sample input:\n\nIn the first sample, all participants have a sum of 2, which is equal to x. So in the best case, Vasya is first, and in the worst case, he is last.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the best and worst are both 1 and 5.\n\nWait, no, the output is '1 5' for both.\n\nSo for the best case, Vasya can be first, regardless of others' sums, because the jury can decide to place him first.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, the maximum sum is chosen, and Vasya is considered to be first.\n\nSo the best possible rank is 1.\n\nHmm, so maybe the best possible rank is always 1, because Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and the jury can place him first even if others have the same sum.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWait, no. Suppose Vasya has a sum of 10, and another participant also has 10. Then, the jury can place Vasya first, so his rank is 1.\n\nSo for the best possible, the rank is 1.\n\nSo for the best possible, the rank is 1.\n\nNow for the worst possible rank:\n\nWe need to find the minimal possible rank Vasya can get, given that his sum is at least x.\n\nTo minimize his rank, we want his sum to be as small as possible (but >=x), and the other participants' sums to be as large as possible.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible sum s_min that Vasya can have, such that s_min >=x.\n\n   How? Because Vasya's sum is a_i + b_j, and we have to choose a_i and b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. So s_min is the minimal possible sum that meets this condition.\n\n2. Once s_min is selected, the other participants' sums are as large as possible. How to compute that.\n\nWait, but how to pair the remaining a's and b's to maximize the number of participants with sums >= s_min.\n\nWait, no. To find the worst possible rank, we need to maximize the number of participants whose sum is >= s_min, thus pushing Vasya down in the rankings.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, for the worst case:\n\nWe choose the minimal possible sum s for Vasya (s >=x).\n\nThen, for the other participants, we arrange their a's and b's such that their sums are as large as possible. This will cause as many participants as possible to have sums >=s, thus increasing Vasya's rank.\n\nWait, but how to model that.\n\nWait, perhaps for the worst case, the minimal possible s is the minimal a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nOnce that s is chosen, the other participants will have their a's and b's paired in a way that maximizes their sums.\n\nSo, for the worst case:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible sum s_min that Vasya can have, i.e., s_min is the minimal a_i + b_j >=x.\n\n2. Then, for the other participants, we need to pair the remaining a's and b's in such a way that as many as possible have sums >=s_min.\n\nSo the worst possible rank is the number of participants (including Vasya) whose sum is >= s_min.\n\nBecause in that scenario, Vasya is ranked after all those participants.\n\nWait, but how do we find the number of participants (including Vasya) that can have sums >= s_min.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute, for the worst case, the minimal possible s that Vasya can have (>=x), and then compute how many participants can have sums >= s.\n\nWait, but that's not directly applicable because the sum depends on how the a's and b's are paired.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst case is determined by finding the minimal s such that s >=x, and then compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=s.\n\nBut how to calculate that.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think about the process step by step.\n\nFor the best case:\n\n- Choose the maximum possible sum for Vasya.\n\n- Then, arrange other participants' a's and b's in a way that their sums are as small as possible.\n\nThus, Vasya's rank is 1.\n\nFor the worst case:\n\n- Choose the minimal possible sum s for Vasya (s >=x).\n\n- Then, arrange other participants' a's and b's in a way that their sums are as large as possible.\n\nThus, the number of participants with sum >=s will determine Vasya's worst rank.\n\nWait, but how do we compute that.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is:\n\nFor the worst case:\n\n1. Find all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j >=x.\n\n2. For each such pair, compute s = a_i + b_j.\n\n3. Then, compute the maximum possible number of participants that can have sum >= s, using the remaining a's and b's.\n\nThe maximum over all such possible s (>=x) is the worst rank.\n\nWait, but that's computationally expensive, considering all possible s.\n\nBut n is up to 105, and x can be up to 210. So perhaps it's manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute for each possible s (all possible a_i + b_j >=x), compute the maximum number of participants (including Vasya) that can have sum >=s.\n\nThe maximum number across all s is the worst possible rank.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum number for a particular s.\n\nWait, but for a particular s, how to pair the a's and b's to maximize the number of participants with sum >=s.\n\nHow?\n\nLet me think.\n\nSuppose we have a target sum T. We need to pair the a's and b's such that as many as possible have a_i + b_j >= T.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way to maximize the count is:\n\nSort the a's in ascending order and the b's in descending order, and pair a_i with b_j in such a way that a_i is as small as possible, and b_j is as large as possible, thus maximizing the number of a_i + b_j >= T.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps to maximize the number of pairs >= T, we can sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, and then greedily match a_i with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as an assignment problem: given a set of a's and b's, pair them into n pairs, and find the maximum number of pairs where a_i + b_j >= T.\n\nThis is similar to the bipartite matching problem, but for a specific threshold.\n\nBut with n=105, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAn alternative approach is to sort a in ascending order and b in descending order. Then, try to pair a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], etc., and count how many pairs are >= T.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a way to maximize the number of pairs >= T.\n\nWait, let me test with an example.\n\nSuppose a is [1, 2, 3], b is [4,5,6], T=5.\n\nSort a in ascending: [1,2,3].\n\nSort b in descending: [6,5,4].\n\nPairing 1+6=7 >=5 → yes.\n\n2+5=7 >=5 → yes.\n\n3+4=7 >=5 → yes.\n\nAll 3 pairs are >=5. So the count is 3.\n\nAlternatively, if a is [3,2,1], sorted ascending [1,2,3], same as before.\n\nSame result.\n\nAnother example: a = [1,1], b=[2,2], T=3.\n\nPair 1+2=3 → yes.\n\n1+2=3 → yes.\n\nCount is 2.\n\nBut what if a is [1,2], b is [3,1], T=3.\n\nIf a is sorted ascending [1,2], b sorted descending [3,1].\n\nPair 1+3=4 >=3 → yes.\n\n2+1=3 >=3 → yes.\n\nCount is 2.\n\nIf a was [1,2], and b is [3,1], but sorted as [3,1], same result.\n\nBut what if a is [1,1], b is [3,3], T=3.\n\nPair 1+3=4 >=3 → yes.\n\n1+3=4 >=3 → yes.\n\nCount is 2.\n\nBut what if T is 4.\n\nIn that case, 1+3=4 → yes.\n\n1+3=4 → yes.\n\nCount is 2.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach works.\n\nSo the algorithm for a given T is:\n\nSort a in ascending order.\n\nSort b in descending order.\n\nThen, pair a[i] with b[i], for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nCount the number of pairs where a[i] + b[i] >= T.\n\nThis gives the maximum possible number of participants with sum >= T.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWell, let's see another example.\n\na = [1, 3], b = [3, 1], T=3.\n\nSort a ascending: [1,3], sort b descending: [3,1].\n\nPair 1+3=4 >=3 → yes.\n\n3+1=4 >=3 → yes.\n\nCount is 2.\n\nAnother way: a is [1,3], b is [3,1]. Pair 1+3=4, 3+1=4. Both >=3.\n\nAlternatively, if we had paired 1+1=2, 3+3=6: then 3 is >=3, 6 is >=3. So count is 2.\n\nSo same result.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother example: a = [1,4], b = [2,3], T=4.\n\nSort a ascending: [1,4], sort b descending: [3,2].\n\nPair 1+3=4 >=4 → yes.\n\n4+2=6 >=4 → yes. Count is 2.\n\nAlternatively, if a is paired as 1+2=3 <4 → no, and 4+3=7 >=4 → yes. So count is 1.\n\nSo the initial approach of pairing a ascending with b descending gives a better count.\n\nSo perhaps this method indeed gives the maximum possible number of participants with sum >=T.\n\nThus, for the worst case, for each possible s (>=x), compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=s by pairing a in ascending and b in descending order.\n\nBut wait, but s is the sum for Vasya, which is a_i + b_j.\n\nSo for each possible s (which is a_i + b_j >=x), compute the maximum number of participants (including Vasya) that can have sum >=s.\n\nThe worst rank is the maximum of this number over all possible s.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Enumerate all possible s values that are >=x and can be formed by a_i + b_j.\n\n2. For each s, compute the maximum number of participants (including Vasya) that can have sum >=s, using the pairing strategy (a sorted ascending, b sorted descending).\n\n3. The worst rank is the maximum value of this count across all s.\n\nBut wait, in the worst case, Vasya's sum is s, and the other participants' sums are as high as possible, leading to as many as possible being >=s. So the count includes Vasya himself.\n\nBut when you compute the maximum count, it's possible that Vasya's sum is s, and others can have higher sums, thus putting him in a lower position.\n\nSo the worst possible rank is the maximum count across all s.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead a as a list.\n\nRead b as a list.\n\nGenerate all possible s where s = a[i] + b[j], for all i, j, and s >=x.\n\nFor each such s:\n\n   Create a copy of a and b.\n\n   Remove the i-th and j-th elements from a and b, respectively.\n\n   Sort the remaining a in ascending order.\n\n   Sort the remaining b in descending order.\n\n   Pair each a[k] with b[k], for k from 0 to n-1.\n\n   For each pair, check if a[k] + b[k] >=s.\n\n   Count the number of such pairs.\n\n   Keep track of the maximum count across all s.\n\nThe worst possible rank is this maximum count.\n\nSimilarly, for the best possible rank, it's always 1.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCompute best_rank = 1.\n\nFor worst_rank:\n\nInitialize max_count = 0.\n\nFor each possible s (a_i + b_j >=x):\n\n   Make copies of a and b.\n\n   Remove the i-th and j-th elements.\n\n   Sort the remaining a in ascending order.\n\n   Sort the remaining b in descending order.\n\n   Initialize count = 0.\n\n   For each k in 0..n-1:\n\n      if (a_sorted[k] + b_sorted[k]) >= s:\n\n          count +=1\n\n   if count > max_count:\n\n       max_count = count\n\nSet worst_rank = max_count.\n\nSo, in the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=5, x=2.\n\na = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nb = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nSo all possible s are 2.\n\nFor each s=2, when pairing:\n\na is [1,1,1,1], sorted ascending.\n\nb is [1,1,1,1], sorted descending.\n\nEach pair is 2, so count is 5.\n\nmax_count is 5.\n\nSo worst_rank is 5.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=6, x=2.\n\nWait, no, the second sample in the note is:\n\nInput:\n6 2\n4 3 5 6 4 4\n8 6 0 4 3 4\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine.\n\nWait, the sample input given in the problem is:\n\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\nWait, perhaps the actual inputs are:\n\nThe first line is 5 participants, x=2.\n\nThe a list is [1,1,1,1,1].\n\nThe b list is [1,1,1,1,1].\n\nSo in this case, all possible s are 2.\n\nWhen s=2, the other 4 participants have a sum of 2 each. So when pairing, the count is 5, so worst rank is 5.\n\nSo the output is 1 5.\n\nSo in code, the steps are manageable.\n\nBut now, how to implement this efficiently.\n\nThe problem is that for each possible s, which can be up to 210, and for each s, we have to generate a new pairing.\n\nBut for n=105, this could be time-consuming.\n\nWait, but the number of possible s is O(n^2), since each s is a sum of a[i]+b[j], which can be up to 210. So for n=105, the number of possible s is 105*105=11025, but considering that s can be up to 210, perhaps many s's are duplicates.\n\nSo we can precompute all possible s and group them, then for each unique s >=x, compute the max count.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute all possible s = a[i] + b[j], for all i and j.\n\n2. Collect all unique s where s >=x.\n\n3. For each such s, compute the maximum number of pairs >=s as per the pairing strategy.\n\n4. The worst_rank is the maximum count across all s.\n\nNow, the code outline.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n, x.\n\na = list of integers.\n\nb = list of integers.\n\nCompute all possible s:\n\npossible_s = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        s = a[i] + b[j]\n\n        if s >=x:\n\n            possible_s.add(s)\n\npossible_s = sorted(possible_s)\n\nbest_rank = 1\n\nmax_worst = 0\n\nfor s in possible_s:\n\n    # create copies of a and b, remove a[i] and b[j]\n\n    # but wait, for each s, which i and j are used? Because s is a specific a[i] + b[j].\n\n    # So for each s, we need to choose a pair (i,j) where a[i] + b[j] = s.\n\n    # Wait, but how to handle multiple (i,j) pairs leading to the same s.\n\n    # Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nAh, right! Because for a given s, there are multiple (i,j) pairs that could produce it. Each of these may lead to different a and b left, hence different counts.\n\nSo, for example, if s can be achieved by multiple (i,j) pairs, each pair will leave different a and b arrays, leading to different counts.\n\nSo for each s, we have to consider all possible (i,j) pairs that produce s, and for each, compute the count, then take the maximum.\n\nWait, but this is computationally expensive, as for each s, we have to iterate over all possible (i,j) that contribute to that s.\n\nBut for n=105, this can be O(105^2 * 105^2) operations, which is 105^4= about 1e10, which is way too slow.\n\nThat's not feasible.\n\nSo, this approach won't work.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of considering all possible (i,j) pairs, perhaps find a way to find the minimal s for which the maximum possible count is achieved.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to pair a and b is such that for the worst case, the minimal possible s is chosen, and the maximum count for that s is computed.\n\nBut earlier reasoning suggests that the worst case is determined by choosing the minimal s (>=x) and computing the maximum number of participants with sum >=s.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nFind all possible s values that are >=x.\n\nFor each s, compute the maximum possible count of participants (including Vasya) that can have sum >=s.\n\nThe worst possible rank is the maximum count across all s.\n\nBut to compute this, for each s, we need to find the maximum number of pairs (after removing one a and one b) where a_i + b_j >=s.\n\nBut how to find this maximum without considering all possible (i,j) pairs.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nFor a given s, the maximum number of pairs with sum >=s is equal to the maximum number of (a_i, b_j) pairs such that a_i + b_j >=s, after selecting a single (i,j) pair as Vasya's.\n\nSo for each s, the maximum count is the maximum, over all possible (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=s, of the number of pairs in the remaining a and b that can form >=s.\n\nBut again, this is O(n^2) for each s, which is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nInstead of considering all possible (i,j) pairs for each s, perhaps find the s that maximizes the count, and for that s, compute the maximum count.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst case is when Vasya's sum is as small as possible, so s is the minimal possible.\n\nThus, for the worst case, we need to find s_min, which is the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have (>=x), and then compute the maximum count for s_min.\n\nBecause if s is as small as possible, then more participants can have sum >=s, leading to a higher count.\n\nSo perhaps the worst case is determined by the minimal s that Vasya can have (s >=x), and for that s, compute the maximum count.\n\nThus, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute s_min, the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have, which is s_min = min{a_i + b_j | a_i + b_j >=x}.\n\n2. Then, compute the maximum number of participants (including Vasya) that can have sum >=s_min, using the pairing strategy.\n\n3. The worst rank is this count.\n\nBut wait, is this correct?\n\nBecause for the worst case, perhaps a higher s could lead to a higher count.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think with an example.\n\nSuppose a = [1, 10], b = [9, 10], x=10.\n\nPossible s:\n\ns=10: 1+9=10, 10+10=20.\n\ns=19: 10+9=19.\n\nSo possible s >=10 are 10, 19, 20.\n\nNow, for s=10:\n\nWe need to choose either (1,9) or (10,10).\n\nCase 1: Choose (1,9). Remaining a is [10], b is [10].\n\nPair 10+10=20 >=10 → count is 2.\n\nCase 2: Choose (10,10). Remaining a is [1], b is [9].\n\nPair 1+9=10 >=10 → count is 2.\n\nSo maximum count is 2.\n\nFor s=19:\n\nChoose (10,9): 10+9=19 >=19.\n\nRemaining a is [1], b is [10].\n\nPair 1+10=11 <19 → count is 1.\n\nOr choose (10,10): but 10+10=20 >=19.\n\nRemaining a is [1], b is [9].\n\nPair 1+9=10 <19 → count is 1.\n\nThus, maximum count is 1.\n\nFor s=20:\n\nChoose (10,10). Remaining a is [1], b is [9].\n\nPair 1+9=10 <20 → count is 1.\n\nOr choose (1,9): 10 is not >=20 → invalid, as s is 20.\n\nWait, no: when s=20, the chosen pair must have sum >=20.\n\nOnly (10,10) satisfies this.\n\nSo when we choose (10,10), the remaining a is [1], b is [9].\n\nPair 1+9=10 <20 → count is 1.\n\nThus, for s=20, maximum count is 1.\n\nSo for each s in possible s >=x, the maximum count is:\n\ns=10 → 2.\n\ns=19 →1.\n\ns=20 →1.\n\nThus, the worst rank is 2.\n\nBut what if we choose s=10, which is the minimal possible s >=x, and the maximum count is 2.\n\nWhich is the worst possible rank.\n\nBut what if s=19 is chosen, but the count is 1.\n\nSo the overall maximum count is 2.\n\nThus, the worst rank is 2.\n\nSo in this example, the minimal s leads to the maximum count.\n\nThus, the worst case is determined by the minimal possible s.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is:\n\nFind the minimal s that Vasya can have (s >=x).\n\nThen, compute the maximum possible count of participants (including Vasya) that can have sum >=s.\n\nThat count is the worst possible rank.\n\nSo this reduces the problem to:\n\n1. Find s_min, the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have, which is >=x.\n\n2. Then, compute the maximum count for s_min.\n\nThus, the code can be optimized.\n\nSo the steps for the worst case:\n\n- Find the minimal s >=x that can be formed by a_i + b_j.\n\n- For this s, compute the maximum count of pairs >=s.\n\n- The worst rank is this count.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as:\n\nCompute s_min as the minimal a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nThen, compute the maximum number of participants (including Vasya) that can have sum >=s_min, using the pairing strategy.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nCompute s_min as the minimal possible sum (>=x) that Vasya can have.\n\nThen, for s = s_min, compute the maximum count as follows:\n\n- Find all (i,j) where a[i] + b[j] == s_min.\n\n- For each such (i,j), remove a[i] and b[j], then sort the remaining a in ascending, and b in descending, pair them, count how many pairs are >=s_min.\n\n- Take the maximum count across all (i,j) pairs.\n\nThe worst_rank is this maximum count.\n\nBut wait, why? Because for each (i,j) that produces s_min, the remaining a and b may lead to different counts.\n\nWe need to find the (i,j) that, when removed, allows the maximum count of pairs >=s_min.\n\nThus, the code needs to:\n\n1. Compute s_min.\n\n2. Collect all possible (i,j) pairs where a[i] + b[j] == s_min.\n\n3. For each (i,j) in this list:\n\n   a. Create copies of a and b, remove a[i] and b[j].\n\n   b. Sort the remaining a in ascending, remaining b in descending.\n\n   c. Pair each a[k] with b[k], count how many pairs are >=s_min.\n\n4. The maximum count across all these (i,j) is the worst_rank.\n\nSo in the earlier example, when s_min is 10, and the possible (i,j) are (0,0) and (1,1):\n\nFor (0,0): a becomes [10], b becomes [10]. Sorted a: [10], sorted b: [10]. Pair 10+10=20 >=10 → count=1.\n\nWait, wait. No, wait, the a and b after removing (0,0):\n\nOriginal a = [1,10], remove a[0], a becomes [10].\n\nOriginal b = [9,10], remove b[0], b becomes [10].\n\nSort a: [10], sort b: [10].\n\nPair 10+10=20 >=10 → count is 1.\n\nFor (1,1): a becomes [1], b becomes [9].\n\nSort a: [1], sort b: [9].\n\nPair 1+9=10 >=10 → count is 1.\n\nSo the maximum count is 1.\n\nBut earlier analysis said that the maximum count is 2.\n\nWait, this contradicts the earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier example.\n\nWait, the example was a = [1,10], b = [9,10], x=10.\n\ns_min is 10.\n\nPossible (i,j) pairs that give s=10:\n\n(0,0): a[0]=1, b[0]=9 → sum 10.\n\n(1,1): a[1]=10, b[1]=10 → sum 20.\n\nWait, but 20 is >=x, but s_min is 10.\n\nSo when s=10, the possible (i,j) are (0,0) and (1,1)?\n\nWait, no. Because for (1,1), a[i] + b[j] is 20, which is >=x.\n\nBut s_min is 10, which is less than 20.\n\nSo in this case, the s_min is 10, but the (i,j) pairs that produce s=10 are (0,0).\n\nBecause a[i] + b[j] for (0,0) is 1+9=10.\n\nOther pairs:\n\n(0,1): ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The results of the tours are given as two separate lists, but without knowing the correspondence between the participants' names and their scores.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: The best rank Vasya can achieve is always 1. This is because if Vasya has the highest possible sum of points from both tours, the jury can place him first even if others have the same sum.\n\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To find the worst rank, we need to consider the minimum possible sum Vasya could have while still being at least `x`. For this sum, we then determine how many other participants can have sums greater than or equal to this minimum sum, thus pushing Vasya to a lower rank.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Compute all possible s where s = a[i] + b[j] >= x\npossible_s = set()\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        s = a[i] + b[j]\n        if s >= x:\n            possible_s.add(s)\n\nif not possible_s:\n    print(\"0 0\")\n    exit()\n\ns_min = min(possible_s)\nmax_count = 0\n\n# Find all (i,j) pairs where a[i] + b[j] == s_min\ncandidates = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if a[i] + b[j] == s_min:\n            candidates.append((i, j))\n\n# Now, for each candidate (i,j), compute the count\nmax_count = 0\nfor (i, j) in candidates:\n    # Create copies and remove a[i] and b[j]\n    new_a = a[:i] + a[i+1:]\n    new_b = b[:j] + b[j+1:]\n    \n    # Sort new_a ascending and new_b descending\n    new_a_sorted = sorted(new_a)\n    new_b_sorted = sorted(new_b, reverse=True)\n    \n    count = 0\n    for k in range(len(new_a_sorted)):\n        if new_a_sorted[k] + new_b_sorted[k] >= s_min:\n            count += 1\n    if count > max_count:\n        max_count = count\n\nprint(f\"1 {max_count}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of participants `n`, the minimum points `x`, the scores from the first tour `a`, and the scores from the second tour `b`.\n\n2. **Possible Sums**: We generate all possible sums `s` that can be formed by adding elements from `a` and `b`, ensuring each sum is at least `x`.\n\n3. **Minimum Sum**: The smallest possible sum `s_min` that is still at least `x` is identified.\n\n4. **Candidates Pairs**: Identify all pairs `(i, j)` where the sum of `a[i]` and `b[j]` equals `s_min`.\n\n5. **Compute Maximum Count**: For each candidate pair, simulate the scenario where Vasya's sum is `s_min`. Pair the remaining scores optimally to maximize the number of participants with sums greater than or equal to `s_min`.\n\n6. **Output Result**: The best rank is always 1, and the worst rank is the maximum count found in the previous step.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the best and worst possible ranks by leveraging sorting and greedy pairing strategies to simulate optimal participant rankings.",
