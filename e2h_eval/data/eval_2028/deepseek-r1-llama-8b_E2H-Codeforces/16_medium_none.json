Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Crazy Town,\" and from the description, it seems like it involves lines dividing a plane into regions, and moving between these regions with certain rules.\n\nHmm, the task is to find the minimum number of steps to get from the home block to the university block. Each step can move from one block to another if they share a common border of non-zero length. So, the key here is understanding how the lines partition the plane and how the regions are connected.\n\nWait, the problem says that two blocks are adjacent if their shared boundary has non-zero length. So, for example, if two regions meet only at a single point (an intersection), that doesn't count as a shared border. They must share a line segment.\n\nI remember that when multiple lines intersect, they form a planar graph where each region is a face. The adjacency between regions depends on whether their boundaries share an edge (a line segment). So, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path in this graph, where each node is a region, and edges exist between adjacent regions.\n\nBut wait, the number of regions could be very large, especially since n can be up to 300. So, building such a graph explicitly isn't feasible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nOh right! Maybe we can model this using the concept of arrangement of lines and determine the parity or some other property that determines the regions' relationships. Another thought: perhaps each line partitions the plane into two parts. So, the arrangement of lines forms a structure where each region is on one side or the other of each line.\n\nWait, but with multiple lines, the regions can be determined by their positions relative to each line. For each line, the region can be on one side or the other. But with n lines, there are 2^n possible combinations, which for n=300 is way too big.\n\nSo that's not directly helpful. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: think about the dual graph of the arrangement. In computational geometry, the dual graph represents adjacency between regions. But again, for n=300, the number of regions could be enormous, making this approach impractical.\n\nWait, but maybe the key lies in the fact that each time a line is crossed, the parity of the side changes. So, the minimal path can be determined based on how many lines separate the two points.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to the problem where you have a set of lines, and you want to know how many times you have to cross them to get from point A to point B. And each crossing flips some state, and the minimal number of steps is the number of lines that separate the two points, divided by something.\n\nWait, in the problem where you have to move through lines, each time you cross a line, you change your state. So, if a line separates your current position from the target, you must cross it. But in our case, the movement is between regions, and each step allows crossing a single line.\n\nWait, no. Because each step can move between any adjacent regions, which may involve crossing multiple lines if those regions are separated by several lines.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each region can be represented as a vector of its position relative to each line. For each line, the region is either on one side or the other. Then, the number of lines that separate the home and university points would determine something about the minimal path.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Imagine all the lines as cutting the plane. For any two points, the lines that separate them are exactly the lines where the two points lie on opposite sides. So, for each line, check if home and university are on different sides. The number of such lines is k.\n\nNow, perhaps the minimal number of steps required is equal to k. Or maybe it's the ceiling of k/2 or something like that.\n\nWait, let me think about the example given.\n\nIn the sample input:\n\nHome is at (1,1), university at (-1,-1). There are 3 roads.\n\nThe first road is 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y = 0. Home is at y=1, university at y=-1. So, they are on opposite sides of this line.\n\nSecond road is x=0: home is x=1, university is x=-1. Opposite sides.\n\nThird road is x + y -3 =0. At home, 1+1-3 =-1 <0. At university, (-1)+(-1)-3 =-5 <0. So same side. So only two lines separate them.\n\nThe output is 2 steps.\n\nHmm, so in this case, the number of separating lines is 2, and the answer is 2. So perhaps the minimal steps is equal to the number of separating lines.\n\nAnother test case: suppose there is 1 line that separates the two points. Then the minimal steps would be 1.\n\nWait, but if the two points are on the same side of all lines, then no steps are needed.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal number of steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n1. For each line, determine whether the home and university are on opposite sides. Count the total number of such lines, say 'count'.\n\n2. The minimal steps required is 'count'.\n\nWait, but why? How does that make sense?\n\nWell, because each line that separates them can be crossed once, and each crossing takes you from one region to another. Since each step can cross a single line, but wait no—because each step can move to an adjacent region, which might require crossing multiple lines. Or wait, no: each step can only move between regions that share a common border. So, the path would have to go through each separating line exactly once.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of steps is indeed equal to the number of lines that separate the two points. Because each such line must be crossed exactly once in the path.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\nFor each line, compute whether the home and university are on different sides. Sum the count.\n\nOutput that count.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with the sample.\n\nSample Input:\n\nHome: (1,1)\n\nUniversity: (-1,-1)\n\nLines:\n\nLine 1: y=0 → home is above, university is below → different sides. Count +=1.\n\nLine 2: x=0 → home is right, university is left → different sides. Count +=1.\n\nLine3: x + y -3=0. Let's compute for both points.\n\nAt home: 1+1-3= -1.\n\nAt university: -1-1-3= -5.\n\nSame sign, same side. So no count.\n\nTotal count is 2. Output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: suppose 3 lines, none separate the two points. Then output is 0.\n\nAnother case: 2 lines that do not separate the two points. So output is 0.\n\nWait, but what if two lines do separate the points, but the regions are arranged such that you can move between them via a single step? No, because each step can only cross one line at a time.\n\nWait, no. Because each line that separates the two points would require crossing it once, but perhaps in a way that allows moving through multiple regions with a single step.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the movement rules. The problem states that in one step, you can move from one block to another if their common border has non-zero length. So, two regions can be adjacent even if they are separated by multiple lines, but share a border that's a line segment along a single line.\n\nWait, no. If two regions are separated by multiple lines, their common border must consist of a union of line segments along the intersections of the lines.\n\nWait, but I think that in the arrangement of lines, two regions can share a border that's a segment on a single line, but also can share a more complex border if they are adjacent across multiple lines.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because two regions that are adjacent across multiple lines would have a common boundary that's formed by the intersection of multiple lines, which may result in a polygonal boundary.\n\nBut regardless, the minimal number of steps to move from one region to another would depend on how the regions are connected through lines.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps the initial approach is correct: the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the two points.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each line, determine whether the home and university are on opposite sides. Sum the count, and output that.\n\nSo, now, how to implement this.\n\nEach line is given by aix + biy + ci = 0. We can evaluate this for each point.\n\nCompute the value for home: a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n\nCompute the value for university: a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n\nIf the signs are different, then the points are on opposite sides of the line, so increment count.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\nRead home (x1,y1), university (x2,y2).\n\nRead n.\n\nInitialize count=0.\n\nFor each of the next n lines:\n\n    Read a, b, c.\n\n    Compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n\n    Compute val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:  # different signs\n\n        count +=1\n\nPrint count.\n\nWait, but what if val1 is zero or val2 is zero? Well, the problem statement says that neither home nor university lie on any road. So, val1 and val2 are never zero. So, checking if val1 * val2 <0 is sufficient.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code is straightforward.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0 → line y=0.\n\nval1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0=1 >0.\n\nval2=0*(-1) +1*(-1)+0= -1 <0.\n\nSo, different signs → count +=1.\n\nSecond line:1 0 0 → x=0.\n\nval1=1*1 +0*1 +0=1>0.\n\nval2=1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0= -1 <0.\n\nDifferent signs → count +=1.\n\nThird line:1 1 -3.\n\nval1 =1*1 +1*1 -3= -1 <0.\n\nval2=1*(-1)+1*(-1) -3= -5 <0.\n\nSame signs → no addition.\n\nTotal count is 2. So output 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSuppose home and university are on the same side of all lines → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: 3 lines, two separate.\n\nThen output is 2.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nThus, the solution is to count the number of lines that separate the two points, i.e., the lines where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nThus, the code should read the inputs, compute for each line whether the two points are on opposite sides, and sum the count.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. The town is divided by multiple lines, and each step can only move between blocks that share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each line in Crazy Town divides the plane into two halves. If you are on opposite sides of a line, it means you can move between those two regions in one step. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting how many lines separate the home block from the university block.\n\n1. **Evaluate Each Line**: For each line defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\), determine if the home and university points lie on opposite sides of the line.\n2. **Count Separating Lines**: For each line that separates the home and university points, increment a counter.\n3. **Result**: The minimum number of steps required is equal to the count of such separating lines.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input for home and university\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of lines and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Line Evaluation**: For each line, compute the value of the line equation at both the home and university points. If these values have opposite signs, it means the points are on opposite sides of the line.\n3. **Counting Separations**: Each time the points are on opposite sides of a line, increment the count.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total count, which represents the minimum number of steps needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the geometric property of lines dividing the plane, ensuring an optimal solution.",
