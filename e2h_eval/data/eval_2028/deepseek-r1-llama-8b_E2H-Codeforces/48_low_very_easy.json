            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about converting a number from one base to another, but with some Roman numeral rules involved. Oh right, and the bases can be up to 25, which is manageable.\n\nThe input gives me two integers a and b. Wait, but b could be 'R', which indicates that the target base uses Roman numerals. Interesting. Then, there's a string c which is in base a. My task is to convert this into base b, but using Roman numerals if needed.\n\nLet me break this down. So first, I need to parse the input correctly. The first line has a and b, but b might be R. The second line is the number c in base a.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Read a and b. If b is R, then the output should be in Roman numerals. Otherwise, it's in base b as a decimal string.\n\n2. Convert the number c from base a to an integer (in base 10).\n\n3. Then, convert that integer to the target base (either as a decimal string or as Roman numerals if b is R).\n\nWait, but wait—no, because for cases where b is not R, the output is just the number in base b as a string without leading zeros. For example, if a is 10, b is 2, and c is 5, then 5 in base 2 is 101, so the output is '101'.\n\nBut when b is R, the output is the Roman numeral equivalent of the integer value of c.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read a and b: if b is R, then we'll process the output as Roman numerals. Else, process it as a regular number in base b.\n\nThen, read c, which is a string representing a number in base a. We need to convert this to a decimal integer.\n\nOnce we have the decimal integer, we can proceed to convert it to the target base.\n\nSo, let's think about how to handle each part.\n\nFirst, converting c from base a to a decimal integer. That's straightforward. Each digit is multiplied by a^(position) and summed.\n\nBut wait, the digits in c can be letters? No, the input is a non-negative integer c in base a. Wait, no—wait, the input says \"a single non-negative integer c in base a\". So c is a string that represents a number in base a, using digits 0-9 and perhaps letters? Or wait, no—wait, base a is up to 25, so digits can be 0 to a-1. But since a can be up to 25, the digits can be represented as 0-9 and A-Z, but I'm not sure if the input includes letters for digits beyond 9. Looking at the sample input:\n\nIn the sample, one of the inputs is 'A' as part of the last test case. Wait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input is:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nHmm, so the last one is c = 'A' in base 12. So 'A' represents 10 in base 12. Then, converted to base 13, which is just 'A' again.\n\nWait, but in base 12, 'A' is 10, and in base 13, 'A' is also 10. So the output is 'A'.\n\nSo, the c string can consist of letters, but how are they handled?\n\nWait, the problem statement says that c is a non-negative integer in base a. So, for example, in base a=16, 'A' would represent 10. But when a is less than 10, letters aren't used for digits. So, for a given c string, each character is a digit in base a. So, I need to process each character in c, mapping it to its corresponding value.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, c is written in base a, which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. So, each digit in c is either a numeric character or a letter, depending on the base a.\n\nWait, no. Because in base a, the digits allowed are 0 to a-1. So for a=10, digits are 0-9, and for a=16, digits are 0-9 and A-F.\n\nSo, the function to convert c to decimal will need to take each character in c and map it to its corresponding value in base a.\n\nSo, for example, if a is 16, then 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. But if a is 10, then 'A' is invalid",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from one base to another, taking into account the unique rules of Roman numerals when the target base is greater than 10. The solution involves parsing the input, converting the number to a decimal integer, and then converting it back to the target base or to Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the input values for the source base `a` and the target base `b`, where `b` can be 'R' indicating Roman numerals.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: Convert the given number `c` from base `a` to a decimal integer. This involves processing each digit of `c` and summing their contributions based on their position.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**: Depending on whether `b` is 'R', convert the decimal integer to either a regular number in base `b` or to Roman numerals.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the result without leading zeros.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    a_b = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    a = int(a_b[0])\n    b_str = a_b[1].strip()\n    \n    c_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    c = c_line.split()[1]\n    \n    # Convert c from base a to decimal\n    decimal = 0\n    for ch in c:\n        val = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else (ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10)\n        if val >= a:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid character in c for base a\")\n        decimal += val * (a ** (len(c) - 1 - len(ch)))\n    \n    # Determine output format\n    if b_str == 'R':\n        print(roman(decimal))\n        return\n    \n    # Convert decimal to base b as string\n    if decimal == 0:\n        print('0')\n        return\n    \n    res = []\n    while decimal > 0:\n        rem = decimal % b\n        decimal = decimal // b\n        res.append(str(rem))\n    res.reverse()\n    print(''.join(res))\n\ndef roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for i, v in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res.append(v)\n            num -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the source base `a` and the target base `b`. If `b` is 'R', it indicates that the result should be in Roman numerals.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: Each character of the input number `c` is converted to its corresponding value in base `a`. This involves checking if the character is a digit or a letter and adjusting the value accordingly.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', the decimal number is converted to Roman numerals using a predefined list of value-symbol pairs, which are iterated to build the Roman numeral string.\n4. **Base Conversion**: For regular bases, the number is converted by repeatedly dividing the decimal number by the base and collecting remainders.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed without leading zeros, ensuring the correct format for both numeric and Roman numeral outputs.",
