The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Frog Jumping.\" Hmm. Let me read the description carefully.\n\nThe frog starts at position 0 on a number line. It can jump either +a or -b each time. For each x, f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach without stepping outside [0, x]. We need to compute the sum of f(i) from i=0 to m.\n\nWait, so for each i from 0 to m, we calculate f(i), which counts how many positions the frog can reach without going beyond i (or maybe exactly up to i). Then sum all these f(i)s.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the sample input first to get some intuition.\n\nIn the first example, m=7, a=5, b=3.\n\nFor x=0: the frog can't jump, so only 0 is reachable. So f(0)=1.\n\nx=1: same as before, no jumps possible because a=5 is larger than 1. So f(1)=1.\n\nSimilarly, for x=2,3,4: same as x=0,1,2,3,4? Because a=5 is bigger than those, so no jumps. So f(x) is 1 for x <5.\n\nAt x=5: the frog can now jump from 0 to 5. So f(5)=2? Wait, wait. Or wait, the frog can make a jump of +a, but in x=5, it's allowed. So the reachable positions are 0 and 5. So f(5) is 2.\n\nWait no, the sample output says that for the first case, f(5)=3. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, let's look at the note. Oh right, in the first example, the sum is 19, which includes f(0) to f(7). And for f(5), the value is 3. So perhaps my initial reasoning was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that for x=5, the frog can only reach 0 and 5. But according to the note, f(5) is 3. So that suggests that there are more positions reachable within 0-5.\n\nWait, maybe the frog can also make multiple jumps. Like, from 0, jump +a to 5. But then, from 5, can it jump back? Wait, no, because the frog can choose between +a or -b. So when at 5, it can jump back by 3, reaching 2. From 2, it can't jump further because a=5 is larger than 2. So the reachable positions are 0,5,2. So for x=5, f(5)=3. That makes sense.\n\nSo the frog can take multiple steps, possibly jumping forward and backward, as long as it doesn't go beyond [0, x].\n\nHmm, so for each x, f(x) is the count of all reachable positions within 0 to x, considering any possible path.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute the sum from x=0 to m of f(x).\n\nGiven that m can be up to 1e9, we can't compute each x individually. We need a mathematical approach to find the sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem.\n\nFirst, the frog can move in steps of +a and -b. So the possible positions the frog can reach are numbers of the form k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, such that the position is >=0 and <=x.\n\nBut wait, since the frog can make any number of jumps, positive and negative, the reachable positions are determined by the linear combinations of a and b.\n\nWait, but a and b are given, and they are positive. So the minimal step is gcd(a, b). Hmm, that might come into play.\n\nWait, if a and b are such that their greatest common divisor is d, then any reachable position must be a multiple of d. Because each step adds or subtracts multiples of a and b, which are both multiples of d.\n\nSo, the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, and satisfies certain conditions based on a and b.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the frog is starting at 0, and each jump is either +a or -b. So the reachable positions are all numbers that can be written as s*a - t*b, where s and t are non-negative integers, and the result is >=0 and <=x.\n\nBut since a and b could be large, and m is up to 1e9, we need a way to model this.\n\nLet me consider the minimal step that can be taken. Suppose d = gcd(a,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the sum of the number of distinct positions a frog can reach on a number line, starting from position 0, for each integer x from 0 to m. The frog can jump either forward by a units or backward by b units without stepping outside the interval [0, x].\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog can reach positions that are linear combinations of `a` and `b`. The key insight is that the reachable positions are determined by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`, which we denote as `d`.\n\n2. **Mathematical Formulation**: The frog can reach any position that is a multiple of `d` and within the bounds [0, x]. The number of such positions can be determined using the formula derived from the properties of gcd.\n\n3. **Summing Over Intervals**: For each x, the number of reachable positions forms a periodic pattern due to the nature of gcd. We can use this periodicity to compute the sum efficiently without iterating through each x individually.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: By identifying the period and the number of complete periods within the range from 0 to m, we can compute the sum using arithmetic series and modular arithmetic.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    a = int(input[1])\n    b = int(input[2])\n    \n    if a == 0 or b == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    s = a + b\n    if d != 0:\n        s = d\n    \n    max_pos = m\n    full_cycles = max_pos // s\n    remainder = max_pos % s\n    \n    total = full_cycles * (s + 1) * (s // 2)\n    \n    start = s - remainder - 1 if remainder > 0 else s - 1\n    end = max_pos - (start + 1)\n    count = end // d + 1\n    if count < 0:\n        count = 0\n    total += count * (count - 1) // 2\n    total += (count - 1) * (start + 1) + end + 1\n    \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **GCD Calculation**: Compute the gcd of `a` and `b` to determine the step size `d`.\n2. **Periodicity**: The frog's reachability pattern repeats every `d` units. This periodicity allows us to compute the sum over large ranges efficiently.\n3. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: Calculate the number of complete cycles of `d` within the range [0, m] and handle the remaining part separately.\n4. **Sum Calculation**: Use arithmetic series to sum the contributions from complete cycles and the remainder part to get the final result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle very large values of `m` efficiently, avoiding the need for iterative computation for each x up to m.",
