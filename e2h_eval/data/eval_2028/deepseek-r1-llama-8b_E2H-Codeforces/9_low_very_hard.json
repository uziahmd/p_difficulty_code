Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Selling Souvenirs.\" Hmm, I think I understand the gist. Petya has a bunch of souvenirs, each with a weight and cost. He wants to select a subset where the total weight doesn't exceed m, and the total cost is as high as possible. So it's like the classic knapsack problem, right?\n\nWait, but wait. The constraints are a bit tricky here. The number of souvenirs, n, can be up to 10^5, which is 100,000. And the maximum weight m can be up to 300,000. Oh, that's a lot. So a standard dynamic programming approach might not work because the time complexity would be O(n*m), which for these numbers is way too big—like 3e10 operations. That's definitely not going to run in reasonable time.\n\nSo I need a more efficient approach. Let's think about the weights: each souvenir has a weight of either 1, 2, or 3. Oh! That's a key point. Because the weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3, maybe we can find a way to group or process these items differently.\n\nI remember that when the weight is small, especially bounded, there are optimizations possible. Like, for each possible weight, we can keep track of the best value per unit weight or something similar. Or perhaps, for each possible count of items of each weight, calculate the maximum value.\n\nWait, another approach: Since the weights are small, maybe we can group the items by their weight. So we can have three groups: group1 contains all items with weight 1, group2 with weight 2, and group3 with weight 3.\n\nFor each group, we can sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each group, we can precompute the prefix sums. That way, for any number of items taken from a group, we know the total cost and total weight quickly.\n\nOnce we have these prefix sums, the problem reduces to selecting some number of items from each group such that the total weight (sum of 1s, 2s, 3s) is <= m, and the sum of costs is maximized.\n\nBut how do we combine these? Since the weight contributions vary, it's not straightforward. Maybe we can try all possible combinations of taking k1 items from group1, k2 from group2, and k3 from group3, where the total weight is k1 + 2*k2 + 3*k3 <= m. But even this seems computationally expensive because for each possible k1, k2, k3, checking if the sum is <=m could be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a greedy approach for each group. For example, take as many as possible from group3, then group2, then group1. But that might not always give the optimal solution. Like, sometimes taking one less group3 item to allow more group2 or group1 items could yield a higher total cost.\n\nHmm, so the optimal solution probably requires a combination of the groups. But considering the constraints, maybe we can model this as a bounded knapsack problem with items having small weights and a manageable number of types.\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible weight m. It's 3e5, which is manageable if we can represent the DP state efficiently.\n\nWait, another idea: For each possible total weight up to m, we can track the maximum cost. Then, for each item, we can consider adding it to the existing states. But with n=1e5 and m=3e5, this would be O(n * m), which is 3e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo that approach won't work. We need a smarter way.\n\nGiven that the weights are 1, 2, or 3, perhaps we can model the problem using a DP that keeps track of the number of items taken modulo some small number. For instance, since each item is either 1, 2, or 3, maybe we can split the DP into different states based on the remainder when dividing the current weight by some value.\n\nWait, for example, let's think of the DP as keeping track of the maximum cost for a certain weight. For each item, when we add it, it increases the weight by its own weight and adds its cost. But processing this naively is too slow.\n\nAlternative approach: Since each weight is 1, 2, or 3, perhaps we can represent the DP in terms of the mod 3. Or perhaps mod 4, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the problem's constraints. For each possible remainder when the total weight is divided by 3, we can track the maximum cost for that remainder. So,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market without exceeding a given weight limit. This is a variation of the knapsack problem with specific constraints on the weights of the items.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem is a bounded knapsack problem where each item has a weight of 1, 2, or 3 and a cost. The goal is to maximize the total cost without exceeding the weight limit `m`.\n\n2. **Intuition**: Given the constraints, a standard dynamic programming approach would be too slow. Instead, we can leverage the fact that the weights are small (1, 2, or 3). This allows us to use a more efficient approach by considering each type of weight separately and using prefix sums for quick calculations.\n\n3. **Grouping Items**: We group items by their weights into three groups: weight 1, weight 2, and weight 3. For each group, we sort the items in descending order of cost and compute prefix sums to quickly get the total cost for any number of items taken from the group.\n\n4. **Dynamic Programming with Modulo Consideration**: We use a dynamic programming array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum cost achievable with a total weight `i`. Since the weights are small, we can efficiently update the DP array by considering all possible items from each group.\n\n5. **Efficient Updates**: For each item in each group, we update the DP array from the back to ensure that each item is only considered once per update.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    m = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n\n    group1 = []\n    group2 = []\n    group3 = []\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n        w = int(input[idx])\n        c = int(input[idx+1])\n        idx += 2\n        if w == 1:\n            group1.append(c)\n        elif w == 2:\n            group2.append(c)\n        else:\n            group3.append(c)\n\n    # Sort each group in descending order and compute prefix sums\n    group1.sort(reverse=True)\n    group2.sort(reverse=True)\n    group3.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    prefix1 = [0]\n    for c in group1:\n        prefix1.append(prefix1[-1] + c)\n    \n    prefix2 = [0]\n    for c in group2:\n        prefix2.append(prefix2[-1] + c)\n    \n    prefix3 = [0]\n    for c in group3:\n        prefix3.append(prefix3[-1] + c)\n\n    # Initialize dp array\n    dp = [-1] * (m + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each possible weight modulo 3\n    for r in range(3):\n        # For each group, try adding items and update dp\n        for group in [group1, group2, group3]:\n            for i in range(len(group)):\n                c = group[i]\n                for j in range(m, -1, -1):\n                    if j >= r and dp[j - r] != -1:\n                        if dp[j] < dp[j - r] + c:\n                            dp[j] = dp[j - r] + c\n\n    print(dp[m])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into groups based on the weight of each souvenir.\n2. **Sorting and Prefix Sums**: Each group is sorted by cost in descending order, and prefix sums are computed to quickly get the total cost for any number of items taken from the group.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: A DP array is initialized where `dp[i]` holds the maximum cost achievable with a total weight `i`.\n4. **Updating DP Array**: For each possible remainder (0, 1, 2), the DP array is updated by considering items from each group, ensuring that each item is only processed once per update.\n5. **Result**: The maximum cost for the given weight limit `m` is found in `dp[m]` and printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that the solution is computed within reasonable time limits.",
