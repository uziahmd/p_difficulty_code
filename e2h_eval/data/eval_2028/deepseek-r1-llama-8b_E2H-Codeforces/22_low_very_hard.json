After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about determining the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. Hmm.\n\nSo, each student has marks for m subjects. A student is considered the best at a subject if no one else has a higher mark for that subject. And a student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. My task is to find out how many such students there are.\n\nLet me think about the input. The first line gives n and m. Then there are n lines, each representing a student's grades. Each grade is a string of m characters, each being a digit from 1 to 9.\n\nWait, right. So for each subject, I need to determine which student has the highest mark. Because that student is the best in that subject. Then, for each student, check if they are the best in any subject.\n\nHow can I approach this? Maybe I'll process each subject separately, track the maximum mark for each subject, and note which student achieved that maximum. Then, for each student, check if they have at least one subject where they are the maximum.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input correctly.\n2. For each subject (each column in the data), find the maximum mark and the student who achieved it.\n3. For each student, count how many times they are the maximum in any subject. If at least once, they are successful.\n4. Sum up all such students.\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure this.\n\nFirst, parsing the input. The first line is n and m. Then n lines follow, each being a string of length m. Each character in the string represents a mark for a subject.\n\nSo, for example, if a student's line is '223', then for subject 0, they scored 2, subject 1: 2, subject 2:3.\n\nI can represent each student's marks as a list of integers. That might make it easier to compare.\n\nSo, for each student, I'll convert their string into a list of integers.\n\nThen, for each subject index (from 0 to m-1), I'll look at all students' marks in that position and find the maximum value and the corresponding student(s). Wait, but wait—what if multiple students have the same maximum? Then, all of them are considered the best for that subject. So, for a subject, any student who has the maximum is the best.\n\nBut wait, the problem says a student is the best at a subject if there's no one with a higher mark. So, for a subject, the maximum determines who is the best. If two students have the same maximum, they are both the best for that subject.\n\nSo, for each subject, collect all the students who have the maximum mark in that subject.\n\nOnce I have that, for each student, check if they are present in any of the best lists for any subject. If yes, they are successful.\n\nHmm, okay. So, perhaps I can proceed as follows:\n\n- For each subject s from 0 to m-1:\n   - Find the maximum mark among all students in this subject.\n   - Collect all students who have this maximum mark.\n   - Store this information for later use.\n\nThen, for each student, check if they are in any of the best lists for any subject.\n\nSo, how do I represent this data?\n\nMaybe for each subject, store the maximum mark and a list of student indices who achieved it.\n\nAlternatively, since each subject's best is just the max, perhaps I can, for each subject, track which student(s) are the best.\n\nSo, let's create a 2D array or a list of sets. For each subject, the set contains the student indices who are the best in that subject.\n\nOnce I have that, for each student, I check if they are in any of these sets across all subjects. If so, count them as successful.\n\nThat sounds manageable.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n2. Read each student's marks, converting each into a list of integers. Also, keep track of each student's index (0-based or 1-based? Probably 0-based for easier handling).\n3. For each subject s in 0..m-1:\n   a. Iterate over all students, collect their mark for subject s.\n   b. Find the maximum mark in this subject.\n   c. Find all students who have this maximum mark in subject s.\n   d. Add these students to a list for subject s.\n4. After processing all subjects, for each student, check if they are present in any of the subject lists.\n5. Count the number of students who satisfy this condition.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark for that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: The first input line contains two integers `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). Each subsequent line represents a student's marks for each subject.\n2. **Convert Marks to Integers**: For each student, convert their marks from strings into a list of integers for easier comparison.\n3. **Track Best Students per Subject**: For each subject, determine the maximum mark and identify all students who achieved this maximum mark. These students are considered the best for that subject.\n4. **Count Successful Students**: For each student, check if they are the best in any subject by verifying if they are listed as the best for that subject. Count how many such students exist.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nbest_in_subject = [[] for _ in range(m)]\n\nfor s in range(m):\n    max_mark = -1\n    for student in students:\n        if student[s] > max_mark:\n            max_mark = student[s]\n    # Collect all students with max_mark in this subject\n    for i, student in enumerate(students):\n        if student[s] == max_mark:\n            best_in_subject[s].append(i)\n\nsuccessful = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    if i in best_in_subject[0]:\n        successful += 1\n    else:\n        for s in best_in_subject:\n            if i in s:\n                successful += 1\n                break\n\nprint(successful)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the number of students `n` and subjects `m`. It then reads each student's marks and converts them into a list of integers.\n2. **Tracking Best Students**: For each subject, the code finds the maximum mark and records which students achieved this mark. This information is stored in a list where each entry corresponds to a subject.\n3. **Counting Success**: For each student, the code checks if they are listed as the best in any subject. If a student is the best in at least one subject, they are counted as successful.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each subject to determine the best students and then checks each student's performance across all subjects to count the successful ones.",
