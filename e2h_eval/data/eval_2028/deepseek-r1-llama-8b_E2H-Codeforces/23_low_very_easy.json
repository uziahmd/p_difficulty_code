In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles, and I have to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form at least one mentsu. Mentsu can be either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nHmm, let's think about how to approach this. The input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s' is one tile. My goal is to determine for each of these three inputs what's the minimal number of additional tiles needed.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the output is three lines, right? Like in the example, the input is three strings, and the output is three integers, each indicating the minimal for each possible hand. Or wait, maybe not. Oh, wait, looking back, the problem says \"the only line contains three strings\"—so the input is three tiles, and for each of them, we need to compute the minimal number of draws required. Or maybe it's that all three are part of the same hand? Wait, no. Looking at the example:\n\nIn the sample input, it's three separate strings, each representing a set of three tiles. But the output is three separate numbers, like 0, 0, 1. So perhaps each of those sets is considered individually, and we need to compute the minimal draws for each.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that the input is three strings—each string is a tile. So the initial hand consists of three tiles. So for each of those three, I think we need to compute the minimal number of tiles she needs to add to her entire hand to form a mentsu. Or wait, no. Maybe I misunderstood.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that she has three tiles in her hand. She can draw any number of tiles, and after drawing, she must have at least one mentsu in her entire hand. So the initial hand is three tiles, and she can add any number of tiles (including zero), and then check if any mentsu exists in the combined set.\n\nSo the task is: given three tiles, what is the minimal number of tiles to add such that the resulting collection of tiles (original plus added) contains at least one mentsu.\n\nAh, okay. So the problem isn't per tile but overall. So the input is three tiles, and we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that the union of original and added tiles forms at least one mentsu.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows three separate cases. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nThe output is ['0', '0', '1'].\n\nWait, so for the first case, the hand is 1s, 2s, 3s. That's already a shuntsu, so she needs 0 extra tiles.\n\nFor the second case, she has three 9m tiles, which is a koutsu, so again 0.\n\nThe third case is 3p, 9m, 2p. She doesn't have a mentsu yet. She can add one tile, like 1p or 4p, to form a shuntsu.\n\nSo the output is three separate numbers, each corresponding to each of the three input sets. Wait, but the way the problem is worded, the initial hand is three tiles, and the output is the minimal number of tiles to add across the entire hand. So the input is three separate hands, and for each, we compute the minimal number.\n\nNo, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Because the problem says, \"the following is a competitive programming problem.\" So perhaps the input is three tiles, and the output is three numbers, each corresponding to the minimal number of tiles needed to make each of the three possible mentsu combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the case. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement: The input is three strings—tiles in her hand. Then, she can draw any tiles, including those already present, and after drawing, she must have at least one mentsu. The output is the minimal number of tiles she needs to draw.\n\nSo, the problem is: given three initial tiles, what is the minimal number of tiles to add so that the combined set has at least one mentsu.\n\nBut the sample output shows three numbers, so perhaps each number corresponds to one of the three possible mentsu possibilities. Or perhaps not.\n\nWait, the sample input is three separate hands. Each is a different scenario. For example, the first input is [1s,2s,3s], which is a shuntsu. So she needs 0. The second is [9m,9m,9m],",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given three tiles, each represented as a string with a digit and a suit (m, p, s). We need to find the minimum number of additional tiles required to form at least one mentsu.\n2. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, check if the current set of tiles already forms a mentsu. If it does, no additional tiles are needed.\n3. **Generate Possible Combinations**: For each tile in the initial hand, consider all possible ways to form a triplet or a sequence by adding the fewest tiles.\n4. **Evaluate Each Possibility**: For each possible combination, calculate how many additional tiles are needed and keep track of the minimum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef min_draws(tiles):\n    # Check if already has a mentsu\n    if is_mentsu(tiles):\n        return 0\n    \n    # Generate all possible mentsu options\n    suits = ['m', 'p', 's']\n    min_draws = float('inf')\n    \n    # Try to form a triplet\n    for tile in tiles:\n        count = tiles.count(tile)\n        if count >= 3:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            needed = 3 - count\n            if needed < min_draws:\n                min_draws = needed\n    \n    # Now try all possible sequences for each suit\n    for suit in suits:\n        nums = []\n        for tile in tiles:\n            num = int(tile[:-1])\n            nums.append(num)\n        # Create a sorted list of unique numbers\n        unique_nums = sorted(list(set(nums)))\n        # For each possible sequence starting at each number\n        for i in range(len(unique_nums)):\n            start = unique_nums[i]\n            for j in range(3):\n                if i + j >= len(unique_nums):\n                    break\n                end = unique_nums[i + j]\n                if end - start == j:\n                    continue\n                else:\n                    # How many to add?\n                    needed = 3 - (j + 1)\n                    if needed <= 0:\n                        return 0\n                    if needed < min_draws:\n                        min_draws = needed\n    \n    return min_draws\n\ndef is_mentsu(tiles):\n    # Check for triplet\n    counts = {}\n    for tile in tiles:\n        t = tile\n        suit = t[-1]\n        num = int(t[:-1])\n        counts[num] = counts.get(num, 0) + 1\n        if counts[num] >= 3:\n            return True\n    # Check for sequence\n    suits_present = set()\n    for tile in tiles:\n        suit = tile[-1]\n        suits_present.add(suit)\n        num = int(tile[:-1])\n        others = []\n        for other_tile in tiles:\n            if other_tile != tile:\n                others.append(int(other_tile[:-1]))\n        others_sorted = sorted(others)\n        # Find any two consecutive numbers\n        found = False\n        for x in others_sorted:\n            if (num - x == 1) and (x in others_sorted) and (num in others_sorted):\n                found = True\n                break\n        if found:\n            return True\n    return False\n\n# Read input\ntiles_input = sys.stdin.read().split()\ntiles = [tiles_input[0], tiles_input[1], tiles_input[2]]\n\nfor tile_set in tiles:\n    # Convert to a list of individual tiles\n    tiles_list = []\n    for t in tile_set.split():\n        tiles_list.append(t)\n    # Compute minimal draws\n    print(min_draws(tiles_list))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single string split into individual tiles.\n2. **Check for Mentsu**: The function `is_mentsu` checks if the current tiles form a triplet or a sequence.\n3. **Generate Combinations**: For each possible way to form a triplet or sequence, calculate the number of additional tiles needed.\n4. **Output Result**: For each input, compute the minimum number of additional tiles needed and print the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible ways to form a mentsu and determine the minimum number of tiles needed to achieve this.",
