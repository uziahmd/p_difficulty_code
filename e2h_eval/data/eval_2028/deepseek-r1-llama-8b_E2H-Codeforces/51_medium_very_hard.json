Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Amusing Joke\" and from the description, it sounds like we need to determine if a pile of letters can be rearranged to form the guest's name and the host's name without any extra letters. Hmm.\n\nSo the input consists of three lines: the first is the guest's name, the second is the host's name, and the third is the pile of letters found. We need to check if combining the letters of the guest and host names gives exactly the pile, with no extras.\n\nRight, so the approach here is to compare the combined letters of the two names with the letters in the pile. If they match exactly in terms of frequency, then output YES; otherwise, NO.\n\nHow do I do that? Well, one way is to count the frequency of each character in the guest and host names, combine them, and then compare with the frequency of the pile.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Read the three input lines.\n2. Concatenate the first two strings (guest + host) into one string.\n3. Count the frequency of each character in this concatenated string.\n4. Do the same for the pile string.\n5. Compare the two frequency dictionaries. If they are identical, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but how to handle the case where the lengths don't match? Oh right, because if the total number of characters in guest and host is not equal to the pile, then it's immediately a NO. So maybe before even counting, we can check the length.\n\nYes, that's a good point. So step 0: check if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, return NO.\n\nOtherwise, proceed to count the letters.\n\nIn Python, how do I count the frequency? Well, the collections.Counter class is perfect for this. It creates a dictionary-like object where the keys are the characters and the values are their counts.\n\nSo, let's outline the code:\n\n- Read the three lines: guest = input().strip(), host = input().strip(), pile = input().strip()\n- combined = guest + host\n- if len(combined) != len(pile): print 'NO' and exit.\n- create counter_combined = Counter(combined)\n- create counter_pile = Counter(pile)\n- if counter_combined == counter_pile: print 'YES' else 'NO'\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, are there any edge cases? For example, when one of the names is empty? But the problem statement says all lines are not empty, so each name has at least one character. So no problem.\n\nWhat about uppercase letters? The problem says all letters are uppercase, so no issues with case sensitivity.\n\nAnother edge case: when the guest or host has repeated letters. The Counter will correctly count them, so it should handle that.\n\nWhat about when the pile has more letters than the combined names? Then the initial length check will catch it.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nLet me write the code structure.\n\nRead the three lines:\n\nline1 = input().strip()\nline2 = input().strip()\nline3 = input().strip()\n\nThen:\n\ncombined = line1 + line2\nif len(combined) != len(line3):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    from collections import Counter\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(line3):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but importing inside the else might not be efficient, but since it's just a single condition, it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, import Counter at the top.\n\nWait, the code must read from standard input and output to standard output, so perhaps the helper functions are okay.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nline1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nline2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nline3 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\ncombined = line1 + line2\nif len(combined) != len(line3):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(line3):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but wait: is using readline() correct here? Because sometimes, in online judges, the input may have leading or trailing spaces or newlines, but the strip() takes care of that.\n\nYes, because each line is read as a separate line, and strip() removes any leading/trailing whitespace, including newlines.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the example given:\n\nSample Input:\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, actually, the input is three lines, so in code, line1 would be 'SANTACLAUS', line2 'DEDMOROZ', line3 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ.\n\nThe pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS.\n\nWait, no, in the sample, the pile is 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER', which when concatenated is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHERBABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Anyway, the code correctly combines line1 and line2.\n\nIn the sample, the first test case is YES, because the combined letters match the pile. The second is NO because of a missing P and extra L. Third is NO because of an extra L.\n\nSo the code should handle all these.\n\nI think this should work.\n\nAnother test case: suppose guest is 'AB', host is 'CD', pile is 'ACBD'. Then combined is 'ABCD', which is same as pile, so YES.\n\nAnother test case: guest is 'A', host is 'B', pile is 'BA' → YES.\n\nIf pile is 'AA', combined is 'AB' → length is same, but counts differ → NO.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nI think this should cover all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters can be rearranged to form the names of a guest and a host without any extra letters. This involves checking if the combined letters of the guest's and host's names exactly match the letters in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the three lines of input representing the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Length Check**: Verify if the combined length of the guest's and host's names is equal to the length of the pile. If not, immediately return \"NO\".\n4. **Frequency Count**: Use a frequency counter to count the occurrences of each character in both the combined names and the pile.\n5. **Comparison**: Compare the frequency counts of the combined names and the pile. If they match exactly, return \"YES\"; otherwise, return \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact match of letters without any extras using frequency counting.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\n# Read the three input lines\nguest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nhost = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\npile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n# Combine the guest and host names\ncombined = guest + host\n\n# Check if the lengths are equal\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Use Counter to compare character frequencies\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads three lines from standard input, each representing the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n- **Combining Names**: The guest's and host's names are concatenated into a single string to form the expected combined string.\n- **Length Check**: If the combined length of the guest's and host's names does not match the length of the pile, it is impossible to form the names from the pile, so the result is \"NO\".\n- **Frequency Counting**: Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined names and the pile.\n- **Comparison**: The frequency counts are compared. If they match, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the names exactly, resulting in \"YES\". Otherwise, the result is \"NO\".\n\nThis method efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures that the solution is both correct and optimal.",
