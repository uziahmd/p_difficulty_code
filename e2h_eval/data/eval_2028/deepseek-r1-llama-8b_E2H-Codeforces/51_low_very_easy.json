Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Amusing Joke\" and from the description, it sounds like we need to determine if a pile of letters can be rearranged to form the guest's name and the host's name without any extra letters.\n\nHmm, the input consists of three lines: the first is the guest's name, the second is the host's name, and the third is the pile of letters found. We need to check if the pile has exactly the right letters in the correct counts to form both names combined, nothing more, nothing less.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Well, I think the steps are:\n\n1. Read all three inputs.\n2. Combine the guest and host names into one string.\n3. Check if the combined length matches the pile's length. If not, immediately return \"NO\".\n4. Count the frequency of each letter in the combined names.\n5. Count the frequency of each letter in the pile.\n6. Compare the two frequency dictionaries. If they match exactly, output \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, for example, in the sample input, combining 'SANTACLAUS' and 'DEDMOROZ' gives a certain set of letters. The pile should have exactly those letters with the same counts.\n\nLet me think about the edge cases. What if the guest or host names are empty? Oh, but the problem says all lines are not empty. So no problem there. Also, case where all letters are the same, like 'AAAAA' and 'AAAAA', and the pile is 'AAAAAAAAAA'. Wait, wait: the combined would be 10 A's, and the pile must have exactly 10 as well.\n\nAnother thing: the letters are uppercase, so we don't have to worry about case sensitivity.\n\nSo, the plan is to read the three lines, concatenate the first two, then compare the letter counts with the third line.\n\nIn Python, I can use the collections.Counter class for this. Counter will count the occurrences of each character efficiently.\n\nBut wait, what about performance? Since each line can be up to 100 characters, the total combined is up to 200, which is manageable.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n- Read the first line as guest.\n- Read the second line as host.\n- Read the third line as pile.\n- Concatenate guest + host to get the required letters.\n- Now, create a Counter for this concatenated string.\n- Create another Counter for the pile.\n- Compare if these two Counters are equal. If yes, print \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nYes, that seems solid.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in code.\n\nFirst, read the inputs. Since the input comes via standard input, I'll read three lines using input().strip() perhaps. But wait, in the sample input, each line is separated by a newline. So, for example, the first line is 'SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'â€”no, wait, looking back at the sample input, it's given as three separate lines. So in the actual input, each of the three lines is a separate string, possibly containing newlines? Or perhaps the input is read as three lines, each being the respective part.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, it says the input file consists of three lines. So when reading via stdin, I can read each line individually. So in Python, something like:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the guest is 'SANTACLAUS', which is one line, followed by 'DEDMOROZ', then the pile. So when read via input(), each is taken as a single string. So yes.\n\nThen, combine guest + host into one string.\n\nNow, compare the counts.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\n# Edge case: if lengths differ, return NO\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the order? No, because Counter is a multiset; it doesn't care about order, just counts.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTesting this logic against the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATAL",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters can be rearranged to form the names of a guest and a host without any extra letters. The solution involves checking if the pile contains exactly the right letters in the correct counts to form both names combined.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Inputs**: Read the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Check Lengths**: If the combined length of the guest's and host's names does not match the length of the pile, print \"NO\".\n4. **Count Letters**: Use a counter to count the frequency of each letter in both the combined names and the pile.\n5. **Compare Counts**: If the letter counts from the combined names match those from the pile, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact required letters using Python's `collections.Counter` for counting letter frequencies.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The code reads three lines of input corresponding to the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's and host's names are concatenated to form a single string representing all letters that should be present in the pile.\n3. **Length Check**: The combined length is compared with the pile's length to quickly determine if they could match.\n4. **Letter Counting**: Using `Counter`, the code counts occurrences of each letter in both the combined names and the pile.\n5. **Comparison**: The counts are compared to ensure every letter matches exactly, ensuring no extra or missing letters.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem constraints and provides the correct result by leveraging efficient string operations and counting mechanisms.",
