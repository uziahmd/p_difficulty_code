The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a Rock-Paper-Scissors game between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They play n rounds, and in each round, the winner gives the loser a pinch, which leaves a red spot. We need to calculate how many red spots each has after all the rounds.\n\nHmm, let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n- Each player has their own sequence of moves that they cycle through.\n- For each round, both choose the next move in their respective sequences. So, for the i-th round, Nikephoros uses A[i % m], where m is the length of his sequence. Similarly for Polycarpus with B[i % k].\n- Then, we determine who wins each round. If it's a draw, no one gets a spot. Otherwise, the winner gets a point.\n\nWait, wait. No, no. Because the loser is the one who gets pinched. Oh right, because the winner gives the pinch. So in each round, if the round isn't a draw, the loser (the one who loses) gets a red spot.\n\nSo the steps for each round are:\n\n1. Determine the moves of both players.\n2. Check who wins.\n3. If it's a draw, nothing happens.\n4. Else, the loser (the one who doesn't win) gets a red spot.\n\nOur goal is to compute the total number of red spots for each after n rounds.\n\nSo, for each round from 0 to n-1 (assuming zero-based), we do the following:\n\n- Get the current move of both players. For Nikephoros, it's A[i % m], since he cycles through A. Similarly for Polycarpus, it's B[i % k].\n- Compare the two moves to see who wins.\n- If there's a winner, increment the corresponding count.\n\nWait, but how do we determine the winner? Let's think about the rules:\n\n- Rock beats scissors: So if A's move is R and B's is S, then R wins, B loses.\n- Scissors beat paper: If A is S and B is P, A wins, B loses.\n- Paper beats rock: If A is P and B is R, A wins, B loses.\n\nIf both moves are the same, it's a draw.\n\nSo for each pair of moves, determine the outcome.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize two counters, nike = 0 and poly = 0.\n- For each round i from 0 to n-1:\n   - get a = A[i % len(A)], b = B[i % len(B)]\n   - if a == b: continue\n   - else, determine who loses based on the rules.\n   - if a beats b: then poly +=1 (since the winner is Nikephoros, and the loser is Poly)\n   - else: nike +=1 (Poly's move beats Nike's, so Poly is the winner, Nike loses)\n\nWait, no. Wait, if a beats b, then the winner is the one with a, and the other is the loser. So the loser gets a spot.\n\nSo if a beats b: Poly loses, so Poly's spot increases by 1.\nIf b beats a: then Nike loses, so his spot increases.\n\nSo for each round, after determining that a != b:\n\nCompare a and b to see who's the winner.\n\nHow to implement this? Maybe create a helper function or just a series of conditionals.\n\nAlternatively, we can have a dictionary that maps each move to what it beats.\n\nLike, beats = {\n    'R': 'S',\n    'S': 'P',\n    'P': 'R'\n}\n\nSo for a given a and b:\n\nif a == b: pass\nelse:\n   if beats[a] == b: then a wins, so loser is Poly → poly +=1\n   else: b wins, so loser is Nike → nike +=1\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps for each round are:\n\n1. Compute the current a and b.\n2. Check if they're equal → skip.\n3. Else, check whether a beats b. If yes, then Poly loses → add 1 to Poly's count.\n   Else, add 1 to Nike's count.\n\nSo, now the question is: how to process each round efficiently.\n\nConstraints are n up to 2e5, which is manageable.\n\nBut wait, looking at the input, it's given as strings. So for example, A is a string like \"RPS\", etc.\n\nSo in code, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\na = A[i % lenA]\nb = B[i % lenB]\n\nwhere lenA is len(A), lenB is len(B).\n\nSo, in Python, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, after they play a series of Rock-Paper-Scissors games. Each round is played according to a specific sequence of moves that each player cycles through.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each player has their own sequence of moves which they cycle through for each round. The winner of each round gives the loser a red spot. The goal is to count the total number of red spots each player ends up with after `n` rounds.\n2. **Determine Moves**: For each round, both players choose their move based on their respective sequences. The move for each player in round `i` is determined by cycling through their sequence.\n3. **Check Outcomes**: For each round, determine if it results in a win for one of the players or a draw. If there is a winner, the loser gets a red spot.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Use a dictionary to map each move to the move it beats, allowing quick determination of the winner for each round.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nlenA = len(A)\nlenB = len(B)\n\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nnike = 0\npoly = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a = A[i % lenA]\n    b = B[i % lenB]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if beats[a] == b:\n        poly += 1\n    else:\n        nike += 1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the sequences `A` and `B` for Nikephoros and Polycarpus respectively.\n2. **Cycle Through Sequences**: For each round `i`, the move for each player is determined by cycling through their sequence using modulo operations.\n3. **Determine Winner**: Using a dictionary `beats`, we quickly check if a move wins over another. If `a` beats `b`, Polycarpus loses and gets a red spot. Otherwise, Nikephoros loses and gets a red spot.\n4. **Count Red Spots**: Track the number of red spots for each player and print the result after processing all rounds.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the outcome of each round and keep track of the red spots, providing the correct result within the constraints.",
