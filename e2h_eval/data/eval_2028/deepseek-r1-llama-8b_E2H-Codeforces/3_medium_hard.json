Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Lanterns.\" Hmm.\n\nSo, the setup is that Vanya is walking along a straight street of length l. There are n lanterns placed along this street. Each lantern can light all points within a distance d from it. The goal is to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nWait, right. So each lantern covers a segment of the street. The union of all these segments needs to cover the entire [0, l] interval. And we need the smallest possible d.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Well, let's think about the input. We have n lanterns, each at position ai. We need to determine the minimal radius d where every point on the street is within d of at least one lantern.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is that the minimal d will be determined by the maximum gap between consecutive points that are covered by the nearest lanterns. So perhaps the way to compute d is to look at the coverage of each lantern and see where the gaps are.\n\nWait, but the lanterns might not be in order. So maybe I should sort them first. Because once sorted, I can process them in order and figure out the necessary coverage between them.\n\nSo the steps I think are:\n\n1. Sort the list of lantern positions.\n2. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the maximum distance required to cover the gap between them.\n3. The maximum of these distances across all gaps will be the minimal d.\n\nBut wait, that's only part of the story. Because the first lantern could have a position less than zero (but in our case, no, since positions are between 0 and l). Wait, no: the lanterns can't be beyond l or before 0, as per the problem statement.\n\nWait, the lantern positions are given as ai, which can be 0 or l. So for example, if the first lantern is at 0, then the next one could be somewhere else.\n\nLet me think with an example. Suppose we have two lanterns at 0 and l. Then, to cover the entire street, d must be at least l/2, because each lantern covers up to d. But if d is l/2, the first lantern covers from 0 to d, and the second from l-d to l. So the middle part (l/2 to l -d) isn't covered. Wait, no. Wait, when you have two lanterns at 0 and l, each with radius d. Then the first covers [0, d], the second covers [l-d, l]. So the maximum gap is between d and l-d. For the entire street to be covered, d must be at least l/2, because otherwise, the middle part isn't covered. So in that case, the minimal d is l/2.\n\nAnother example: suppose we have three lanterns. The first is at 0, the second at x, the third at l. Then, the regions to check are between 0 and x, between x and the next, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to:\n\n- Sort the lanterns' positions.\n- Compute the coverage intervals for each lantern, which would be [ai -d, ai +d].\n- The union of all these intervals must cover [0, l].\n- We need the smallest d such that this holds.\n\nBut calculating this directly might be computationally intensive, especially since n can be up to 1000. So we need an efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal d is determined by the maximum of the following:\n\n- The distance from the first lantern to 0.\n- The distance from the last lantern to l.\n- The maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns divided by two.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for the first lantern, the left end is 0, so the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position must be <=d. Similarly, the distance from the last lantern to l must be <=d. Also, between any two consecutive lanterns, say at a_i and a_j, the distance between a_j and a_i must be <= 2d. Otherwise, there's a gap in the middle that isn't covered by either lantern.\n\nWait, yes! Because if two consecutive lanterns are at positions a and b, with a < b. The maximum distance between them is b - a. For their coverage areas to overlap or meet, the sum of their radii should be at least b - a. But since all lanterns have the same radius d, the sum is 2d. So 2d >= (b - a), which implies d >= (b - a)/2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n1. The first lantern's position minus 0 (since the first lantern must cover up to 0).\n   Wait, no. The first lantern must cover from 0 to a_1 +d. Or wait, the first lantern's coverage is [a_1 -d, a_1 +d]. To cover 0, we need 0 >= a_1 -d => d >= a_1. Because a_1 >=0. So the first lantern must cover 0, which requires d >= a_1.\n\nSimilarly, the last lantern must cover up to l, so l <= a_n +d => d >= l - a_n.\n\nThen, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, a_i and a_{i+1}, the distance between them is a_{i+1} - a_i. The minimal d must be at least half of that, i.e., (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2.\n\nSo the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\nmax( a_1 , (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2 for all i, l - a_n )\n\nWait, but wait. Let's test this with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nInput:\n7 15\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nWait, the lanterns are at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. So after sorting, they are 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nCompute the required d:\n\n- First lantern is 0, so d >=0. Second, the distance between 0 and3 is 3, so d >=3/2=1.5.\n\nBetween 3 and5: 2 units, so d >=1.\n\nBetween 5 and7: 2, d>=1.\n\n7-9: 2, d>=1.\n\n9-14:5, d >=2.5.\n\n14-15:1, d >=0.5.\n\nAlso, last lantern is 15, so l - a_n =15-15=0.\n\nSo the maximum among 0, 1.5, 1,1,1,2.5,0 is 2.5. So d=2.5.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nInput:\n2 5\n2 5\n\nAfter sorting, 2 and5.\n\nCompute:\n\na1=2, so d >=2.\n\nBetween 2 and5: 3 units, so d >=1.5.\n\nLast lantern is5: 5-5=0.\n\nMaximum is max(2,1.5,0)=2. Which is the sample's output.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10. Lantern at position 5.\n\nThen, a1=5. So d must be >=5 (to cover 0), and also >=5 (to cover 10). So d=5.\n\nYes, because the lantern covers [0,10], so radius is 5.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=10. Positions at 1 and 9.\n\nCompute:\n\na1=1: d >=1.\n\na2=9: d >=1.\n\nBetween them:8 units, so d >=4.\n\nThus, d=4.\n\nBecause 1-4: 0 to 5 is covered by first (from 1-4, but wait, 1-4 gives coverage from -3 to 5. So 0 is covered. 5 is covered by first. Between 5 and 9, the second lantern at 9 covers up to 13, but l is 10. So the coverage is from 5 to 10 (from 9-4=5). So yes, d=4.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Compute the maximum of the following values:\n   a) The first lantern's position.\n   b) The last lantern's position subtracted from l.\n   c) For each pair of consecutive lanterns, (current - previous)/2.\n3. The maximum of these is the required d.\n\nSo now, the code.\n\nIn Python, I'll read the input, process it.\n\nWait, the input format is a bit tricky. It says the first line has n and l, then the next line has n integers. So for the sample input, the first line is '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', meaning n=7, l=15, and then the lanterns are at those positions.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead the first line as n and l.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers. These are the ai's.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the max_d as the maximum of:\n\n- The first element.\n\n- l - last element.\n\n- For each i from 0 to len(sorted_list)-2, (sorted_list[i+1] - sorted_list[i])/2.\n\nThe maximum of these is the answer.\n\nWait, but wait: for the case where the lanterns are at 0 and l. For example, n=2, l=10, positions 0 and10.\n\nThen, first is 0, so d >=0.\n\nlast is 10, so l -10=0.\n\nBetween them, (10-0)/2=5.\n\nSo the maximum is 5.\n\nWhich is correct, because each lantern covers up to 5 units away. So 0 covers 0-5, 10 covers 5-15, but l is 10, so 5-10 is covered. So yes, d=5.\n\nSo the code logic is correct.\n\nNow, handle the edge cases.\n\nWhat if n=1? Like, n=1, l=5, position 3.\n\nThen, d must be >=3 (covers 0) and >=5-3=2. So the maximum is 3. So the lantern at 3 covers from 0 (3-3=0) to 6 (3+3=6), but l is 5, so it's enough.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: all lanterns are at the same position.\n\nn=3, l=10, all lanterns at 5.\n\nThen, first is 5: d >=5.\n\nlast is5: 10-5=5.\n\nConsecutive pairs: 5-5=0, so each contributes 0.\n\nThus, d=5.\n\nWhich is correct, because the single lantern at 5 covers [0,10], so d=5.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are not in order.\n\nLike, n=3, l=10, positions 10, 5, 0.\n\nSorting gives 0,5,10.\n\nCompute:\n\na1=0, so d >=0.\n\nlast is10, l-10=0.\n\nBetween 0 and5:5/2=2.5.\n\nBetween5 and10:5/2=2.5.\n\nSo d is max(0,0, 2.5, 2.5) →2.5.\n\nWhich is correct because each lantern covers 2.5 units. So 0 covers 0-2.5, 5 covers 2.5-7.5, 10 covers7.5-12.5. So the entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\nSo the code logic works.\n\nSo, now, implement this in Python.\n\nThe code steps:\n\n- Read n and l.\n\n- Read the list of a_i.\n\n- Sort the list.\n\n- Compute initial_max as the maximum between the first element and (l - last element).\n\n- For each consecutive pair, compute (current - previous)/2 and compare to initial_max.\n\n- Update initial_max with the maximum of these.\n\n- Print initial_max with 10 decimal digits.\n\nWait, but in Python, when you have numbers like 2.5, they can be printed as 2.5000000000.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nWe can read the input as follows:\n\nFirst line: n, l = map(int, input().split())\n\nSecond line: ai = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nSort ai.\n\nCompute the max_d.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 1?\n\nYes, because the loop for consecutive pairs won't run, and the max_d is correctly computed.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\nai = list(map(int, input().split()))\nai.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif n == 0:\n    # but according to constraints, n >=1?\n    # problem statement says 1<=n<=1000.\n    pass\n\n# Compute initial max from first and last.\nmax_d = max(ai[0], l - ai[-1])\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    diff = ai[i+1] - ai[i]\n    current = diff / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but wait: the first and last elements are part of the sorted array. So yes.\n\nTesting the sample:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=7, l=15\n\nai after sort: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nCompute:\n\nmax_d starts as max(0, 15-15=0) →0.\n\nThen, for each i:\n\ni=0: diff=3, current=1.5 →max_d becomes 1.5.\n\ni=1: 5-3=2 →1 →no change.\n\ni=2:7-5=2→1.\n\ni=3:9-7=2→1.\n\ni=4:14-9=5→2.5 →now max_d is 2.5.\n\ni=5:15-14=1 →0.5.\n\nSo final max_d is 2.5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, l=5.\n\nai after sort: [2,5].\n\nmax_d is max(2, 5-5=0) →2.\n\nNo consecutive pairs, loop doesn't run.\n\nSo output is 2.0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, ai=[5].\n\nmax_d is max(5, 10-5=5) →5.\n\nNo consecutive pairs.\n\nThus, output 5.0000000000.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=10, ai = [1,9].\n\nmax_d is max(1, 10-9=1). Then, consecutive pair: (9-1)/2=4. So max_d becomes 4.\n\nThus, output 4.0000000000.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nWait, but wait about the lanterns being at 0 and l. For example:\n\nn=2, l=10, ai = [0,10].\n\nmax_d is max(0, 10-10=0). Then, consecutive pair: (10-0)/2=5. So max_d becomes 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, ai = [0,5,10].\n\nmax_d is max(0, 0) →0.\n\nThen, consecutive pairs:\n\n5-0=5 →2.5.\n\n10-5=5 →2.5.\n\nSo max_d is 2.5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo yes, the code handles all cases.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement it.\n\nWait, but in Python, the print statement should format the number to 10 decimal places. So using .10f.\n\nSo the code is as written.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns on a street can light the entire street from 0 to \\( l \\). Each lantern lights all points within a distance \\( d \\) from it.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns. This helps us efficiently determine the coverage gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Compute Initial Maximum Distance**: The first lantern must cover from 0 to its position, and the last lantern must cover up to \\( l \\). Thus, the initial maximum distance \\( d \\) is the maximum of the first lantern's position and \\( l \\) minus the last lantern's position.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the distance between them. The required radius \\( d \\) must be at least half of this distance to ensure their coverage areas overlap sufficiently.\n4. **Determine the Minimum Radius**: The minimum radius \\( d \\) is the maximum value obtained from the above steps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\nai = list(map(int, input().split()))\nai.sort()\n\nmax_d = max(ai[0], l - ai[-1])\n\nfor i in range(n - 1):\n    diff = ai[i+1] - ai[i]\n    current = diff / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of lanterns \\( n \\) and the length of the street \\( l \\), followed by the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Initial Maximum Calculation**: The initial maximum distance is determined by the farthest point the first and last lanterns need to cover.\n4. **Gap Calculation**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the gap is checked to ensure it is covered by the radius \\( d \\). If the gap requires a larger radius, it updates the maximum distance.\n5. **Output**: The result is formatted to 10 decimal places to meet the precision requirement.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum radius needed to light the entire street, considering both the endpoints and the gaps between lanterns.",
