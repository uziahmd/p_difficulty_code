A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Soft Drinking,\" and from the description, I need to calculate how many toasts each friend can make given certain resources.\n\nHmm. Let me try to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe friends have bought k bottles of soft drink, each with l milliliters. So the total drink is k multiplied by l. Each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. Since each friend makes a toast, for one toast, all n friends together consume n * nl milliliters. Wait, no—wait, each toast is per friend. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for m toasts, each friend drinks m * nl ml. But since there are n friends, the total drink consumed is n * m * nl. Right.\n\nThen, they have c limes cut into d slices each. So the total number of lime slices is c * d. Each toast requires one slice per friend, so for m toasts, it's n * m slices needed. So the maximum number of toasts possible based on limes is (c*d) / n, but we'll have to take the floor because you can't have a fraction of a toast.\n\nLastly, they have p grams of salt. Each toast requires np grams per friend, so for m toasts, the total salt needed is n * m * np. So the maximum based on salt is p divided by (n * np), again taking the floor.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum of these three values: the maximum number of toasts allowed by drink, limes, and salt. Then, since each friend can make that number of toasts, the answer is that minimum value.\n\nWait, wait. No, wait. Because each toast is per person. So for each toast, each friend uses one slice and some drink and salt. So for m toasts, each friend has m toasts, so the constraints are:\n\nTotal drink: n * m * nl ≤ total_drink\nTotal slices: n * m ≤ total_slices\nTotal salt: n * m * np ≤ total_salt\n\nSo the maximum m is the minimum of (total_drink // (n * nl)), (total_slices // n), (total_salt // (n * np)).\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's compute each resource's capacity for m toasts.\n\nFor the drink: each toast requires n * nl ml. So total drink is k*l. So the maximum m for drink is (k*l) // (n*nl).\n\nFor the limes: each toast needs n slices. So total required is n*m. Total available is c*d. So m can be at most (c*d)//n.\n\nFor the salt: each toast needs n * np grams. So total salt is p. So m can be at most p // (n * np).\n\nSo the overall maximum m is the minimum of those three.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input values: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\n2. Calculate the total drink: total_drink = k * l.\n\n3. Calculate the maximum m based on drink: m_drink = total_drink // (n * nl).\n\n4. Calculate the total slices: total_slices = c * d.\n\n5. Maximum m based on slices: m_slices = total_slices // n.\n\n6. Calculate maximum m based on salt: m_salt = p // (n * np).\n\n7. The answer is the minimum of m_drink, m_slices, m_salt.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample input, let's test.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5: total drink is 20.\n\nEach toast needs 3*3=9ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2.\n\nLimes: c=10, d=8, total slices 80. Each toast needs 3 slices (3 friends). 80/3 is 26.666, floor 26.\n\nSalt: p=100, each toast needs 3*1=3g. 100/3 is 33.333, floor 33.\n\nSo the min is 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: second input is 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3.\n\nDrink: 100*10=1000ml. Each toast needs 5*4=20ml. 1000/20=50. So m_drink is 50.\n\nLimes: 1*19=19 slices. Each toast needs 5. 19/5=3.8 → 3.\n\nSalt",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, lime slices, and salt per friend. The solution involves calculating the maximum number of toasts possible based on each resource and then taking the minimum of these values to ensure all friends can toast equally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: First, compute the total amount of each resource available.\n   - Total drink: Multiply the number of bottles by the volume per bottle.\n   - Total lime slices: Multiply the number of limes by the number of slices per lime.\n   - Total salt: Given directly as input.\n\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: Each toast requires `nl` milliliters per friend, so for `n` friends, each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters. The maximum number of toasts is the total drink divided by this value.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: Each toast requires one slice per friend, so for `n` friends, each toast requires `n` slices. The maximum number of toasts is the total slices divided by `n`.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: Each toast requires `np` grams of salt per friend, so for `n` friends, each toast requires `n * np` grams. The maximum number of toasts is the total salt divided by this value.\n\n3. **Compute the Result**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum of the values obtained from the three constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Calculate total resources\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\n# Compute maximum toasts based on each resource\nmax_toasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\nmax_toasts_lime = total_slices // n\nmax_toasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n\n# Find the minimum of the three to determine the max possible toasts\nmax_toasts = min(max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_lime, max_toasts_salt)\n\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe code reads the input values and calculates the total resources available. It then computes the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on the drink, lime slices, and salt constraints. The result is the minimum of these three values, ensuring that all friends can toast the same number of times without running out of any resource. This approach efficiently determines the optimal number of toasts using simple arithmetic operations and integer division to handle edge cases correctly.",
