    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Array Stabilization. Hmm.\n\nThe task says that given an array of integers, I need to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. So, for each possible removal of an element, I calculate the new max and min, subtract them, and then find the smallest such value among all possibilities.\n\nWait, but calculating this naively for each element would be O(n^2), which won't work for n up to 1e5. That's way too slow. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about how the instability changes when I remove an element. The initial instability is max(a) - min(a). When I remove an element, it could either be the current max or min, or something else. If I remove a max, the new max might be the second maximum. Similarly for min.\n\nSo perhaps I should precompute the sorted array to help find these values quickly. Sorting the array will let me know all possible max and min candidates when any element is removed.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the array.\n2. For each position i, consider removing a[i], and compute the new max and min of the remaining elements.\n3. Find the minimum instability from all these possibilities.\n\nBut wait, if the array is sorted, then for each i, the new max would be the maximum of the subarray excluding a[i]. Since the array is sorted, the max without a[i] is either a[i-1] (if i was the max) or remains the same otherwise. Wait, no. Because if i is somewhere in the middle, the max remains the same unless a[i] is the current max.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Let me think differently.\n\nAfter sorting, the global max is at the end, and the global min is at the start. When I remove an element, the new max could be the next highest if the removed element was the current max. Similarly for the new min.\n\nSo perhaps I should precompute prefix mins and suffix maxes or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, the idea is that when you remove an element, the new max can't be lower than the current max, unless the element you're removing is the current max. Similarly, the new min can't be higher than the current min unless the element you're removing is the current min.\n\nWait, that's not correct. For example, if the array has multiple max elements, removing one doesn't change the max. But if it's the only max, then the new max is the next one.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n- Compute the global min and max of the array.\n- Then, find out if there are multiple elements equal to the max or the min.\n\nFor each element in the array, when we remove it, the new instability will be (new_max - new_min).\n\nSo for each element a[i], the new_max is the max of the array except a[i], and similarly for new_min.\n\nBut how do I compute new_max and new_min efficiently?\n\nIdea: After sorting the array, for each i, the new_max is the max of the array minus a[i], which could be a[i-1] or the next element beyond i. Wait, no. Actually, in a sorted array, if you remove a[i], the new max depends on whether a[i] is the maximum.\n\nWait, for example, suppose the array is [1,2,3,4,5]. If I remove 5, the new max is 4. If I remove 3, the max is still 5.\n\nSo, to compute the new_max for each i, I can look ahead to see if the element being removed is the current max. Similarly for the new_min.\n\nSo here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Sort the array.\n2. Precompute the maximum of the array excluding each i:\n   - If a[i] < a[-1], then the new max is a[-1].\n   - Else, the new max is a[-2] (if n>1).\n   - Wait, no. Because if a[i] is a[-1], but there are multiple elements with that value, then the new max is still a[-1].\n\nSo perhaps, for each i, the new_max is the maximum of a[0..i-1] and a[i+1..n-1]. But that's O(n) per i, which is O(n²) time overall. Not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: The new_max is either the global max (if the element being removed is not the max) or the second max (if the element being removed is the max and there is only one occurrence). Similarly for the new_min.\n\nSo, first, find the global max and its count, and the second max.\n\nSame for the min.\n\nWait, but how? Let's think:\n\n- Let the global max be M, and count how many times M appears.\n- The second max is the maximum element less than M.\n- Similarly for the min.\n\nIf the count of M is more than one, then even if we remove one M, the new max is still M. Otherwise, the new max is the second max.\n\nSimilarly for min.\n\nSo, for each i, when considering removing a[i], the new_max is:\n\nif a[i] == M:\n   if count(M) > 1:\n       new_max = M\n   else:\n       new_max = second_max\nelse:\n   new_max remains M.\n\nSame logic applies for new_min.\n\nWait, no. Because even if a[i] is not the max, if it's part of the current min, then removing it could increase the min.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the new_max and new_min as follows:\n\nWhen you remove a[i], the new_max is the maximum of all elements except a[i]. But computing this for each i is O(n) per i, which is O(n²) time. Not acceptable.\n\nSo I need a way to compute, for each i, the new_max and new_min quickly.\n\nAn alternative approach is to precompute prefix max and suffix max arrays, and similarly for min.\n\nLet me think: for each position i, the maximum of the array excluding a[i] is the maximum of the prefix up to i-1 and the suffix starting at i+1.\n\nSo, for each i, new_max = max( prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+1] )\n\nSimilarly for new_min.\n\nYes! That makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the array.\n2. Precompute the prefix_max array: prefix_max[i] is the maximum of a[0..i].\n3. Precompute the suffix_max array: suffix_max[i] is the maximum of a[i..n-1].\n4. Similarly, compute prefix_min and suffix_min arrays.\n\nThen, for each i, the new_max would be the maximum of prefix_max[i-1] and suffix_max[i+1], because when you remove a[i], the new array is a[0..i-1] concatenated with a[i+1..n-1], so the max is the max of the two parts.\n\nSimilarly, new_min is the min of prefix_min[i-1] and suffix_min[i+1].\n\nOnce I have new_max and new_min for each i, the instability is new_max - new_min. I need to find the minimum such value across all i.\n\nWait, but what about when i is 0 or n-1? For i=0, the left part is empty, so new_max is suffix_max[1], and new_min is suffix_min[1]. Similarly for i=n-1: new_max is prefix_max[n-2], new_min is prefix_min[n-2].\n\nWait, but in the case where i=0, the new array is a[1..n-1], so new_max is the max of a[1..n-1], which is suffix_max[1], right? And new_min is the min of a[1..n-1], which is suffix_min[1].\n\nSimilarly, for i=n-1, the new array is a[0..n-2], so new_max is prefix_max[n-2], new_min is prefix_min[n-2].\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Sort the array.\n- Precompute prefix_max, suffix_max, prefix_min, suffix_min.\n- For each i in 0..n-1:\n   if i == 0:\n      current_max = suffix_max[1]\n      current_min = suffix_min[1]\n   elif i == n-1:\n      current_max = prefix_max[n-2]\n      current_min = prefix_min[n-2]\n   else:\n      current_max = max(prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+1])\n      current_min = min(prefix_min[i-1], suffix_min[i+1])\n   compute instability as current_max - current_min, track the minimum.\n\nThis should be O(n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 1e5.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, sort the array.\n\nCompute prefix_max: iterate from left to right, each step is max of previous and current.\n\nSimilarly, suffix_max: iterate from right to left, each step is max of previous and current.\n\nSame for prefix_min and suffix_min, but using min instead.\n\nOnce that's done, loop through each i, compute current_max and current_min as described.\n\nCompute the instability and keep track of the minimum.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\n- All elements are the same: removing any will result in same min and max, so instability is zero.\n\n- Removing the max: if there are multiple max elements, removing one leaves others, so new_max is same. Otherwise, new_max is the next max.\n\nSimilarly for the min.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2. Then removing either element leaves one element, so instability is zero.\n\nTesting against the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n4\n1 3 3 7\n\nAfter sorting: [1,3,3,7]\n\nprefix_max: [1,3,3,7]\nsuffix_max: [7,7,7,7]\nprefix_min: [1,1,1,1]\nsuffix_min: [1,3,3,7]\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\nprefix_max[0] = 1\nprefix_max[1] = max(1,3)=3\nprefix_max[2] = max(3,3)=3\nprefix_max[3] = max(3,7)=7\n\nsuffix_max[3] =7\nsuffix_max[2]=max(3,7)=7\nsuffix_max[1]=max(3,7,3)=7?\nWait, no. Suffix_max[i] is the maximum from a[i] to a[n-1].\n\nSo for i=3, it's 7.\n\ni=2: max(a[2], a[3]) = 7.\n\ni=1: max(a[1], a[2], a[3]) =7.\n\ni=0: max(a[0],a[1],a[2],a[3})=7.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the suffix_max[i] is the maximum from a[i] to a[n-1]. So for i=1, it's the maximum of 3,3,7 which is 7.\n\nSimilarly for i=0, it's the maximum of all elements, which is 7.\n\nSo the suffix_max array is [7,7,7,7].\n\nSimilarly, the prefix_min is [1,1,1,1], since all are same.\n\nSuffix_min for i=0 is 1, i=1 is min(3,3,7) =3, i=2 is 3, i=3 is7.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, prefix_min is computed as the min up to each index. So for i=0, prefix_min[0]=1.\n\ni=1: min(1,3)=1.\n\ni=2: min(1,3,3)=1.\n\ni=3: min(1,3,3,7)=1.\n\nSuffix_min is computed from the end:\n\ni=3:7.\n\ni=2: min(3,7)=3.\n\ni=1: min(3,3,7)=3.\n\ni=0: min(1,3,3,7)=1.\n\nSo suffix_min is [1,3,3,7].\n\nNow, for each i, compute new_max and new_min.\n\ni=0: new_max is suffix_max[1] =7. new_min is suffix_min[1]=3. instability is 4.\n\nWait, but wait, when i=0 is removed, the array is [3,3,7]. New max is7, new min is3. So 7-3=4.\n\nBut in the sample, removing 7 gives instability 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm computing new_max and new_min.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach isn't correct.\n\nWait, another way: when i=3 (the last element, which is 7), the new array is [1,3,3]. So new_max is3, new_min is1. 3-1=2.\n\nSo for i=3:\n\ncurrent_max = prefix_max[2] =3.\n\ncurrent_min = prefix_min[2] =1.\n\nSo the instability is 2, which is better.\n\nBut according to the earlier approach, for i=3, it's handled in the else clause.\n\nWait, for i=3, which is n-1 (since n=4, indexes are 0-3), we take prefix_max[n-2] (which is prefix_max[2]=3) and prefix_min[n-2] (prefix_min[2]=1). So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut why, for i=0, the code computes new_max as suffix_max[1], which is7, but the array after removal is [3,3,7], whose max is7, min is3. So the code correctly computes 4.\n\nBut the sample's optimal is 2, which comes from removing 7.\n\nSo the code will find this.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: the second sample input.\n\nInput:\n2\n1 100000\n\nAfter sorting: [1, 100000]\n\nprefix_max: [1, 100000]\n\nsuffix_max: [100000, 100000]\n\nprefix_min: [1,1]\n\nsuffix_min: [1, 100000]\n\nFor i=0:\n\nnew_max is suffix_max[1] =100000.\n\nnew_min is suffix_min[1] =100000.\n\nInstability is 0.\n\nFor i=1:\n\nnew_max is prefix_max[0]=1.\n\nnew_min is prefix_min[0]=1.\n\nInstability is 0.\n\nSo the minimum is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the plan is to implement this.\n\nIn Python, read n, read the list, sort it.\n\nCompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min.\n\nThen loop through each i, compute new_max and new_min, and track the minimal instability.\n\nNow, how to compute prefix and suffix arrays.\n\nImplementing prefix_max:\n\nprefix_max = [0]*n\n\nprefix_max[0] = a[0]\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    prefix_max[i] = max(prefix_max[i-1], a[i])\n\nSimilarly for suffix_max:\n\nsuffix_max = [0]*n\n\nsuffix_max[n-1] = a[n-1]\n\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n    suffix_max[i] = max(suffix_max[i+1], a[i])\n\nSame for prefix_min and suffix_min, but using min.\n\nOnce these arrays are built, for each i:\n\nif i ==0:\n    if n ==1:\n        # but n >=2, so not possible.\n        pass\n    new_max = suffix_max[1]\n    new_min = suffix_min[1]\nelif i == n-1:\n    new_max = prefix_max[n-2]\n    new_min = prefix_min[n-2]\nelse:\n    new_max = max(prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+1])\n    new_min = min(prefix_min[i-1], suffix_min[i+1])\n\nThen, instability is new_max - new_min.\n\nKeep track of the minimal such value.\n\nFinally, output the minimal instability.\n\nWait, but what about when n=1? According to the problem statement, n is at least 2, so no need to handle that.\n\nSo the code should be okay.\n\nNow, handling the cases where i is 0 or n-1.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when n=2, for i=0, the new_max is a[1], new_min is a[1], so instability is 0.\n\nSimilarly for i=1.\n\nThus, the code will correctly output 0.\n\nTesting another case: n=3, a=[1,2,3].\n\nAfter sorting: [1,2,3]\n\nprefix_max: [1,2,3]\n\nsuffix_max: [3,3,3]\n\nprefix_min: [1,1,1]\n\nsuffix_min: [1,2,3]\n\nFor each i:\n\ni=0: new_max = suffix_max[1] =3, new_min = suffix_min[1]=2. Instability 1.\n\ni=1: new_max is max(prefix_max[0], suffix_max[2]) = max(1,3) =3. new_min is min(prefix_min[0], suffix_min[2]) =1. So 3-1=2.\n\ni=2: new_max is prefix_max[1]=2. new_min is prefix_min[1]=1. So 1.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nWhich is correct, because removing the 3 gives instability 2-1=1, or removing 1 gives 3-2=1, or removing 2 gives 3-1=2. So minimal is 1.\n\nSo the code correctly returns 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, a = [5,5,5,5,5]. Removing any element leaves instability 0.\n\nSo the code should return 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=3, a = [2, 5, 5].\n\nSorted: [2,5,5].\n\nprefix_max: [2,5,5]\n\nsuffix_max: [5,5,5]\n\nprefix_min: [2,2,2]\n\nsuffix_min: [2,5,5]\n\nFor each i:\n\ni=0: new_max = suffix_max[1] =5. new_min = suffix_min[1]=5. instability 0.\n\ni=1: new_max = max(prefix_max[0]=2, suffix_max[2]=5) =5. new_min = min(prefix_min[0]=2, suffix_min[2]=5) =2. instability 3.\n\ni=2: new_max = prefix_max[1]=5. new_min = prefix_min[1]=2. instability 3.\n\nSo the minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is correct, since removing 2 gives all 5s.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, implementing the code.\n\nRead n, then the array.\n\nSort it.\n\nCompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min.\n\nLoop over each i, compute new_max and new_min, calculate the instability, track the minimum.\n\nThen print the minimal instability.\n\nWait, but in the code, for i=0, new_max is suffix_max[1], but what if n is 1? Well, according to the problem statement, n>=2, so no problem.\n\nSo now, writing the code.\n\nIn Python:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nprefix_max = [0]*n\nprefix_min = [0]*n\nprefix_max[0] = a[0]\nprefix_min[0] = a[0]\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    prefix_max[i] = max(prefix_max[i-1], a[i])\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], a[i])\n\nsuffix_max = [0]*n\nsuffix_min = [0]*n\nsuffix_max[-1] = a[-1]\nsuffix_min[-1] = a[-1]\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n    suffix_max[i] = max(suffix_max[i+1], a[i])\n    suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], a[i])\n\nmin_instability = float('inf')\nfor i in range(n):\n    if i ==0:\n        current_max = suffix_max[1]\n        current_min = suffix_min[1]\n    elif i == n-1:\n        current_max = prefix_max[n-2]\n        current_min = prefix_min[n-2]\n    else:\n        current_max = max(prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+1])\n        current_min = min(prefix_min[i-1], suffix_min[i+1])\n    instability = current_max - current_min\n    if instability < min_instability:\n        min_instability = instability\n\nprint(min_instability)\n\nWait, but what about when i is 0 and n=2. Let's test.\n\nn=2, a = [1,3]\n\nsorted: [1,3]\n\nprefix_max: [1,3]\n\nprefix_min: [1,1]\n\nsuffix_max: [3,3]\n\nsuffix_min: [1,3]\n\nFor i=0:\n\ncurrent_max = suffix_max[1] =3.\n\ncurrent_min = suffix_min[1] =3.\n\nso instability 0.\n\nFor i=1:\n\ncurrent_max = prefix_max[0] =1.\n\ncurrent_min = prefix_min[0] =1.\n\nso 0.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a=[1,2,3].\n\nAs before, code correctly finds minimal instability 1.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
