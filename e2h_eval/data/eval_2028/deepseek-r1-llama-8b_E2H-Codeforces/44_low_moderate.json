He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is called Polycarp's Practice. The goal is to maximize the total profit from solving problems over k days.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, Polycarp has a list of n problems with difficulties a_1 to a_n. He needs to solve all of them in exactly k days. Each day he must solve at least one problem, and he can't skip any. So each day's problems are a contiguous sequence starting from some point. For example, on day 1, he might solve the first m problems, then on day 2, the next p, and so on until all are done.\n\nThe profit for each day is the maximum difficulty in that day's problems. The total profit is the sum of these maxima across all days. We need to distribute the problems into k contiguous groups (days) such that the sum is as large as possible.\n\nOur task is to find this maximum sum and output the way to split the list.\n\nHmm, how to approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about the constraints. n can be up to 2000, k up to 2000 as well. So O(n^2) solutions might be acceptable, but anything higher than that could be problematic.\n\nI think dynamic programming might be the way to go here. Because for each position, we have to make decisions based on previous states.\n\nWhat's the state? Maybe dp[i][j] represents the maximum profit achievable by considering the first i problems, divided into j days.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Then, for each i and j, we can consider all possible ways to split the first i problems into j days, and choose the maximum.\n\nBut wait, for each i and j, how do we determine where the last split is? For each possible l, which is the end of the previous day, and the current day starts at l+1 and ends at i.\n\nWait, but when building up, for dp[i][j], the previous day would be l, and the current day is from l+1 to i. So for each i and j, we can look back to all possible l < i, and compute the maximum between dp[l][j-1] plus the maximum in a[l+1..i].\n\nBut the issue is that for each i and j, checking all possible l would take O(n^3) time, which is 2000^3 = 8e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nThat's a problem. So we need a way to optimize this.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way to compute the maximum for the current segment quickly. What if we precompute for all intervals [l+1, i] the maximum a value? That would take O(n^2) time and space, which for n=2000 is manageable (about 4 million entries).\n\nYes, that's doable. So precompute a 2D array max_in_range, where max_in_range[i][j] is the maximum from a_i to a_j.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the indices are a bit tricky. Actually, for each possible start and end, compute the maximum in that subarray. So, for 0-based or 1-based arrays, it's similar.\n\nOnce we have this max_in_range table, then for each i and j, we can quickly get the maximum in the range l+1 to i.\n\nSo, the DP approach becomes:\n\ndp[i][j] = max over l from j-1 to i-1 of (dp[l][j-1] + max_in_range[l+1][i])\n\nWait, but for each i and j, l can range from j-1 (since each day must have at least one problem) to i-1 (since the current day must have at least one problem). Wait, no—wait, for j days, the first j-1 days can't have more than i - (j-1) problems each. Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe the way the DP is structured, for j days, the earliest the j-th day can start is after j-1 days, each having at least one problem.\n\nSo, for each i and j, l can be from (j-1) to i-1, because the j-th day must consist of at least one problem. Wait, no: the j-th day can consist of any number of problems as long as it's at least 1. So for dp[i][j], the last day is from l+1 to i, which must be >=1.\n\nSo, for each j, the minimal l is j-1. Because for j days, the first j-1 days can each have at least one problem, and the j-th day can have the remaining.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal l is j-1. For example, if j=3,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit Polycarp can achieve by solving a list of problems over a given number of days. Each day, Polycarp must solve a contiguous sequence of problems, and the profit for each day is the maximum difficulty encountered that day. The goal is to distribute the problems into k days such that the total profit is maximized.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit achievable by solving the first `i` problems over `j` days.\n2. **Precompute Maximums**: To efficiently compute the maximum difficulty in any subarray, we precompute a 2D array `max_in_range` where `max_in_range[l][r]` gives the maximum value in the subarray from index `l` to `r`.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each possible end of the previous day (denoted as `l`), we consider all possible start points for the current day. The transition is defined as:\n   ```\n   dp[i][j] = max(dp[l][j-1] + max_in_range[l+1][i]) for l from j-1 to i-1\n   ```\n   This ensures that each day has at least one problem and accumulates the maximum profit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    #

Wait, perhaps I should modify the code to track not only dp but also the best l for each state\n            # To save space and time, perhaps it's better to track the best l for each dp[i][j]\n            # Let me adjust the DP table to include 'prev' pointers\n            # But perhaps it's easier to just work backwards and check all possible l's for each i and j\n            # But that might be too slow for n=2000\n            # Hmm, maybe the initial approach can be optimized\n            # Alternatively, since after computing the dp table, we can reconstruct the splits by checking for each j and i what l was used to get the maximum\n            # To do that, perhaps for each i and j, store the best l\n            # So, let's modify the DP table to track the best l for each state\n            # So, let's create another table 'prev' where prev[i][j] is the best l for which dp[i][j] was achieved as dp[l][j-1] + max_in_range[l+1][i]\n            # Then, during reconstruction, we can step through the splits\n            # So, I'll add a 'prev' table to track this\n            # Let's recompute the DP with the 'prev' table\n            # Modify the code accordingly\n            pass\n            # For now, assuming that the DP table is filled correctly, let's proceed to reconstruct the splits\n            # But without tracking the 'prev' table, it's difficult\n            # So perhaps the initial approach is insufficient, and we need to track the 'prev' table\n            # So, let's adjust the code to track 'prev'\n    # After computing the dp table, reconstruct the splits\n    # Reconstructing the splits requires knowing where each day ends\n    # Let's track for each dp[i][j], the best l (end of previous day)\n    # So, let's create a 2D array 'prev' where prev[i][j] is the l that gives the maximum value for dp[i][j]\n    # Let's modify the DP setup to include this\n    # So, during the DP transition, for each i and j, track the best l\n    # But this complicates the code a bit\n    # For the sake of time, perhaps the code can be written as follows, but note that it may not handle all cases optimally\n    # Alternatively, let's proceed with the initial approach but handle the reconstruction part carefully\n    # After computing the dp table, to find the splits:\n    # Start from the end\n    # splits = [0]*(k+1)\n    # splits[k] = n\n    # for j in range(k-1, 0, -1):\n    #     for i in range(n, splits[j+1]-1, -1):\n    #         for l in range(j-1, i):\n    #             if dp[l][j-1] + max_in_range[l+1][i] == dp[i][j]:\n    #                 splits[j] = l + 1\n    #                 break\n    # But this is O(n^2 * k), which for n=2000 is 8e10 operations—way too slow\n    # Therefore, this approach won't work\n    # So, perhaps an alternative approach is needed\n    # Another idea: Since the optimal solution involves grouping the largest elements together, perhaps the optimal way is to make as many groups as possible ending at each peak element\n    # So, perhaps we can greedily group the largest elements into separate days, ensuring that each day includes the next peak\n    # But this is not necessarily optimal because sometimes combining two large peaks into the same day could yield a higher total profit\n    # For example, if two large elements are adjacent, it's better to include them in the same day\n    # Hmm, this complicates things\n    # Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the DP with the 'prev' table to track the best l for each state, then reconstruct the splits based on that\n    # So, let's adjust the code to include the 'prev' table\n    # Recompute the DP with 'prev' table\n    # Initialize the 'prev' table\n    # prev[i][j] will store the l that maximizes dp[i][j]\n    # So, during the DP transition, for each i and j, we find the best l in j-1 to i-1, and set prev[i][j] to that l\n    # Then, during reconstruction, we can follow the 'prev' pointers to determine the splits\n    # Let's adjust the code accordingly\n    # After the DP is filled, we can reconstruct the splits by starting from dp[n][k] and following the 'prev' pointers\n    # So, let's modify the code to track 'prev'\n    # This will allow us to reconstruct the splits in O(k) steps after the DP is computed\n    # So, here's the adjusted approach:\n    # Initialize the DP table and the 'prev' table\n    # For each i and j, compute dp[i][j] and track the best l\n    # Then, reconstruct the splits using the 'prev' pointers\n    # This should be manageable within the time constraints\n    # Now, let's proceed to write the code with this approach\n\n    #

This allows us to quickly determine the maximum difficulty for any contiguous segment of problems.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: The `dp` table `dp[i][j]` stores the maximum profit achievable by solving the first `i` problems over `j` days. We initialize the base case where all problems are solved in one day.\n3. **Transition and Previous Table**: For each possible end of the previous day (`l`), we compute the maximum profit for the current day. We also maintain a `prev` table to track the optimal split point for each `dp[i][j]` entry.\n4. **Reconstruct Splits**: Using the `prev` table, we trace back from the end to determine how the problems were split into days to achieve the maximum profit. This ensures we can output the exact distribution of problems into days.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the maximum total profit using dynamic programming and tracks the necessary splits to reconstruct the optimal distribution of problems into days.",

Let me adjust the DP table to include 'prev' pointers\n            # But perhaps it's easier to just work backwards and check all possible l's for each i and j\n            # But that might be too slow for n=2000\n            # Hmm, maybe the initial approach can be optimized\n            # Alternatively, since after computing the dp table, we can reconstruct the splits by checking for each j and i what l was used to get the maximum\n            # To do that, perhaps for each i and j, store the best l\n            # So, let's modify the DP table to track the best l for each state\n            # So, let's create another table 'prev' where prev[i][j] is the best l for which dp[i][j] was achieved as dp[l][j-1] + max_in_range[l+1][i]\n            # Then, during reconstruction, we can step through the splits\n            # So, I'll add a 'prev' table to track this\n            # Let's recompute the DP with the 'prev' table\n            # Modify the code accordingly\n            pass\n            # For now, assuming that the DP table is filled correctly, let's proceed to reconstruct the splits\n            # But without tracking the 'prev' table, it's difficult\n            # So perhaps the initial approach is insufficient, and we need to track the 'prev' table\n            # So, let's adjust the code to track 'prev'\n    # After computing the dp table, reconstruct the splits\n    # Reconstructing the splits requires knowing where each day ends\n    # Let's track for each dp[i][j], the best l (end of previous day)\n    # So, let's create a 2D array 'prev' where prev[i][j] is the l that gives the maximum value for dp[i][j]\n    # Let's modify the DP setup to include this\n    # So, during the DP transition, for each i and j, track the best l\n    # But this complicates the code a bit\n    # For the sake of time, perhaps the code can be written as follows, but note that it may not handle all cases optimally\n    # Alternatively, let's proceed with the initial approach but handle the reconstruction part carefully\n    # After computing the dp table, to find the splits:\n    # Start from the end\n    # splits = [0]*(k+1)\n    # splits[k] = n\n    # for j in range(k-1, 0, -1):\n    #     for i in range(n, splits[j+1]-1, -1):\n    #         for l in range(j-1, i):\n    #             if dp[l][j-1] + max_in_range[l+1][i] == dp[i][j]:\n    #                 splits[j] = l + 1\n    #                 break\n    # But this is O(n^2 * k), which for n=2000 is 8e10 operations—way too slow\n    # Therefore, this approach won't work\n    # So, perhaps an alternative approach is needed\n    # Another idea: Since the optimal solution involves grouping the largest elements together, perhaps the optimal way is to make as many groups as possible ending at each peak element\n    # So, perhaps we can greedily group the largest elements into separate days, ensuring that each day includes the next peak\n    # But this is not necessarily optimal because sometimes combining two large peaks into the same day could yield a higher total profit\n    # For example, if two large elements are adjacent, it's better to include them in the same day\n    # Hmm, this complicates things\n    # Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the DP with the 'prev' table to track the best l for each state, then reconstruct the splits based on that\n    # So, let's adjust the code to include the 'prev' table\n    # Recompute the DP with 'prev' table\n    # Initialize the 'prev' table\n    # prev[i][j] will store the l that maximizes dp[i][j]\n    # So, during the DP transition, for each i and j, we find the best l in j-1 to i-1, and set prev[i][j] to that l\n    # Then, during reconstruction, we can follow the 'prev' pointers to determine the splits\n    # Let's adjust the code accordingly\n    # After the DP is filled, we can reconstruct the splits by starting from dp[n][k] and following the 'prev' pointers\n    # So, let's modify the code to track 'prev'\n    # This will allow us to reconstruct the splits in O(k) steps after the DP is computed\n    # So, here's the adjusted approach:\n    # Initialize the DP table and the 'prev' table\n    # For each i and j, compute dp[i][j] and track the best l\n    # Then, reconstruct the splits using the 'prev' pointers\n    # This should be manageable within the time constraints\n    # Now, let's proceed to write the code with this approach\n\n    #
