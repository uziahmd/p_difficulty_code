In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about determining the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu in her hand. Mentsu can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). \n\nHmm. So the input is three strings representing the current tiles she has. Each string has a digit followed by 'm', 'p', or 's'. I need to compute for each possible scenario how many more tiles she needs to add to form a mentsu.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the output isn't per scenario but per tile? Or wait, looking back at the example, the output is a list of three numbers, each corresponding to one of the three initial tiles. Oh right, because each tile could be part of a different solution. So for each of the three initial tiles, I need to find the minimal number of draws required if that particular tile is part of the optimal solution.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me read the problem statement again. It says: \"Print a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\" But the sample input shows an output of three numbers, like ['0', '0', '1']. Oh, wait, no, looking at the note, the sample output is ['0', '0', '1'], which is printed as separate values, probably meaning that each initial tile's scenario is considered and the minimal across all possibilities is taken. Or perhaps the output is three numbers, each being the minimal required for each initial tile to be part of some mentsu.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input... and prints the desired outputs to standard output.\" And the sample input has three lines, but the output is three numbers, like 0,0,1. So perhaps the correct approach is to process each of the three initial tiles, compute for each the minimal number of tiles needed to form a mentsu including that tile, and then take the minimal across all possibilities. Or maybe, no—perhaps the minimal is across all possible mentsus, regardless of which initial tile is used.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win\". So the goal is to have at least one mentsu after adding the minimal number of tiles. So the minimal number is determined by considering all possible ways to form a mentsu, whether using any of the existing tiles.\n\nSo the approach should be to find all possible mentsus that can be formed by adding some tiles, and choose the one with the smallest number of additions.\n\nBut given the initial three tiles, we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that in the combined set, there's at least one mentsu.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Because the initial three tiles plus any added tiles can form a mentsu. We need to check all possible mentsus that can be formed by the initial tiles plus the ones we can add, and find the minimal number of additions required.\n\nBut considering all possibilities might be computationally intensive, but since the number of possible mentsus is manageable, perhaps it's feasible.\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to take.\n\nFirst, parse the input into three tiles. Each tile is a string like '1m'.\n\nNext, I need to generate all possible mentsus that can be formed by considering all possible sets of four or more tiles (since adding up to three tiles can create a mentsu). Wait, no. Wait, Tokitsukaze starts with three tiles, and adds some to reach four or more. Wait, no: the mentsu is exactly three tiles. So the total tiles after adding must include at least three that form a mentsu.\n\nWait, no. A mentsu is exactly three tiles forming a koutsu or shuntsu. So, after adding some tiles, the entire collection (including initial and added) must contain at least one such trio.\n\nSo the approach is: consider the initial three tiles plus any number of added tiles, and find the minimal number of added tiles such that within the entire set, there exists a triplet or a sequence.\n\nBut since adding more tiles can't decrease the minimal count, perhaps the minimal is found by trying all possible triplets that can be formed with the initial tiles and possibly adding tiles, and compute the minimal required.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to approach this is:\n\n1. For each possible mentsu (all possible triplets and sequences), determine if it can be formed by the initial three tiles, possibly with additional tiles. Then, calculate how many tiles are needed to complete this mentsu. The minimal such number across all possible mentsus is the answer.\n\nBut that's not quite right. Because the mentsu can consist of any three tiles in the combined set. So for example, if the initial set is [A, B, C], adding D, E, F may result in multiple mentsus, and we only need one of them.\n\nBut the key is to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that at least one mentsu exists in the resulting set.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- Generate all possible triplets (mentsus) that can be formed by the initial tiles plus any possible tiles. For each such triplet, compute how many tiles are missing from the initial set, and track the minimal number of tiles needed across all possible triplets.\n\nWait, but that's not accurate because some tiles may already be present in the initial set beyond the triplet. For example, if the initial set has four of the same tile, then a triplet is already present without needing to add any tiles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by checking all possible possible mentsus that can be formed using any subset of the initial tiles, and then seeing how many additional tiles are needed to complete them.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nFor all possible mentsus (each possible triplet or sequence), check if the initial tiles plus any number of added tiles can form this mentsu. Compute the minimal number of added tiles required across all possible mentsus.\n\nBut the problem is that there are a lot of possible mentsus, and for each, we need to compute the minimal number of tiles required.\n\nSo, how do I model this?\n\nEach mentsu is a triplet (either koutsu or shuntsu). For each such triplet, compute how many of its tiles are already present in the initial set. The number of tiles needed to add is 3 minus the count of those present in the initial set.\n\nWait, but that's only for the specific triplet. However, the problem allows for the initial set plus added tiles to have other tiles as well. So, perhaps the minimal required is the minimal among all possible mentsus.\n\nWait, for example, suppose the initial set has two tiles of a koutsu and one other tile. Then, adding one more tile of the same suit would form a koutsu. So for that mentsu, the required is 1.\n\nBut there could be other mentsus that require fewer tiles. Wait, no. Because in this case, the required is 1, which is minimal.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. Enumerate all possible mentsus.\n\n2. For each mentsu, calculate how many tiles are already present in the initial set.\n\n3. The number of tiles needed to add is 3 minus the count from step 2.\n\n4. Find the minimal such value across all mentsus.\n\nBut wait, this is only correct if the mentsu can be formed without needing to add any other tiles beyond those required for it. Because the added tiles could contribute to other mentsus, but we just need at least one.\n\nYes, because the problem requires at least one mentsu. So, for each possible mentsu, compute how many tiles are needed to form it, and the minimal over all is the answer.\n\nBecause adding those tiles would ensure that the mentsu exists, even if other tiles are present.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- For each possible mentsu (all possible triplets in all suits), compute how many of its three tiles are already present in the initial set. The minimal required is 3 - count.\n\nThe overall minimal across all possible mentsus is the answer.\n\nWait, but let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSo the initial tiles are:\n\nTile 1: 1s\n\nTile 2: 9m\n\nTile 3: 9m\n\nSo the initial set is {1s, 9m, 9m}.\n\nNow, let's consider all possible mentsus.\n\nCase 1: Looking for a shuntsu in 's' suit.\n\nPossible shuntsus are 1s,2s,3s; 2s,3s,4s; etc.\n\nLooking at the initial tiles, we have 1s, 2s is missing, 3s is missing. So for the shuntsu 1s,2s,3s: currently, we have 1s. So need to add 2s and 3s. That's 2 tiles, but wait, wait: the initial set has three tiles. Wait, initial set is 1s, 9m, 9m. So for the shuntsu 1s,2s,3s, we have one tile (1s). So required is 2 more.\n\nBut the sample output for the first tile is 0. Hmm, that suggests that the first tile (1s) is part of a shuntsu already present in the initial set. But according to my earlier logic, it's not. So why is the output 0?\n\nWait, the sample output is [0, 0, 1]. So perhaps the way I'm thinking is wrong.\n\nWait, let's think again. The sample output is for the three initial tiles, each being processed separately. Oh, maybe I misunderstood the output format. Perhaps for each of the three initial tiles, compute the minimal number of tiles needed to form a mentsu that includes that tile. Then, take the minimal across all such possibilities.\n\nSo for each initial tile, consider it as part of a possible mentsu, and compute how many tiles are needed to complete it, then take the minimal across all.\n\nThat makes sense because the sample output has three values, each for each initial tile.\n\nSo the problem is: for each of the three initial tiles, find the minimal number of tiles needed to add so that this tile is part of at least one mentsu in the resulting set. Then, the overall answer is the minimal across these three.\n\nWait, but that doesn't fit the sample. Let's see.\n\nIn the sample, the first initial tile is 1s. To form a shuntsu, it can be part of 1s, 2s, 3s. Currently, the initial set has 1s. So to form this shuntsu, we need to add 2s and 3s, which is two tiles. But the sample output is 0 for this tile. That suggests that another mentsu involving 1s exists that requires 0 additional tiles.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial set already contains a mentsu. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the initial three tiles: 1s, 9m, 9m.\n\nDo they form a mentsu? Well, the 9m,9m,9m is a koutsu. So yes. So the initial set already has a mentsu. So the minimal is 0 for all three tiles, because each is part of that mentsu.\n\nAh! So perhaps for each initial tile, when computing the minimal, we need to see if it is part of any existing mentsu in the initial set, and if so, the required is zero.\n\nBut then, the minimal across all is zero, so the sample output is 0 for all.\n\nBut wait, the third tile in the sample is 2p. So, in the initial set, is there a mentsu that includes 2p? No. Because the initial set is 1s, 9m,9m. So 2p is not present. So for the third tile, 2p, how can it be part of a mentsu with minimal draws?\n\nIn the sample, the output is 1 for the third tile. So adding 1 tile (like 1p or 4p) will allow a shuntsu.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each initial tile, compute the minimal number of tiles needed to form a mentsu that includes this tile. Then, the overall answer is the minimal of these three values.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each initial tile, consider it as part of a mentsu.\n\n2. For each possible mentsu that includes this tile, compute how many tiles are already present in the initial set.\n\n3. The minimal number of tiles needed for this tile is 3 - count.\n\n4. Among all possible mentsus for this tile, find the one with the minimal required.\n\n5. Then, the overall minimal is the minimal across all three initial tiles.\n\nWait, but this seems complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: For each initial tile, find all possible mentsus that include it, and compute the minimal required for that tile. Then, the minimal across all three is the answer.\n\nBut how do I model this?\n\nAlternatively, for each initial tile, generate all possible mentsus that include it, and for each, compute how many tiles are needed to complete it. Then, for the initial tile, the minimal required is the minimal of these values. Then, the overall answer is the minimal of the three.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the process for each initial tile.\n\nTake the first initial tile: '1s'\n\nWe need to find all possible mentsus that include '1s'.\n\nThese can be:\n\n- Koutsu: three '1s's. So, in the initial set, we have one '1s'. So to form this, we need two more '1s's. So required is 2.\n\n- Shuntsu: sequences in 's' suit starting with 1s. So, 1s,2s,3s. We have one tile, so need to add two more.\n\nAlternatively, in the same suit, 1s could be the middle tile in a sequence, but that's not possible as 0s don't exist. Or the last tile, but that would require 1s-1, which is invalid.\n\nWait, shuntsu is three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So 1s can be part of 1s,2s,3s; or 2s,1s,3s? No, because order doesn't matter. So the shuntsu is a set, not an ordered sequence.\n\nSo for '1s', the possible shuntsus it can be part of are:\n\n- 1s,2s,3s\n\n- 2s,1s,3s → which is the same as above.\n\nSo, in terms of the set, it's just 1s,2s,3s.\n\nSo for the shuntsu case, we have to add two tiles.\n\nAnother possibility is that '1s' is part of a shuntsu where it's the middle or end tile. Wait, no. Because the shuntsu is a sequence of three consecutive numbers. So if you have 1s,2s,3s, that's a shuntsu. If you have 2s,3s,4s, 1s can't be part of that.\n\nSo for the initial tile '1s', the possible mentsus are:\n\nKoutsu: three '1s's → needs two more.\n\nShuntsu: 1s,2s,3s → needs two more.\n\nAlternatively, is there any other shuntsu that includes '1s'? Like 1s,0s,-1s? No, because numbers are from 1-9.\n\nSo the minimal required for the first tile is 2? But the sample output is 0. How does that fit?\n\nWait, the sample output is 0 for the first tile, which suggests that in the initial set, the first tile is part of a mentsu. So why is that?\n\nBecause the initial set includes three '9m's. So, in the initial set, the tile '9m' is part of a koutsu. So for the first tile, '1s', the minimal is zero because it's not part of that koutsu, but for other tiles, like the second and third, which are '9m's, they are part of that koutsu.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is: for each initial tile, find the minimal number of tiles needed to form a mentsu that includes this tile, considering all possible mentsus that include it.\n\nSo, for the first initial tile '1s', the minimal is 2 (as above). For the second and third initial tiles, which are '9m's, they are part of a koutsu that's already present. So the minimal required is zero.\n\nSo the overall answer is the minimal among 2,0,0 → 0.\n\nSo the sample output is 0,0,1.\n\nWait, the third initial tile is '2p'. So for this tile, the minimal required is 1.\n\nBecause adding either 1p or 4p will form a shuntsu.\n\nSo, for each initial tile, we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu that includes that tile.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- For each of the three initial tiles, compute the minimal number of tiles needed to form any mentsu that includes that tile.\n\n- Then, the overall minimal across all three is the answer.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the first tile is 1s, and the initial set doesn't have any mentsu that includes 1s. So the minimal is 2. But the sample output is 0 for that tile. That suggests that I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to find the minimal across all possible mentsus, regardless of which initial tile is used. But the sample output suggests that each initial tile's scenario is considered, and the output is three numbers, each indicating the minimal for that tile.\n\nWait, the sample output is ['0', '0', '1'], which for the first tile is 0, which suggests that 1s is part of a mentsu already present.\n\nBut in the initial set, the 1s is alone, and the other two are 9m's, which form a koutsu. So the initial set has a mentsu (the koutsu of 9m's). So for the first initial tile (1s), it's part of that mentsu? No, because the mentsu is 9m's. So the 1s is not part of it.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the initial set is three tiles: 1s,9m,9m. So the mentsu is the triplet of 9m's, and the 1s is not part of it.\n\nSo the sample output is 0,0,1. So for the first initial tile (1s), the minimal is 0. But why?\n\nBecause in the initial set, there's a mentsu (the triplet of 9m's), and the first initial tile is not part of it. So how can the first initial tile have a required 0?\n\nAh, I think I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the output is the minimal number of tiles to add so that at least one mentsu exists in the entire set, regardless of which initial tile is considered. So the output is a single number, not three. But the sample shows three numbers. So perhaps the problem is that for each initial tile, compute the minimal required to form a mentsu that uses that tile, and then output the minimal across all three.\n\nWait, but the sample shows three numbers as output. So perhaps the output is three integers, each representing the minimal required for each of the three initial tiles. So for each tile, what's the minimal number of tiles needed to add to form a mentsu that includes that tile.\n\nSo, for the first tile, 1s: can it be part of a mentsu with 0 added tiles? Because currently, the initial set has 1s, 9m, 9m. So no, because the only mentsu is the triplet of 9m's, which doesn't include 1s. So the first tile's minimal required is 2, but the sample shows 0. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the sample input.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSo the initial set is three tiles:\n\nTile 1: 1s\n\nTile 2: 9m\n\nTile 3: 9m\n\nSo the initial set is {1s, 9m, 9m}.\n\nSo in the initial set, the 9m appears twice. So, the triplet 9m,9m,9m is not possible because only two 9m's are present. So the initial set does not contain a koutsu.\n\nWait, wait! Oh, right! Because a koutsu requires three identical tiles. So, if you have two 9m's, you can't form a koutsu. So in the initial set, the only mentsu is none.\n\nSo the sample output is [0,0,1], but how?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\nAfter drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.\n\nShe must have at least one mentsu.\n\nSo, the initial set is three tiles. She can add any number of tiles, including duplicates.\n\nThe question is to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that in the resulting set, there exists at least one mentsu.\n\nSo, the sample input's initial set is 1s,9m,9m.\n\nWhat's the minimal number of tiles to add?\n\nWell, adding 9m once will make three 9m's, forming a koutsu. So she needs to add one tile.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nBut the sample output is [0,0,1].\n\nHmm. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the output is three numbers, each indicating the minimal required for each initial tile, but the overall answer is the minimal across all three.\n\nWait, but the sample output is [0,0,1], which implies that for the first initial tile, 0 is the minimal, which would mean that the initial set already has a mentsu involving that tile.\n\nBut in the initial set, the only mentsu possible is not present. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the output is the minimal number of tiles to add for each of the initial tiles, regardless of whether the initial set has a mentsu.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense. For example, in the initial set, no mentsu exists. So the minimal for all tiles is at least 1.\n\nSo why is the sample output 0?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the initial set plus added tiles must contain at least one mentsu, and the output is the minimal number of tiles needed to add to achieve that. So the output is a single number, not three.\n\nBut the sample shows three numbers as output. So perhaps I'm completely misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"Print a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\"\n\nBut the sample input is three strings, and the output is three numbers.\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is that the initial set is three tiles, but she has three separate hands, and for each of them, compute the minimal required. So the output is three numbers, each for each initial tile.\n\nWait, but the problem says: \"print a single integer\".\n\nSo this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimal number of tiles needed to add so that at least one of the initial tiles is part of a mentsu. But that's not what the sample indicates.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Let's try to think of another approach.\n\nPerhaps the problem is to find for each of the three initial tiles, the minimal number of tiles to add so that this tile is part of a mentsu. Then, the overall minimal across all three is the answer.\n\nBut in the sample, the initial tiles are 1s,9m,9m.\n\nSo for the first tile, 1s:\n\nTo form a mentsu that includes 1s, she can form a shuntsu 1s,2s,3s. Currently, she has one tile, so needs two more.\n\nOr, she can form a koutsu of 1s,1s,1s. She has one, so needs two more.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nBut the sample output for this tile is 0. So this approach isn't matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is three numbers, each for the three initial tiles, and the answer is the minimal of these three.\n\nIn the sample, the first tile's minimal is 0, second is 0, third is 1. So the overall answer is 0.\n\nBut why would the first tile's minimal be 0?\n\nBecause, perhaps in the initial set, the 1s is part of a shuntsu that includes 2s and 3s. But in the initial set, she only has 1s. So she can't form a shuntsu yet.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe the initial set is considered as part of the mentsu. So, the initial set is three tiles, and she can form a mentsu without adding any tiles.\n\nIn the initial set, she has 1s,9m,9m. Does this form any mentsu?\n\nNo. Because 9m appears twice. So to form a koutsu, she needs three of the same.\n\nSo, the initial set doesn't form a mentsu.\n\nSo, she must add at least one tile.\n\nSo, in the sample, the minimal is 1.\n\nBut the sample output is [0,0,1]. So perhaps the output is the minimal for each tile, but the overall answer is the minimal across all.\n\nBut that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the minimal number of tiles needed to add so that all initial tiles are part of a mentsu. But that doesn't fit the sample.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find for each initial tile, the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu that includes that tile, and the overall answer is the minimal of these three.\n\nSo, the sample output is 0 for the first tile because she can form a mentsu that includes it by adding zero tiles.\n\nBut in the initial set, she can't form any mentsu, so adding zero tiles won't help.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles needed to add so that the union of the initial tiles and added tiles contains a mentsu, regardless of which initial tile is used.\n\nIn that case, the sample's initial set is 1s,9m,9m. Adding one 9m would form a koutsu. So the minimal is 1.\n\nBut the sample output is 0,0,1. Which is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is three numbers, each being the minimal required for each initial tile, but the answer is the minimal of all three.\n\nIn the sample, the minimal is 0, achieved by the first and second initial tiles.\n\nBut why? Because adding zero tiles allows a mentsu to be formed. But in the initial set, no mentsu is present.\n\nThis is getting really confusing. Maybe I should look for hints or similar problems.\n\nWait, the sample input is ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'].\n\nWait, but the initial set is three tiles: 1s, 9m,9m.\n\nWait, perhaps the second initial tile is '9m 9m 9m', which is three 9m's. So, that forms a koutsu. So, in the initial set, there's already a mentsu. So the minimal number of tiles to add is zero.\n\nSo, the sample output is 0,0,1.\n\nBecause:\n\n- The first initial tile (1s) is part of a mentsu that exists in the initial set? No, because the mentsu is the 9m's.\n\nSo why is the first initial tile's output 0?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial set is considered as having three tiles, but each tile can be part of a mentsu in the initial set.\n\nSo, for the first initial tile (1s), is there a mentsu in the initial set that includes it?\n\nNo, because the only mentsu is the 9m's.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial reasoning is incorrect, and the sample output is 0 because she can form a mentsu without adding any tiles.\n\nBut in that case, the initial set has a mentsu. But according to the initial set, the 9m's are present as two copies. So, unless the third tile is also 9m, which it's not.\n\nWait, the initial set is 1s,9m,9m. So, the 9m's are two, not three. So, no koutsu.\n\nSo, perhaps the sample output is 0, but why?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial set is considered as having three tiles, but the way the tiles are arranged can form a mentsu in some way.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial set is 1s,9m,9m. So, the 9m's are two, which can't form a koutsu. But wait, perhaps in the initial set, the 9m's are present as two, and the 1s is another. So, no mentsu is present.\n\nThus, the minimal number of tiles to add is 1.\n\nBut the sample output is 0,0,1.\n\nSo, I'm really confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to compute for each of the three initial tiles, the minimal number of tiles needed to form a mentsu that includes that tile, and then output the minimal across all three. But in the sample, the second and third initial tiles are part of a koutsu that can be formed by adding zero tiles because the third tile is 9m, but wait, no, the initial set is 9m,9m, and another tile.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial set is the three tiles, and the user can add any tiles, including duplicates. So, for the second initial tile, which is 9m, she can add another 9m, making three, and thus forming a koutsu. So, the minimal for the second initial tile is 1. But the sample shows 0.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the initial set is considered as four tiles, but no, the problem states that the initial set is three.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial set is four tiles, but no, the input is three.\n\nI think I'm stuck and need to find another approach.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nThe initial set is three tiles. We need to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that the combined set has at least one mentsu.\n\nA mentsu is a triplet or a sequence.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\n1. Parse the initial set into a multiset or a dictionary counting the occurrences of each tile.\n\n2. For all possible mentsus (triplets or sequences), compute how many tiles are needed to form them based on the initial set.\n\n3. The minimal number of tiles to add is the minimal (3 - count) across all possible mentsus.\n\nBut this approach ignores the fact that adding tiles can contribute to multiple mentsus.\n\nBut the problem only requires that at least one mentsu is present.\n\nSo, the minimal is the minimal number of tiles needed to form any mentsu.\n\nBut how to enumerate all possible mentsus.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Generate all possible mentsus.\n\n- For each mentsu, compute how many tiles are already present in the initial set.\n\n- The required tiles is 3 - count.\n\n- The minimal required is the minimal of these.\n\nSo, the code will:\n\n- Create a frequency dictionary for the initial tiles.\n\n- Generate all possible triplets (koutsu) and sequences (shuntsu).\n\n- For each mentsu, count how many tiles are already present.\n\n- Keep track of the minimal required.\n\nSo, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, how to generate all possible mentsus.\n\nKoutsu: each is three same tiles, e.g., 1m,1m,1m.\n\nSo for each suit, for each number from 1-9, we can have a koutsu.\n\nShuntsu: each is a sequence of three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\nFor each suit, the possible shuntsus are:\n\nnumbers i, i+1, i+2, for i from 1 to 7.\n\nSo, for each suit, 7 possible shuntsus.\n\nSo, total mentsus:\n\nFor each of the three suits:\n\n- 9 koutsus (each number 1-9, same tile)\n\n- 7 shuntsus (i, i+1, i+2 for i=1 to 7)\n\nTotal: 3*(9 +7) = 48 mentsus.\n\nSo, for each of these 48 mentsus, we can compute how many of their three tiles are present in the initial set.\n\nSo, the code can precompute all 48 mentsus, and for each, compute the required tiles.\n\nThen, the minimal required is the minimal (3 - count) across all mentsus.\n\nBut wait, the initial set is three tiles, and adding tiles can add any number, so for each mentsu, the required is max(0, 3 - count).\n\nWait, no, because the initial set may have more than three tiles. Wait, no, the initial set is three tiles, and the code will compute how many of the mentsu's three tiles are present. The required is 3 - count. But since adding can include any tiles, including duplicates, the required is the number of tiles missing from the initial set for that mentsu.\n\nWait, for a mentsu, the required is the number of tiles needed to add to have at least one copy of each in the mentsu.\n\nSo, for each mentsu, count how many of the three tiles are present in the initial set. The required is 3 - count.\n\nSo, for example, if a mentsu is 1m,2m,3m, and the initial set has 1m and 3m, the count is 2, so required is 1.\n\nBut wait, in the initial set, 1m and 3m are present. So, to form the shuntsu, she can add 2m.\n\nSo, the required is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nRead the three initial tiles, and create a frequency map.\n\nGenerate all 48 mentsus.\n\nFor each mentsu, count how many of its three tiles are present in the initial set.\n\nCompute required = 3 - count.\n\nTrack the minimal required.\n\nSo, the code will output this minimal required.\n\nTesting this approach on the sample.\n\nSample input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nInitial tiles are: 1s, 9m, 9m.\n\nFrequency map: 1s:1, 9m:2.\n\nNow, for each mentsu:\n\nCheck all 48 mentsus.\n\nFor example, the koutsu 9m,9m,9m: count is 2 (two 9m's are present). So required is 1.\n\nAnother koutsu: 1m,1m,1m: count is 1 (only 1s). So required is 2.\n\nShuntsu in 's' suit: 1s,2s,3s: count is 1. Required is 2.\n\nShuntsu in 'm' suit: 1m,2m,3m: count is 0. Required is 3.\n\nShuntsu in 'p' suit: 1p,2p,3p: count is 0. Required is 3.\n\nAnother shuntsu in 'm': 8m,9m,10m → but 10m is invalid. So no.\n\nWait, no, shuntsu is up to 7,8,9. So 7m,8m,9m is a valid shuntsu.\n\nFor this mentsu, count is 1 (9m is present). So required is 2.\n\nSo, among all mentsus, the minimal required is 1.\n\nSo, the sample's output should be 1.\n\nBut the sample output is [0,0,1], which suggests that the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, but according to the sample explanation, in the third initial tile (2p), adding one tile (1p or 4p) forms a shuntsu.\n\nSo, for that mentsu, the required is 1.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, the minimal required across all mentsus is 1.\n\nSo, the code would output 1.\n\nBut the sample expects 0,0,1.\n\nWait, this is conflicting.\n\nSo perhaps the code's approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not to find the minimal",
