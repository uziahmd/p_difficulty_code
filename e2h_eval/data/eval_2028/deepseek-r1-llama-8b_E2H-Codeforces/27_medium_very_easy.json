On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"A Twisty Movement\" and involves sequences of numbers. Hmm.\n\nSo, the problem statement says that Tommy wants to choose an interval [l, r] in the sequence and reverse the subarray from l to r. After doing this, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the new sequence.\n\nWait, right. The original sequence consists of 1s and 2s because each ai is either 1 or 2. That's helpful because the possible values are limited, which might make some optimizations feasible.\n\nLet me think about the approach. For each possible interval [l, r], we reverse a[l..r], then compute the LNDS of the modified array. We need to find the maximum such LNDS across all possible intervals.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2000. So if we try every possible [l, r], that's O(n^2) possibilities. For each possibility, reversing is O(1) since it's just a swap of elements. Then, computing the LNDS after reversal could take O(n^2) time using a dynamic programming approach. But 2000^4 is way too big—like 16e12 operations, which is impossible.\n\nHmm, that won't work. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to realize that for binary sequences of 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be computed efficiently. Because the values are only 1 and 2, the structure of the LNDS is quite constrained.\n\nLet me think: for any reversed interval, the overall effect on the LNDS isn't straightforward. How does reversing a subarray affect the sequence? Maybe we can model how the reversal changes certain properties that contribute to the LNDS.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute for all possible intervals [l, r], what the LNDS would be after reversing, but even that seems computationally heavy.\n\nAnother angle: since the original sequence is small, maybe we can find for each possible l and r, the best possible LNDS after reversal by looking for certain patterns.\n\nWait, the maximum possible LNDS in any array of 1s and 2s is min(k, n), where k is the count of 1s followed by 2s or something like that. Wait, no, that's not correct. For example, a strictly increasing sequence of 1s and 2s will have an LNDS equal to the entire length.\n\nWait, in a sequence of 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be computed by counting the number of 1s followed by 2s as much as possible. Or perhaps, the LNDS is simply the maximum number of 1s you can have before a 2, plus the maximum number of 2s after that. Or maybe not. Let me think.\n\nActually, the LNDS for a sequence of 1s and 2s can be found by greedily taking as many 1s as possible, then as many 2s as possible. Because since 1 ≤ 2, any 2 can follow a 1, but 1 cannot follow a 2. So the optimal LNDS is the maximum between the number of 1s in the entire array plus the number of 2s that come after them, or the number of 2s if there are more 2s than 1s.\n\nWait, no. Let me take an example. Suppose the sequence is 1 2 1 2. The LNDS is 4, as in the first example. So the approach is to count all 1s and 2s in a way that they are non-decreasing. Since 1 can be followed by 1 or 2, and 2 can only be followed by 2.\n\nSo for a given array, the LNDS can be found by processing each element and keeping track of the counts. Let me formalize this:\n\nInitialize two variables, count1 and count2. For each element in the array:\n\n- If the element is 1:\n   - count1 += 1\n   - count2 remains the same as before.\n- If the element is 2:\n   - count2 = max(count2 + 1, count1 + 1)\n\nBecause when you encounter a 2, it can extend the previous 2 sequence (if it's larger than or equal to the last 2) or start a new one based on the count of 1s.\n\nWait, let me test this logic with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: [1, 2, 1, 2]\n\nProcessing each element:\n\n1: count1=1, count2=0.\n\n2: since it's 2, count2 becomes max(0+1, 1+1)=2.\n\n1: count1=2, count2 remains 2.\n\n2: count2 becomes max(2+1, 2+1)=3.\n\nSo the maximum is 3, but the correct answer after reversal is 4. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe my approach is incorrect. Let's re-examine the sample.\n\nAfter reversing [2,3], the array becomes [1,1,2,2]. So the LNDS is 4, which is indeed correct.\n\nSo according to my previous method:\n\nProcessing 1,1,2,2:\n\n1: count1=1, count2=0.\n\n1: count1=2, count2=0.\n\n2: count2 becomes max(0+1, 2+1) = 2.\n\n2: count2 becomes max(2+1, 2+1)=3.\n\nWait, that gives a maximum of 3, but actual is 4. So my approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, what's the correct way to compute LNDS for a binary array?\n\nWait, another approach: the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s in a row followed by all 2s. Or perhaps it's the maximum number of 1s that can be taken from the beginning, or the maximum number of 2s from the end, whichever is larger.\n\nNo, that's not sufficient. For example, in [1,2,1,2], the optimal is 4.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS is equal to the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before a 2, considering their positions.\n\nWait, maybe the LNDS is the sum of the number of 1s in the entire array plus the number of 2s that come after some point in the array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s and 2s arranged in a non-decreasing order, which for 1s and 2s is equivalent to having all 1s first, then all 2s. Because 1 can be followed by 1 or 2, and 2 can only be followed by 2.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the maximum LNDS is the maximum between the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1, or the total number of 2s.\n\nWait, no. Because if the array is already in order, then the LNDS is n. For example, [1,1,2,2], the LNDS is 4.\n\nBut for [1,2,1,2], the optimal after reversal is 4, which suggests that the LNDS is 4, which is the total number of elements.\n\nWait, maybe the LNDS is the maximum between the number of 1s in the array and the number of 2s in the array, plus the minimum between the number of 1s and the number of 2s. Or perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, think of the LNDS as the largest possible group of 1s followed by 2s. Because 1 <= 2, any 1 can precede any 2, but 2 can't precede 1.\n\nSo for any array, the LNDS is equal to the maximum number of 1s plus the maximum number of 2s that come after some position where all 1s before that position have been considered.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal LNDS is the maximum between the total number of 1s (since all can be included) plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1, or the total number of 2s if that's larger.\n\nNo, that doesn't hold. Let's take the first sample: [1,2,1,2]. Number of 1s is 2, 2s is 2.\n\nIf we take the 1s first, then the 2s: the 1s are at positions 0 and 2, and the 2s are at positions 1 and 3. So in the reversed array, they become [1,1,2,2], which has 4 elements.\n\nWait, maybe the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s that can be taken, followed by as many 2s as possible after those 1s.\n\nWait, for the first sample, the maximum LNDS is 4, which is all 1s and 2s. So perhaps, the LNDS can sometimes include all elements.\n\nWait, but how do we model that? Maybe for each possible position where we switch from 1 to 2, the LNDS is the number of 1s up to that point plus the number of 2s from that point onward.\n\nSo the maximum over all possible split points i (from 0 to n) of (number of 1s in the first i elements) + (number of 2s in the remaining n-i elements).\n\nBut wait, that's not always correct. For example, in a sequence like [1,1,2,2,1], the optimal split point would be after the second 2. So the count is 2 (1s) + 2 (2s) =4, but the actual LNDS is 4.\n\nHmm, but in the first sample, the split point is after the second 1, giving 2 + 2 =4.\n\nSo perhaps the LNDS can be computed as the maximum of (prefix_1[i] + suffix_2[i]) for all i from 0 to n.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for each possible split point, you're considering taking all 1s up to i and all 2s from i onwards. Since the array is binary, any such split would form a non-decreasing sequence.\n\nSo, to compute the LNDS for any array, we can precompute prefix_1 and suffix_2 arrays, then for each possible split point i, compute prefix_1[i] + suffix_2[i], and take the maximum of these values.\n\nThis approach would be O(n) time to compute prefix and suffix arrays, and then O(n) to compute the maximum. So for each possible reversed interval, we can compute the LNDS quickly.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to: for each possible interval [l, r], reverse a[l..r], compute the prefix_1 and suffix_2 arrays, and find the maximum (prefix_1[i] + suffix_2[i]) over all i. Then, keep track of the maximum over all intervals.\n\nBut the issue is that for each [l, r], the array is modified, and for each such modification, we need to compute the prefix_1 and suffix_2 arrays, which is O(n) per interval. With n=2000, that's 2000 * 2000 = 4e6 intervals, each requiring O(n) operations, leading to 8e9 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo that's not feasible. We need a way to compute, for each possible interval [l, r], what the prefix_1 and suffix_2 would look like without actually modifying the array each time.\n\nWait, but how? Reversing a subarray affects the order of elements, which in turn affects the prefix_1 and suffix_2 arrays.\n\nAn alternative approach: for each possible [l, r], what is the modified array's prefix_1 and suffix_2, and then compute the maximum.\n\nBut again, for each [l, r], this is O(n), leading to O(n^3) time, which is 8e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think differently. Since the array consists of 1s and 2s, perhaps the effect of reversing a subarray can be captured by examining how it changes the order of 1s and 2s in certain regions.\n\nWait, for the prefix_1 array, the reversed subarray may change the count of 1s in the prefix. Similarly, for the suffix_2 array, the reversed subarray may change the count of 2s in the suffix.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible interval [l, r], the modified array's prefix_1 is the same as the original prefix_1 up to l-1, then depends on the reversed subarray, and similarly for the suffix_2.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal interval to reverse is such that the modified array has as many 1s as possible followed by as many 2s as possible. So perhaps we can model for each possible interval [l, r], how it affects the 1s and 2s in the prefix and suffix.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to find the interval [l, r] where, when reversed, the sequence becomes as \"good\" as possible, meaning that the maximum split point i gives a higher value.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to calculate that.\n\nAnother idea: since the array is small (n=2000), perhaps we can precompute for all possible intervals [l, r], the modified array, compute its LNDS as per the split method, and then find the maximum.\n\nBut as earlier thought, this would be O(n^2) * O(n) = O(8e9), which is way too slow.\n\nWait, but wait: for n=2000, n^2 is 4 million. For each interval, the computation of the LNDS is O(n), which is 2000 steps. So 4e6 * 2e3 = 8e9 operations. That's way beyond what can be handled in Python, which typically handles around 1e8 operations per second.\n\nSo we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach: find the best possible interval [l, r] that maximizes the LNDS. Perhaps the optimal interval is determined by specific patterns in the array.\n\nLet me think about the effect of reversing a subarray. What happens to the prefix_1 and suffix_2 arrays after the reversal.\n\nSuppose we reverse a subarray from l to r. The elements within this subarray are now in reverse order.\n\nFor the prefix_1 array, the modified array will have the same elements as before, except in the region [l, r]. So for indices before l, the prefix_1 is the same as the original. For indices after r, it's also the same. But between l and r, the order of 1s and 2s is reversed.\n\nSimilarly for the suffix_2 array: after the reversal, the 2s in the [l, r] region are in reverse order, which may affect the suffix_2 counts.\n\nHmm, but I'm not seeing a clear way to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum LNDS can be achieved by choosing an interval where the reversed part starts with a lot of 2s and ends with a lot of 1s. Or perhaps it's better to reverse a segment that has a lot of 1s followed by 2s, thus allowing more 1s to be in the prefix and 2s in the suffix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal interval is one where the reversed segment allows us to have a longer run of 1s before a run of 2s.\n\nWait, but without knowing which interval to reverse, it's hard to proceed.\n\nLet me think of the problem differently. What if we consider that for any interval [l, r], the reversed subarray may alter the positions of certain 1s and 2s. The goal is to arrange the array such that the maximum split point i gives the highest possible prefix_1[i] + suffix_2[i].\n\nSo, for each possible [l, r], the modified array has certain prefix_1 and suffix_2 arrays. We need to find the maximum over all these possibilities.\n\nBut again, the problem is how to compute this efficiently.\n\nPerhaps instead of trying every possible [l, r], we can find for each possible l and r the best possible split point i and compute the maximum.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe we can model the problem by considering the impact of reversing [l, r] on the prefix_1 and suffix_2 arrays.\n\nLet me denote the original array as A.\n\nWhen we reverse [l, r], the subarray becomes A[l..r][::-1].\n\nSo, for the prefix_1 array:\n\nFor positions < l: same as before.\n\nFor positions >= r: same as before.\n\nBetween l and r: the number of 1s up to position i is equal to the number of 1s in the reversed subarray up to (i - (l-1)).\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because the reversed subarray's 1s are in reverse order.\n\nHmm, perhaps the reversed subarray's contribution to the prefix_1 array can be represented as the original subarray's prefix_1, but in reverse.\n\nSimilarly for the suffix_2 array.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to combine this information.\n\nWait, maybe for each possible interval [l, r], the modified array's prefix_1 can be thought of as the original prefix_1 up to l-1, then for l <= i <= r, the prefix_1 is the original subarray's prefix_1 at (r - (i - l + 1) + 1). Or perhaps it's the original subarray's prefix_1 in reverse order.\n\nWait, perhaps the prefix_1 after reversal is as follows:\n\nThe modified array from 1 to l-1 is same as before.\n\nFrom l to r, the original array A[l..r] is reversed. So the prefix_1 for position i (l <= i <= r) is the number of 1s in the reversed subarray up to (i - l + 1)th position.\n\nWhich is equal to the original subarray's prefix_1 at (r - (i - l + 1) + 1) = r - i + l.\n\nWait, that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the modified array, the prefix_1 can be computed as:\n\nprefix_1_modified[i] = prefix_1_original[i] \n\nfor i < l.\n\nFor i >= l and i <= r: \n\nthe number of 1s up to i is the number of 1s in the reversed subarray A[l..r] up to (i - l + 1).\n\nWhich is the same as the number of 1s in the original subarray A[l..r] up to (r - (i - l + 1) + 1).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of the reversed subarray as the original subarray reversed. So for each position i in [l, r], the element is A[r - (i - l)].\n\nSo the prefix_1 for i in [l, r] is the sum of 1s in A[r], A[r-1], ..., A[l], up to (i - l + 1) terms.\n\nWhich is the same as the sum of 1s in the original subarray A[l..r] in reverse order up to (i - l + 1) elements.\n\nHmm, but that seems difficult to model.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given [l, r], the modified prefix_1 can be considered as:\n\nprefix_1_modified[i] = \n\noriginal_prefix_1[i] \n\nfor i < l,\n\nand for i >= l,\n\nprefix_1_modified[i] = original_prefix_1[l-1] + the number of 1s in the reversed subarray up to (i - l + 1).\n\nWhich is the same as the number of 1s in the original subarray up to (r - (i - l + 1) + 1) positions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to precompute for each possible [l, r], the modified prefix_1 and suffix_2, but that's again O(n^3), which is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Instead of iterating over all possible [l, r], perhaps we can find for each possible split point i, what is the best possible [l, r] that maximizes prefix_1[i] + suffix_2[i], and then choose the maximum over all splits.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for a given split point i, the LNDS is prefix_1[i] + suffix_2[i]. So, for each possible split i (from 0 to n), we can find the maximum possible prefix_1[i] + suffix_2[i] across all possible intervals [l, r].\n\nThen, the overall maximum is the maximum of all these.\n\nSo, for each i, the problem reduces to finding the best interval [l, r] such that when reversed, the prefix_1 up to i is as large as possible, and the suffix_2 from i is as large as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible split point i, the best interval [l, r] is such that the reversed part includes as many 1s as possible in the prefix and as many 2s as possible in the suffix.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum LNDS can be achieved by reversing a single element. So, for each element in the array, we can try reversing it and compute the LNDS. Then take the maximum over all such possibilities.\n\nBut that's not necessarily the case. The sample input's optimal solution was reversing a two-element interval.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: For each possible interval [l, r], the modified array's LNDS can be found by considering the split points within and outside the interval. Maybe we can find for each [l, r], the best split i, and compute the maximum.\n\nBut again, for each [l, r], finding the best i is O(n), which is too slow.\n\nWait, but perhaps the best i for a given [l, r] is either inside the interval or outside. Or perhaps it's somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best i is determined by the structure of the reversed interval.\n\nWait, perhaps for each interval [l, r], the optimal split i is at l-1 or r+1, or somewhere in between.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the array is small (n=2000), perhaps for each possible interval [l, r], we can represent the modified array as a list, reverse it, compute prefix_1 and suffix_2, and then find the maximum split. This approach would be O(n^3), which is 8e10 operations. That's way too slow for Python, which can handle about 1e8 operations per second.\n\nSo, that's not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Find that the optimal interval [l, r] must be such that the reversed part has a certain structure, like all 1s followed by all 2s. Then, for such intervals, the LNDS can be computed quickly.\n\nBut I don't know.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal interval is such that the reversed subarray is a run of 1s followed by a run of 2s. Because then, when reversed, it becomes a run of 2s followed by a run of 1s, which may allow for a longer LNDS.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal interval is such that, when reversed, it allows as many 1s as possible to appear before 2s.\n\nBut again, without knowing how to model this, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's think about the initial array. The LNDS is the maximum of (prefix_1[i] + suffix_2[i]) for all i.\n\nReversing a subarray can potentially increase this maximum.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem reduces to finding the interval [l, r] such that, after reversal, the maximum of (prefix_1[i] + suffix_2[i]) is as large as possible.\n\nBut how do we find such an interval?\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible interval [l, r], the maximum (prefix_1[i] + suffix_2[i]) can be computed based on the structure of the original array.\n\nBut again, without knowing how to compute this quickly, it's unclear.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the array is binary, perhaps for each possible interval [l, r], the modified array's LNDS can be found in O(1) time, based on certain properties.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum LNDS after reversing [l, r] is the maximum between:\n\n- The maximum LNDS of the original array.\n\n- The maximum possible when the reversed subarray allows all 1s to come before 2s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to realize that the optimal interval [l, r] is such that the reversed subarray is a run of 1s followed by a run of 2s. When reversed, this becomes a run of 2s followed by a run of 1s, which can potentially allow more 2s to be in the prefix and more 1s to be in the suffix.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's think of the sample input 2:\n\nInput: 10 elements, 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1.\n\nAfter reversing [3,7], which is the subarray 2,2,2,1,1, the reversed subarray becomes 1,1,2,2,2. So the array becomes [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]. The LNDS is 9, which is all except the last element.\n\nSo the split point is after the 5th element (the last 2), giving 5 2s and 5 2s after, but that's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the split is after the 5th element (index 5?), giving prefix_1[5] = 5 and suffix_2[5] =4, totaling 9.\n\nSo the LNDS is 9.\n\nSo the interval [3,7] allowed the reversed subarray to have more 1s in the prefix.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal interval is such that, when reversed, the 1s in the subarray are moved to the beginning of the reversed subarray, thus contributing to the prefix_1.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible interval [l, r], the number of 1s in the reversed subarray is x, and the number of 2s is y. Then, when reversed, the 1s are placed at the end of the subarray, and the 2s are placed at the beginning.\n\nWait, no, when you reverse a subarray, the order is reversed. So, if the original subarray is [a1, a2, ..., ay], after reversal, it becomes [ay, ..., a2, a1].\n\nSo, for the subarray, the number of 1s in the reversed subarray is the same as in the original, but their positions are reversed.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: For each possible interval [l, r], let's compute how the 1s and 2s are distributed in the reversed subarray, and then see how it affects the prefix_1 and suffix_2 arrays.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute for each possible [l, r], the number of 1s in the subarray, and the number of 2s. Then, when the subarray is reversed, the 1s are now positioned at the end of the subarray, and the 2s are at the beginning.\n\nBut how does that affect the prefix_1 and suffix_2 arrays.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each interval [l, r], the reversed subarray contributes a certain number of 1s and 2s to the prefix and suffix.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nMaybe it's time to think about the problem differently. Since the array is small, perhaps we can precompute for all possible intervals [l, r], the modified array, and for each, compute the LNDS as per the split method, then take the maximum.\n\nBut for n=2000, this would be 2000*2000=4e6 intervals. For each, we need to reverse the subarray, compute prefix_1 and suffix_2, then find the maximum split.\n\nBut for each interval, reversing is O(r-l+1) time, which for 2000 is 2000 steps. Then, computing prefix_1 and suffix_2 is O(n) each. So for each interval, it's O(n) steps. 4e6 * 2e3 = 8e9 steps—way too slow for Python.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can precompute for all possible intervals [l, r], the modified prefix_1 and suffix_2 arrays.\n\nBut even that seems challenging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each interval [l, r], we can compute the modified prefix_1 and suffix_2 arrays in O(1) time, leveraging precomputed data.\n\nBut I'm not seeing how.\n\nWait, another Idea: Since the elements are only 1 and 2, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS after reversing [l, r] is the maximum of:\n\n1. The original LNDS.\n\n2. The number of 1s in the entire array plus the number of 2s in the reversed subarray.\n\n3. The number of 2s in the entire array plus the number of 1s in the reversed subarray.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's see the first sample. Original array is [1,2,1,2]. The original LNDS is 3 (either 1,2,2 or 1,1,2).\n\nAfter reversing [2,3], the array is [1,1,2,2], which has LNDS 4.\n\nIn this case, the number of 1s is 2, and the number of 2s in the reversed subarray (which was [2,1]) is 1. So 2 + 1 =3, which is less than 4.\n\nWait, but the LNDS is 4, which is the total number of elements.\n\nHmm, perhaps that approach isn't capturing the correct measure.\n\nAnother Idea: The maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum number of 1s plus the maximum number of 2s in the entire array, but that's not possible because you can't have all 1s and 2s together unless they are arranged properly.\n\nWait, but the LNDS is the maximum possible non-decreasing sequence, which for 1s and 2s is the maximum of all possible runs of 1s followed by 2s.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal interval [l, r] is such that the reversed subarray allows a longer run of 1s followed by a longer run of 2s.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for hints or think about the problem differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal interval [l, r] is such that the reversed subarray starts with a lot of 2s and ends with a lot of 1s. Because when you reverse it, the 2s come before the 1s, which could disrupt the LNDS. Or perhaps the opposite.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal interval is such that the reversed subarray has a transition from 2 to 1. For example, if the original subarray has a run of 2s followed by a run of 1s, reversing it would create a run of 1s followed by a run of 2s, which could help in creating a longer LNDS.\n\nWait, that's an interesting thought. Suppose the original subarray is a run of 2s followed by a run of 1s. When you reverse it, the 1s come first, then the 2s. So in the modified array, the 1s are before the 2s, which could allow for a longer LNDS.\n\nFor example, suppose the subarray is [2,2,1,1]. Reversing it gives [1,1,2,2]. So the prefix_1 increases by 2, and the suffix_2 increases by 2, leading to a higher LNDS.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal interval [l, r] is such that in the original array, the subarray A[l..r] is a run of 2s followed by a run of 1s.\n\nThus, reversing it would allow the 1s to come before the 2s, thus increasing the prefix_1 and suffix_2 counts.\n\nSo, perhaps for each possible such interval, we can compute the gain in the LNDS.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute all possible intervals [l, r] where A[l..r] is a run of 2s followed by a run of 1s.\n\n2. For each such interval, compute the LNDS after reversing it.\n\n3. The maximum among these plus the original LNDS is the answer.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFirst, how to identify such intervals.\n\nWe can scan the array and for each possible l, find the maximum r where all elements from l to r are 2s, followed by 1s.\n\nBut for each l, r can be up to the point where the first 1 occurs.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, the maximum r is the minimal index where A[r] is 1, starting from l.\n\nAlternatively, for each l, find the longest possible run of 2s starting at l, and then the longest possible run of 1s following that.\n\nOnce such intervals are identified, reversing them can potentially give a higher LNDS.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis; I need to verify.\n\nIn the first sample, the interval [2,3] is [2,1], which is a run of 2 followed by 1. Reversing it gives [1,2], which allows the LNDS to increase.\n\nIn the second sample, the interval [3,7] is [2,2,2,1,1], which is 2s followed by 1s. Reversing gives 1,1,2,2,2, which allows the LNDS to be 9.\n\nSo, perhaps this is the right approach.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the original LNDS.\n\n2. For each possible interval [l, r] where A[l..r] is a run of 2s followed by a run of 1s:\n\n   a. Reverse this interval.\n\n   b. Compute the new LNDS.\n\n   c. Keep track of the maximum.\n\n3. The answer is the maximum between the original LNDS and the best new LNDS.\n\nNow, the question is: how to find all such intervals [l, r].\n\nTo find such intervals, we can iterate through the array and for each position l, find the maximum r such that A[l] is 2, and the next elements are 2s until some point, after which they are 1s.\n\nBut how to find all possible l and r where A[l..r] is a run of 2s followed by 1s.\n\nPerhaps we can precompute for each position l, the maximum r where the subarray from l to r is a run of 2s followed by a run of 1s.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible l, find the earliest position where the elements are 1s, and include all up to that point.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: For each possible l, find the maximal r where A[l..r] is a run of 2s, then find the maximal s where A[r+1..s] is a run of 1s. Then, the interval [l, s] is a candidate.\n\nBut this may miss some cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible l, the interval [l, r] is a run of 2s followed by a run of 1s. So, for each l, the r is the smallest index > l where A[r] is 1, and the subarray from l to r-1 is all 2s.\n\nWait, that could work.\n\nFor example, in the first sample:\n\nIndices 0:1, 1:2, 2:1, 3:2.\n\nFor l=1, A[1]=2. The next element is A[2]=1, which is 1. So the interval [1,2] is 2 followed by 1. Reversing this gives 1,2, which allows the LNDS to increase.\n\nSo, for each l where A[l] is 2, we can check if the next elements are 2s until a certain point, and then 1s.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to represent the array as a list of runs. Each run is a tuple (value, start, end).\n\nFor example, the first sample is:\n\nRun 1: 1, 0-0.\n\nRun 2: 2, 1-1.\n\nRun 3: 1, 2-2.\n\nRun 4: 2, 3-3.\n\nSo, any interval that starts in run 2 and ends in run 3 is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, in the second sample, the interval [3,7] is within run 2 (2s) and run 4 (1s).\n\nSo, the idea is to find all intervals that consist of a run of 2s followed by a run of 1s.\n\nThus, for each possible run of 2s, followed by a run of 1s, the interval [start_run_2.start, end_run_1.end] is a candidate.\n\nSo, the algorithm becomes:\n\n- Split the array into runs of consecutive same numbers.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in the given sequence of 1s and 2s.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the optimal interval to reverse is one where the subarray consists of a run of 2s followed by a run of 1s.
