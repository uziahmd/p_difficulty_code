Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Selling Souvenirs.\" Hmm, I think I understand the gist. Petya has a bunch of souvenirs, each with a weight and cost. He wants to select a subset where the total weight doesn't exceed m, and the total cost is as high as possible. So, it's like a knapsack problem, right?\n\nWait, but the constraints might be a bit tricky. Let me look at the input details. Oh right, n can be up to 100,000, and m up to 300,000. Hmm, that's a lot. So a standard dynamic programming approach might not work because for such large n and m, it would be way too slow.\n\nWait, but the weights are limited. Each wi is either 1, 2, or 3. Oh, that's a crucial point. So maybe we can group the items based on their weight and process them accordingly. That should help reduce the problem's complexity.\n\nSo, the plan is: since the weights are small (only 1, 2, 3), we can handle each weight category separately. For each category, we can sort the items in descending order of cost because we want the most valuable items first. Then, for each possible number of items taken from each category, we can compute the maximum cost without exceeding the weight limit.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. We'll have three groups: group1 for weight 1, group2 for weight 2, and group3 for weight 3. For each group, we'll sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each possible number of items taken from each group, we'll calculate if the total weight is within m, and find the combination that gives the highest total cost.\n\nBut how do we efficiently compute the best combination? Because for each possible count in group1, group2, and group3, the total weight could vary, and we need to track the maximum cost for each possible total weight up to m.\n\nHmm, perhaps a dynamic programming approach where dp[i][j] represents the maximum cost achievable by taking i items from group1, j items from group2, and k items from group3, but that seems complicated because the state space would be too big.\n\nWait, another idea: for each possible number of group1 items, precompute the maximum cost and the total weight. Similarly for group2 and group3. Then, use a two-pointer technique to combine these groups optimally.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight is up to 3, maybe we can model the problem with a DP array where we track the maximum cost for each possible total weight. But given that m can be 3e5, the DP array would be manageable.\n\nWait, let's think about it. We can process each group one by one and update the DP array accordingly. For group1, since all items have weight 1, we can take as many as possible in a way that maximizes the cost without exceeding the weight. Similarly for group2 and group3.\n\nWait, here's an outline:\n\n1. Separate the items into three groups based on their weights.\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n3. Precompute prefix sums for each group. For group1, prefix_sum_1[k] will be the total cost of taking the top k items from group1. Similarly for group2 and group3.\n4. Now, the problem reduces to selecting some k1, k2, k3 such that 1*k1 + 2*k2 + 3*k3 <= m, and the sum of their prefix sums is maximized.\n\nSo the problem becomes finding non-negative integers k1, k2, k3 that maximize prefix1[k1] + prefix2[k2] + prefix3[k3], subject to 1*k1 + 2*k2 + 3*k3 ≤ m.\n\nThis seems more manageable. But how to efficiently find the maximum sum.\n\nHmm, considering that the prefix sums for each group are sorted in a non-decreasing manner (since adding more items adds more cost), perhaps we can iterate through all possible k1 and k2, then compute the maximum possible k3, and find the best combination.\n\nBut even that might be too slow because n is up to 1e5, which means each group can have up to 3e4 items each (since 1e5 / 3 is about 33333). Wait no, wait, group1 has all items with weight 1, so group1's size is up to n, same for group2 and group3.\n\nWait, but when n is 1e5, each group could have up to 1e5 items. So iterating through all possible k1 and k2 would be O(n^2), which is 1e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nWe need a smarter approach.\n\nAnother idea: since the weight contributions are 1, 2, and 3, perhaps we can represent the problem as trying all possible combinations of taking a certain number of items from each group, but in a way that limits the computational steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for each group, the prefix sum is non-decreasing. So for a given k1 and k2, the maximum k3 is (m - (k1 + 2*k2)) // 3. Then, we can find the best k3 in group3 for that particular k1 and k2.\n\nBut even that, for each possible k1 and k2, checking the best k3 might still be too slow if done naively.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can precompute for each possible (k1, k2) the maximum possible k3, but again, that's O(n^2), which is not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the possible weight increments are 1, 2, and 3, perhaps we can model this with a 3D DP, but that's also not feasible because m is up to 3e5.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to loop through all possible numbers of group3 items, and for each, determine the best possible k1 and k2 that fit into the remaining weight.\n\nWait, but the groups are independent except for the weight constraint.\n\nWait, maybe for each possible k3, we can compute the maximum possible k1 and k2 that fit into the remaining weight (m - 3*k3), and then find the best combination of k1 and k2 in that remaining weight.\n\nBut how to compute the best k1 and k2 for a given remaining weight.\n\nWait, the remaining weight after taking k3 items from group3 is w = m - 3*k3. Then, for this w, we need to choose k1 (from group1) and k2 (from group2) such that k1 + 2*k2 ≤ w.\n\nThe problem now is, for each w, find the maximum sum of prefix1[k1] + prefix2[k2] where k1 + 2*k2 ≤ w.\n\nThis seems manageable, but how to compute this quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible w, we can precompute the maximum possible sum for all possible w.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAnother thought: For each group, the prefix sums are non-decreasing. So, for a given w, we can try all possible k2 (number of items taken from group2) such that 2*k2 ≤ w, and for each k2, the maximum k1 is w - 2*k2. Then, the maximum sum would be prefix1[k1_max] + prefix2[k2].\n\nBut even that, for each w, it's O(w/2) operations, which for w up to 3e5 could be 1e5 per w, which is 3e5 * 1e5 = 3e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nNo, that's not feasible.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each possible w, we can find the best k2 in group2 and k1 in group1 such that k1 + 2*k2 ≤ w, and the sum of their costs is maximized.\n\nSince group1 and group2's prefix sums are sorted, perhaps for each possible w, the optimal k2 is up to min(k_max_group2, w//2), and for each possible k2, the optimal k1 is min(k_max_group1, w - 2*k2).\n\nWait, but even that would be too slow for large w.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWe can precompute for each possible weight up to m, the maximum possible sum from group1 and group2 that doesn't exceed that weight. Then, for each k3, we can use this precomputed array to find the best sum.\n\nYes! Let's try that.\n\nSo, first, precompute an array dp12[w], which is the maximum sum achievable by choosing items from group1 and group2 with total weight exactly w. Wait, no, exactly or up to w? Wait, no. Actually, for a given weight limit, say s, we need the maximum sum from group1 and group2 such that the total weight is ≤ s.\n\nWait, but how to compute dp12[s], the maximum sum for group1 and group2 with total weight ≤ s.\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be done using a dynamic programming approach for group1 and group2. Since group1 items have weight 1 and group2 have weight 2, we can model this as a 0-1 knapsack for group1 and group2 combined.\n\nLet me think: group1's items are all weight 1, group2's are weight 2. So for each item in group1, adding it increases the weight by 1 and the cost by its c_i. For group2, each item increases weight by 2 and cost by c_i.\n\nBut combining both, we can model this as a standard knapsack where each item can be either taken or not, but with varying weights and costs.\n\nWait, but the problem is that group1 and group2 can have up to 1e5 items each, which makes a standard DP approach impossible for m up to 3e5.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find a way to compute the optimal selection of group1 and group2 items for each possible weight s.\n\nWait, group1 can be processed greedily because all items are weight 1. So, for any weight s, the maximum sum from group1 is the sum of the top s items in group1. Similarly for group2, the maximum sum for weight t is the sum of the top t items in group2.\n\nBut when combining group1 and group2, it's not just additive because the total weight is s = a + 2b, where a is the number of group1 items, and b the number from group2.\n\nSo, the problem is to find a and b such that a + 2b ≤ s, and the sum is prefix1[a] + prefix2[b] is maximized.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each possible s, the maximum sum is the maximum over all possible a and b where a + 2b ≤ s.\n\nBut again, for s up to 3e5, and a and b up to 1e5 each, it's not feasible to compute this directly.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each possible b (number of group2 items taken), the maximum a is s - 2*b. So for each b, the maximum a is min(k_max_group1, s - 2b). Then, for each b, compute a_max and see if prefix1[a_max] + prefix2[b] is better than the current maximum.\n\nBut even that, for each s, trying all possible b could be O(s), which is 3e5 per s, leading to 9e10 operations for all s up to 3e5—way too slow.\n\nWait, but what if we precompute for each possible b, the best a for all possible s >= 2b.\n\nWait, perhaps for each b, the best a is min(k_max_group1, s - 2b). So for each b, the contribution to s is prefix2[b] + prefix1[min(s - 2b, len(prefix1) - 1)].\n\nBut again, computing this for each s is too slow.\n\nAlternative Idea: Precompute for each possible weight s, the best combination of a and b.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, maybe the maximum for group1 and group2 can be found by considering all possible b, and for each b, compute the a that gives the maximum possible prefix1[a] for a <= (s - 2b). Then, for each s, the best is the maximum over all b of (prefix2[b] + prefix1[ a ] ), where a is min(k_max_group1, s - 2b).\n\nBut even this is O(1e5) per s, which is 3e5 * 1e5 = 3e10 operations—no way.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think about the structure of the problem.\n\nEach group's items are already sorted in descending order, so their prefix sums are non-decreasing. So, for a given b, the best a is determined by s - 2b.\n\nWait, maybe for each b, the function f_b(s) = prefix2[b] + prefix1[ min(s - 2b, len(prefix1)-1) ].\n\nBut then, for each s, the maximum over all b of f_b(s) is the value we need.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps for each b, we can compute the maximum possible a for different ranges of s. Like, for s from 2b to 2b + len(prefix1)-1, the a is len(prefix1)-1.\n\nBut this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for each b, the function f_b(s) is a step function that increases until s reaches 2b + len(prefix1)-1, after which it remains constant.\n\nWait, but even so, combining all these step functions for all b is difficult.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: Since group1 and group2 are separate, perhaps for each possible s, the maximum sum can be computed by trying all possible b up to s//2, and for each b, take the best a.\n\nBut for s up to 3e5, and b up to 1e5, that's 3e5 * 1e5 = 3e10 operations—too slow.\n\nSo, perhaps we need a way to compute for each possible s, the best b quickly.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each s, the optimal b can be found in logarithmic time.\n\nWait, because for each s, the function is the sum of a non-decreasing function (prefix1) and another (prefix2), but it's unclear.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's consider that for each b, the maximum possible a is len(prefix1) if 2b <= s.\n\nWait, but no. For a fixed b, the a can be up to s - 2b.\n\nBut since s is fixed, for each b, a is min(len(prefix1) - 1, s - 2b).\n\nBut the problem is that for each s, we have to check all possible b.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal approach is to precompute for each possible s, the best combination of a and b, and store it in a DP array.\n\nBut how to build this DP array efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps for each b, we can compute for all possible s >= 2b, the best a for that b, and then keep track of the maximum across all b.\n\nBut again, for 3e5 s and 1e5 b, it's not feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to note that for group1 and group2, since their items are sorted, the maximum possible sum for a given s is achieved by taking as many high-value items as possible.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum sum for group1 and group2 can be found by trying all possible b from 0 to min(b_max, s//2), and for each b, take the a that maximizes prefix1[a] where a is up to s - 2b.\n\nBut even this approach is O(s) for each s, which is too slow.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each s, the best b is around s/(2 + 1) = s/3, since each b contributes 2 to the weight. So maybe we can limit the range of b we check for each s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each s, the optimal b is somewhere between 0 and min(b_max, s//2). But even that, for each s, it's O(1e5) steps.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to find a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by iterating over possible numbers of group3 items first. For each possible k3, the remaining weight is m' = m - 3*k3. Then, for this m', we can compute the maximum sum from group1 and group2, which is the dp12[m'].\n\nBut how to compute dp12[m'] for each m' quickly.\n\nWait, maybe the dp12 array can be built once for all possible m' up to m.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Preprocess group1 and group2 to compute their prefix sums.\n2. For each possible s from 0 to m, compute dp12[s], which is the maximum sum achievable by group1 and group2 with total weight ≤ s.\n3. Once dp12 is built, for each possible k3 (number of group3 items taken), compute the remaining weight s = m - 3*k3. If s <0, skip. Otherwise, the total cost is dp12[s] + prefix3[k3]. Find the maximum over all k3.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to building the dp12 array, which is the maximum sum from group1 and group2 for each possible s.\n\nNow, how to compute dp12[s] efficiently.\n\nHmm, the problem is similar to a 2-dimensional knapsack where group1 has items of weight 1 and group2 items of weight 2.\n\nWait, but since group1 and group2 are independent, perhaps we can model this as a 2D grid where each cell (w, c) represents the maximum cost achievable with weight w, and then for each group's items, we update the grid accordingly.\n\nBut again, with w up to 3e5, this might be manageable.\n\nWait, the initial state is dp12[0] = 0, and all others are -infinity or something. Then, for each item in group1, we can add 1 to the weight and add its cost. Similarly for group2, each item adds 2 to the weight and its cost.\n\nBut since the items in group1 and group2 are sorted in descending order, perhaps we can process them in a way that allows us to build the dp12 array efficiently.\n\nWait, but for group1, processing them as a 0-1 knapsack is not efficient because there are up to 1e5 items. Same for group2.\n\nAlternative Idea: For group1, since all items are weight 1, the optimal way is to take the top s items for any s. So, for any s, the maximum sum from group1 is prefix1[s'], where s' is the minimum between the number of group1 items and s.\n\nSimilarly for group2: the maximum sum for 2*b is prefix2[b], but for any weight t >= 2*b, the sum can be up to prefix2[b].\n\nWait, so perhaps for any s, the maximum sum from group1 and group2 is the maximum over all possible b (number of group2 items) of (prefix2[b] + prefix1[ min(s - 2*b, len(prefix1)-1) ]).\n\nSo, the problem is to find, for each s, the maximum of this expression over all possible b.\n\nBut as before, this is O(s) per s, which is not feasible.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find the optimal b for each s quickly.\n\nWait, the function for each b is f_b(s) = prefix2[b] + prefix1[ min(s - 2b, len(prefix1)-1) ].\n\nWe can precompute for each b, the function f_b(s) is a piecewise linear function that increases until s reaches 2b + len(prefix1)-1, and then remains flat.\n\nHmm, but combining all these for each s is still challenging.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since for each b, the function f_b(s) is non-decreasing up to s = 2b + len(prefix1)-1, perhaps the maximum across all b for a particular s can be found by binary search.\n\nWait, for a given s, the optimal b is somewhere between 0 and min(b_max, s//2). But even so, for each s, trying all possible b in this range is O(1e5) per s.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal b for a given s is around s/(2+1) = s/3, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum for group1 and group2 can be found by trying all possible b in a window around s/3. But this might miss the optimal solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each possible b, the best a for each possible s, but again, this seems unmanageable.\n\nWait, another Idea: Since the prefix sums are non-decreasing, for a given s, the best b is the one that maximizes prefix2[b] + prefix1[s - 2b], where s - 2b must be ≥0 and ≤ len(prefix1)-1.\n\nSo, for each s, we can perform a binary search on b.\n\nWait, but how does the function behave? Let's say for a given s, as b increases, 2b increases, so s - 2b decreases. So, the a part (prefix1) is decreasing as b increases. But prefix2[b] is increasing as b increases.\n\nSo, the overall function f_b(s) = prefix2[b] + prefix1[s-2b] may have a single peak. So, for each s, the optimal b can be found using ternary search.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this applies here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is unimodal, meaning it increases to a maximum and then decreases, which would allow ternary search.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each s, we can perform a ternary search on b in [0, min(b_max, s//2)] to find the optimal b.\n\nBut how to confirm whether the function is unimodal.\n\nWell, for a fixed s, as b increases, 2b increases, so a decreases. So, prefix2[b] increases, but prefix1[a] decreases. So, the function f_b is the sum of a function that increases and another that decreases.\n\nIt's possible that the function has a single maximum point, making it suitable for ternary search.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each s, we can perform a ternary search on b to find the optimal value, leading to O(log(1e5)) steps per s.\n\nWhich, for s up to 3e5, would result in 3e5 * 20 = 6e6 steps, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Preprocess group1 and group2 into their prefix sums.\n\n2. For each s from 0 to m:\n   a. Use ternary search to find the optimal b in [0, min(b_max, s//2)].\n   b. Compute the corresponding a as min(a_max, s - 2b).\n   c. Compute the sum as prefix2[b] + prefix1[a].\n   d. Store the maximum sum for this s.\n\n3. Then, for each possible k3 (number of group3 items taken), compute s = m - 3*k3. If s >=0, get dp12[s] and add prefix3[k3]. Keep track of the maximum total.\n\nSo, let's think about implementing this.\n\nFirst, the steps to process each group:\n\nGroup1: collect all items with wi=1, sort them in descending order of ci, compute prefix1 where prefix1[k] is the sum of the first k items.\n\nSimilarly for group2 and group3.\n\nThen, for each s from 0 to m, compute dp12[s] as the maximum sum from group1 and group2 with total weight ≤ s.\n\nTo compute dp12[s], for each s, perform a ternary search on b in the possible range.\n\nWait, but for s=0, only b=0 is possible.\n\nBut how to implement the ternary search correctly.\n\nWait, let's outline the steps for each s:\n\nFor s in 0 to m:\n   low = 0\n   high = min(b_max, s // 2)\n   while low <= high:\n       mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n       mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n       cost1 = prefix2[mid1] + prefix1[min(s - 2*mid1, len(prefix1)-1)]\n       cost2 = prefix2[mid2] + prefix1[min(s - 2*mid2, len(prefix1)-1)]\n       if cost1 < cost2:\n           low = mid1 + 1\n       else:\n           high = mid2 - 1\n   best_b = high\n   best_a = s - 2*best_b\n   if best_a < 0:\n       best_a = 0\n   dp12[s] = prefix2[best_b] + prefix1[best_a]\n\nWait, but is this correct? Because the ternary search assumes that the function is unimodal, but perhaps in some cases, it's not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each s, the optimal b is in a small range, so we can try all possible b in a window around s/3, say from max(0, s/3 - 100) to min(s//2, s/3 + 100). For s up to 3e5, this would be 200 steps per s, leading to 3e5 * 200 = 6e7 steps, which should be manageable.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this approach would always find the optimal b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal b is near s/2, because group2 items contribute 2 units each, so to fill the weight, group2 should be taken as much as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal b is up to s//2, but again, trying all b up to s//2 is too slow.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, another Idea: For each possible s, the optimal b can be found by considering that for each additional b, we gain prefix2[b] but lose some a (since 2b increases, a decreases by 2 each time b increases by 1). So, the trade-off is between the two.\n\nPerhaps, for a given s, the optimal b is around the point where the marginal gain from adding another group2 item equals the loss from reducing group1 items.\n\nSo, for each s, the optimal b can be found by solving for when the derivative changes sign, which suggests a ternary search approach.\n\nBut I'm not confident about the function being unimodal. So, perhaps it's better to try a binary search or a loop with a small window.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each s, the best b is in the range [max(0, s - len(prefix1)*1), min(s//2, len(prefix2))].\n\nBecause beyond a certain point, adding more group2 items would require taking fewer group1 items, which may not be optimal.\n\nBut again, without knowing the exact behavior, it's hard to say.\n\nWell, perhaps the ternary search approach is worth trying, as it can potentially reduce the computation time significantly.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that plan.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nThen, read the n items, split them into group1, group2, group3 based on their weight.\n\nSort each group in descending order of cost.\n\nCompute the prefix sums for each group.\n\nFor example, group1 is sorted in descending order, and prefix1[k] is the sum of the first k elements. Similarly for group2 and group3.\n\nOnce we have these prefix arrays, we can compute dp12 for each s from 0 to m.\n\nWait, but how to compute dp12[s] for all s efficiently.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, for each s, perform a ternary search to find the optimal b.\n\nBut wait, the group1 and group2's prefix arrays can be precomputed.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCompute group1, group2, group3.\n\nCompute prefix1, prefix2, prefix3.\n\nInitialize dp12 as a list of size m+1, filled with 0.\n\nFor s in 0 to m:\n\n   low = 0\n\n   high = min(len(group2), s//2)\n\n   # Perform ternary search to find best b\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n       mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n\n       a1 = min(len(prefix1)-1, s - 2*mid1)\n\n       sum1 = prefix2[mid1] + prefix1[a1]\n\n       a2 = min(len(prefix1)-1, s - 2*mid2)\n\n       sum2 = prefix2[mid2] + prefix1[a2]\n\n       if sum1 < sum2:\n\n           low = mid1 + 1\n\n       else:\n\n           high = mid2 - 1\n\n   best_b = high\n\n   a = s - 2*best_b\n\n   if a < 0:\n\n       a = 0\n\n   current_sum = prefix2[best_b] + prefix1[a]\n\n   dp12[s] = max(dp12[s], current_sum)\n\nWait, but initially, dp12 is set to 0 for all s. No, that's incorrect. Because for each s, we're trying to find the maximum sum, so perhaps the initial dp12 should be set to 0, and during the ternary search, we compare and possibly update it.\n\nWait, no. The initial dp12 should be filled with 0 for s=0, and for other s, the maximum possible sum is built up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dp12 should be initialized with -infinity, and then updated as the maximum is found.\n\nWait, but in our case, for each s, we're trying to find the maximum possible sum, so initializing dp12 to 0 is incorrect, as for s=0, the sum is 0, but for higher s, it could be higher.\n\nHmm, perhaps the dp12 array should be initialized with 0, and for each s, the maximum is stored.\n\nWait, but in the code above, for each s, we're trying to find the best b and a, and setting dp12[s] to the maximum between its current value and the computed sum.\n\nBut initially, dp12 is filled with 0, so for s=0, it's correct.\n\nWait, no, because for s=0, the best b is 0, and a is 0, so sum is 0.\n\nFor s=1, the best b can be 0, and a is 1 (if group1 has items), or a=0 if not.\n\nWait, perhaps the code needs to be adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial dp12 array should be filled with -infinity, except dp12[0] = 0.\n\nThen, for each s, we compute the maximum possible sum.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to initialize dp12 as all -infinity, and then for each s, compute the maximum possible sum.\n\nWait, but in practice, the maximum sum for s can only come from group1 and group2, so for each s, the maximum is the best possible.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndp12 = [-inf] * (m + 1)\n\ndp12[0] = 0  # base case: no items taken\n\nfor s in range(1, m + 1):\n\n   # perform ternary search to find best b\n\n   low = 0\n\n   high = min(len(group2), s // 2)\n\n   best_sum = -inf\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n       mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n\n       a1 = min(len(prefix1) - 1, s - 2 * mid1)\n\n       sum1 = prefix2[mid1] + prefix1[a1]\n\n       a2 = min(len(prefix1) - 1, s - 2 * mid2)\n\n       sum2 = prefix2[mid2] + prefix1[a2]\n\n       if sum1 < sum2:\n\n           low = mid1 + 1\n\n       else:\n\n           high = mid2 - 1\n\n   best_b = high\n\n   a = s - 2 * best_b\n\n   if a < 0:\n\n       a = 0\n\n   current_sum = prefix2[best_b] + prefix1[a]\n\n   if current_sum > dp12[s]:\n\n       dp12[s] = current_sum\n\nWait, but this is O(m * log(max_b)), which for m=3e5 and log(1e5)=17 is 5.1e6 operations—manageable.\n\nOnce dp12 is built, the next step is to process group3.\n\nFor group3, each item has weight 3. So for each k3 in 0 to len(group3), the weight is 3*k3. We need to ensure that 3*k3 ≤ m.\n\nFor each k3, the remaining weight is s = m - 3*k3.\n\nIf s < 0: skip.\n\nElse: the maximum sum from group1 and group2 is dp12[s]. So, the total is dp12[s] + prefix3[k3].\n\nWe need to find the maximum of this over all valid k3.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nmax_total = 0\n\nfor k3 in 0 to len(prefix3):\n\n   if 3*k3 > m:\n\n       continue\n\n   s = m - 3*k3\n\n   current_sum = dp12[s] + prefix3[k3]\n\n   if current_sum > max_total:\n\n       max_total = current_sum\n\nSo, that's another loop, but len(prefix3) is up to 1e5, which is manageable.\n\nPutting it all together, the code structure would be:\n\nRead n, m.\n\ngroup1 = []\ngroup2 = []\ngroup3 = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n   w, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n   if w == 1:\n\n       group1.append(c)\n\n   elif w == 2:\n\n       group2.append(c)\n\n   else:\n\n       group3.append(c)\n\nSort each group in descending order.\n\nCompute prefix sums:\n\nprefix1 = [0]\n\ncurrent_sum = 0\n\nfor c in group1:\n\n   current_sum += c\n\n   prefix1.append(current_sum)\n\nSimilarly for prefix2 and prefix3.\n\nCompute dp12:\n\nInitialize dp12 as [ -inf ] * (m + 1 )\n\ndp12[0] = 0\n\nfor s in range(1, m+1):\n\n   # perform ternary search for b in 0 to min(len(group2), s//2)\n\n   low = 0\n\n   high = min(len(group2), s // 2)\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n       mid2 = high - (high - low) //3\n\n       a1 = min(len(prefix1) - 1, s - 2*mid1)\n\n       sum1 = prefix2[mid1] + prefix1[a1]\n\n       a2 = min(len(prefix1) - 1, s - 2*mid2)\n\n       sum2 = prefix2[mid2] + prefix1[a2]\n\n       if sum1 < sum2:\n\n           low = mid1 + 1\n\n       else:\n\n           high = mid2 - 1\n\n   best_b = high\n\n   a = s - 2 * best_b\n\n   if a < 0:\n\n       a = 0\n\n   current_sum = prefix2[best_b] + prefix1[a]\n\n   if current_sum > dp12[s]:\n\n       dp12[s] = current_sum\n\nThen, process group3:\n\nmax_total = 0\n\nfor k3 in range(len(prefix3)):\n\n   if 3*k3 > m:\n\n       continue\n\n   s = m - 3*k3\n\n   if s < 0:\n\n       continue\n\n   current_sum = dp12[s] + prefix3[k3]\n\n   if current_sum > max_total:\n\n       max_total = current_sum\n\nprint(max_total)\n\nWait, but what about the case where no items are taken from any group? It should be handled, as dp12[0] is 0, and group3 can take 0 items.\n\nAlso, in the dp12 computation, for s=0, the sum is 0, which is correct.\n\nTesting the example:\n\nSample Input:\n\nn=3, m=4\n\nItems:\n\n1 1\n\n2 2\n\n1 1\n\nWait, wait, the input seems to have three lines, but the sample input is written as ['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1'].\n\nWait, perhaps it's a mistake in the sample input formatting. But regardless, the code should handle the example correctly.\n\nIn the sample:\n\nAfter grouping:\n\ngroup1: items with wi=1. In the first line, '1 1' → c=1. The third line has '1 1' → c=1. So group1 is [1, 1], sorted as [1,1]. prefix1 is [0,1,2].\n\ngroup2: items with wi=2. Second line has '2 2' and '2 2', so group2 is [2,2], sorted as [2,2]. prefix2 is [0,2,4].\n\ngroup3: items with wi=3. Fourth line: '3 10', '2 7', '2 8', '1 1'. Wait, no, group3 is for wi=3. So in the fourth line, '3 10' → c=10. So group3 is [10], sorted as [10]. prefix",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market without exceeding a given weight limit.
