При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about determining whether a given string could have resulted from an error in message transmission between servers. The error occurs when two identical messages are sent one after another, and due to a bug, they get concatenated in a specific way. \n\nHmm, the task is to check if the given string t could be such a result. If yes, I need to find one possible original message s that could have caused this error. Otherwise, output NO.\n\nFirst, let's understand the error scenario. When two identical messages are sent, their concatenation happens by overlapping as much as possible. But wait, no, more precisely, the error is that two messages are sent consecutively, and during transmission, they might merge. The merging happens at the end of the first and the start of the second, but only if the overlapping part is the same. So, for example, if the first message is 'abc' and the second is also 'abc', then the error would result in 'abccbc'? Or wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, the example says that sending two 'abrakadabra's could result in either 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (overlapping by one character) or 'abrakadabrakadabra' (overlapping by four). So the merged string is formed by taking the first message up to some point, then appending the second message starting from that point.\n\nSo the merged string must have a split point where the end of the first part matches the beginning of the second part, allowing them to merge. The key here is that the length of the overlap can't be zero and must be less than the length of the message.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the length of the overlap must be a positive number, less than the length of the text message. So for a message of length n, the maximum possible overlap is n-1. Because if the entire message is overlapped, then it's just the same message twice, but that's not considered an error.\n\nWait, the note says that if the entire message is the same as the other, like 'abcd', then it's not considered an error. So for a message 'abcdabcd', which is the same as sending two 'abcd's, but since the entire message is the same, it's considered a correct case, not an error. So our code should treat such cases as no error.\n\nSo the approach is: check if the string can be split into two equal parts, where the first part is s, the second is s, and the end of s overlaps with the start of s by some k characters, where k is at least 1 and less than len(s).\n\nWait, no. Because when two identical messages are sent, the first is s, the second is s, and the error merges them by overlapping the end of the first with the start of the second. So the resulting string is s[0..k] + s[k+1..n] + s[k+1..n], but wait no, wait the two messages are s followed by s, but during transmission, the two s's are merged by overlapping as much as possible. So the total string is s followed by the part of s that didn't overlap. Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around.\n\nWait, let's think: when two messages are sent, each is s. During transmission, the last k characters of the first s are merged with the first k characters of the second s. So the resulting string is s concatenated with the part of s that starts at k. So the total length is len(s) + (len(s) -k) = 2*len(s) -k.\n\nWait, no: the first message is s, the second is s. They are sent one after another, but during transmission, the two messages are merged by overlapping as much as possible. So the resulting string is s concatenated with s, but with the maximum possible overlap between the end of the first and the start of the second. So the maximum possible k is the largest possible such that the last k characters of s match the first k characters of s. Then, the resulting string is s concatenated with s[k:].\n\nSo for example, if s is 'abcd', the maximum possible k is 3, because 'bcd' matches the start of s. So the merged string would be 'abcd' + 'd' → 'abcdd'?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Oh wait, no: the two messages are s and s. The first is sent, then the second. During transmission, the two are merged by overlapping the end of the first with the start of the second. So the resulting string is s concatenated with s[k:], where k is the maximum possible overlap. But wait, the maximum k is the largest possible such that s ends with a substring of length k that is equal to the start of s.\n\nSo for s='abcd', the maximum possible k is 4? But no, because if k=4, then s ends with 'abcd' and starts with 'abcd', so the merged string would be 'abcdabcd', but according to the note, if the entire message is the same, it's not considered an error. So in that case, the error isn't present. So for our problem, we have to find a k where 1 ≤ k < len(s), and the last k characters of s equal the first k of s. Then, the merged string is s + s[k:]. So the merged string is s followed by s[k:].\n\nWait, no, because the second message is s, so when the two are merged, the resulting string is s followed by the part of s that comes after the k-th character. So for example, if s is 'ab', the maximum k is 1, so the merged string is 'a' + 'b' → 'ab', but that's just the original message. Hmm, but according to the problem statement, if the two messages are the same and completely overlap, it's not considered an error.\n\nWait, the problem says that the error can only occur if the two messages are the same and are sent consecutively, but their concatenation has an overlap. So the resulting string must have a point where the first part is s, and the second part is the remaining of s after the overlap. So the merged string t must be equal to s concatenated with s[k:], where k is the maximum possible overlap.\n\nBut wait, how do I find s? Because t is given, and I need to find s such that t = s + s[k:], where k is the maximum possible overlap (but any possible k >=1 and less than len(s) could work). Or perhaps, any k where the last k of s equals the first k of s, and the resulting t is s concatenated with s[k:].\n\nWait, but s could vary. So for t, I need to see if there exists a split point i such that t can be written as s1 + s2, where s1 is the first part, s2 is the second part, and s1 is equal to s2. Then, check if the end of s1 and the start of s2 can overlap by k characters, where k is between 1 and len(s1)-1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to consider all possible possible split points in t into two equal parts. For each possible split point, check if the first part s can be such that s ends with a prefix of itself. Because when two s's are merged, the resulting string is s concatenated with s[k:], where k is the maximum possible. So for a given s, t must be s followed by s[k:]. So for each possible s, which is a possible prefix of t, we can check if the rest of t matches s[k:] for some k.\n\nBut trying all possible s's is computationally expensive, especially since the maximum length of t is 100. So we need an efficient way.\n\nAnother approach: for each possible split position i in t, where i is from 1 to len(t)//2, check if the first i characters form a string s, and the remaining part of t can be obtained by cutting s after some k characters. So s[k:] should equal the remaining part of t.\n\nWait, let's formalize this:\n\nFor t to be the result of an error, there must exist a string s and a k such that:\n\nt = s + s[k:]\n\nand k is the maximum possible, which is the largest k where the last k characters of s equal the first k characters of s.\n\nBut for our purposes, any k ≥1 and less than len(s) will suffice, as long as s[k:] equals the remaining part of t.\n\nWait, but the maximum k is the largest possible, so perhaps checking for any possible k is sufficient, as long as s[k:] equals the remaining part of t.\n\nSo, the steps I can take are:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible possible split points i, where the first part is s_candidate, and the second part is the remaining part.\n\n2. For each s_candidate, check if the remaining part of t is a suffix of s_candidate.\n\nBut wait, no: the remaining part of t must be equal to s_candidate[k:], where k is between 1 and len(s_candidate)-1.\n\nSo for each possible split into s_candidate and the rest, check if the rest is a suffix of s_candidate starting at some position k>0.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible split into s_candidate and the rest, check if the rest is equal to s_candidate[k:] for some k where 1<=k < len(s_candidate).\n\nIf such a k exists, then s_candidate is a possible s, and the rest is s_candidate[k:], so t would be s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut wait, the rest may be longer than s_candidate's possible suffix. So for each possible split, the rest part must be equal to s_candidate[k:], which is a substring starting at position k in s_candidate.\n\nSo, for example, if t is 'acacaca', then a possible split is after 3 characters: s_candidate is 'aca', the rest is 'caca'. We need to check if 'caca' is a suffix of 'aca' starting at some k. But 'aca' has length 3. So k can be 1 or 2.\n\nAt k=1: 'aca'[1:] is 'ca' → does it equal 'caca'? No.\nAt k=2: 'aca'[2:] is 'a' → does it equal 'caca'? No. So this split doesn't work.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, for the second test case, the output was 'acaca', implying that the s is 'acaca' and the rest is 'ca'.\n\nWait, the sample input is 'acacacaca', and the output is 'YES\\nacaca'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample. Let's look:\n\nSample Input 2: 'acacacaca' → Output is 'YES\\nacaca'.\n\nSo the string is 'acacacaca', which is 10 characters.\n\nIf s is 'acaca' (5 letters), then the second message is also 'acaca'. So the maximum possible k is the maximum overlap where the end of 'acaca' matches the beginning. Let's see:\n\nCheck for k=4: last 4 of 'acaca' is 'caca'; does it match the first 4 of 'acaca'? 'acac' vs 'caca' → no.\nk=3: last 3 is 'aca'; first 3 is 'aca' → yes! So the maximum k is 3.\n\nSo the merged string would be 'acaca' + 'acaca'[3:] → 'acaca' + 'ca' → 'acacaca'. But the input is 'acacacaca' which is longer. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 'acacacaca' is 10 letters. 'acaca' is 5 letters. So s is 'acaca', the second message is 'acaca'. Merging with k=3, the result is 'acaca' + 'acaca'[3:] → 'acaca' + 'ca' → 'acacaca', which is 7 letters. But the input is 10 letters. So that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to find s such that t is s concatenated with s[k:], where k is any value ≥1 and less than len(s). So for each possible split of t into s and the rest, check if the rest is equal to s[k:] for some k.\n\nSo for the sample input 'acacacaca', let's see:\n\nPossible splits:\n\ni=5: s is 'acaca', the rest is 'caca'.\n\nCheck if 'caca' is a suffix of 'acaca' starting at any k>0.\n\ns is 'acaca' (length 5). Let's try k=2: s[2:] is 'aca'. Does 'caca' equal 'aca'? No.\n\nk=3: s[3:] is 'ca' → no.\n\nk=1: s[1:] is 'caca' → yes! Because s[1:] is 'caca', which matches the rest.\n\nSo t would be 'acaca' + 'caca' → 'acacacaca' (5+4=9 letters?), wait no, 'acaca' is 5 letters, 'caca' is 4. So 5+4=9, but the sample input is 'acacacaca' which is 10 letters. Hmm, something's wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nAh, the problem says that when two messages are sent, they are merged by their overlapping. So the resulting string is s + s[k:], but wait, no. Because the two messages are s and s. So when they are merged, the first message is s, the second is s, and the overlapping is k. So the resulting string is s[0...k-1] + s[k ... len(s)] + s[k ... len(s)]. Wait, no, that would mean the result is s concatenated with s[k:].\n\nWait, no. Because the first message is s, the second is s. The overlapping occurs at the end of the first and the start of the second. So the result is s followed by the part of the second s that comes after the overlapping.\n\nSo the result is s + s[k:], but only if the overlapping is at the end of the first s and the start of the second s.\n\nWait, but the second s is the same as the first. So the result is s followed by s[k:]. So the length of t is len(s) + (len(s) -k) = 2*len(s) -k.\n\nIn the sample input 2, the output is 'acaca' as s, and the rest is 'ca', making t 'acacaca' which is 7 letters. But the input is 'acacacaca' which is 10 letters. That doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample input. Looking back, in the problem statement, the second example is:\n\nInput:\n['acacacaca', ...]\n\nOutput:\n['YES\\nacaca', ...]\n\nWait, the output is 'acaca' as s, but the input is 'acacacaca' which is 10 letters. Let me count:\n\nacaca → 5 letters.\n\nThen the rest is 5 letters: 'caca' is 4, but 5+5=10. Wait, no. So perhaps the rest is 5 letters, but 'acaca' + 'acaca'[k:] must equal the input.\n\nWait, 'acaca' is 5 letters. Let's see:\n\nIf k=1, then s[k:] is 'caca', which is 4 letters. So 'acaca' + 'caca' is 9 letters, but the input is 10 letters. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's calculate the length.\n\nThe input is 'acacacaca' which is 10 letters. Suppose s is 'acaca' (5 letters). Then the second s is 'acaca'. The maximum possible k is 3, because the last 3 letters of s are 'aca', which is the same as the first 3 letters.\n\nSo the merged string is 'acaca' + 'acaca'[3:] → 'acaca' + 'ca' → 'acacaca', which is 7 letters. But the input is 10 letters, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps s can be longer than half of t.\n\nWait, another approach: for t to be the result of s followed by s[k:], the length of t must be len(s)*2 -k. So len(t) = 2*len(s) -k.\n\nSo len(s) = (len(t) +k)/2.\n\nSince k must be at least 1 and less than len(s), len(s) must be at least (len(t)+1)/2.\n\nSo for each possible split, s must be at least (len(t)+1)/2.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So for a string t of length n, the possible s can only be of length m, where m is (n + k)/2, and k ranges from 1 to m-1.\n\nBut for each possible m, which must satisfy 2m -k = n, and 1 <=k <m.\n\nSo, for each possible m, which is (n +k)/2, but since k can vary, perhaps it's better to iterate m from ceil(n/2) down to something.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is:\n\nFor each possible m (the length of s), m must be such that 2m -k = len(t), where k is between 1 and m-1.\n\nSo for each possible m, check if there exists a k in [1, m-1] such that len(t) = 2m -k → k = 2m - len(t).\n\nBut since k must be ≤ m-1, 2m - len(t) ≤ m-1 → m ≤ len(t) -1.\n\nSo for each possible m, which can range from (len(t)+1)//2 up to len(t)-1.\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nWe have len(t) = 2m -k → k = 2m - len(t).\n\nBut since k must be ≥1 and ≤m-1.\n\nSo 1 ≤ 2m - len(t) ≤ m-1.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2m - len(t) ≥1 → 2m ≥ len(t)+1.\n\nAnd 2m - len(t) ≤ m-1 → m ≤ len(t) -1.\n\nSo m must satisfy:\n\n(len(t)+1)/2 ≤ m ≤ len(t) -1.\n\nBut m must be an integer, so m can range from ceil((len(t)+1)/2) to len(t)-1.\n\nFor each m in that range, compute k = 2m - len(t). Check if k is between 1 and m-1, inclusive.\n\nOnce m and k are found, extract s as the first m characters of t, and then check if the rest of t (from m onwards) is equal to s[k:].\n\nIf this condition holds, then s is a possible solution.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nLoop through m from (len(t)+1)//2 up to len(t)-1:\n\n   k = 2*m - len(t)\n\n   if k is between 1 and m-1:\n\n       s_candidate = t[:m]\n\n       if t[m:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n           return YES and s_candidate\n\nIf none found, return NO.\n\nSo, applying this to the sample input:\n\nSample Input 2 is 'acacacaca' → len(t) is 10.\n\nPossible m's are from (10+1)/2=5.5 → 6, up to 9.\n\nSo m can be 6,7,8,9.\n\nFor each m:\n\nm=6: k=2*6-10=12-10=2. 1 ≤2 ≤5 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is t[:6] → 'acacac'.\n\nCheck if t[6:] is 'acaca' → 'acacac' + 'acaca'?\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nt is 'acacacaca' → len 10.\n\nm=6: s_candidate is 'acacac' (first 6 letters).\n\nt[m:] is 'acaca' (last 4 letters).\n\nWe need to check if 'acaca' equals s_candidate[2:].\n\ns_candidate[2:] is 'cacac'.\n\nIs 'acaca' equal to 'cacac'? No.\n\nSo m=6 is invalid.\n\nNext m=7:\n\nk=14-10=4.\n\nCheck 1 ≤4 ≤6 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is 'acacaca' (first 7 letters).\n\nt[m:] is 'caca' (3 letters).\n\nCheck if 'caca' equals s_candidate[4:].\n\ns_candidate is 'acacaca' → s_candidate[4:] is 'aca'.\n\nNo, 'caca' is not 'aca'.\n\nSo m=7 invalid.\n\nm=8:\n\nk=16-10=6.\n\nBut 6 must be ≤7 (since m=8, m-1=7). So 6≤7 is true.\n\ns_candidate is 'acacacac' (first 8 letters).\n\nt[m:] is 'acaca' (2 letters).\n\nCheck if 'acaca' equals s_candidate[6:].\n\ns_candidate[6:] is 'c' → no.\n\nSo invalid.\n\nm=9:\n\nk=18-10=8.\n\nCheck if 8 ≤8 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is 'acacacaca' (9 letters).\n\nt[m:] is 'acacaca' (wait, no, len(t) is 10, m is 9, so t[m:] is 'a').\n\nWait, no, m=9, len(t)=10: t[m:] is the 10th character, which is 'a'.\n\nCheck if 'a' equals s_candidate[8:] → s_candidate[8:] is 'a'.\n\nYes! So t[m:] is 'a', and s_candidate[8:] is 'a'. So condition holds.\n\nSo s_candidate is 'acacacaca' (9 letters), and t is 'acacacaca' + 'a' → which is 'acacacacaa' → but the input is 'acacacaca' which is 10 letters. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Wait, when m=9, len(s_candidate) is 9, k=8.\n\nt[m:] is t[9:] → the substring starting at index 9, which is 'a'.\n\ns_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[8:] → which is the substring from index 8 to end, which is 'a'.\n\nSo t[m:] is 'a' and s_candidate[k:] is 'a' → they are equal. So this split is valid.\n\nThus, s_candidate is 'acacacaca' and the rest is 'a'. So the merged string is s_candidate + 'a' → 'acacacacaa' which is 10 letters, but the input is 'acacacaca' which is 10 letters. So that's a match.\n\nWait, but the sample output is 'acaca' as s. How does that fit?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let's re-examine the sample.\n\nThe sample input is 'acacacaca' (10 letters). The output is 'acaca' as s. So let's see:\n\ns is 'acaca' (5 letters). So len(s) is 5.\n\nThen the second s is 'acaca'.\n\nThe maximum k is the maximum possible overlap between the end of s and the start of s.\n\nLooking for the largest k where s[-k:] == s[:k].\n\nCheck k=3: s[-3:] is 'aca', s[:3] is 'aca' → yes.\n\nSo the merged string is s + s[k:] → 'acaca' + 'ca' → 'acacaca' which is 7 letters. But the input is 10 letters, so that's not matching.\n\nWait, this suggests that my initial approach is incorrect. Because according to the sample, the string can be split into s and the rest, but perhaps my method isn't capturing that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample is considering a different split.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct split is not based on m being (len(t)+1)//2, but instead considering any possible split where s is a prefix of t, and the rest is a suffix of s.\n\nSo for the sample input 'acacacaca' (10 letters), perhaps s is 'acaca' (5 letters), and the rest is 'caca' (5 letters). So len(s) is 5, len(remaining) is 5.\n\nBut then, according to the condition, the remaining must be equal to s[k:], where k is between 1 and 4.\n\nSo s is 'acaca', the remaining is 'caca'. Let's see:\n\nCheck if 'caca' equals s[k:] for some k.\n\nFor k=1: s[1:] is 'caca' → yes! So 'caca' equals 'caca'.\n\nSo the split is s_candidate = 'acaca', remaining = 'caca'.\n\nThus, t is s_candidate + remaining → 'acacaca' + 'caca' → 'acacacaca' (which is 10 letters). So that's correct.\n\nBut according to the earlier approach, when m=5, len(t) is 10.\n\nSo m=5, then k=2*5 -10 = 10-10=0 → k=0, which is not allowed. So the earlier approach wouldn't consider this split.\n\nAh, I see! So my initial approach was incorrect because I limited m to be at least (len(t)+1)//2, but in reality, for this case, m is 5, which is less than (10+1)/2=5.5, so m=5 is allowed in the range (since m must be ≥5.5 rounded up is 6, but 5 is less than that). So my earlier approach was flawed.\n\nWait, no. Because for m=5, len(t)=10, then 2m -k =10 → k=10-2*5=0. Which is invalid because k must be ≥1.\n\nSo this suggests that my initial approach misses this case.\n\nSo why does the sample have a valid split with m=5 and k=0, but k=0 is invalid?\n\nWait, because k must be ≥1. So the initial approach misses it, but the sample shows that it's a valid case. So that indicates that my approach is incorrect.\n\nSo perhaps I need to rethink the way I'm splitting.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect because it's limiting m to be larger than (len(t)+1)/2, but in reality, m can be any value, as long as k is ≥1 and ≤m-1.\n\nWait, because len(t) = 2m -k → for a given m, k must be 2m - len(t). And since k must be ≥1 and ≤m-1, that gives:\n\n1 ≤ 2m - len(t) ≤ m-1.\n\nWhich rearranged gives:\n\n2m - len(t) ≥1 → 2m ≥ len(t)+1 → m ≥ (len(t)+1)/2.\n\nAnd 2m - len(t) ≤ m-1 → m ≤ len(t) -1.\n\nSo m must be ≥ (len(t)+1)/2 and ≤ len(t)-1.\n\nIn the sample case, len(t) is 10.\n\nSo m must be ≥ (10+1)/2 =5.5 → m≥6.\n\nBut in the sample case, the correct m is 5. So that's outside the required range. So why does the sample consider it a valid case?\n\nThis suggests that my understanding of the problem is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the error can only happen when two messages are sent. So the error can only happen if the string is formed by s followed by s[k:]. But what if the string is exactly s followed by s[k:], but with a certain k, which allows for a valid split.\n\nBut in the sample case, the string is 'acacacaca' which is 10 letters. So len(s) is 5, len(t) is 10. So 2m -k =10 → 2*5 -k=10 → k=0. But k must be ≥1.\n\nSo this suggests that the sample is wrong, but that's not possible. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the error can occur in a way that the two messages are s and s, but the overlapping is anywhere, not necessarily the maximum possible.\n\nSo perhaps, for the sample, the s is 'acaca', and the merged string is 'acacaca' → which is 7 letters. But the sample input is longer. So perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for multiple possible s and k, and the sample has an s that's shorter than half of t.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to consider all possible s's that are prefixes of t, regardless of their length, and for each s, check if the rest of t can be written as s[k:] for some k ≥1 and < len(s).\n\nSo for each possible split into s and the rest, regardless of the length of s, check if the rest equals s[k:] for some k.\n\nBut how to choose which splits to check.\n\nBecause len(t) can be up to 100, trying all possible splits (all possible s lengths) could be feasible.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nLoop over all possible s lengths m from 1 to len(t)-1:\n\n   s_candidate = t[:m]\n\n   remaining = t[m:]\n\n   for k in 1 to m-1:\n\n       if remaining == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n           return YES and s_candidate\n\nIf no such s_candidate found, return NO.\n\nWait, but this could be O(n^3), which for n=100 is manageable.\n\nBecause for each m (up to 99), and for each k (up to m-1), and checking if the remaining equals s_candidate[k:]. So for 99*99=9801 iterations, each with a string of up to 99 characters, it's manageable.\n\nSo perhaps that's the way to go.\n\nTesting this approach with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 2: 'acacacaca' → len(t) 10.\n\nCheck all possible m from 1 to 9.\n\nFor m=5:\n\ns_candidate = 'acaca'\n\nremaining = 'caca'\n\nCheck for k=1: s_candidate[1:] is 'caca' → which equals 'caca' → yes.\n\nSo this is a valid split.\n\nSo the output is 'YES\\nacaca'.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nAnother sample: 'abababab' → len is 8.\n\nLooking for m=4:\n\ns_candidate is 'abab', remaining is 'abab'.\n\nCheck for k=2: s_candidate[2:] is 'ab' → which is not equal to 'abab'.\n\nk=3: s_candidate[3:] is 'b' → no.\n\nBut perhaps another m.\n\nWait, the sample output is 'YES\\nababab'.\n\nWait, len(ababab) is 6.\n\nSo m=6: s_candidate is 'ababab', remaining is ''.\n\nNo, because remaining must be non-empty.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the logic wrong.\n\nWait, the approach is to split t into s and the rest. So for m=6, s_candidate is 'ababab' (6 letters), remaining is 'ababab'[6:] → which is empty. So that's invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m=4, s_candidate 'abab', remaining 'abab'.\n\nCheck for k=2: s_candidate[2:] is 'ab' → 'ab' != 'abab'.\n\nk=3: 'abab'[3:] is 'b' → no.\n\nBut sample output is 'YES\\nababab'.\n\nSo perhaps m=4 is not the right split.\n\nWait, perhaps m=5:\n\ns_candidate is 'ababa', remaining 'babab'.\n\nCheck for k=1: s_candidate[1:] is 'baba' → compare with 'babab' → no.\n\nk=2: 'aba' → no.\n\nk=3: 'ba' → no.\n\nk=4: 'a' → no.\n\nNot valid.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the sample output is 'YES\\nababab' for 'abababab' → which is 8 letters.\n\nSo s_candidate is 'ababab' (6 letters), and the rest is 'ababab'[6:] → which is empty. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the split is after m=8, but that's the entire string.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample. Let me look back.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the fourth test case is 'abababab' → output is 'YES\\nababab'.\n\nSo 'abababab' is 8 letters. So s_candidate is 'ababab' (6 letters), but len(s) is 6, which is more than (8+1)/2=4.5 → so m=6 is allowed.\n\nWait, but then the remaining is 8-6=2 letters: 'ab'.\n\nCheck if 'ab' equals s_candidate[k:].\n\nk must be ≥1 and ≤5.\n\ns_candidate is 'ababab' → for k=4: s_candidate[4:] is 'ab' → which matches the remaining 'ab'.\n\nSo yes, the split is s_candidate 'ababab' and remaining 'ab'.\n\nSo the condition is met.\n\nThus, the approach would find this.\n\nSo, the approach is to loop over all possible m (from 1 to len(t)-1), and for each m, loop over k from 1 to m-1, and check if the remaining equals s_candidate[k:].\n\nIf any such case is found, output 'YES' and the s_candidate.\n\nOtherwise, output 'NO'.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase 1: t is 'a' → len 1. It cannot be split, so output 'NO'.\n\nCase 2: t is 'aa' → len 2. Possible m=1.\n\ns_candidate is 'a', remaining is 'a'.\n\nCheck k=1: 'a'[1:] is '' → which is not equal to 'a'.\n\nSo no. Thus, output 'NO'.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, if two identical messages are sent, they may be merged. But for 'aa' to be the result of two 'a's, the maximum k would be 0, which is not allowed. So 'aa' is not considered an error.\n\nAnother case: t is 'aba'.\n\nPossible splits:\n\nm=2: s_candidate 'ab', remaining 'a'.\n\nCheck k=1: s_candidate[1:] is 'b' → 'a' != 'b'.\n\nNo.\n\nm=1: s_candidate 'a', remaining 'ba'.\n\nCheck k=1: s_candidate[1:] is '' → 'ba' is not empty.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, output 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: t is 'abababab' → len 8.\n\nAs before, m=6: s_candidate 'ababab' → remaining 'ab'.\n\nCheck k=4: s_candidate[4:] is 'ab' → which matches.\n\nThus, output 'YES\\nababab'.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nAnother test case: t is 'abcabc'.\n\nAccording to the note, this is not considered an error, because the two messages are simply concatenated without overlapping.\n\nSo, for m=3: s_candidate 'abc', remaining 'abc'.\n\nCheck k=3: s_candidate[3:] is '' → not equal to 'abc'.\n\nThus, no.\n\nOther m's:\n\nm=4: s_candidate 'abca', remaining 'bc'.\n\nk=1: s_candidate[1:] is 'bca' → 'bc' is not equal.\n\nm=5: s_candidate 'abcab', remaining 'c'.\n\nk=1: 'bcab' → 'c' is not equal.\n\nThus, no valid split, so output 'NO'.\n\nWhich aligns with the note.\n\nAnother test case: t is 'tatbt' → len 5.\n\nCheck all possible m:\n\nm=1: s_candidate 't', remaining 'atbt'.\n\nCheck k=1: s_candidate[1:] is '' → no.\n\nm=2: s_candidate 'ta', remaining 'tbt'.\n\nk=1: 'a' → 'tbt' is not 'a'.\n\nm=3: s_candidate 'tat', remaining 'bt'.\n\nCheck k=1: 'at' → 'bt' is not equal.\n\nk=2: 't' → no.\n\nm=4: s_candidate 'tatb', remaining 't'.\n\nCheck k=1: 'atab' → 't' is not equal.\n\nk=2: 'bb' → no.\n\nk=3: 'b' → 't' is not equal.\n\nThus, no valid split. Output 'NO'.\n\nWhich aligns with the sample.\n\nSo the approach is to loop m from 1 to len(t)-1, and for each m, loop k from 1 to m-1, and check if t[m:] equals s_candidate[k:].\n\nIf any such pair (m, k) is found, output 'YES' and s_candidate.\n\nElse, output 'NO'.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nRead the input string t.\n\nFor each m in range(1, len(t)):\n\n   s_candidate = t[:m]\n\n   remaining = t[m:]\n\n   for k in range(1, m):\n\n       if len(remaining) != len(s_candidate) -k:\n\n           continue  # because",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have resulted from an error in message transmission between servers. The error occurs when two identical messages are sent consecutively and their ends overlap with the beginnings of each other. Our task is to check if such an error is possible and, if so, identify one possible original message.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: When two identical messages are sent, they might merge by overlapping at the end of the first and the start of the second. This results in a string that is a concatenation of the first message and a part of the second message after the overlap.\n2. **Key Insight**: For a string `t` to be the result of such an error, it must be possible to split `t` into two parts where the second part is a suffix of the first part starting from some index `k`.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Iterate over all possible lengths `m` for the prefix (from 1 to `len(t)-1`).\n   - For each prefix length `m`, check all possible overlaps `k` (from 1 to `m-1`).\n   - Verify if the remaining part of `t` matches the suffix of the prefix starting from `k`.\n   - If such a valid split is found, output \"YES\" and the prefix as the possible original message. If no valid split is found, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\n\nfor m in range(1, len(t)):\n    s_candidate = t[:m]\n    remaining = t[m:]\n    for k in range(1, m):\n        if len(remaining) != len(s_candidate) - k:\n            continue\n        if s_candidate[k:] == remaining:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(s_candidate)\n            exit()\nprint(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input string `t` is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n- **Iterate Over Possible Prefixes**: For each possible length `m` of the prefix (from 1 to `len(t)-1`), extract the prefix and the remaining part of `t`.\n- **Check Overlaps**: For each prefix, check all possible overlaps `k` to see if the remaining part of `t` matches the suffix of the prefix starting from `k`.\n- **Output Result**: If a valid overlap is found, print \"YES\" and the prefix. If no valid overlap is found after checking all possibilities, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways the string could have been formed by an error, ensuring we find a solution if one exists.",
