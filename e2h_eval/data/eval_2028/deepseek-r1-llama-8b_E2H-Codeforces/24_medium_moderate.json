She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a browser with multiple tabs and Luba needs to close some of them as quickly as possible.\n\nHmm, the problem statement says that Luba has n opened tabs, indexed from 1 to n. The cursor is currently at position 'pos'. She needs to keep the tabs from l to r inclusive and close all others. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right (but not beyond the current open tabs), or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nI need to find the minimum number of seconds required for her to achieve this.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's consider the initial state. All tabs are open. The cursor is at pos. We need to end up with only tabs l to r open.\n\nSo, what needs to happen? Any tabs before l must be closed, and any after r must be closed.\n\nBut the way she closes them depends on where she moves the cursor and which actions she takes.\n\nWait, each action is either moving or closing. So for each step, she can choose to move (left or right) or close left or close right.\n\nSo the plan is to decide the optimal sequence of moves and close operations to minimize the time.\n\nI think the key is to figure out the steps needed to close the left and right parts, considering the starting position.\n\nLet me break it down into two parts: handling the left side (tabs before l) and the right side (tabs after r).\n\nFor the left part:\n\nIf there are any tabs before l (i.e., l > 1), then she needs to close them. But how?\n\nShe can move the cursor to position l, and then close left. Or maybe she can move to some other position first.\n\nWait, no. Because when she's at position i, closing left will close all tabs to the left of i, which are from a to i-1. But initially, a is 1, so if she's at i, closing left will close everything to the left of i, including all tabs less than i.\n\nSo for example, if she's at position l, closing left will close all tabs before l, which is exactly what's needed. But wait, what if l is not the starting position?\n\nSo the steps would involve moving the cursor to the correct position(s) and then performing the close operation.\n\nSame goes for the right side: she needs to move to r or beyond and then close right.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal strategy is to:\n\n1. Move to the position where she can close the left side.\n2. Close the left side.\n3. Move to the position where she can close the right side.\n4. Close the right side.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can do both closes in a way that minimizes the total steps.\n\nBut what about the order? Like, maybe she should close left first, then right, or vice versa.\n\nWait, but the order might matter because after closing one side, the available tabs change, affecting the movement steps.\n\nLet me think about the different cases.\n\nCase 1: No tabs to close on the left or right. For example, when l=1 and r=n. Then, no action is needed, output is 0.\n\nCase 2: Both left and right have tabs to close.\n\nCase 3: Only left needs to be closed.\n\nCase 4: Only right needs to be closed.\n\nSo, for each case, we need to compute the minimal steps.\n\nLet me outline the approach:\n\nCompute the steps required to close the left part, then the right part.\n\nBut the steps depend on the starting position and the movement needed.\n\nLet me model each part separately.\n\nLeft Part:\n\nIf there are any tabs to the left of l (i.e., l > 1), then we need to perform a close-left operation.\n\nTo do this, she needs to move the cursor to a position where closing left will remove all tabs < l.\n\nWhich position is best? Well, moving to l and then closing left will take (l - pos) steps to move, plus one step for closing.\n\nAlternatively, she could move to a position beyond l, but that's not necessary since moving to l is sufficient.\n\nWait, because when she's at l, closing left will close all tabs before l. So the minimal steps for left part is the distance from pos to l, plus 1.\n\nSimilarly for the right part: the distance from r to pos, plus 1.\n\nBut wait, maybe she can optimize by moving to both ends in one go, but that depends on the positions.\n\nWait, no. Because after moving to l, she can close the left, then she can move to r, and close the right. Alternatively, she might move to r first, close right, then move to l, close left.\n\nBut in either case, the total steps would be the sum of the movements and the two close operations.\n\nWait, but what if she can move to a position where she can close both sides in one step? Probably not, because each close operation affects only one side.\n\nSo, the minimal steps would be the sum of the steps to close left and right, plus any movement between those steps.\n\nWait, perhaps she can perform the closes in a way that minimizes the total movement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can combine the steps. Like, move to l, close left, then move to r, close right. Or move to r, close right, then move to l, close left.\n\nWhich is better depends on the initial position, l, and r.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nOption 1:\n- Move from pos to l: cost is |pos - l|\n- Close left: +1\n- Move from l to r: cost is |l - r|\n- Close right: +1\nTotal: |pos-l| + |l-r| + 2\n\nOption 2:\n- Move from pos to r: |pos - r|\n- Close right: +1\n- Move from r to l: |r - l|\n- Close left: +1\nTotal: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2\n\nWe need to choose the option that gives the smaller total.\n\nBut wait, another possibility is that she can close one side first, then move to the other side without having to go back all the way. For example, after closing left, she's at l, so she can then move directly to r.\n\nAlternatively, after closing right, she's at r, and can move to l.\n\nSo, the options are as above.\n\nAnother thing to consider: if l == r, meaning that only that single tab needs to be kept. Then, she doesn't need to close anything. But that's covered in the initial condition.\n\nWait, no. If l equals r, but initially, other tabs are present, she needs to close all except l and r (which is the same). So she has to close both left and right.\n\nSo, for the general case:\n\nCompute the steps needed to close left and right.\n\nLeft steps: if l > 1, then the steps are (distance from current pos to l) + 1.\n\nRight steps: if r < n, steps are (distance from current pos to r) + 1.\n\nThen, the question is whether she can do these in a way that the movement between the two is minimized.\n\nWait, no. Because after closing one side, the other side's movement may be affected.\n\nWait, no. Because after closing, the available tabs are from l to r. So, when she's moving after closing left, she's within [l, r], so movement is allowed as per the current a and b.\n\nWait, when she closes left, a becomes l, and b remains r.\n\nSo, after closing left, the available tabs are from l to b (current b is r if she didn't close right yet). Then, when she moves to r, she can do so, but the movement is limited to the current a and b.\n\nWait, no. After closing left, the a is l, and b is still r (since she hasn't closed the right yet). So, she can move freely between l and r.\n\nSo, the movement cost between closing left and right is the distance from l to r.\n\nSimilarly, if she closes right first, the movement cost is from r to l.\n\nSo, the total steps would be the sum of the left steps and right steps, plus the movement between the two.\n\nWait, but the movement between the two is |l - r| steps.\n\nSo, the total steps would be:\n\nleft_steps + right_steps + movement_between.\n\nWhere:\n\nleft_steps = (distance from pos to l) + 1 if l>1.\n\nright_steps = (distance from pos to r) + 1 if r <n.\n\nmovement_between is the distance between l and r.\n\nBut wait, no. Because after closing left, she is at l, and then she needs to move to r. So movement is |l - r| steps.\n\nSimilarly, if she closes right first, she is at r, then needs to move to l: |r - l| steps.\n\nSo, the total steps for Option 1: (steps to l) + 1 (close left) + |l - r| (move to r) + 1 (close right) = (|pos-l| + |l - r|) + 2.\n\nSame for Option 2: (|pos - r| + |r - l|) + 2.\n\nSo, the minimal of the two options.\n\nBut wait, another scenario: what if she can close left and right without moving between them? Like, if she starts at l, closes left, then moves to r and closes right.\n\nBut the movement is required.\n\nWait, suppose she is already at l. Then, movement from l to r is |l - r| steps.\n\nSo, yes, in that case, the movement is necessary.\n\nWait, but what if l and r are the same? Then, she just needs to close left and right. Since l == r, but wait, if l == r, then she doesn't have to close anything except perhaps the other tabs.\n\nWait, no, because l and r could be in the middle of the initial setup. So, for example, if l=3 and r=5, and n is 10. Then she needs to close left (tabs 1-2) and right (6-10). So, regardless of l and r, if l != r, she has to close both sides.\n\nWait, no. If l=1 and r=n, then no closing is needed.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nIf l > 1: must close left.\n\nIf r < n: must close right.\n\nSo, the problem can be broken down into whether we need to handle left, right, both, or neither.\n\nSo, let's model the steps as follows:\n\nInitialize total_time = 0.\n\nIf l > 1:\n\n   Compute steps to reach l: distance from current pos.\n\n   Then, add 1 step to close left.\n\n   Then, from l, move to r: distance between l and r.\n\n   Then, add 1 step to close right.\n\n   So, total_time += (|pos - l| + |l - r|) + 2.\n\nElse if r < n:\n\n   Compute steps to reach r: distance from pos.\n\n   Add 1 step to close right.\n\n   Then, from r, move to l: distance between r and l.\n\n   Add 1 step to close left.\n\n   Total_time += (|pos - r| + |r - l|) + 2.\n\nElse:\n\n   Do nothing, return 0.\n\nWait, but that's only for the case where both left and right need to be closed. What about when only left or only right needs to be closed?\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\nIf both left and right need to be closed:\n\n   Choose the option that gives the minimal total steps between the two approaches (closing left first or right first).\n\nIf only left needs to be closed:\n\n   Steps: (distance from pos to l) + 1.\n\n   Because after closing, no need to move further.\n\nIf only right needs to be closed:\n\n   Steps: (distance from pos to r) + 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nCalculate left_needed = (l > 1)\n\nright_needed = (r < n)\n\nif neither: 0 steps.\n\nelif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n   option1 = (|pos - l| + 1) + (|l - r| + 1)  --> because after closing left, you move to r, then close right.\n\n   option2 = (|pos - r| + 1) + (|r - l| + 1)  --> after closing right, move to l, close left.\n\n   total = min(option1, option2)\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n   total = (|pos - l| + 1)\n\nelif right_needed:\n\n   total = (|pos - r| + 1)\n\nWait, but wait. When both left and right are needed, the movement between l and r is required. So, for option1, after closing left, you have to move from l to r and then close right. So the movement is |l - r| steps.\n\nSimilarly for option2.\n\nBut what about the initial position being such that it's better to first close one side, then the other, without having to go through the entire movement.\n\nWait, for example, if pos is somewhere in the middle of l and r.\n\nLike, pos is between l and r.\n\nThen, in option1, she moves to l, closes left, then moves to r, closes right.\n\nIn option2, she moves to r, closes right, then moves to l, closes left.\n\nWhich is better depends on the distances.\n\nBut another approach: perhaps she can close one side, then the other, but without moving all the way.\n\nWait, no. Because after closing left, the available tabs are from l to r. So, moving from l to r is allowed.\n\nSimilarly for closing right first.\n\nSo, the movement steps are |l - r|.\n\nSo, the minimal steps are the sum of the individual steps plus the movement between.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a smarter way. What if she can reach l and r in a way that reduces the movement steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she can move to l, close left, then move to r, close right. The movement steps between l and r are |l - r|.\n\nSo, the total steps are (|pos - l| + 1) + (|l - r| + 1) = |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2.\n\nSimilarly, for the other option.\n\nSo, in code, for the case where both are needed, the minimal steps are min( (|pos - l| + |l - r| + 2), (|pos - r| + |r - l| + 2) )\n\nWhich simplifies to min( (|pos - l| + |l - r| + 2 ), (|pos - r| + |l - r| + 2 ) )\n\nBut since |l - r| is the same in both options, it can be factored out.\n\nWait, no. Because |pos - l| could be smaller than |pos - r|, depending on where pos is.\n\nWait, but the |l - r| is fixed, so when choosing between the two options, it's better to compute both and take the minimal.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n   option1 = (abs(pos - l) + 1) + (abs(r - l) + 1)\n\n   option2 = (abs(pos - r) + 1) + (abs(r - l) + 1)\n\n   total = min(option1, option2)\n\nelse if left_needed:\n\n   total = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelse if right_needed:\n\n   total = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nelse:\n\n   total = 0\n\nWait, but wait, in the case where she closes left first, then she can move to r, but the movement is |l - r| steps.\n\nSimilarly for the other option.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4\n\nn=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nLeft needed: 2>1, yes.\n\nRight needed:4<6, yes.\n\noption1: |3-2| +1 + |2-4| +1 = 1+1 +2+1=5.\n\noption2: |3-4|=1 +1 + |4-2|=2 +1 → 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nSo, min is 5. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: input 6 3 1 3.\n\nHere, l=1, so left_needed is false. Only right_needed is true, since 3<6.\n\nSo, steps: |3-3|=0 +1=1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThird example: 5 2 1 5.\n\nHere, l=1, r=5. So no closing needed. Output 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=7, pos=4, l=3, r=6.\n\nLeft needed:3>1.\n\nRight needed:6<7.\n\nOption1: move to 3, close left (2 steps: 4→3?), wait no, |4-3|=1 step to move, then close (1 step). Then move to 6 (3→6 is 3 steps), close right (1 step). So total steps 1+1 +3+1=6.\n\nOption2: move to 6 (2 steps: 4→5→6), close right (1 step). Then move to 3 (3 steps:6→5→4→3), close left (1 step). Total steps 2+1 +3+1=7.\n\nSo option1 is better, so total is 6.\n\nSo the code seems to handle this.\n\nAnother case: n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nLeft needed:2>1.\n\nRight needed:4<5.\n\noption1: move from 3→2 (1 step), close left (1). Then move 2→4 (2 steps), close right (1). Total 1+1+2+1=5.\n\noption2: move from 3→4 (1 step), close right (1). Then move 4→2 (2 steps), close left (1). Total 1+1+2+1=5. So same.\n\nWhat if pos is 1 and l=2, r=3.\n\nLeft needed: no, since l>1 is false.\n\nRight needed:3 < n (assuming n>3).\n\nSteps: move to 3, close right (distance from 1 to 3 is 2 steps, plus 1. So 3 steps.\n\nWait, but in this case, she needs to close all tabs after 3. So, she can move to 3, close right, which will close 4,5,...n.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: pos is 5, l=3, r=6, n=10.\n\nLeft needed:3>1.\n\nRight needed:6<10.\n\noption1: move to 3: 5→4→3 (2 steps) + close left (1) → 3 steps. Then move to 6: 3→4→5→6 (3 steps) + close right (1) → 3 steps. Total 3+3=6 steps.\n\noption2: move to 6 (5→6: 1 step) + close right (1) → 2 steps. Then move to 3: 6→5→4→3 (3 steps) + close left (1) →4 steps. Total 2+4=6 steps. So same.\n\nSo, in this case, both options give same result.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle these.\n\nNow, what about when l=1 and r=2, pos=2.\n\nLeft needed: no.\n\nRight needed:2 <n (assuming n>2).\n\nShe needs to close right (tabs 3,4...n).\n\nShe is at 2. So she can close right in 1 step. So total steps 1.\n\nAnother case: l=4, r=5, pos=3.\n\nLeft needed:4>1.\n\nRight needed:5 <n (if n>5).\n\nSo, option1: move to 4 (from 3: 1 step), close left (1 step). Then move to 5 (1 step), close right (1). Total 1+1 +1+1=4.\n\noption2: move to 5 (2 steps from 3), close right (1). Then move to 4 (1 step), close left (1). Total 2+1 +1+1=5.\n\nSo option1 is better.\n\nSo code would correctly calculate 4 steps.\n\nNow, what about when l=r? Like l=3, r=3, pos=3, n=5.\n\nLeft needed:3>1 → yes.\n\nRight needed:3 <5 → yes.\n\nSo she needs to close left (tabs 1,2) and right (4,5).\n\nOption1: move to 3 (0 steps), close left (1). Then move to 3 again (0 steps), close right (1). So total 2 steps.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nWait, after closing left, the a becomes 3, b is 3. Then, she can't move beyond that. So when she's at 3, closing right would close all tabs after 3. So yes.\n\nSo steps: 0 +1 (close left) + 0 +1 (close right) → 2 steps.\n\nOption2: move to 3 (0), close right (1). Then move to 3 (0), close left (1). Same.\n\nSo, the code would compute option1 as (0 +1) + (0 +1) = 2, same for option2.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to cover all cases.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nThe plan is:\n\n- Read the four integers n, pos, l, r.\n\n- Compute whether left and right are needed.\n\n- Depending on that, compute the minimal steps.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead input as four integers.\n\nleft_needed = (l > 1)\n\nright_needed = (r < n)\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n   option1 = (abs(pos - l) + 1) + (abs(l - r) + 1)\n\n   option2 = (abs(pos - r) + 1) + (abs(r - l) + 1)\n\n   total = min(option1, option2)\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n   total = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelse:\n\n   total = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but wait: in the case where left_needed and right_needed, is the movement between l and r always required?\n\nYes, because after closing one side, she needs to get to the other side to close it.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:6 3 2 4\n\nleft_needed=True, right_needed=True.\n\noption1: |3-2|+1=1+1=2, |2-4|=2+1=3 → total 5.\n\noption2: |3-4|=1+1=2, |4-2|=2+1=3 → total 5.\n\nmin(5,5)=5. So output is 5.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:6 3 1 3.\n\nleft_needed=False (since l=1), right_needed=True.\n\ntotal = |3-3| +1 = 0+1=1.\n\nSample3:\n\n5 2 1 5.\n\nboth False, output 0.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=7, pos=3, l=3, r=5.\n\nleft_needed:3>1 → yes.\n\nright_needed:5<7 → yes.\n\noption1: |3-3|+1=1. |3-5|=2+1=3. Total 1+3=4.\n\noption2: |3-5|=2+1=3. |5-3|=2+1=3. Total 3+3=6.\n\nSo min is 4.\n\nThus, code would output 4.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: pos=5, l=3, r=6, n=10.\n\nAs discussed earlier, code would compute 6 steps.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nNow, implement it in Python.\n\nRead the input as four integers.\n\nCompute left_needed and right_needed.\n\nHandle the cases.\n\nSo, the code would be something like:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nleft_needed = l > 1\n\nright_needed = r < n\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n    option1 = (abs(pos - l) + 1) + (abs(l - r) + 1)\n\n    option2 = (abs(pos - r) + 1) + (abs(l - r) + 1)\n\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n    print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n\nelse:\n\n    print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n\nWait, but wait! Wait a minute.\n\nIn the case where she needs to close both left and right, the code adds the movement between l and r in both options, but is that correct?\n\nBecause, after closing left, she is at l, and needs to move to r, which is |l - r| steps.\n\nSimilarly, after closing right, she is at r, and needs to move to l.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",

Choose the minimal steps from these two scenarios.\n   - If only left tabs need to be closed, compute the steps to move to `l` and close the left tabs.\n   - If only right tabs need to be closed, compute the steps to move to `r` and close the right tabs.\n3. **Handle Edge Cases**: If no tabs need to be closed (i.e., `l=1` and `r=n`), return 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nleft_needed = l > 1\nright_needed = r < n\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n    print(0)\nelif left_needed and right_needed:\n    option1 = (abs(pos - l) + 1) + (abs(l - r) + 1)\n    option2 = (abs(pos - r) + 1) + (abs(l - r) + 1)\n    print(min(option1, option2))\nelif left_needed:\n    print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\nelse:\n    print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Identify Needs**: Check if tabs before `l` or after `r` need to be closed.\n- **Calculate Steps**: For each scenario where tabs need to be closed, compute the total steps considering both movement and closing actions.\n- **Efficient Movement**: Ensure the minimal steps are taken by considering both possible orders of closing left and right tabs if both are needed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle all edge cases and efficiently compute the minimal time required using straightforward arithmetic operations and conditional checks.",
