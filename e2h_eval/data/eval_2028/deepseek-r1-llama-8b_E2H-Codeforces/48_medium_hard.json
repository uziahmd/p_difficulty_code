He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about converting a number from one base to another, but with some Roman numeral rules involved. Oh right, and the bases can be up to 25, which is manageable.\n\nThe input gives me two integers a and b. Wait, but b could be 'R', which indicates that the target base uses Roman numerals. Interesting. Then, there's a string c which is in base a. My task is to convert this into base b, but using Roman numerals if needed.\n\nLet me break this down. So first, I need to parse the input correctly. The first line has a and b, but b might be R. The second line is the number c in base a, possibly with leading zeros.\n\nThe output should be the same number in base b, without leading zeros. And if the target base is greater than 10, I use letters A-Z for 10 and beyond. If it's using Roman numerals (i.e., b is R), then I have to represent the number according to Roman rules, considering subtractive combinations like IV for 4, IX for 9, etc.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read a and b. Determine whether the target is a numeric base or Roman.\n2. Convert the given number c from base a to a decimal (base 10) integer.\n3. Then, convert this decimal number into base b, but using Roman numerals if b is R.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the conversion is directly from base a to base b, but when the target is Roman, we have to represent the number using Roman symbols instead of digits.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that each door's parts are a, either b or R, c, and then empty. So when the second part is R, it's the Roman system. So for the target, if b is R, we have to output the number as a Roman numeral. Otherwise, output it in base b as a string, omitting leading zeros.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Parse a and b. If b is R, then target is Roman. Else, target is base b as a string.\n- Convert the given c (base a) to a decimal integer.\n- Then, if the target is base b (not R), convert the decimal to base b as a string.\n   - But wait, when the target is a regular base, how do we represent numbers? For example, if a=2 and b=2, the output is the same as the input, but without leading zeros. So we have to handle that.\n- If the target is Roman, then we need to convert the decimal number to Roman numerals, following the rules.\n\nHmm, okay, so the main tasks are:\n\na. Converting c from base a to decimal.\nb. Then, based on the target base (b), either outputting in base b (as a string) or converting to Roman numerals.\n\nLet's think about the first part: converting c from base a to decimal. How to do that? Well, for each character in the string c, starting from the left, multiply the current total by a, then add the value of the current digit. But wait, the digits can be letters too, right? No, wait, c is given in base a. Since a can be up to 25, the digits can be 0-9 and A-Z (but lowercase?), but the problem says that c is in base a, so each character represents a digit in base a. So for example, if a is 16, then the digits can be 0-F.\n\nWait, but in the input, c is given as a string, like '1111001'. So each character is a digit in base a. So to convert c to decimal:\n\nFor each character in c:\n- If it's a digit, its value is int(char).\n- If it's a letter, uppercase or lowercase? The problem statement says that in bases above 10, A is 10, B 11, etc. So probably, letters are uppercase. But the input may have any case? Or perhaps the input is always uppercase. Hmm, but the problem says that c is a non-negative integer in base a. So the letters in c must be in the correct range for base a. So, for example, if a is 16, letters can be up to F, etc.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, for example, one of the test cases is '12 13\\nA' which outputs 'A'. So the input c is 'A', which in base 13 is 10. So when converted to base 13, it's still 'A'.\n\nSo, during conversion, each character is treated as a digit in base a. So for that, we'll need to map each character to its corresponding value in base a.\n\nWait, but for a base like 16, the digits can be 0-15. So letters A-F represent 10-15. So in the code, for each character in c, we need to find its value as per base a.\n\nSo, for the function to convert a string in base a to decimal, we can process each character:\n\ndef str_to_decimal(c_str, base):\n    total = 0\n    for char in c_str:\n        val = 0\n        if char.isdigit():\n            val = int(char)\n        else:\n            # assume uppercase letters only?\n            val = ord(char.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        # check if val is less than base\n        if val >= base:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid character {char} for base {base}\")\n        total = total * base + val\n    return total\n\nWait, but the problem says that c is a non-negative integer, so it won't be negative. Also, it's guaranteed that if using Roman numerals, the number is <= 300010, but otherwise, it's <=101510. So the decimal can be up to around 300k or so, which is manageable.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, the next step is to convert it to the target representation.\n\nCase 1: Target is a numeric base (b is not R). Then, we need to represent the decimal as a string in base b, without leading zeros.\n\nBut wait, if the decimal is zero, the output is zero. But the problem says that c is not zero. So we don't have to handle that case.\n\nCase 2: Target is Roman. Then, we need to convert the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nSo the main functions we need are:\n\n- A function to convert a decimal number to Roman numerals, following the rules.\n\nLet's think about the Roman numeral conversion. The rules are:\n\n- Symbols are I, V, X, L, C, D, M, etc., but their values depend on their position.\n\nThe standard Roman numerals go like this:\n\nI = 1\nV =5\nX=10\nL=50\nC=100\nD=500\nM=1000\n\nBut when the symbols are used in subtraction, like IV for 4 (5-1), IX for 9 (10-1), XL for 40 (50-10), XC for 90, CD for 400, CM for 900.\n\nSo, for numbers >= 1000, we have to use M's. For numbers between 900-999, use CM and D's and others.\n\nThe approach to convert a decimal number to Roman is usually done by breaking it down into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nBut the key is to use the subtractive forms where possible to get the smallest possible representation.\n\nAn algorithm to do this is:\n\nCreate a list of tuples that maps values to their Roman numeral representations, ordered from highest to lowest, including the subtractive cases.\n\nFor example:\n\n[\n(1000, 'M'),\n(900, 'CM'),\n(500, 'D'),\n(400, 'CD'),\n(100, 'C'),\n(90, 'XC'),\n(50, 'L'),\n(40, 'XL'),\n(10, 'X'),\n(9, 'IX'),\n(5, 'V'),\n(4, 'IV'),\n(1, 'I'),\n]\n\nThen, for each value in the list, subtract as much as possible from the number and append the corresponding Roman symbols to the result.\n\nThis works because we process higher values first.\n\nSo, for example, 394 would be processed as:\n\n- 1000: no\n- 900: yes, subtract 900, add 'CM'\n- remaining: 394-900= no, wait 394 is less than 900. So proceed.\n- 500: no.\n- 400: yes, subtract 400, add 'CD', remaining 394-400= -6? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me think. 394: 300 is CCC, 90 is XC, 4 is IV. So the correct Roman is 'CCCXCIV'.\n\nWait, but according to the algorithm, 394 is 400-6. So the algorithm would subtract 400, which leaves a negative number, which is incorrect.\n\nAh, right, so the algorithm needs to process the largest possible values first, but only subtract if the current value is less than or equal to the remaining number.\n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\nFor each value-symbol pair in the list, while the number is >= value, subtract the value and append the symbol.\n\nSo, for 394:\n\nStart with 394.\n\nCheck 1000: no.\nCheck 900: no.\nCheck 500: no.\nCheck 400: 394 <400 → skip.\nCheck 100: 394 /100 is 3, so append 'CCC' → 394-300=94.\nCheck 90: 94 >=90 → append 'XC', subtract 90 → 4.\nCheck 50: no.\nCheck 40: no.\nCheck 10: no.\nCheck 9: no.\nCheck 5: no.\nCheck 4: 4 ==4 → append 'IV', done.\n\nSo the result is 'CCCXCIV'.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nnumber = ... initial number\nresult = ''\nfor value, symbol in sorted_values:\n    while number >= value:\n        result += symbol\n        number -= value\nreturn result\n\nYes, that's the correct way.\n\nSo, in code, the Roman conversion function would look like this.\n\nNow, the other case: converting the decimal number to base b as a string.\n\nBut for bases above 10, the digits are represented as letters A-Z, where A is 10, B is 11, etc.\n\nSo, for example, if the base is 16, the digits 10-15 are represented as A-F.\n\nSo, for a number n in base b, we need to represent it as a string where each digit is either a digit (0-9) or a letter (A-Z), corresponding to 10-35 (since b can be up to 25).\n\nWait, no. Because b can be up to 25. So the maximum digit value is 25-1=24. So for base 25, the digits are 0-24. So 10 is A, 11 is B, ..., 24 is X (since 10 +14 =24, which is the 15th letter after A, but wait, letters go A (10), B(11), ... X (24, since 10+14=24? Wait, A is 10, B 11,..., Z is 35, but since our base is up to 25, the max digit is 24.\n\nWait, 25-1=24. So the digits go up to 24, which is represented by 'X' (since A is 10, B is 11, C 12, D13, E14, F15, G16, H17, I18, J19, K20, L21, M22, N23, O24. Wait, wait, 10 is A, 11 B, 12 C, 13 D, 14 E, 15 F, 16 G, 17 H, 18 I, 19 J, 20 K, 21 L, 22 M, 23 N, 24 O, 25 is P, but since base is up to 25, the digit 25 is not allowed. Wait, no, because base is 25, the digits go from 0 to 24. So 24 is O.\n\nSo for each digit, we need to represent it as follows:\n\ndigit_value = 0-9 → '0'-'9'\n\ndigit_value >=10 → corresponding letter: 10→A, 11→B, ..., 24→O.\n\nSo, the function to convert a digit to its character is straightforward.\n\nSo, for a base b, to convert a number to its string representation:\n\nWe repeatedly divide the number by b, get the remainder as the digit, then build the string from least significant to most, then reverse it.\n\nBut we need to handle leading zeros. So, for example, if the number is zero, output '0', but according to the problem statement, c is not zero.\n\nSo, the steps for converting a decimal number to base b as a string:\n\nif n ==0: return '0'\n\nelse:\n\ndigits = []\nwhile n>0:\n    remainder = n % b\n    if remainder <10:\n        digits.append(str(remainder))\n    else:\n        # remainder is 10-24, so map to A-O\n        digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder -10))\n    n = n // b\n\nThen, reverse the digits to get the correct order, and join them into a string.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, for example, when the target is base 2, and c is '1' in base 10, the output is '1'. So that's handled correctly.\n\nAnother example: the input was '12 13\\nA', which is 'A' in base 13. The output is 'A', which is 10 in base 13. So that's correct.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead a and b from the first line. But wait, the first line is given as something like '10 2\\n1'—so it's a string with a and b separated by space, then a new line. So in Python, I can split the first line into a and b.\n\nWait, the input comes as a list of lines. Wait, no, the input is read via standard input, which can be read as a single string split by lines.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the input is given as a list of lines, but in reality, the program will read from stdin. So perhaps in the code, the first line is split into a and b, and the second line is the c string.\n\nWait, in the sample input provided, it's shown as:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWhich implies that the first line is a and b, and the second line is c.\n\nSo in code, read the first line as a and b. Then read the second line as c.\n\nWait, but the input is passed as a list of lines, perhaps? Or perhaps it's read as a single string, split into lines.\n\nIn Python, for the code, perhaps the input is read as:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nThen, a and b are taken from the first line, and c is the second line.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nline1 = lines[0].strip() → split into a and b.\n\nline2 = lines[1].strip() → c_str.\n\nSo, a, b = map(int, line1.split())\n\nc_str = line2.strip()\n\nThen, parse c_str into a decimal number.\n\nSo, create a function to convert c_str from base a to decimal.\n\nWait, but c_str could have letters, which represent digits in base a.\n\nSo, for each character in c_str:\n\n- if it's a digit: its value is int(char)\n- if it's a letter: uppercase, and the value is 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A')).\n\nBut wait, the problem states that c is a non-negative integer in base a. So any letters in c_str must be valid for base a.\n\nSo, for example, if a is 16, letters can be up to F.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef str_to_decimal(s, base):\n    total = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            val = int(ch)\n        else:\n            # assume uppercase\n            val = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        if val >= base:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid character {ch} in base {base}\")\n        total = total * base + val\n    return total\n\nWait, but what about when base is 1? No, because the constraints say a and b are at least 2. So no problem.\n\nOnce we have the decimal number, we then decide how to represent it.\n\nIf b is 'R', then we need to output the Roman numeral equivalent.\n\nElse, we output the number in base b as a string, without leading zeros.\n\nSo, let's write the Roman function:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            num -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\nYes.\n\nAnd the function to convert decimal to base b as a string:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            # rem is 10-24, so A-O\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem -10))\n        n = n // base\n    # digits are in reverse order\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, when c is '5 R\\n4', which is 5 in base a=5, the decimal is 5. Then, target is R, so output is 'IV'? Wait, no.\n\nWait, the sample input shows:\n\nSample Input:\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nWait, wait, the third case is '5 R\\n4'—so a is 5, b is R.\n\nSo c is '4' in base 5. So decimal is 4.\n\nSo the target is R, so output is IV.\n\nYes, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, handling the case when the target is R:\n\nSo, after converting c to decimal, if b is 'R', then call decimal_to_roman, else, call decimal_to_base.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the function to read the input is:\n\nline1 = lines[0].strip()\nparts = line1.split()\na = int(parts[0])\nb = parts[1]  # could be 'R' or a number\n\nWait, but in code, b is initially a string, but if it's 'R', then we treat it as Roman. Else, as an integer.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nline1 = lines[0].strip()\na_str, b_str = line1.split()\na = int(a_str)\nb = b_str\n\nThen, if b == 'R':\n    target_is_roman = True\nelse:\n    target_is_roman = False\n\nSo, the code proceeds accordingly.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows that the first line is '10 2\\n1' → a is 10, b is 2, so target is base 2.\n\nThe c_str is '1', which in base 10 is 1. So converted to base 2, which is '1'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: '12 13\\nA' → a is 12, b is 13. So c_str is 'A' which is 10 in base 12.\n\nThen, target is base 13. So 10 in base 13 is 'A', so output is 'A'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, now, putting it all together.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n1. When the target is base 2, and the decimal is 0 → but problem says c is non-zero.\n\nWait, no, the problem says c is not zero, but the output can be zero if the target is base 2 and c is zero, but in the problem statement, c is non-zero.\n\nSo no, but code handles n=0 correctly.\n\n2. When the target is base 1: but according to the problem statement, a and b are at least 2, so base can't be 1.\n\n3. Leading zeros: when converting to base b, the function removes leading zeros.\n\nFor example, in the sample input, '2 2\\n1111001' → c is '1111001' in base 2, which is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 +1*2^0 → 64 +32 +16 +8 +0 +0 +1 = 121. So in base 2, it's 1111001, which is 7 ones, but the output is '1111001' without leading zeros.\n\nWait, the function returns '1111001' as the output, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: if the decimal is 10, and the target base is 16, output is 'A'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: when the target is base 10, but the number is 0. But the problem says c is not zero, so no issue.\n\nAnother case: when the target is base 10, and the decimal is 12345 → output as '12345'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead lines.\n\nParse a and b.\n\nParse c_str.\n\nConvert c_str to decimal.\n\nThen, if b is 'R':\n\n   convert decimal to Roman.\n\nElse:\n\n   convert decimal to base b as string.\n\nOutput the result.\n\nBut wait, when converting to base b, the function returns a string, but in the case of a=2, b=2, the output is the same as c_str, but without leading zeros.\n\nSo, for example, if c is '0011' in base 2, the decimal is 3, which in base 2 is '11' → output '11'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the functions should handle leading zeros correctly.\n\nNow, testing the code:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2\n\n1 → a=10, b=2, c_str='1'\n\nDecimal is 1.\n\nTarget is base 2 → output '1'.\n\nSample Output: '1'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n16 R\n\n5 → a=16, b=R, c_str='5'.\n\nDecimal is 5.\n\nRoman numeral is V.\n\nSample Output: 'V'.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 R\n\n4 → a=5, b=R, c_str='4' → decimal 4 → Roman IV.\n\nSample Output: 'IV'.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001 → a=2, b=2, c_str='1111001' → decimal is 121.\n\nTarget base 2 → output is '1111001'.\n\nSample Output: '1111001'.\n\nSample Input 5:\n\n12 13\n\nA → a=12, b=13, c_str='A' → decimal is 10.\n\nTarget is base 13 → output 'A'.\n\nSample Output: 'A'.\n\nAll match the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: let's say a=3, b=10, c_str='21' → in base 3, '21' is 2*3 +1=7. So decimal is 7.\n\nConvert to base 10 → '7'.\n\nAnother test case: a=16, b='R', c_str='FF' → FF in base 16 is 255. So Roman is 'CCCLXXXV'.\n\nWait, 255 is 200 +50 +5 → CC LXXX V → wait, 200 is C, 50 is L, 5 is V → CCCLXXXV?\n\nWait, 255 is 200 (C) +50 (L) +5 (V) → total 255. So the Roman numeral is 'CCCLXXXV'.\n\nWait, no: 200 (C) → 255-200=55. 55 is 50 (L) +5 (V) → so 200 +50 +5 = 255 → C L V → CLV?\n\nWait, no, because 50 +5 is 55, which is L followed by V → LV. So 200 +50 +5 is 255 → C LV → CLV.\n\nWait, but in Roman numerals, you can't have more than one occurrence of subtractive notation in a row. So 255 is 200 + 50 + 5 → C LV → 'CLV'.\n\nWait, but 50 is L, 5 is V. So 'CLV' is 200 + 50 +5 = 255.\n\nYes, so 'CLV'.\n\nSo, the function should output 'CLV'.\n\nTesting that, in code, 255 → the function loops through the list:\n\nStart with 1000: no.\n\n900: no.\n\n500: 255 <500 → no.\n\n400: no.\n\n100: 255 >=100 → subtract 100, add 'C' → 155.\n\n155 >=100 → again, add 'C' → 55.\n\n55 >=100 → no.\n\nNext is 90: no.\n\n50: 55 >=50 → add 'L' → 5 left.\n\n5: add 'V' → done.\n\nSo, the result is 'CCLV'.\n\nWait, wait, that's different. Hmm, what's wrong here.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-calculate.\n\nNumber is 255.\n\nCheck each value:\n\n1000: no.\n\n900: no.\n\n500: 255<500 → no.\n\n400: 255<400 → no.\n\n100: 255//100 is 2, so add 'C' twice → 'CC', subtract 200, leaving 55.\n\nThen, 90: 55<90 → no.\n\n50: 55 >=50 → add 'L', subtract 50, leaves 5.\n\n5: add 'V', subtract 5 → done.\n\nSo the result is 'CCCLV' → 'CCCLV' is 200+50+5=255.\n\nWait, but that's three Cs?\n\nWait, 100 is C, so 255 /100 is 2 → two Cs.\n\nSo, the Roman numeral is 'CCCLV'.\n\nSo, the function would produce 'CCCLV' for 255.\n\nWait, but earlier thought said that it's 'CLV'.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let's double-check.\n\nWait, 255 is 200 + 50 +5.\n\nSo 200 is two Cs → 'CC', 50 is L, 5 is V.\n\nSo the correct Roman is 'CCCLV'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the function is correct.\n\nSo, code-wise, the function works.\n\nAnother test case: 1994.\n\nWait, 1994 in Roman numerals is MCMXCIV.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n1994:\n\n1000 → M, 994 remains.\n\n900 → CM, 94 remains.\n\n90 → XC, 4 remains.\n\n4 → IV.\n\nSo, M CM XC IV → MCMXCIV.\n\nSo the function correctly appends M, then CM, then XC, then IV.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the function is correct.\n\nNow, coding all of this.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n1. Handling uppercase letters in c_str.\n\nIn the function str_to_decimal, the code converts each character to uppercase before processing. So, regardless of the case in the input, it's treated as uppercase. So that's correct.\n\n2. Making sure that the target base is treated correctly.\n\nIn code, when b is 'R', then the target is Roman. Else, it's a number.\n\n3. Making sure that the functions handle all cases, including when the decimal is zero. But since c is non-zero, it's not a concern.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nline1 = lines[0].strip()\na_str, b_str = line1.split()\na = int(a_str)\nb = b_str\n\nline2 = lines[1].strip()\nc_str = line2\n\nThen, convert c_str to decimal.\n\nBut wait, what if a is 1? No, the constraints say a and b are ≥2.\n\nImplementing the str_to_decimal function.\n\ndef str_to_decimal(s, base):\n    total = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            val = int(ch)\n        else:\n            val = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        if val >= base:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Character {ch} in base {base} is invalid\")\n        total = total * base + val\n    return total\n\nBut in the code, perhaps better to have helper functions.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplement the helper functions.\n\nThen, after converting c_str to decimal_num:\n\nif b == 'R':\n    roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_num)\nelse:\n    base_b = decimal_to_base(decimal_num, int(b))\n\nprint(roman or base_b)\n\nWait, but if decimal_num is zero, but c is non-zero, so no problem.\n\nTesting for the sample inputs.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef str_to_decimal(s, base):\n    total = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            val = int(ch)\n        else:\n            val = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        if val >= base:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid character {ch} in base {base}\")\n        total = total * base + val\n    return total\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            num -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\nif not lines:\n    print('')\n    exit()\n\nline1 = lines[0].strip()\na_str, b_str = line1.split()\na = int(a_str)\nb = b_str\n\nline2 = lines[1].strip()\nc_str = line2\n\ntry:\n    decimal_num = str_to_decimal(c_str, a)\nexcept:\n    print(\"Error: Invalid c_str for base a\")\n    exit()\n\nif b == 'R':\n    roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_num)\nelse:\n    try:\n        base_b = decimal_to_base(decimal_num, int(b))\n    except:\n        print(\"Error: Could not convert to base\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(roman if b == 'R' else base_b)\n\nWait, but in the code above, the 'print' statement refers to variables that may not exist if b is 'R' or not. So, to fix that:\n\nif b == 'R':\n    print(decimal_to_roman(decimal_num))\nelse:\n    print(decimal_to_base(decimal_num, int(b)))\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the corrected code is:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef str_to_decimal(s, base):\n    total = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            val = int(ch)\n        else:\n            val = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        if val >= base:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid character {ch} in base {base}\")\n        total = total * base + val\n    return total\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            num -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\nif not lines:\n    print('')\n    exit()\n\nline1 = lines[0].strip()\na_str, b_str = line1.split()\na = int(a_str)\nb = b_str\n\nline2 = lines[1].strip()\nc_str = line2\n\ntry:\n    decimal_num = str_to_decimal(c_str, a)\nexcept:\n    print(\"Error: Invalid c_str for base a\")\n    exit()\n\nif b == 'R':\n    roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_num)\nelse:\n    try:\n        base_b = decimal_to_base(decimal_num, int(b))\n    except:\n        print(\"Error: Could not convert to base\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(roman if b == 'R' else base_b)\n\nWait, but in the code, when b is 'R', 'roman' is defined, else 'base_b' is.\n\nSo, the print statement correctly outputs the desired string.\n\nTesting this code against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2\n1\n\ndecimal_num = 1.\n\nb is '2' → not R.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another. The target base can either be a numeric base or the Roman numeral system. The conversion involves parsing the input, converting the number to a decimal (base 10) integer, and then converting it to the target base or Roman numeral representation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Parse Input:** Read the input values which include the source base, target base, and the number in the source base.\n2. **Convert to Decimal:** Convert the given number from its source base to a decimal (base 10) integer.\n3. **Determine Target Conversion:** Based on the target base, decide whether to convert the decimal number to a Roman numeral or to a string representation in the target base.\n4. **Roman Numeral Conversion:** If the target is the Roman numeral system, use a predefined list of value-symbol pairs to construct the Roman numeral string by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible values.\n5. **Base Conversion:** If the target is a numeric base, convert the decimal number to the target base using repeated division and modulo operations, handling digits beyond 9 with letters A-Z.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef str_to_decimal(s, base):\n    total = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            val = int(ch)\n        else:\n            val = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        if val >= base:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid character {ch} in base {base}\")\n        total = total * base + val\n    return total\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            num -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\nif not lines:\n    print('')\n    exit()\n\nline1 = lines[0].strip()\na_str, b_str = line1.split()\na = int(a_str)\nb = b_str\n\nline2 = lines[1].strip()\nc_str = line2\n\ntry:\n    decimal_num = str_to_decimal(c_str, a)\nexcept:\n    print(\"Error: Invalid c_str for base a\")\n    exit()\n\nif b == 'R':\n    roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_num)\nelse:\n    try:\n        base_b = decimal_to_base(decimal_num, int(b))\n    except:\n        print(\"Error: Could not convert to base\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(roman if b == 'R' else base_b)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The input is read as a list of lines. The first line contains the source and target bases, and the second line contains the number in the source base.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal:** The function `str_to_decimal` converts the number from its source base to a decimal integer by iterating over each character and computing its value.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion:** The function `decimal_to_roman` constructs the Roman numeral string by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible values from the number.\n4. **Base Conversion:** The function `decimal_to_base` converts the decimal number to the target base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders.\n5. **Output:** Depending on whether the target base is Roman or numeric, the result is printed as either a Roman numeral string or a numeric string in the target base.",
