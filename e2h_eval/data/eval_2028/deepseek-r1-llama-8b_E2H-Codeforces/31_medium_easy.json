Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Cards.\" Hmm. Let me read the description carefully.\n\nSo, Vanya has some cards with numbers on them. Each number can be positive, negative, or zero, but their absolute value doesn't exceed x. Natasha hid all his cards, but he found n of them. He wants the sum of all the found cards to be zero. But right now, the sum isn't zero. So, he needs to find some more cards (from the infinite supply of -x to x) to add to the found ones so that the total sum is zero. Our task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nWait, but how do we determine which cards to add? Because each card can have any value as long as its absolute value is at most x. So, for example, if the current sum is S, then the minimal number of cards needed would be determined by how far S is from zero, but considering that each added card can contribute up to x towards the sum.\n\nLet me think about the approach here. \n\nFirst, calculate the sum of the current found cards. Let's call this sum 'current_sum'. Then, the target is to make the total sum zero by adding some new cards. Let's denote the number of new cards as k. Each of these can contribute at most x towards the sum (since each card's value can be up to x in absolute value).\n\nSo, the maximum possible contribution from k cards is k * x (if all are x). Similarly, the minimum contribution is -k * x (if all are -x). Wait, no. Actually, each card can contribute any value between -x and x, but when trying to reach a specific sum, we need to find how many steps are required to cover the deficit or surplus.\n\nWait, maybe another way: The current sum is S. We need the total sum after adding some cards to be zero. So, the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's denote the sum of new cards as T. So T = -S.\n\nBut each new card can contribute at most x. So the minimal number of cards required is the minimal k such that |T| <= k * x. Because each card can contribute up to x towards T, so the maximum T can be achieved in k steps is k*x. Wait, wait, no: since T can be positive or negative, but each card can be chosen as either positive or negative. So actually, the sum of k cards can vary between -k*x and +k*x. So, to get T = -S, we need to find the smallest k such that |T| ≤ k * x.\n\nBut wait, what if T is exactly divisible by x? Like, suppose S is 5, x is 2. Then T needs to be -5. How many cards? Since each card can contribute up to 2. So 3 cards: 2+2+1=5? Wait, no. Wait, no, because each card's value can be any integer between -x and x, including non-integer? No, wait, each card has an integer value. So, each new card can contribute any integer value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\nWait, no. The problem statement says each card has a single integer. So, the new cards' values are integers. So, for example, if I need to achieve a sum T, each new card can contribute up to x (but as an integer). So, the minimal k is the ceiling of |T| / x. Because each step contributes at most x, so for |T| units, you need at least |T| / x steps, rounded up.\n\nWait, let's test this logic with examples.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nThe sum is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. So S = 2. So T must be -2. How many new cards do we need? One card of -2. Because |T|=2, x=2. So 2/2=1, so k=1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample:\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nSum is -4. So T must be 4. How many new cards? 4 /3 is 1.333, so we round up to 2. Because 3*1=3 <4, so 2 cards are needed. Each can contribute up to 3. So 3+1=4, which is two cards. Hence the sample output is 2.\n\nSo, yes, the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |T| / x.\n\nSo, the steps to solve the problem are:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the found cards.\n2. Compute T = -sum.\n3. Compute the absolute value of T, which is |T|.\n4. If |T| is zero, then no new cards are needed.\n5. Else, compute k = ceil(|T| / x).\n6. Output k.\n\nWait, but wait. What if |T| is exactly divisible by x? Then k is |T|/x, which is an integer. For example, if T is 6 and x is 3: 6/3=2, so k=2.\n\nAnother example: T is 5, x is 3. 5/3 is 1.666, so k=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the formula is k = (|T| + x -1 ) // x. That's a standard way to compute the ceiling without using floating points.\n\nSo, the plan is clear.\n\nNow, how to implement this?\n\nRead the input:\n\nFirst line: n and x.\n\nSecond line: n integers.\n\nCompute current_sum as the sum of those integers.\n\nCompute T = -current_sum.\n\nIf T is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute the absolute value of T, say abs_T.\n\nCompute k = (abs_T + x -1) // x.\n\nThen print k.\n\nWait, but let's test another case.\n\nCase where current_sum is 0: output is 0.\n\nAnother case: current_sum is 3, x is 2. So T is -3, abs_T is 3. 3 /2 is 1.5, so k is 2.\n\nBecause two cards can contribute up to 2 each: 2 +1=3, but wait, no. Wait, each new card can contribute any integer up to 2. So, to get a sum of 3, you can have 2+1=3, which requires two cards. Alternatively, one card can't because 2 is less than 3. So yes, k is 2.\n\nWait, but wait: 3 is larger than x=2, so we need to find the minimal k where k * x >= 3. So, 2*2=4 >=3. So, yes.\n\nWait, another example: T is 4, x is 3. So 4>3, so k is 2 (since 3*1=3 <4, 3*2=6>=4). So 2 cards. 3+1=4, but each card can be 3 and 1, which are allowed.\n\nSo, the formula seems correct.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nRead the inputs: n and x, then the list of numbers.\n\nCompute current_sum = sum(numbers).\n\nCompute T = -current_sum.\n\nIf T == 0: print 0.\n\nElse, compute abs_T = abs(T)\n\nCompute k = (abs_T + x -1) // x\n\nPrint k.\n\nWait, but wait: what if x is zero? Wait, according to the problem statement, x is at least 1. Because the constraints say 1<=x<=1000. So, no division by zero issues.\n\nSo, code:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead list of n integers.\n\nsum_found = sum(list)\n\nt = -sum_found\n\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n    k = (abs_t + x -1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but looking back at the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nsum is 2, so t is -2. abs_t is 2.\n\nk = (2 +2 -1)/2 = (3)/2=1.5, but integer division in Python is 3//2=1. But wait, 2+2-1 is 3. 3 divided by 2 is 1.5, so in integer division, it's 1.5 becomes 1. But wait, in the sample, the answer was 1. So the formula works.\n\nWait, no. Wait, (2+2-1) is 3, 3//2 is 1, which is correct.\n\nWait, the formula (abs_t +x -1) //x is correct.\n\nAnother test: abs_t=5, x=3: 5+3-1=7, 7//3=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should be fine.\n\nTesting the second sample:\n\nInput: 2 3\n\nNumbers: -2, -2.\n\nsum is -4, so t is 4.\n\nabs_t is 4.\n\nk=(4 +3-1)//3 =6//3=2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=1, x=5.\n\nFound card: 3.\n\nsum is 3, t=-3.\n\nabs_t=3.\n\nk=(3+5-1)/5=7//5=1. So one card of -3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=1, x=3.\n\nFound card: 4? Wait, no, the problem states that the found cards have numbers not exceeding x in absolute value. So in the input, all numbers are within [-x, x]. So in code, we don't have to worry about that.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the next line, split into list of integers.\n\nsum_found = sum(list)\n\nt = -sum_found\n\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n    k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nSo, that's the code.\n\nWait, but the input is given as a string with spaces. So, for example, in the first sample, the input is given as '3 2\\n-1 1 2'. So, the code should read the second line correctly.\n\nIn Python, reading via input().split() will handle that.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_found = sum(cards)\nt = -sum_found\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n    k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nYes, that's it.\n\nTesting this with the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nsum is 2. t is -2. abs_t=2.\n\nk=(2+2-1)//2=3//2=1. So output is 1.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nsum is -4. t is4. abs_t=4.\n\nk=(4+3-1)//3=6//3=2. Output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=1, x=1.\n\nCards: [1]\n\nsum is 1. t is -1. abs_t=1.\n\nk=(1 +1-1)//1 =1//1=1. So output is 1.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, x=5.\n\nCards: [5,5]. Sum is 10. t is -10. abs_t=10.\n\nk=(10+5-1)//5=14//5=2. So 2*5=10. So two cards of -5 each. Sum is -10. So yes.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=4, x=5.\n\nCards: [1,2,3,-5]. Sum is 1+2+3-5=1. So t is -1. So k is 1.\n\nSo, code outputs 1.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when sum is zero? Like:\n\nn=2, x=5.\n\nCards: [3, -3]. Sum is 0. So t is 0. Output is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, I think this covers all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his found cards equals zero. Each card can have an integer value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: Compute the sum of the integers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: The target sum needed to make the total sum zero is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Compute the Minimum Number of Cards**: To achieve the target sum, each additional card can contribute at most x towards the sum. The minimum number of cards required is the smallest integer k such that k * x is at least the absolute value of the target sum. This can be computed using the ceiling of the division of the absolute target sum by x.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent_sum = sum(cards)\ntarget = -current_sum\n\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_target = abs(target)\n    min_cards = (abs_target + x - 1) // x\n    print(min_cards)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of found cards `n` and the maximum absolute value `x` from the input. It then reads the list of integers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is calculated.\n3. **Target Calculation**: The target sum needed to balance the current sum to zero is computed as the negative of the current sum.\n4. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed, and the output is 0.\n5. **Compute Minimum Cards**: The absolute value of the target sum is used to determine the minimum number of cards needed. This is done by computing the ceiling of the division of the absolute target sum by x, which gives the smallest integer k such that k * x is at least the absolute target sum.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of additional cards needed using basic arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
