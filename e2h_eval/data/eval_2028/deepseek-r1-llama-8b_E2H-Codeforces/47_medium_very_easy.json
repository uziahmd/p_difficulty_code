    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem says that Neko has two integers a and b, and he wants to find a non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple (LCM) of a + k and b + k is as small as possible. If there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, he picks the smallest one.\n\nHmm, right. So the task is to compute the optimal k for given a and b.\n\nFirst, let's think about how the LCM works. The LCM of two numbers x and y is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). So to minimize the LCM, we want to maximize the GCD of x and y. Because if the GCD is higher, the product is divided by a larger number, leading to a smaller LCM.\n\nWait, but since x = a +k and y = b +k, which can be rewritten as y = x + (b -a), assuming a < b. Or maybe not, because if a > b, then it's x = y + (a - b). So the difference between x and y is fixed based on a and b. Let's denote d as the absolute difference between a and b. So d = |a - b|. Without loss of generality, let's assume a <= b, so d = b - a. Then x = a +k and y = a +k +d. So the two numbers are consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence with step d.\n\nSo, for any k, the two numbers x and y are at a distance d apart. So the LCM(x, y) is equal to (x*(x + d))/gcd(x, x+d).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the LCM is (x * y) / gcd(x, y). Since y = x +d, it's (x*(x +d)) / g, where g is the gcd of x and x +d. But since x and x +d have a gcd of g, which must divide d. Because the gcd of x and x +d is the same as the gcd of x and d.\n\nAh right! Because gcd(x, x +d) = gcd(x, d). So the maximum possible g is the divisor of d. So to maximize g, we should choose x such that g is as large as possible.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding x = a +k, such that g = gcd(x, d) is as large as possible. Because the LCM would then be minimized.\n\nSo our goal is to find x >= a, x = a +k, such that x is a multiple of some divisor g of d. And among all such x's, we need the one that maximizes g, and if there are multiple, pick the smallest x.\n\nWait, but wait: the LCM is (x * (x +d)) / g. But x and x +d are both multiples of g, so their product is g^2 * m, where m is something. So the LCM becomes g*m. So the larger the g, the smaller the LCM.\n\nSo yes, maximizing g will minimize the LCM.\n\nSo the strategy is to find the largest possible divisor g of d, and set x to be a multiple of g. Then, among all possible x's that are multiples of g, choose the smallest x >= a.\n\nBut wait, perhaps more precisely: for each possible divisor g of d, compute the minimal x that is a multiple of g and >= a. Then compute the corresponding LCM for each such x, and pick the one with the minimal LCM. If multiple g's lead to the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest x.\n\nWait, but considering all divisors might be computationally intensive if d is large. But since d can be up to 1e9, but the number of its divisors is O(sqrt(d)), which is manageable.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|.\n   If d is zero, then a and b are equal. So the LCM is a +k, which is minimized when k is zero. So output 0.\n\n2. Otherwise, find all the divisors of d.\n\n3. For each divisor g of d, sorted in descending order, do the following:\n   a. Find the smallest x >= a such that x is a multiple of g.\n      x = ((a + g - 1) // g) * g\n   b. Check if x >= a. If x < a, add g until x is >= a.\n      Wait, no, the formula (a +g-1)//g *g ensures that x is the smallest multiple of g >= a.\n   c. Compute the LCM for x and x +d.\n   d. Keep track of the minimal LCM found so far, along with the k that achieved it.\n\n4. Once all g's are processed, the optimal k is x -a. Among all possible g's that lead to the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest x, hence the smallest k.\n\nWait, but why process the divisors in descending order? Because we want to find the largest possible g first, which would likely give the best (smallest) LCM. But perhaps sometimes a smaller g may yield a better result because x could be closer to a, thus making x*(x+d) smaller. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe we should process all divisors and compute the corresponding x, then select the one that gives the minimal LCM.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximal g may not always lead to the minimal LCM, but perhaps it's the case that the maximal g does. Because as g increases, the LCM decreases.\n\nWait, let me think about that. Suppose d is fixed. For x, the LCM is (x*(x +d)) / g, where g is gcd(x, d).\n\nSo, for a fixed d, the LCM depends on x and g. To minimize it, we need to maximize g and make x as small as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps it's sufficient to process the divisors in descending order, and for each, compute the x, calculate the LCM, and track the minimal one. Once a certain g gives a lower LCM than any previously found, we can keep track. However, in the worst case, we have to process all possible divisors.\n\nBut given that the number of divisors is small (like up to around 10^5 for 1e9?), processing all of them is manageable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute d = |a - b|. If d is zero, return 0.\n\n- Generate all divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g in all divisors (sorted in any order), compute x = a + k, where k is such that x is a multiple of g and x >= a.\n\n- For each such x, compute the LCM of x and x +d. Keep track of the minimal LCM and the corresponding k.\n\nWait, but how do we efficiently generate all the divisors of d?\n\nYes, the standard way is to factorize d into its prime factors, then generate all possible products.\n\nFor example, factor d into primes, say d = p1^e1 * p2^e2 ... pn^en. Then the number of divisors is (e1+1)(e2+1)...(en+1). Each divisor can be generated by choosing exponents from 0 to e_i for each prime.\n\nSo the first thing is to write a function to get all the divisors of a number.\n\nOnce we have all the divisors, we can iterate through each, compute x as the smallest multiple of g >= a, compute the LCM, and track the minimal.\n\nBut wait, what about when x is very large? Like, suppose d is 1e9, and a is also 1e9. Then x would be 1e9 + something, but the LCM is (x)*(x+1)/1, which is x² +x. That's 1e18 or something, which is manageable as a computation, but we don't need to compute it for all g's, just track the minimal.\n\nWait, but for the code, we can precompute all the divisors, then for each, compute x, then the LCM, and compare.\n\nBut wait, for each divisor g, x is the smallest multiple of g >= a. So for example, if a is 6, d is 4, then g could be 4, 2, 1.\n\nWait, but for each g, x is a multiple of g, so x = ceil(a / g) * g.\n\nBut how do we handle the cases where a is a multiple of g? Then x is a.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nCompute d = abs(a - b)\n\nif d == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    compute all divisors of d\n\n    for each divisor g in the divisors:\n\n        x = ((a + g -1) // g ) * g\n\n        if x < a:  # but this shouldn't happen because of the division.\n\n            x += g\n\n        lcm_val = (x * (x + d)) // g\n\n        if lcm_val < current_min:\n\n            current_min = lcm_val\n\n            best_k = x - a\n\n        elif lcm_val == current_min:\n\n            if x < best_x:\n\n                best_k = x - a\n\n                best_x = x\n\n    after all g's, output best_k\n\nWait, but the initial best_k is None, and we track the minimal.\n\nBut wait, another approach is to collect all possible candidates and then select the one with the minimal LCM, and if tie, the smallest k.\n\nBut for the code, how to implement this.\n\nWait, but another point: for each g, the x is a multiple of g, but g is a divisor of d. So when we compute x, x is a + k, which is a multiple of g.\n\nSo, let's think about the code structure.\n\nIn Python, the steps would be:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute d = abs(a - b)\n\nIf d == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    generate all divisors of d.\n\n    Initialize variables:\n\n        min_lcm = infinity\n\n        best_k = 0\n\n    for each g in divisors:\n\n        x = ((a + g -1) // g) * g\n\n        # but x must be >= a. Since g is positive, (a + g -1) // g *g is >= a.\n\n        # compute y = x + d\n\n        lcm = (x * y) // gcd(x, y)\n\n        # but y = x +d, so d is known. So maybe we can compute the gcd(x, d) instead.\n\n        # Because y = x +d, so gcd(x, y) = gcd(x, d)\n\n        # So perhaps compute g_candidate = gcd(x, d), then lcm = (x * (x +d)) // g_candidate\n\n        # which is the same as before.\n\n        # but regardless, the calculation remains.\n\n        # Now, compare lcm to min_lcm.\n\n        if lcm < min_lcm:\n\n            min_lcm = lcm\n\n            best_k = x - a\n\n        elif lcm == min_lcm:\n\n            if (x - a) < best_k:\n\n                best_k = x -a\n\n    print(best_k)\n\nWait, but for the case where a is larger than b, d is still correct as the absolute difference.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the key steps are:\n\n1. Generate all divisors of d.\n\n2. For each divisor, compute x as the smallest multiple of g >= a.\n\n3. Compute the LCM of x and x +d.\n\n4. Track the minimal LCM and the corresponding k.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut first, we need a function to generate all the divisors of a number.\n\nHow to implement that.\n\nWell, the standard approach is to factorize d into primes, then generate all possible products.\n\nBut for d up to 1e9, trial division is feasible.\n\nSo, let's write a function to get the prime factors of d.\n\nOnce we have the factors, we can generate all divisors.\n\nLet me sketch the function.\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    if n == 0:\n\n        return []\n\n    factors = {}\n\n    i = 2\n\n    while i*i <=n:\n\n        while n%i ==0:\n\n            factors[i] = factors.get(i,0) +1\n\n            n = n//i\n\n        i +=1\n\n    if n>1:\n\n        factors[n] = 1\n\n    # now generate all divisors.\n\n    divisors = [1]\n\n    for p in factors:\n\n        exponents = [p**e for e in range(1, factors[p]+1)]\n\n        new_divisors = []\n\n        for d in divisors:\n\n            for e in exponents:\n\n                new_divisors.append(d * e)\n\n        divisors += new_divisors\n\n    # remove duplicates and sort.\n\n    divisors = list(set(divisors))\n\n    divisors.sort()\n\n    return divisors\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because the way I generate new_divisors is incorrect. It should multiply each existing divisor with each exponent.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is:\n\ndivisors starts as [1]\n\nfor each prime p with exponent e:\n\n    temp = []\n\n    for d in divisors:\n\n        for power in 0 to e:\n\n            temp.append( d * (p^power) )\n\n    divisors = temp\n\nNo, wait. Because for each prime, we can take any exponent from 0 to e.\n\nSo, for example, for factors {2:2,3:1}, the initial divisors is [1]. For 2, we can multiply by 2^0, 2^1, 2^2. So new divisors are 1*1, 1*2, 1*4. Then for 3, each of these is multiplied by 3^0 and 3^1. So 1,2,4 become 1,3,6, 2,6,12,4,12,24.\n\nWait, but in the code above, for each p, it's adding new_divisors as d * e, where e is p^1, p^2 etc. But that's not correct because it misses the exponents 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to, for each prime, generate all possible exponents and multiply with existing divisors.\n\nWait, here's a better approach:\n\nInitialize divisors as [1]\n\nfor each prime p in factors:\n\n    exponents = [p^k for k in 0 to factors[p]]\n\n    new_divisors = []\n\n    for d in divisors:\n\n        for e in exponents:\n\n            new_divisors.append(d * e)\n\n    divisors = new_divisors\n\nSo for each prime, you consider all possible exponents, including 0.\n\nThis way, after processing all primes, divisors contains all possible products.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nn=6, factors are 2^1, 3^1.\n\ndivisors starts as [1].\n\nProcess 2: exponents are 1 (2^0=1, 2^1=2).\n\nnew_divisors = [1*1, 1*2] → [1,2]\n\nProcess 3: exponents are 1 (3^0=1, 3^1=3).\n\nnew_divisors = [1*1, 1*3, 2*1, 2*3] → [1,3,2,6]\n\nSo the divisors are [1,3,2,6], but we should sort them.\n\nSo the code needs to be adjusted.\n\nBut in the function, perhaps I should implement this correctly.\n\nLet me adjust the function.\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    if n == 0:\n\n        return []\n\n    factors = {}\n\n    i = 2\n\n    while i * i <= n:\n\n        while n % i == 0:\n\n            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1\n\n            n = n // i\n\n        i += 1\n\n    if n > 1:\n\n        factors[n] = 1\n\n    # Generate all divisors.\n\n    divisors = [1]\n\n    for p in factors:\n\n        exponents = [p**e for e in range(factors[p] + 1)]\n\n        current_divisors = []\n\n        for d in divisors:\n\n            for exp in exponents:\n\n                current_divisors.append(d * exp)\n\n        divisors = current_divisors\n\n    # Remove duplicates and sort.\n\n    divisors = list(set(divisors))\n\n    divisors.sort()\n\n    return divisors\n\nWait, but in the code above, for each prime p, we generate all possible exponents and multiply by existing divisors. So for p=2, exponents are 1 and 2 (since factors[p]=1). So for each d in divisors, multiply by 1 and 2.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTesting for n=6:\n\nfactors are 2:1, 3:1.\n\ndivisors starts as [1].\n\nProcessing 2: exponents are 1 (2^0=1, 2^1=2).\n\ncurrent_divisors is [1*1, 1*2] → [1,2].\n\ndivisors becomes [1,2].\n\nProcessing 3: exponents are 1 and 3.\n\ncurrent_divisors is [1*1, 1*3, 2*1, 2*3] → [1,3,2,6].\n\ndivisors becomes [1,3,2,6].\n\nAfter dedup and sort: [1,2,3,6]. Correct.\n\nAnother test: n=4.\n\nfactors are 2:2.\n\ndivisors starts as [1].\n\nprocessing 2: exponents 1, 2, 4.\n\ncurrent_divisors: [1*1, 1*2, 1*4] → [1,2,4].\n\nSo divisors are [1,2,4]. Correct.\n\nAnother test: n=1.\n\nfactors is {1:1}.\n\ndivisors starts as [1].\n\nprocessing 1: exponents 1^0=1, 1^1=1.\n\ncurrent_divisors: [1*1, 1*1] → [1,1]. After dedup, it's [1].\n\nSo divisors is [1]. Correct.\n\nSo the function seems correct.\n\nNow, once we have the divisors, for each g in the divisors, compute x = a +k, where x is the smallest multiple of g >= a.\n\nWhich can be computed as x = ((a + g -1) // g) * g.\n\nBecause (a + g -1) // g is the ceiling of a/g. Multiplying by g gives the smallest multiple >=a.\n\nYes.\n\nThen, compute the LCM of x and x +d.\n\nBut since x and x +d have a difference of d, their GCD is the same as GCD(x, d). So the LCM is (x * (x +d)) // g_current, where g_current is the GCD(x, d).\n\nWait, but earlier, g was a divisor of d, so the GCD(x, d) could be a divisor of g. Or perhaps a multiple of g?\n\nNo, because x is a multiple of g. So x = mg. Since d is a multiple of g (because g is a divisor of d), then d = kg for some k.\n\nSo x and d are both multiples of g. So the GCD(x, d) must be a multiple of g.\n\nWait, but x is a multiple of g, and d is a multiple of g. So the GCD(x, d) is at least g.\n\nBut since x = m * g, and d = k * g, then GCD(x, d) = g * GCD(m, k).\n\nSo the GCD(x, d) is a multiple of g.\n\nWait, but that complicates things. Because in the code, when we compute the LCM, it's (x * (x +d)) / (GCD(x, d)).\n\nBut since x and d are both multiples of g, the GCD is at least g. So the LCM could be smaller than when using g as the GCD.\n\nWait, but in our approach, we're iterating over all possible divisors of d, and for each, compute x as the smallest multiple of g >=a. So for each g, the x is chosen as the smallest possible multiple of g >=a, which is the best x for that g.\n\nSo perhaps the code as outlined is correct.\n\nBut perhaps I should compute the actual GCD(x, d) each time to get the precise value.\n\nAlternatively, since d is fixed, and x is a multiple of g, which divides d, then the GCD(x, d) is g * GCD(m, d/g), where m = x/g.\n\nBut I'm not sure whether that helps.\n\nIn any case, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nBut let's think about the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 6 10.\n\nSo a=6, b=10. d=4.\n\ndivisors of 4 are 1,2,4.\n\nFor each g:\n\ng=4:\n\nx = ((6 +4-1)//4)*4 → (9//4)=2 → 2*4=8.\n\nx=8, y=8+4=12.\n\ngcd(8,12) is 4. So LCM is (8*12)/4=24.\n\ng=2:\n\nx = ((6+2-1)//2)*2 →7//2=3 → 3*2=6.\n\ny=6+4=10.\n\ngcd(6,10) is 2. LCM is 30.\n\ng=1:\n\nx = ((6+1-1)//1)*1 =6.\n\ny=6+4=10.\n\ngcd(6,10) is 2. So LCM is 30.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 24, achieved by g=4, x=8, k=2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: 21 31.\n\nd=10.\n\ndivisors of 10: 1,2,5,10.\n\nFor each g:\n\ng=10:\n\nx = ((21 +10-1)//10)*10 →30//10=3 → 3*10=30.\n\ny=40.\n\ngcd(30,40)=10. LCM= 1200.\n\ng=5:\n\nx= ((21 +5-1)//5)*5 →25//5=5 →5*5=25.\n\ny=35.\n\ngcd(25,35)=5. LCM= 175.\n\ng=2:\n\nx= ((21 +2-1)//2)*2 →22//2=11 →22.\n\ny=22+10=32.\n\ngcd(22,32)=2. LCM= 352.\n\ng=1:\n\nx=21.\n\ny=31.\n\ngcd(21,31)=1. LCM=651.\n\nSo the minimal is 175, achieved by g=5, x=25, k=4.\n\nBut wait, sample output is 9.\n\nWait, what's wrong here.\n\nWait, in the sample input 21 31, the output is 9.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the x for g=5.\n\nWait, a is 21, g is 5.\n\nSo x = ((21 +5-1)//5) *5 = (25//5)*5=5*5=25.\n\nBut 25 is 21+4. So k=4. But sample output is 9.\n\nWait, that suggests that my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, wait no, perhaps I made a mistake in the sample.\n\nWait, sample input is 21 31, output is 9.\n\nWait, wait, let's re-calculate.\n\nWait, for the case when a=21, b=31, d=10.\n\nThe code's approach is to find x = a +k, which is a multiple of a divisor g of d, and x >=a.\n\nSo for g=5:\n\nx = 25, which is a +4.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better g that gives a smaller LCM.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed other divisors.\n\nWait, divisors of 10 are 1,2,5,10.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate each case:\n\ng=10:\n\nx = ((21 +10-1) //10) *10 → (30//10)=3 → 30.\n\ny=40.\n\ngcd(30,40) is 10.\n\nlcm = (30*40)/10 = 1200.\n\ng=5:\n\nx=25.\n\ny=35.\n\ngcd(25,35)=5.\n\nlcm= (25*35)/5= 175.\n\ng=2:\n\nx=22.\n\ny=32.\n\ngcd(22,32)=2.\n\nlcm= (22*32)/2= 352.\n\ng=1:\n\nx=21.\n\ny=31.\n\ngcd=1.\n\nlcm=21*31=651.\n\nSo the minimal is 175, achieved by k=4.\n\nBut sample output is 9. So something's wrong.\n\nWait, but the sample output is 9. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, what's happening here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some divisors.\n\nWait, 10's divisors are 1,2,5,10. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should also consider the case where k is 9, which makes a+k = 30, b+k=40. Which is the same as when g=10, x=30, which is k=9.\n\nWait, wait, in that case, the LCM is 1200, which is worse than 175.\n\nSo why is the sample output 9?\n\nWait, the sample output says for input 21 31, the output is 9.\n\nBut according to my calculations, the optimal k is 4, which leads to x=25, y=35, lcm 175.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, let's look back.\n\nSample Input 2 is ['21 31', ... ].\n\nSample Output is ['9'].\n\nSo for a=21, b=31, the optimal k is 9.\n\nWait, but according to my calculations, that's not correct.\n\nSo perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says that x = a +k and y = b +k.\n\nSo for a=21, b=31, k=9: x=30, y=40.\n\nTheir LCM is 1200.\n\nBut for k=4, x=25, y=35. Their LCM is 175.\n\nWhich is better.\n\nSo why is the sample output 9?\n\nHmm, perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal k is when the LCM is minimal, but the way to achieve that is not via the maximum possible g.\n\nSo perhaps the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, what's the correct answer for a=21, b=31?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the LCM.\n\nWait, when x=25, y=35:\n\ngcd(25,35) is 5.\n\nSo LCM is (25 *35)/5 = 175.\n\nWhen x=30, y=40: gcd(30,40)=10. LCM is (30*40)/10=1200.\n\nBut 175 is less than 1200.\n\nSo why is the sample output 9?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong sample.\n\nWait, the sample inputs are:\n\n['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n\nAnd the outputs are ['2', '9', '0'].\n\nSo for the second input, the output is 9.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the LCM for k=9.\n\nx=30, y=40.\n\ngcd(30,40)=10.\n\nSo LCM is 30*40 /10= 1200.\n\nWhat's the minimal possible LCM?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a better k.\n\nWhat about k=14?\n\nx=35, y=45.\n\ngcd(35,45)=5.\n\nlcm= (35 *45)/5 = 315.\n\nThat's worse than 175.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that x=25 is allowed.\n\nWait, wait, a=21, k=4: x=25, which is greater than 21. So that's valid.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 175, achieved when k=4.\n\nSo why is the sample output 9?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not about the minimal LCM, but about the minimal possible sum of a +k and b +k.\n\nWait, but the problem clearly states it's the LCM that must be minimal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing some possible divisors.\n\nWait, let's see. For d=10, the divisors are 1,2,5,10.\n\nBut perhaps I should also consider the case where x is a +k, and the difference between x and y is d, but the GCD(x, y) is larger than any divisor of d.\n\nWait, but that's impossible because the GCD(x, y) must divide d.\n\nBecause y = x +d, so any common divisor of x and y must also divide d.\n\nSo, for example, if x and y share a common divisor g, then g divides d.\n\nThus, the approach of considering all divisors of d is correct.\n\nBut then why is the sample output 9?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some other possible g.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is correct, but in the sample input, the correct k is 9, but according to my analysis, it's not.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should re-examine the sample.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is not the second input, but another.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\n['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n\nSample outputs are ['2', '9', '0'].\n\nSo for the second input, 21 31, the output is 9.\n\nSo what's the reasoning for k=9.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way x is computed.\n\nWait, for the second input, a=21, b=31, d=10.\n\nLooking for x >=21, x is a multiple of a divisor g of 10.\n\nSo let's try all possible g's.\n\ng=10:\n\nx = ((21 +10-1)//10)*10 = (30//10)*10 = 3*10=30. k=9.\n\ng=5:\n\nx= ((21 +5-1)//5)*5 →25//5=5 →5*5=25. k=4.\n\ng=2:\n\nx= ((21+2-1)//2)*2 →22//2=11 →11*2=22. k=1.\n\ng=1:\n\nx=21 →k=0.\n\nCompute for each x:\n\nx=30, y=40: LCM=1200.\n\nx=25, y=35: LCM=175.\n\nx=22, y=32: LCM=352.\n\nx=21, y=31: LCM=651.\n\nSo the minimal is 175, achieved at k=4.\n\nBut sample output is 9.\n\nHmm, this suggests that either the sample is wrong, or I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm reading the sample input incorrectly.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n\nOutput:\n\n['2', '9', '0']\n\nSo for the second input, 21 31, the output is 9.\n\nBut according to my analysis, k=4 is better.\n\nSo perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the LCM for x=30 and x=25.\n\nWait, 25 and 35: 25 is 5^2, 35 is 5*7. So LCM is 5^2 *7=175.\n\n30 and 40: 30 is 2*3*5, 40 is 2^3*5. So LCM is 2^3 *3 *5 = 120.\n\nWait, wait, wait! Oh! No, that's different.\n\nWait, 30 and 40.\n\n30 *40 = 1200.\n\ngcd(30,40) is 10.\n\nSo LCM is 1200/10 = 120.\n\nWait, 120 is less than 175.\n\nOh! So that's why for x=30, the LCM is 120, which is better than 175.\n\nSo I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nSo, let's recalculate:\n\nFor x=30, y=40.\n\ngcd(30,40) is 10.\n\nSo LCM is (30*40)/10 = 1200 /10= 120.\n\nWhich is 120.\n\nWhich is smaller than 175.\n\nSo, for g=10, x=30, the LCM is 120.\n\nWhich is better than the previous options.\n\nSo, in that case, the code's approach of considering all divisors is correct.\n\nSo, for the second sample, the minimal LCM is 120, achieved when g=10, x=30, k=9.\n\nWhich is the sample output.\n\nSo I must have made a mistake in my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that x=30 gives LCM 1200, but that's wrong. Because 30 and 40 have a GCD of 10, so their LCM is (30*40)/10=120.\n\nWhich is indeed smaller than 175.\n\nSo, that explains why the sample output is 9.\n\nSo my earlier mistake was that I forgot that the GCD is 10, not 5.\n\nThus, the code's approach is correct.\n\nSo the code needs to correctly compute the GCD(x, d), but since d is 10, and x is 30, which is a multiple of 10, the GCD(x, d) is 10.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code proceeds as described.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: a = b.\n\nThen d=0.\n\nSo the LCM of a +k and b +k is a +k. So to minimize, k=0.\n\nCase 2: a=1, b=1e9.\n\nd=999,999,999.\n\nWe need to find the best g, which is a divisor of d, and x is the smallest multiple >=a.\n\nBut for such a large d, the code may have to process a lot of divisors, but it's manageable.\n\nAnother edge case: a=5, b=10.\n\nd=5.\n\ndivisors are 1,5.\n\nFor g=5:\n\nx=5.\n\ny=10.\n\ngcd(5,5) is 5.\n\nlcm= (5*10)/5=10.\n\nWhich is better than g=1, which gives x=5, y=10, same as above.\n\nSo k=0.\n\nWhich is the sample's third case.\n\nThus, the code handles that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the plan is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut now, to code it.\n\nThe code outline is:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute d = abs(a - b).\n\nif d ==0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    generate all divisors of d.\n\n    for each divisor g in the divisors:\n\n        x = ((a +g -1) //g ) *g\n\n        lcm = (x * (x +d)) // gcd(x, d)\n\n        track the minimal lcm and the corresponding k.\n\n    finally, print the k.\n\nBut in Python, we can use math.gcd.\n\nBut note that for x=0, but in this case, a is at least 1, and d is at least 1, so x is at least a >=1.\n\nWait, no, a can be 1, and k can be 0, making x=1.\n\nBut no, a is >=1, and d is >=1.\n\nThus, x is always >= a >=1.\n\nThus, no issues with x being zero.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement the function get_divisors as above.\n\nBut in Python, for handling very large numbers, it's efficient.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nImport math.\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute d.\n\nif d is zero, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nGenerate all divisors.\n\nfor each g in divisors:\n\n    x = ((a +g -1) //g ) *g\n\n    y = x +d\n\n    current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n\n    current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n\n    compare to min_lcm.\n\ntrack the minimal.\n\nFinally, output k.\n\nNow, let's code it.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the way to generate the divisors is as per the function.\n\nBut in Python, for the function get_divisors(n), returns a sorted list.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    factors = {}\n    temp = n\n    i = 2\n    while i * i <= temp:\n        while temp % i == 0:\n            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1\n            temp = temp // i\n        i += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = 1\n    # Generate all divisors.\n    divisors = [1]\n    for p in factors:\n        exponents = [p**e for e in range(factors[p] + 1)]\n        current_divisors = []\n        for d in divisors:\n            for exp in exponents:\n                current_divisors.append(d * exp)\n        divisors = current_divisors\n    # Remove duplicates and sort.\n    divisors = list(set(divisors))\n    divisors.sort()\n    return divisors\n\na, b = map(int, input().",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find a non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized.

This difference is crucial because the LCM of two numbers is influenced by their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n   - The key insight is that the GCD of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) must be a divisor of \\( d \\). Therefore, to minimize the LCM, we should maximize this GCD.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), compute the smallest \\( x \\) (where \\( x = a + k \\)) that is a multiple of \\( g \\) and greater than or equal to \\( a \\).\n   - Calculate the LCM for each such \\( x \\) and track the minimum LCM along with the corresponding \\( k \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute all divisors of \\( d \\).\n   - For each divisor \\( g \\), determine the smallest multiple of \\( g \\) that is greater than or equal to \\( a \\).\n   - Calculate the LCM for each valid \\( x \\) and keep track of the minimum LCM and the corresponding \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Considerations**:\n   - Generating divisors of \\( d \\) is efficient because the number of divisors grows at most as \\( O(\\sqrt{d}) \\).\n   - Each divisor check involves simple arithmetic operations, making the solution efficient even for large values of \\( d \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    factors = {}\n    temp = n\n    i = 2\n    while i * i <= temp:\n        while temp % i == 0:\n            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1\n            temp = temp // i\n        i += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = 1\n    # Generate all divisors.\n    divisors = [1]\n    for p in factors:\n        exponents = [p**e for e in range(factors[p] + 1)]\n        current_divisors = []\n        for d in divisors:\n            for exp in exponents:\n                current_divisors.append(d * exp)\n        divisors = current_divisors\n    # Remove duplicates and sort.\n    divisors = list(set(divisors))\n    divisors.sort()\n    return divisors\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nd = abs(a - b)\n\nif d == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n    for g in divisors:\n        x = ((a + g - 1) // g) * g\n        y = x + d\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = x - a\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n            if (x - a) < best_k:\n                best_k = x - a\n    print(best_k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n- **Compute Difference**: Calculate \\( d \\) as the absolute difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n- **Generate Divisors**: If \\( d \\) is zero, print 0 immediately since \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\).
