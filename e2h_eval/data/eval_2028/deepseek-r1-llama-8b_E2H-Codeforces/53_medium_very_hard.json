    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The task is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about the examples they gave. For 'abcd', the output is 0 because all substrings are unique. For 'ababa', the output is 3. Oh right, because 'aba' appears twice, overlapping in the middle. And for 'zzz', the output is 2 because 'zz' occurs twice, but not 'zzz'.\n\nSo how do I approach this? I need to check all possible substrings and find the maximum length where at least two occurrences exist.\n\nFirst, I should consider all possible substring lengths starting from the largest possible down to 1. For each length l, I check every possible substring of that length and see if it appears more than once. Once I find the maximum l where this is true, I can return it.\n\nBut wait, checking all possible substrings for each length might be time-consuming, but since the maximum string length is 100, it's manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over possible substring lengths l, starting from the maximum possible (length of string - 1) down to 1.\n2. For each l, generate all possible substrings of length l.\n3. Use a set to keep track of seen substrings. If a substring is added to the set again, we have a duplicate.\n4. As soon as for a particular l, any substring is found to appear more than once, return l as the answer.\n5. If no such l is found (which shouldn't happen because for l=0, it's always true), return 0.\n\nWait, but for l=0, the substring is empty, which technically appears infinitely many times, but the problem says the string is non-empty, so maybe the minimum is 1 or 0? Looking at the sample input, the first case returns 0, which suggests that when there are no substrings repeating, the output is 0.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For l from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n   - For each i from 0 to len(s)-l:\n      - Take the substring s[i:i+l]\n      - Check if this substring has appeared before\n      - If yes, return l as the answer\n   - If after checking all i for this l, no duplicates found, proceed to l-1.\n\nBut wait, for some cases, the maximum possible l could be len(s)-1. Like in the second example, 'ababa' has length 5. The maximum l is 3, which is 5-2=3. So the loop starts from len(s)-1 and goes down.\n\nSo the code structure would be something like:\n\nmax_len = 0\nfor l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            return l\n        seen.add(substr)\nreturn max_len\n\nWait, but for each l, we're generating all possible substrings and checking if any have been seen before. But this way, for a particular l, as soon as we find a duplicate, we can return immediately, which is efficient.\n\nBut let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 'abcd'\nLoop starts with l=3:\nCheck substrings 'abc', 'bcd'. Both are new. Then l=2: 'ab','bc','cd'—all new. l=1: 'a','b','c','d'—all new. So returns 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' (length 5)\nl=4:\nsubstrings 'abab', 'baba' — both new.\nl=3:\ni=0: 'aba' → add to seen.\ni=1: 'bab' → add.\ni=2: 'aba' → already in seen. So return 3.\n\nSample3: 'zzz' (length 3)\nl=2:\nsubstrings 'zz', 'zz' → both same. So return 2.\n\nYes, that seems to work.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where the entire string is the same character, e.g., 'aaaaa' → the maximum l is 4, since 'aaaa' appears twice (positions 0-3 and 1-4). Or wait, 'aaaaa' has length 5. The maximum l is 4: 'aaaa' occurs at positions 0 and 1.\n\nAnother case: 'ababab' → maximum l is 4. Because substrings 'abab' appear at 0 and 2.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's compute:\n\nFor l=5, substrings 'ababa' and 'babab' → different.\nl=4: 'abab', 'baba', 'abab' → 'abab' appears twice, so return 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcdeabcde' → the maximum l is 5 because 'abcde' appears twice.\n\nWait, but also, 'abcdeabcde' has multiple overlapping substrings. So the code should find l=5.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe steps are:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nIf the string is empty, return 0. But according to the problem statement, the string is non-empty.\n\nThen, for l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n   create a set to track seen substrings.\n\n   loop i from 0 to len(s)-l:\n\n       substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n       if substr is in seen: return l\n\n       add to seen.\n\nIf no l found, return 0.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\nWait, for example, len(s) is 3. len(s)-1 is 2, so l will be 2, then 1.\n\nIn the first iteration, l=2: i can be 0 and 1.\n\nWait, for a string of length 3, for l=2, the possible i's are 0 and 1, giving substrings 0-2 and 1-3, but 1-3 is beyond the string. Wait, no, in Python, s[i:i+l], if i+l exceeds, it just takes up to the end. So in the code, i runs from 0 to len(s)-l inclusive.\n\nWait, for i in range(len(s) - l + 1). Because for l=2 and s of length 3: len(s)-l is 1, so i can be 0 and 1.\n\ns[0:2] is characters 0 and 1.\n\ns[1:3] is characters 1 and 2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code should correctly handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, for l=0, the loop doesn't run. So the initial max_len is 0, but in cases where the entire string has no repeating substrings, the code correctly returns 0.\n\nWait, no: in the code, for each l from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\nif for any l, a duplicate is found, returns l.\n\nIf none are found, after all l's, returns 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead the string.\n\nFor l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n   seen = set()\n\n   for i in range(len(s) - l + 1):\n\n       substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n       if substr in seen:\n\n           print(l)\n\n           exit\n\n       seen.add(substr)\n\nAfter all loops, print(0).\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 'abcd'\n\nl=3: i runs 0,1 → substrings 'abc', 'bcd' → no duplicates.\n\nl=2: i runs 0,1,2 → 'ab','bc','cd' → no.\n\nl=1: i runs 0,1,2,3 → 'a','b','c','d' → no. So output 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa'\n\nl=4: substrings 'abab' and 'baba' → no.\n\nl=3:\n\ni=0 → 'aba' added.\n\ni=1 → 'bab' added.\n\ni=2 → 'aba' → found in seen. So return 3.\n\nSample3: 'zzz'\n\nl=2:\n\ni=0 → 'zz' added.\n\ni=1 → 'zz' → found. Return 2.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa'.\n\nl=4:\n\ni=0 → 'aaaa' added.\n\ni=1 → 'aaaa' → found. So return 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcabc'.\n\nl=5: 'abcab' and 'bcabc' → no.\n\nl=4: 'abca', 'bcab' → no.\n\nl=3: 'abc' → i=0, added.\n\ni=3: 'abc' → found. So return 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nNow, in Python, the code would read the string from stdin, then process as above.\n\nWait, but the input is provided as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but in the actual problem, the input is a single string per line. So in the code, we need to read the input as a single line, stripping any whitespace.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but in Python, 'exit()' can be done via returning or breaking out, but in code golf, using 'print' and then break.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written with a function.\n\nBut for the problem, the code needs to read from stdin and write to stdout, without any extra outputs.\n\nSo, in the code, the function can be written as:\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\n\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but in Python, 'exit()' is not standard in functions. Oh right, in a script, you can't call exit() unless you import sys and use sys.exit(). Because in a script, the function exit() may not be available.\n\nWait, in Python, the built-in function 'exit()' may not be the best way. Instead, perhaps we can return, but since it's a script, perhaps it's better to use 'sys.exit()'.\n\nSo, the code needs to import sys.\n\nThus, the corrected code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ns = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nn = len(s)\n\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            sys.exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n\nYes.\n\nWait, but sometimes the input may have leading or trailing spaces. So using .strip() is correct.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd' → Output 0.\n\nSample Input 2: 'ababa' → Output 3.\n\nSample Input 3: 'zzz' → Output 2.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaabb' → what's the maximum l?\n\nLooking for l=6: 'aabbaa' and 'bbaabb' → no.\n\nl=5: 'aabba', 'bbaab' → no.\n\nl=4: 'aabb', 'bbaa', 'aabb' → 'aabb' appears twice. So output is 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcabca' → l=5: 'abcabc' and 'bcabca' → no.\n\nl=4: 'abca', 'bcab', 'cabca' → no.\n\nl=3: 'abc', 'bca', 'cab', 'abc' → 'abc' appears at i=0 and i=4. So returns 3.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nI think this should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given a string and need to determine the length of its longest substring that appears at least twice. This substring can overlap itself within the string.\n2. **Intuition**: The approach involves checking all possible substrings starting from the longest possible down to the shortest. For each length, we check every possible substring and see if it appears more than once.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a set to keep track of seen substrings. By iterating from the longest possible substring length down to 1, we can efficiently determine the maximum length where a substring repeats.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^3) in the worst case, which is manageable given the problem constraints (string length up to 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ns = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nn = len(s)\n\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            sys.exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Iterate Over Lengths**: We start checking from the longest possible substring length down to 1.\n3. **Check Substrings**: For each length, we generate all possible substrings and use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is found in the set, we print the current length and exit.\n4. **Output Result**: If no repeating substring is found after checking all lengths, we print 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring by leveraging the properties of sets for quick lookups and maintaining optimal performance within the problem constraints.",
