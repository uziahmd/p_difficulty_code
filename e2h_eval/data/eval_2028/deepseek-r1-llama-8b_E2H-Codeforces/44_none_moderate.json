He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

It first initializes a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum total profit that can be achieved with `i` days and the first `j` problems. Then it iterates over each problem and each possible number of days, updating `dp[i][j]` with the maximum of its current value and the maximum total profit that can be achieved with `i - 1` days and the first `j - 1` problems plus the difficulty of the current problem.\n\nAfter filling up the `dp` array, it backtracks to find the distribution of problems between days that achieves the maximum total profit. It keeps track of the starting index of each day by checking when the maximum total profit changes.\n\nFinally, it prints the maximum total profit and the distribution of problems between days.",
