    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the question carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate that's divided into w rows and h columns of cells. We have k rings to gild. Each ring is like a border around a rectangle that's getting smaller each time.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. The first ring is the outermost edge. The second ring is two cells in from that, and so on for k rings. Each ring has a width of one cell.\n\nWait, what's the formula for the number of cells in each ring? For a rectangle of size m x n, the perimeter is 2*(m + n - 2), because you subtract the four corners which are counted twice if you just do 2m+2n.\n\nSo for each ring i, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Because each ring reduces the width and height by 4 each step—subtracting 2 from each side (left and right) twice for each ring.\n\nSo the area for each ring i is calculated as the perimeter of this rectangle. Then, we sum this for all i from 1 to k.\n\nLet me think about how to compute this.\n\nFor each ring i:\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\nperimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\nsum += perimeter\n\nSo the total is the sum of perimeters for each of the k rings.\n\nBut wait, what if after some rings, the current_w or current_h becomes less than or equal to zero? Oh, but according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's valid. So we don't have to worry about invalid cases.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read w, h, k.\n2. Initialize a total variable to 0.\n3. For each i in 1..k:\n   a. Compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n   c. Compute perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n   d. Add perimeter to total.\n4. Output total.\n\nLet's test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1\ncurrent_w =3, current_h=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2)= 2*4=8. Output is 8. Correct.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1\ncurrent_w=7, current_h=9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2)= 2*(14)=28. Correct.\n\nThird example:7 9 2\nFirst ring:7x9 → perimeter 28.\nSecond ring:7-4=3, 9-4=5. 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: say w=5, h=5, k=2.\n\nFirst ring:5x5 → perimeter 2*(5+5-2)=16.\nSecond ring:5-4=1, 5-4=1. So 1x1. Perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 0? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no: 1x1 is a single cell. But the perimeter for 1x1 would be 4, because it's all four sides but each is one cell. Or wait, no: 1 row, 1 column: the perimeter is 4 cells (each of the four edges, each of length 1). So 2*(1 + 1 -2) = 0? That's not correct.\n\nWait, maybe my formula is wrong for small rectangles.\n\nWait, the formula for the perimeter is 2*(width + height - 2). So for a 1x1 rectangle, that gives 2*(1+1-2)=0. But that's incorrect because a 1x1 has 4 cells.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is only applicable when the rectangle is at least 2x2? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.\n\nWait, looking back: the problem says each ring is formed by the bordering cells on the inner rectangle. For i=1, it's the outer rectangle. For each subsequent i, the inner rectangle is 2 cells away on each side. So for the second ring, the rectangle is (w-4, h-4).\n\nWait, so for a 3x3 rectangle, the next ring would be 3-4= -1. Which doesn't make sense. But in the problem statement, k is constrained such that it's valid. So perhaps the formula is correct, but when the rectangle is 1x1, the perimeter is zero, but that's not possible. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should be applied only when current_w >= 2 and current_h >=2. Otherwise, the perimeter is zero. Because for 1x1, there's nothing to add.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the third sample input is 7x9, k=2. The second ring is 3x5, which is 3 rows, 5 columns. So the perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 12, which is correct.\n\nSo perhaps the formula is correct, but when the rectangle is 1x1, the perimeter is 4. Wait, no, because 1+1-2=0, 2*0=0. So that suggests that 1x1 contributes zero cells, which is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula isn't suitable for 1x1. Maybe the way to calculate the perimeter is different.\n\nAlternative approach: for a given current_w and current_h, the perimeter is 2*(w + h - 2) if both w and h are at least 2. Else, if one is 1 and the other is larger, then the perimeter is 2*(max(w,h) + min(w,h) - 2). Wait, but for 1x1, that's 2*(1 +1 -2)=0 again.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeter is computed as follows: for a rectangle, the number of cells in the perimeter is 2*(w + h - 2) if both are >=2. If either is 1, then it's 2*max(w,h) - 4, because one of the sides will have one cell and the other will have one cell, but subtracting the overlapping corners.\n\nWait, let's think for 1x2 rectangle: it's a straight line of 2 cells. The perimeter would be 2*(1+2-2) = 2*(1)=2. Which is correct.\n\nWait, 1x2: perimeter is 2 cells (top and bottom, each of 2 cells? No, wait: 1 row and 2 columns. The perimeter is the top row (2 cells) plus the bottom row (another 2 cells?), but that's double counting. Or wait, perhaps the correct way is to count all four sides.\n\nWait, no, for a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the perimeter is 2*(m + n - 2) because the four corners are each counted once. So for 1x2, it's 2*(1 + 2 - 2) = 2*(1) = 2. Which makes sense: the two cells.\n\nSo for a 1x1 rectangle, the perimeter is 2*(1+1-2)=0. But that's wrong because a single cell has four edges, so it's 4 cells. So perhaps the formula is only applicable for rectangles where both width and height are at least 2.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the formula is correct for normal cases but fails for 1x1. But according to the problem statement, k is chosen such that the inner rectangle is valid. So perhaps in the problem, the inner rectangles for the rings are always such that their width and height are at least 2. Or perhaps not.\n\nWait, the problem says that for each i, the inner rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for i=1, it's w × h. For i=2, w-4, h-4. And so on.\n\nSo for example, if w=5, h=5, and k=2: the first ring is 5x5, perimeter is 2*(5+5-2)= 16. The second ring is 1x1. So according to the problem statement, does that mean we should include it? Or is the formula such that when the rectangle is 1x1, it contributes 4 cells?\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the i-th ring is formed by the bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w-4(i-1))×(h-4(i-1)). So if that rectangle is 1x1, then the ring is all the cells on that rectangle, which is 1 cell. So how many cells? 1? But that seems contradictory because the perimeter is 4 for a 1x1 cell.\n\nWait, perhaps the ring is considered as the perimeter of the rectangle, but when the rectangle is 1x1, it's just one cell. So the perimeter is 4, but in reality, it's one cell. So this suggests that the formula is not applicable for 1x1. So I need to find a way to handle that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula works correctly, but for 1x1, the perimeter is 4, but in reality, the ring is just 1 cell. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, but let's look back at the problem statement's sample input:\n\nIn the third example, 7 9 2:\n\nThe second ring is 3x5. So 3 rows, 5 columns.\n\nThe perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 12. Which is correct.\n\nIf I have a 3x3, the perimeter is 8, which is correct.\n\nSo perhaps the formula works for any rectangle except 1x1. So for 1x1, perhaps the ring is 4 cells.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that the i-th ring consists of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle. So for 1x1, the inner rectangle is 1 cell, so the ring is that one cell. So the number of cells is 1.\n\nBut according to the formula, 2*(1+1-2) = 0. So that's a discrepancy.\n\nSo how to handle this case.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but when the current_w or current_h is 1, the perimeter is 2*(current_w + current_h) instead of 2*(current_w + current_h -2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be:\n\nif current_w == 1 and current_h == 1:\n    perimeter = 1\nelif current_w ==1:\n    perimeter = current_h\nelif current_h ==1:\n    perimeter = current_w\nelse:\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h -2)\n\nWait, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that the inner rectangles are at least 2x2. Let me see.\n\nIn the problem statement, the constraints on k are: k ≤ floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 )\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor example, if w=3, h=3, min is 3, (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1.\n\nIf w=7, h=9: min is7, (7+1)/4=2. So k can be 2.\n\nSo for each ring i, the current_w =w-4*(i-1) and current_h=h-4*(i-1).\n\nWe need current_w and current_h to be ≥1.\n\nBecause for k rings, the inner rectangle is (w -4(k-1)) × (h-4(k-1)).\n\nBut since k is bounded by floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ), then:\n\nfor i=1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w =w -4*(i-1) ≥ w -4*(k-1) ≥ w -4*( (min(w, h)+1)/4 -1 )\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think with an example.\n\nSuppose w=5, h=5: min is 5. (5+1)/4=1.5, floor is 1. So k can be up to 1.\n\nSo the maximum k is 1.\n\nSo for i=1: current_w=5, current_h=5. So perimeter is 16.\n\nThus, the problem's constraints prevent the current_w and current_h from becoming 1 or less, except possibly when i exceeds k.\n\nWait, but when the problem says k is the number of rings, and for each i from 1 to k, the current_w and current_h must be at least 1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe maximum possible k is floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). So for w=5, h=5, min is 5, (5+1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can be 1.\n\nThus, current_w for i=1 is 5, which is okay.\n\nWhat about w=7, h=9, k=2. As in the third sample.\n\ncurrent_w=7-4*(2-1)=3, current_h=9-4*(2-1)=5. Both are ≥2, so perimeter is 2*(3+5-2)= 12.\n\nSo in the problem, for all i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 2.\n\nWait, is that true?\n\nWait, let's see: the maximum k is floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 )\n\nSo for a rectangle where min(w, h) is 1, but that's impossible because the initial condition is w and h ≥3.\n\nWait, the input constraints are w and h ≥3, and k is such that it's valid.\n\nSo for all i from 1 to k, current_w and current_h are ≥3-4*(i-1) for i=1, but wait, no.\n\nWait, for i=1: current_w=w, current_h=h.\n\nFor i=2: current_w=w-4, current_h=h-4.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo for the maximum k allowed, let's see:\n\nmax_k = floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 )\n\nThen, for i=1 to max_k, current_w =w -4*(i-1) ≥ w -4*(max_k-1) ?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's take an example.\n\nSuppose w=9, h=13. min(w, h)=9. (9+1)/4=2.5, so floor is 2. So max_k=2.\n\nFor i=2: current_w=9-4=5, current_h=13-4=9. Both are ≥2.\n\nSo the perimeter is 2*(5+9-2)= 24.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nAnother example: w=4, h=4. min is4. (4+1)/4=1.25 → max_k=1.\n\ni=1: current_w=4, current_h=4. perimeter 2*(4+4-2)= 12.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: w=5, h=5. min is5. (5+1)/4=1.5 → max_k=1.\n\ni=1:5x5, perimeter 16.\n\nSo in all these cases, for i up to k, current_w and current_h are at least 2.\n\nWait, is that always the case?\n\nLet's suppose w=3, h=3. min is3. (3+1)/4=1, so k can be 1.\n\ni=1:3x3. perimeter 8.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, what about w=3, h=7. min is3.\n\nmax_k = (3+1)/4=1.\n\ni=1:3x7. perimeter is 2*(3+7-2)= 2*8=16.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when min(w, h) is 8. So (8+1)/4=2.25 → max_k=2.\n\nFor i=2: current_w=8-4=4, current_h=... Well, depends on h.\n\nSo current_w is 4, current_h is 8-4=4 (if h was 8). So 4x4, perimeter 12.\n\nWhich is okay.\n\nSo it seems that for all i up to k, current_w and current_h are ≥2. Because the maximum k is floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ), so for i=k, current_w =w-4(k-1) ≥ w -4*(floor((min+1)/4) -1). Let's see:\n\nLet min = m.\n\nmax_k = floor( (m+1)/4 )\n\nWe need to ensure that for i = max_k, current_w and current_h are ≥2.\n\nIs that true?\n\nLet's consider m=5.\n\nmax_k= (5+1)/4=1.5 → 1.\n\ni=1: current_w=5, current_h= ... Suppose h is 5.\n\ncurrent_w=5, current_h=5. So perimeter is 16.\n\nBut for i=2, which is beyond max_k, current_w=1, which is invalid.\n\nBut in our code, since k is limited to max_k, i won't go beyond that.\n\nSo in the code, for i from 1 to k, current_w and current_h will always be ≥2. Because the max_k is chosen such that even for i=k, current_w and current_h are ≥2.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nSuppose m=4. (4+1)/4=1.25 → max_k=1.\n\ncurrent_w =4, current_h=4. So i=1, current_w is 4, which is ≥2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: m=7.\n\n(7+1)/4=2 → max_k=2.\n\nFor i=2: current_w=7-4*(2-1)=3, current_h=7-4*(2-1)=3.\n\n3≥2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for all i from 1 to k, current_w and current_h are ≥2. So the formula 2*(current_w + current_h -2) will correctly calculate the perimeter for each ring.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total=0.\n\nFor i in 1..k:\n\nCompute current_w = w -4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h -2)\n\nAdd perimeter to total.\n\nPrint total.\n\nSo let's implement this.\n\nNow, in Python, the code would be straightforward.\n\nRead the input as a single line, split into w, h, k.\n\nConvert them to integers.\n\nInitialize total =0.\n\nLoop for i in range(1, k+1):\n\ncompute current_w and current_h.\n\nadd the perimeter.\n\nFinally, print the total.\n\nTesting this with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 3 3 1\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_w=3, current_h=3.\n\nperimeter=2*(3+3-2)= 8. Sum is 8.\n\nOutput:8.\n\nSample 2:\n\n7 9 1 → 28.\n\nSample3:7 9 2.\n\ni=1:28.\n\ni=2: 3x5 → 2*(3+5-2)= 12. Sum 40.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 5 5 1.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(5+5-2)= 16. So output 16.\n\nAnother test case:5 5 2.\n\nBut wait, max_k is floor( (5+1)/4 )=1. So k cannot be 2. So the problem ensures that the input k is valid.\n\nSo in code, we don't have to worry about i going beyond the allowed k.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo now, write the code.\n\nRead the input as a single line, split into three integers.\n\nCompute the sum as described.\n\nPrint the sum as an integer.\n\nThe code:\n\nRead line from stdin.\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal =0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    cw = w -4*(i-1)\n\n    ch = h -4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(cw + ch -2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nNow, testing it with the samples.\n\nSample 1: 3 3 1 → 8.\n\nSample2:7 9 1 →28.\n\nSample3:7 9 2→40.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case: 5 5 1 →16.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test:7 9 3? But wait, according to the problem statement, k is constrained.\n\nLet's compute max_k for 7x9: min(7,9)=7. (7+1)/4=2 → max_k=2.\n\nSo for k=3, the code may not be called, as per problem statement. So the code doesn't need to handle it.\n\nThus, the code should work correctly.\n",
