Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Amusing Joke\" and from the description, it sounds like we need to determine if a pile of letters can be rearranged to form the guest's name and the host's name without any extra letters. Hmm.\n\nSo the input consists of three lines: the first is the guest's name, the second is the host's name, and the third is the pile of letters found. We need to check if combining the letters of the guest and host names gives exactly the pile, with no extras.\n\nRight, so the approach here is to compare the combined letters of the two names with the letters in the pile. If they match exactly in terms of frequency, then output YES; otherwise, NO.\n\nHow do I do that? Well, one way is to count the frequency of each character in the guest and host names, combine them, and then compare with the frequency of the pile.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Read the three input lines.\n2. Concatenate the first two strings (guest + host) into one string.\n3. Count the frequency of each character in this concatenated string.\n4. Do the same for the pile string.\n5. Compare the two frequency dictionaries. If they are identical, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but how to handle the case where the lengths don't match? Oh right, because if the total number of characters in guest and host is not equal to the pile, then it's immediately a NO. So maybe before even counting, we can check the length.\n\nYes, that's a good point. So step 0: check if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, return NO.\n\nOtherwise, proceed to count the letters.\n\nIn Python, how do I count the frequency? Well, the collections.Counter class is perfect for this. It creates a dictionary-like object where the keys are the characters and the values are their counts.\n\nSo, let's outline the code:\n\n- Read the three lines: guest = input().strip(), host = input().strip(), pile = input().strip()\n- combined = guest + host\n- if len(combined) != len(pile): print 'NO' and exit.\n- create counter_combined = Counter(combined)\n- create counter_pile = Counter(pile)\n- if counter_combined == counter_pile: print 'YES' else 'NO'\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but wait: what about cases where there are more letters in the pile than needed? For example, if the combined has fewer 'A's than the pile. The Counter will naturally account for that because it counts occurrences.\n\nTesting the example given:\n\nFirst sample input:\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\nHost: DEDMOROZ\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ → let's see, the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Hmm, but the order doesn't matter as we're just counting letters.\n\nSo the combined length should be equal to the pile's length. Let me check: len(guest) is 10, len(host) is 8, so combined is 18. Pile's length is also 18. Then, the counters should match.\n\nIn the second sample, the guest and host have a combined length, and the pile's length is different? Or perhaps the letters don't match.\n\nWait, the note says that in the second sample, 'P' is missing and there's an extra 'L'. So the counters would show that the combined has one less 'P' and one more 'L' than the pile.\n\nThird sample: the pile has an extra 'L', so the counters will differ.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: All letters are the same. Like guest is 'AAA', host is 'AA', pile is 'AAAAA'.\n\nCombined is 'AAAAA', which matches the pile. So output YES.\n\nCase 2: Lengths don't match. Guest is 'AB', host is 'CD' (length 2+2=4), pile is 'EFGH' (length 4). But letters don't match. So code correctly returns NO.\n\nAnother case: guest is empty? No, the problem states that all lines are non-empty. So no need to handle empty strings.\n\nWhat about when the guest or host is longer than the pile? For example, guest is 'ABCDE', host is 'DEF', so combined is 6 letters. Pile is 5 letters. The length check will catch it.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nNow, in Python, how to read the three lines. Wait, the input comes as three separate lines. So perhaps:\n\nline1 = input().strip()\nline2 = input().strip()\nline3 = input().strip()\n\nBut sometimes, when using standard input, especially if it's provided as a single string split by newlines, but in the problem statement, each line is a separate input line.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput file consists of three lines: first line guest's name, etc. So each line is read as a separate input.\n\nSo in code:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen proceed as before.\n\nSo putting it all together, the code would look like:\n\nRead guest, host, pile.\n\nCheck if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, print 'NO'.\n\nElse, create counters for both combined and pile. If they are equal, print 'YES'; else, 'NO'.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, testing the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nguest = 'SANTACLAUS' → len is 10\nhost = 'DEDMOROZ' → len is 8\ncombined len is 18.\n\nPile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' → len is 18.\n\nCounters should match, so output YES.\n\nSample 2:\n\nguest: 'PAPAINOEL' → len 9\nhost: 'JOULUPUKKI' → len 10\ncombined len 19.\n\nPile: 'BABBONATALE' + 'FATHERCHRISTMAS' + 'BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER' → Wait, no, the pile is a single line.\n\nWait, in sample 2's output note, it's said that the letter 'P' is missing and there's an extra 'L'. So the combined has one less 'P' and one more 'L' than the pile.\n\nSo the code would detect that the counters are different.\n\nSample 3:\n\nguest: 'BABBONATALE' → len 10\nhost: 'FATHERCHRISTMAS' → len 14\ncombined len 24.\n\nPile: 'BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER' → len 25. So length is different. So code would print NO because the length check fails.\n\nWait, but the note says that the third sample has an extra 'L'. So perhaps the pile's length is 24 as well but has an extra 'L'. So in that case, the code would proceed to count, find that the combined has one less 'L' than the pile, thus counters differ, and output NO.\n\nSo in code, the length check is crucial.\n\nSo the code handles all cases.\n\nI think that's all. Now, writing the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters can be rearranged to form the names of a guest and a host without any extra letters. The approach involves comparing the frequency of each character in the combined names with the frequency of characters in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the three lines of input which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Check Lengths:** Verify if the combined length of the guest's and host's names is equal to the length of the pile. If not, print \"NO\" and exit.\n3. **Count Frequencies:** Use a counter to count the frequency of each character in the combined guest and host names, and separately count the frequency of each character in the pile.\n4. **Compare Frequencies:** If the two counters are identical, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact match of characters, considering both their presence and absence in the required quantities.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined_length = len(guest) + len(host)\nif combined_length != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    counter_combined = Counter(guest + host)\n    counter_pile = Counter(pile)\n    if counter_combined == counter_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The code reads three lines of input corresponding to the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters.\n- **Length Check:** It first checks if the combined length of the guest's and host's names matches the length of the pile. This quick check helps in immediately determining if it's impossible to form the names from the pile.\n- **Frequency Counting:** Using `collections.Counter`, the code counts the occurrences of each character in both the combined names and the pile.\n- **Comparison:** Finally, it compares the two counters to ensure every character appears exactly the same number of times in both the combined names and the pile.\n\nThis method efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures correctness by verifying both the presence and absence of each character in the required quantities.",
