Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Lanterns.\" Hmm.\n\nSo, the setup is that Vanya is walking along a straight street of length l. There are n lanterns placed along this street. Each lantern can light all points within a distance d from it. The goal is to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nWait, right. So, the street goes from 0 to l on a number line. Each lantern is at some position ai, and when they light up with radius d, their coverage is [ai - d, ai + d]. But since the street is from 0 to l, any part beyond 0 or l isn't part of the street. So, for each lantern, the effective coverage is the intersection of [ai -d, ai +d] with [0, l].\n\nThe task is to find the smallest possible d such that the union of all these covered intervals covers the entire [0, l] interval.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this? Well, the first thought is that this is an optimization problem. We need to minimize d, so we can probably perform a binary search on possible d values and check if for a given d, the entire street is covered.\n\nYes, binary search sounds like a good plan here. Because as d increases, the coverage area increases, so the function is monotonic. So the minimal d is where the coverage just includes the entire street.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because the lanterns might not be in order, so arranging them will help in efficiently checking coverage.\n\n2. Perform a binary search on d. The lower bound can be 0, but realistically, it's the minimal distance needed to cover the gaps between lanterns. The upper bound can be l/2, because if d is l/2, then the first lantern covers from 0 to l, but maybe a smaller d is sufficient.\n\nWait, no. For example, if there's only one lantern at l, then d must be l/2 to cover from 0 to l. Or wait, no. If the lantern is at l, then its coverage would be from max(0, l -d) to min(l +d, l). So to cover 0 to l, we need max(0, l-d) <= 0 and min(l +d, l) >= l. So l -d <=0 → d >=l, which can't be. Wait, no. Wait, if the lantern is at position l, then to cover 0, the coverage needs to reach 0. So the left end is l -d. So l -d <=0 → d >= l. But that's impossible because d can't be larger than l. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the street is from 0 to l. A lantern at l has coverage from (l -d) to (l +d). But l +d can't exceed l because the street ends at l. So the coverage for a lantern at position a is [max(0, a -d), min(l, a +d)]. So for a lantern at l, its coverage is [l -d, l], because a +d is l +d, which is clamped to l.\n\nSo for that lantern to cover 0, l -d must be ≤0 → d ≥ l. Which is impossible because d can't be more than l, but in that case, it's exactly d = l. Then the coverage is [0, l], which covers the entire street.\n\nWait, but in that scenario, if the lantern is at l, then d must be at least l to cover 0. But that's only if the lantern is the only one. So if there's only one lantern at l, then the required d is l, because it can't reach 0 otherwise.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are two lanterns both at 5, and l is 5. So the required d is 2. Because each lantern covers 3 units to the left and right. So the first lantern covers [3,7], but since l is 5, it's [3,5]. The second covers [3,7], but again clamped to [3,5]. So together, they cover the entire street [0,5]?\n\nWait, no. Wait the sample input says when d=2, the first lantern covers 0-4, and the second covers 3-5. So combined, they cover 0-5. So that works.\n\nSo, the idea is that when the lanterns are sorted, we can process them in order, and for each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the maximum gap that needs to be covered by the sum of their coverage areas.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: after sorting the lanterns, the minimal d is determined by the largest required gap between consecutive lanterns. For each pair of adjacent lanterns, the required d is half the distance between them. Because each lantern can cover up to d to the left and right. So the maximum gap is the distance between two adjacent lanterns, and the minimal d needed is half of that.\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose two lanterns are at a and b, where a < b. The distance between them is (b -a). So, the coverage from the first is up to a +d, and from the second is down to b -d. To cover the entire [a, b], the condition is a +d >= b -d → 2d >= b - a → d >= (b -a)/2.\n\nSo the minimal d required is (b -a)/2 for each pair of consecutive lanterns, and the overall minimal d is the maximum of all these.\n\nBut wait, what about the ends? Like, the first lantern may have to cover from 0, and the last from l.\n\nSo the initial step is to sort the lanterns. Then, include 0 and l as implicit points. So the list becomes [0, a1, a2, ..., an, l], sorted.\n\nThen, for each consecutive pair, compute the required d as (current - previous)/2. The maximum of these is the required minimal d.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for each gap between two consecutive lanterns (or between 0 and first, or last and l), the required d must be at least half the gap. Otherwise, there's a point in between that isn't covered.\n\nFor example, in the sample input where the lanterns are at 2 and 5, and l is 5. The sorted list is [0,2,5,5,5,5,l=5? Wait, no, the input is 2 and 5. So sorted is [2,5], and we add 0 and 5 to make it [0,2,5,5]? Wait, no. Wait, the lantern positions are 2 and 5, so when sorted, it's [2,5]. Then, the list is extended to include 0 and l=5. Wait, no, the existing lanterns are already at 2 and 5. So the extended list is [0,2,5,5]? No, maybe it's better to consider 0 and l as points, and then process all the lanterns in the middle.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Let's create a sorted list that starts with 0, followed by all the lantern positions (sorted), followed by l. So for the sample input with 2 lanterns at 2 and 5, the list becomes [0,2,5,5]. Wait, no, the lanterns are at 2 and 5, so the list should be [0,2,5,5]? No, wait, perhaps the correct way is to include 0 and l as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to create a list that includes 0, all the lantern positions sorted, and l. Then, for each consecutive pair in this list, compute the required d as (current - previous)/2, and the maximum of those is the answer.\n\nSo for the sample input 2 5, the lanterns are at 2 and 5. The extended list is [0,2,5,5], but wait, no, perhaps it's [0,2,5,5+something? Wait no, l is 5 in the sample. So the list is [0,2,5,5], but perhaps the last element is l, which is 5. So the list is [0,2,5,5]. Wait, but 5 is already included.\n\nWait, perhaps I should process the list as [0, 2,5,5]. So the consecutive pairs are (0,2), (2,5), (5,5). So the required d for (0,2) is (2-0)/2 = 1. For (2,5), it's (5-2)/2=1.5. For (5,5), it's 0.\n\nSo the maximum is 1.5, but in the sample, the correct d is 2. So something's wrong with this approach.\n\nWait, wait, the sample input is:\n\nInput:\n7 15\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nSo the lanterns are at 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nWait, so when sorted, it's 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nAdding 0 and l=15, but wait, 0 is already in the list. So the extended list is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15,15]. Or wait, perhaps it's [0] + sorted lanterns + [l].\n\nIn this case, the extended list would be [0,3,5,7,9,14,15,15], but wait, 15 is already included as the last element.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to create a list that starts with 0, then all lantern positions (sorted), then l. So for the first sample, it's [0,3,5,7,9,14,15,15]. Then, for each consecutive pair, compute (current - previous)/2.\n\nWait, but for the first sample, the output is 2.5. Let's see why.\n\nLooking at the extended list [0,3,5,7,9,14,15,15], the consecutive pairs are:\n\n0-3: d=1.5\n\n3-5: 1\n\n5-7: 1\n\n7-9: 1\n\n9-14: 2.5\n\n14-15: 0.5\n\n15-15: 0\n\nSo the maximum is 2.5, which matches the sample output.\n\nAh, okay, so that seems correct. So the approach is:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions.\n\n2. Create a new list that starts with 0, followed by the sorted lantern positions, followed by l.\n\n3. For each consecutive pair in this new list, compute (current - previous)/2.\n\n4. The maximum of these values is the minimal required d.\n\nThat makes sense because for each gap between two consecutive points, the required d is at least half the gap. Otherwise, there's a point in the middle that is not covered by either lantern.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward:\n\n- Sort the lantern positions.\n\n- Prepend 0 and append l.\n\n- Iterate through the sorted list, compute the differences between consecutive elements, take half of each difference, and find the maximum.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is two lines: the first line has n and l, the second line has the lantern positions.\n\nWait, in the sample input, it's written as ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']—probably, this is a representation, but in reality, the code should read from standard input.\n\nIn Python, we can read the first line as n, l, and then read the second line as the lantern positions.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nextended = [0] + a + [l]\nmax_d = 0\nfor i in range(1, len(extended)):\n    diff = extended[i] - extended[i-1]\n    current_d = diff / 2.0\n    if current_d > max_d:\n        max_d = current_d\n\nprint(max_d)\n\nWait, but wait: in the sample input, when l is 5 and the lanterns are at 2 and 5, the extended list is [0,2,5,5]. Wait, no: a is [2,5], so extended is [0,2,5,5], but wait, l is 5, so the extended list is [0,2,5,5]. Then, the consecutive pairs are (0,2), (2,5), (5,5).\n\nDifferences are 2, 3, 0.\n\nSo current_d for 0-2 is 1.0, 2-5 is 1.5, 5-5 is 0.\n\nSo maximum is 1.5, but the sample expects 2.0.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because according to the sample, the minimal d is 2.0.\n\nWait, but according to our approach, the maximum required d is 1.5, but the sample says 2.0. So something's wrong.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample input is:\n\nInput:\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWhich is n=7, l=15, and a = [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. Wait, wait, no, the second line is '2 5' which is two lanterns at 2 and 5.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the input is two lines. The first line is n and l, the second line is the lantern positions, space-separated.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the first line is '7 15' meaning n=7, l=15. The second line is '15 5 3 7 9 14 0' which is 7 numbers. So a is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0].\n\nWait, no, wait, the second line is '2 5' meaning two lanterns at 2 and 5.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine the sample.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nSo, first line: 7 15 → n=7, l=15.\n\nSecond line: '2 5\\n2 5' → split into ['2','5','2','5'], so a is [2,5,2,5]. When we sort, it's [2,2,5,5].\n\nSo extended list is [0,2,2,5,5,15]. Wait, no. Wait, the original a is [2,5,2,5], when sorted becomes [2,2,5,5]. So the extended list is [0] + [2,2,5,5] + [15], so [0,2,2,5,5,15].\n\nThen, the consecutive pairs are:\n\n0-2 → 2 → d=1.0\n\n2-2 → 0 → d=0\n\n2-5 → 3 → d=1.5\n\n5-5 → 0 → d=0\n\n5-15 →10 →d=5.\n\nSo the maximum is 5, but that's not matching the sample output.\n\nWait, the sample output is 2.5. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look back at the problem statement. Oh! Wait, in the note, the second sample is:\n\nInput:\n2 5\n2 5\n\nOutput:\n2.0000000000\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So the lanterns are at 2 and 5.\n\nSo the street is 0 to 5.\n\nEach lantern has radius d.\n\nAt d=2, the first lantern covers [0,4], the second [3,7], but clamped to [3,5]. So combined, 0-4 and 3-5, which covers 0-5.\n\nSo the minimal d is 2.\n\nAccording to my earlier approach, the extended list is [0,2,5,5]. So the consecutive pairs are 0-2 (d=1), 2-5 (d=1.5), 5-5 (d=0). Max is 1.5, but the required d is 2.\n\nHmm, so my approach is incorrect.\n\nWhat's wrong here? Why is the required d 2 when the maximum gap is 3, leading to d=1.5.\n\nAh, because the lanterns are at 2 and 5.\n\nWait, when d is 1.5, the first lantern covers up to 2 + 1.5 = 3.5. The second lantern covers down to 5 -1.5 =3.5. So together, they cover 0-3.5 and 3.5-5, which is 0-5. So why does the sample require d=2?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sample.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample says that at d=2, the first lantern covers 0-4, and the second covers 3-5. So the entire street is covered.\n\nBut according to the approach, the maximum required d is 1.5. So why is the sample expecting 2?\n\nThis suggests that the approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the lanterns can only light points within distance d from themselves. So, for a lantern at a, the covered interval is [a -d, a +d], but it can't go beyond 0 or l.\n\nSo, for the lantern at 2, with d=1.5, it covers from 0.5 to 3.5.\n\nThe lantern at 5 with d=1.5 covers 3.5 to 6.5, but clamped to 0-5. So 3.5 to 5.\n\nCombined, 0.5-3.5 and 3.5-5 gives 0.5-5. But the street starts at 0, so 0 to 0.5 is not covered. So the street is not fully lit.\n\nAh! So the approach is missing the fact that the first lantern's left coverage may not reach 0, and similarly, the last lantern's right coverage may not reach l.\n\nSo the correct approach is not only to look at the gaps between the lanterns, but also ensure that the first lantern's coverage extends to 0, and the last lantern's coverage extends to l.\n\nSo, how to account for that.\n\nLet me think.\n\nEach lantern's coverage is [a_i -d, a_i +d]. But the street starts at 0 and ends at l. So the coverage is the intersection with [0, l].\n\nSo, for the entire street to be covered, the union of all these intersections must be [0, l].\n\nSo, the coverage must start at 0 and end at l.\n\nThus, the first lantern must cover up to 0, meaning a_1 -d <= 0. And the last lantern must cover down to l, meaning a_n +d >= l.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first lantern's coverage is [a_1 -d, a_1 +d], but the street starts at 0. So the coverage must include 0. So the coverage of the first lantern must extend to 0, which means a_1 -d <=0 → d >= a_1.\n\nSimilarly, the last lantern's coverage must extend to l, so a_last +d >= l → d >= l - a_last.\n\nWait, but that's only for the first and last lanterns. What about other lanterns?\n\nWait, no, because the first and last lanterns are the ones that can potentially cover the ends. So, the minimal d must satisfy:\n\nd >= a_1 (so that the first lantern covers 0)\nd >= l - a_last (so that the last lantern covers l)\nAnd for all consecutive lanterns, d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2.\n\nSo, the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- a_1 (if a_1 >0)\n- l - a_last (if a_last < l)\n- max over (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2 for all i.\n\nAdditionally, if the first lantern is already at 0, then d can be zero, but that's only if all other conditions are satisfied.\n\nWait, no. For example, if the first lantern is at 0, but the next lantern is far away. So the coverage of the first lantern is up to 0 +d. So the second lantern's coverage must start before that.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nCompute four possible constraints:\n\n1. d >= a_1 (since the first lantern's coverage must reach 0, so a_1 -d <=0 → d >=a_1).\n\nBut wait, if a_1 is 0, then d >=0.\n\n2. d >= l - a_last (the last lantern's coverage must reach l: a_last +d >=l → d >= l -a_last).\n\n3. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2.\n\nThen, the minimal d is the maximum of all these.\n\nSo, in the sample where the lanterns are at 2 and 5, l=5.\n\nConstraint 1: a_1=2 → d >=2.\n\nConstraint 2: l -a_last =5-5=0 → d >=0.\n\nConstraint 3: For the pair 2 and5 → (5-2)/2=1.5.\n\nSo, the maximum of 2, 1.5, 0 is 2. So the minimal d is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nAh, that's the correct approach.\n\nSo, the algorithm needs to:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions.\n\n2. Compute the following:\n\n   a. If the first lantern is at a_1, then d must be at least a_1 to cover 0.\n\n   b. If the last lantern is at a_last, then d must be at least l - a_last to cover l.\n\n   c. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2, and take the maximum.\n\n3. The minimal d is the maximum of a, b, c.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Sort the lantern positions.\n\n- Compute a as the first lantern's position (if a[0] >0).\n\n- Compute b as (l - a[-1]) if a[-1] < l.\n\n- Compute c as the maximum of (a[i+1] -a[i])/2 for all i in 0..n-2.\n\n- d is the maximum of a, b, c.\n\nWait, but what if a[0] is 0? Then a is 0, so d can be zero, but only if all other constraints are met.\n\nWait, no. For example, if a[0] is 0, but the next lantern is at a higher position. Then, the coverage of the first lantern is [0, d], and the next lantern's coverage is [a_i -d, a_i +d]. So, the first lantern covers up to d, and the next lantern's coverage starts at a_i -d. So, the combined coverage must reach a_i -d >=d → a_i >= 2d.\n\nBut according to the constraints above, the maximum of a, which is 0, and other factors would still determine d.\n\nWait, perhaps the a, b, c as defined earlier correctly capture all necessary constraints.\n\nSo, let's test this logic.\n\nAnother test case: single lantern at l.\n\nIf n=1, l=5, a=[5]. Then:\n\na=5 (so d>=5 to cover 0).\n\nb=5-5=0 → d >=0.\n\nc=0 (no consecutive lanterns).\n\nSo d=5.\n\nWhich is correct, because the lantern at 5 with d=5 covers 0 to 10, but the street is 0-5, so it's fully covered.\n\nAnother test case: two lanterns at 0 and l.\n\nn=2, l=10, a=[0,10].\n\na=0 (so no constraint for a).\n\nb=10-10=0.\n\nc= (10-0)/2=5.\n\nSo d=5.\n\nWhich makes sense. Each lantern covers 5 units, so the first covers 0-5, the second covers 5-15, but the street is 0-10. So 0-5 and 5-10, which covers everything.\n\nAnother test case: three lanterns at 0, 5, 10, l=10.\n\na=0.\n\nb=10-10=0.\n\nc=(5-0)/2=2.5, (10-5)/2=2.5.\n\nSo maximum is 2.5.\n\nSo d=2.5.\n\nWhich would mean each lantern covers 2.5 units.\n\nLantern at 0 covers 0-2.5.\n\nLantern at5 covers 2.5-7.5.\n\nLantern at10 covers 7.5-12.5, but since l=10, it's 7.5-10.\n\nSo the coverage is 0-2.5, 2.5-7.5, 7.5-10: entire street.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: three lanterns at 2,5,8, l=10.\n\na=2 → d>=2.\n\nb=10-8=2.\n\nc: (5-2)/2=1.5, (8-5)/2=1.5. Max c is 1.5.\n\nSo d is max(2,2,1.5)=2.\n\nCheck coverage:\n\nLantern at 2 with d=2: covers 0-4.\n\nLantern at5: 3-7.\n\nLantern at8: 6-10.\n\nCombined, 0-4, 3-7, 6-10: covers 0-10.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this logic seems to work.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and l.\n\n2. Read the lantern positions into a list.\n\n3. Sort the list.\n\n4. Compute a as a[0], if a[0] >0, else 0.\n\n5. Compute b as l - a[-1], if a[-1] < l, else 0.\n\n6. Compute c as the maximum of (a[i+1] - a[i])/2 for all i in 0..n-2.\n\n7. d = max(a, b, c).\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\na_val = a[0] if a else 0\nb_val = (l - a[-1]) if a and a[-1] < l else 0\n\nc_val = 0\nfor i in range(len(a)-1):\n    diff = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    c_val = max(c_val, diff / 2.0)\n\nd = max(a_val, b_val, c_val)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nWait, but wait: in the first sample, the output is 2.5, which comes from c_val being 10-14 is 4 → 2.0, 14-15 is 1 → 0.5, etc. Wait, no. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, in the first sample:\n\nn=7, l=15.\n\na = [15,5,3,7,9,14,0] → sorted becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\na_val is 0 (since a[0] is 0).\n\nb_val is 15-15=0.\n\nc_val is computed as:\n\nBetween 0 and3: 3/2=1.5.\n\n3 and5: 2/2=1.\n\n5 and7: 2/2=1.\n\n7 and9: 2/2=1.\n\n9 and14:5/2=2.5.\n\n14 and15:1/2=0.5.\n\nMax is 2.5.\n\nSo d is max(0,0,2.5) → 2.5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: sample 2.\n\nn=2, l=5.\n\na = [2,5]. Sorted is [2,5].\n\na_val is 2.\n\nb_val is 5-5=0.\n\nc_val is (5-2)/2=1.5.\n\nd = max(2,0,1.5) → 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo yes, the code should be as described.\n\nSo, in code, it's important to handle the cases where a is empty (but n is at least 1, so a can't be empty). So, in the code, a is always non-empty.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, n can be 1.\n\nSo, code should handle all cases.\n\nAnother edge case: all lanterns are at 0.\n\nn=3, l=10.\n\na = [0,0,0]. Sorted is [0,0,0].\n\na_val is 0.\n\nb_val is 10 -0=10.\n\nc_val is 0 for all consecutive pairs.\n\nSo d is max(0,10,0) →10.\n\nWhich is correct because the last lantern must cover l=10, so d must be 10.\n\nAnother edge case: lanterns at 0 and l.\n\nn=2, l=10.\n\na = [0,10].\n\na_val is 0.\n\nb_val is 10-10=0.\n\nc_val is 10/2=5.\n\nSo d=5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, a=[0], l=5.\n\na_val is 0.\n\nb_val is 5-0=5.\n\nc_val is 0.\n\nSo d=5.\n\nWhich is correct because the lantern at 0 must cover 0 to d, and since l=5, the coverage must reach 5, so d=5.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, a=[5], l=5.\n\na_val is5.\n\nb_val is 0.\n\nc_val is 0.\n\nd=5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead the inputs, sort the array, compute a, b, c as discussed, then print the result with 10 decimal places.\n\nMake sure to format the output correctly, with 10 decimal digits, including trailing zeros.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\na_val = a[0] if a else 0  # a is non-empty\nb_val = (l - a[-1]) if a[-1] < l else 0\n\nc_val = 0.0\nfor i in range(len(a) - 1):\n    diff = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    c_val = max(c_val, diff / 2.0)\n\nd = max(a_val, b_val, c_val)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns on a street can light the entire street from 0 to \\( l \\). Each lantern lights all points within a distance \\( d \\) from it.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to facilitate easier calculation of the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Calculate Constraints**:\n   - **First Lantern Constraint**: The first lantern must cover the start of the street (0). Thus, \\( d \\) must be at least the position of the first lantern if it is not already at 0.\n   - **Last Lantern Constraint**: The last lantern must cover the end of the street (\\( l \\)). Thus, \\( d \\) must be at least \\( l \\) minus the position of the last lantern if the last lantern is not already at \\( l \\).\n   - **Consecutive Lanterns Constraint**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the required \\( d \\) must be at least half the distance between them to ensure continuous coverage. The maximum of these values across all pairs gives the required \\( d \\) for this constraint.\n3. **Determine Minimum \\( d \\)**: The minimum \\( d \\) is the maximum value obtained from the three constraints mentioned above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\na_val = a[0] if a else 0\nb_val = (l - a[-1]) if a and a[-1] < l else 0\n\nc_val = 0.0\nfor i in range(len(a) - 1):\n    diff = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    c_val = max(c_val, diff / 2.0)\n\nd = max(a_val, b_val, c_val)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions helps in efficiently calculating the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Constraints Calculation**:\n  - **First Lantern**: Ensures coverage starts from 0.\n  - **Last Lantern**: Ensures coverage ends at \\( l \\).\n  - **Consecutive Pairs**: Ensures there are no gaps between lanterns.\n- **Result**: The maximum of these constraints ensures the entire street is covered with the minimum radius \\( d \\).\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum \\( d \\) using straightforward arithmetic operations and comparisons, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the problem constraints.",
