She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a browser with several tabs open, and Luba needs to close some tabs efficiently. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds she needs to spend to close all the tabs outside a specific range [l, r].\n\nHmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, the initial setup is that there are n tabs, numbered from 1 to n. The cursor starts at position pos. Luba wants to keep tabs from l to r open. She needs to close all other tabs as quickly as possible.\n\nEach second, she can do one of two actions: move the cursor left or right, but within the current range of open tabs. Or, she can close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor. Closing those tabs would immediately remove them from consideration, so the next moves will be constrained by the new set of open tabs.\n\nWait, so when she closes tabs, the remaining open tabs form a new range. For example, if after closing some tabs, the open tabs are from a to b, then moving left is limited by a, moving right by b.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum number of steps to have only the tabs l to r remain open.\n\nLet's think about how to model this. Maybe we can consider the steps required to close the tabs to the left of l and to the right of r.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal approach is to first close all the left tabs (those before l), then close the right tabs (those after r). Or maybe it's better to close the right ones first, depending on the cursor position.\n\nBut wait, the order might matter because the movement time depends on where you are. So maybe we need to consider both possibilities: close left first, then right; or close right first, then left. Then choose the one with the minimal steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's break down the problem into parts.\n\nFirst, determine which tabs need to be closed: any tabs less than l or greater than r. We need to close all such tabs.\n\nSo, the process would involve:\n\n1. Move to a position where you can close the left tabs.\n2. Close them.\n3. Then move to a position to close the right tabs.\n4. Close them.\n\nOr alternatively:\n\n1. Move to a position to close the right tabs.\n2. Close them.\n3. Then move to a position to close the left tabs.\n4. Close them.\n\nWe need to calculate the steps for both approaches and choose the minimum.\n\nBut wait, what if some tabs are already in the desired range? For example, if l=1 and r=n, no tabs need to be closed. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo first, check if l == 1 and r ==n. If yes, output 0.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, let's think about when l !=1 or r !=n. We need to close tabs to the left of l and/or right of r.\n\nLet me outline the steps for both scenarios.\n\nCase 1: Close left first, then right.\n\nSteps:\n\n- Move from pos to l (since we need to close the left part up to l-1). The movement steps would be |pos - l|.\n\n- Then, close the left tabs. This takes 1 step.\n\n- Now, after closing left, the open tabs start from l. But wait, actually, when you close the left tabs, the new a becomes l. Because the current cursor is at l, and the new a is l.\n\nThen, to close the right tabs, which are from r+1 to whatever. So we need to move from l to r.\n\nBut wait, after closing the left, the available tabs are from l to something. Wait, no: when you close the left of l, the remaining tabs are l and higher. So after that, the a is l, and the current position is l.\n\nTo close the right, which is everything beyond r, we need to get to r. How?\n\nAfter closing the left, the current position is l. So to reach r, we need to move from l to r, which takes (r - l) steps.\n\nThen, close the right, which is 1 step.\n\nSo total steps for case 1: (|pos - l|) + 1 + (r - l).\n\nWait, but after closing the left, the a becomes l, but the initial move was to l, so that's correct.\n\nCase 2: Close right first, then left.\n\nSteps:\n\n- Move from pos to r. Steps: |pos - r|.\n\n- Close the right. 1 step.\n\n- Now, the open tabs are from 1 to r. Current position is r.\n\n- Need to close the left tabs, which are less than l. So we need to move from r to l. Steps: r - l.\n\n- Close the left. 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - r| + 1 + (r - l).\n\nWait, but what if l is not 1? Like, suppose we have to close the left of l, but after closing the right, the current position is r, and we need to move left to l, which is (r - l) steps.\n\nSo for each scenario, the steps are:\n\nScenario A: close left then right.\n\nTime = (steps to l) + 1 + (steps from l to r) + 1.\n\nWhich is |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nScenario B: close right then left.\n\nTime = (steps to r) + 1 + (steps from r to l) + 1.\n\nWhich is |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nWait, wait: for scenario A, after closing left, the a is l, and the current position is l. To close the right, we need to move from l to r, which is (r - l) steps. Similarly, for scenario B, after closing right, the current position is r, and to close left, we have to move from r to l, which is (r - l) steps.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nBut wait, what if l and r are the same? Then, since l = r, we don't need to close anything. So we can handle that case separately.\n\nSo, the steps depend on whether we need to close left, right, both, or neither.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately:\n\nIf l == 1 and r == n: steps are 0.\n\nElse, we need to close either left, right, or both.\n\nSo, for the cases where both left and right need to be closed:\n\nCompute the steps for both scenarios (A and B) and choose the minimum.\n\nFor cases where only left or only right needs to be closed, compute the steps accordingly.\n\nLet me formalize the logic.\n\nFirst, check if l ==1 and r ==n: output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nleft_close_needed = (l > 1)\n\nright_close_needed = (r < n)\n\nif neither needed: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\nWe have to close both left and right.\n\nSo compute steps for scenario A and scenario B, take the minimum.\n\nBut wait, what if l is 1 and r is less than n? Then we only need to close the right.\n\nSimilarly, if r is n and l is larger than 1, we only need to close the left.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to structure the code as:\n\nCalculate the number of steps required to close the left and right, considering both possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps can be determined based on the positions.\n\nLet me think of the variables:\n\nclose_left: whether we need to close tabs to the left of l.\n\nclose_right: whether we need to close tabs to the right of r.\n\nSo:\n\nclose_left = (l > 1)\n\nclose_right = (r < n)\n\nIf neither, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the steps for all possible orders.\n\nBut what are the possible orders?\n\nWell, if both need to be closed, we can choose to close left first or right first.\n\nAdditionally, sometimes, the initial position may make one option better than the other.\n\nSo, for the cases where both close_left and close_right are true:\n\nOption 1: Close left, then right.\n\nOption 2: Close right, then left.\n\nCompute the steps for both options, then take the minimum.\n\nIf only close_left is true:\n\nWe just need to close the left. So the steps are the steps to move to l, close, which is |pos - l| + 1.\n\nSimilarly, if only close_right is true: steps are |pos - r| +1.\n\nSo, putting this all together.\n\nLet me outline the algorithm:\n\nCompute:\n\nclose_left = (l > 1)\n\nclose_right = (r < n)\n\nif not close_left and not close_right:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelif close_left and close_right:\n\n    # compute both options\n\n    option1 = move to l, close left, move to r, close right\n\n    option2 = move to r, close right, move to l, close left\n\n    steps1 = (|pos - l|) + 1 + (r - l) \n\n    steps2 = (|pos - r|) + 1 + (r - l)\n\n    min_steps = min(steps1, steps2)\n\nelif close_left:\n\n    steps = |pos - l| +1 \n\nelif close_right:\n\n    steps = |pos - r| +1 \n\nprint(steps)\n\nWait, but in option1, after closing the left, the current position is l. Then moving to r is (r-l) steps, then close right.\n\nYes.\n\nIn option2, after closing right, the current position is r. Then moving to l is (r-l) steps, then close left.\n\nSo yes.\n\nWait, but in option2, when you close the right, the new a is r, because after closing right, the remaining tabs are from 1 to r. So when moving back to l, which is less than r, you can move left.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the formula seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n6 3 2 4\n\nSo n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nclose_left is true because l>1.\n\nclose_right is true because r <6.\n\nSo both are true.\n\nOption1: move to l=2: 1 step (from 3 to 2). Close left: 1 step. Then move from 2 to 4: 2 steps. Close right: 1 step. Total 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nOption2: move to r=4: 1 step (3 to4). Close right: 1 step. Then move from4 to2: 2 steps. Close left:1. Total 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nSo same result. So min is 5. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n6 3 1 3\n\nHere, l=1, r=3. Since n=6>3, so close_right is true.\n\nOnly close_right is needed.\n\nSteps: move from 3 to3 (no steps), close right:1 step.\n\nTotal 1. Which matches sample.\n\nSample Input3:\n\n5 2 1 5.\n\nHere, l=1 and r=5, which equals n=5. So no need to close anything. Output 0.\n\nAnother test case: let's say n=10, pos=5, l=3, r=7.\n\nclose_left: 3>1 → yes.\n\nclose_right:7<10 → yes.\n\nOption1: move to 3: 2 steps. Close left:1. Then move to7:4 steps. Close right:1. Total 2+1+4+1=8.\n\nOption2: move to7:2 steps. Close right:1. Then move to3:4 steps. Close left:1. Total 2+1+4+1=8.\n\nSame steps.\n\nAnother test case: n=100, pos=50, l=2, r=99.\n\nclose_left: yes.\n\nclose_right: yes.\n\noption1: move to2 (48 steps). Close left (1). move to99:97 steps. Close right (1). Total 48+97+2=147.\n\noption2: move to99 (49 steps). Close right (1). move to2 (97 steps). Close left (1). Total 49+97+2=148.\n\nSo option1 is better, steps 147.\n\nWait, but 48+1+97+1=147.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the algorithm seems to hold.\n\nNow, let's implement this.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nCompute close_left = (l > 1)\n\nclose_right = (r <n)\n\nif not close_left and not close_right:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelif close_left and close_right:\n\n    # compute option1 and option2\n\n    option1 = abs(pos - l) +1 + (r - l)\n\n    option2 = abs(pos - r) +1 + (r - l)\n\n    min_step = min(option1, option2)\n\nelif close_left:\n\n    steps = abs(pos - l) +1\n\nelif close_right:\n\n    steps = abs(pos - r) +1\n\nprint(steps)\n\nWait, but what if l is 1 and r is n? Then, close_left and close_right are both false. So, steps are zero.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: l=1, r=5, n=5. So steps zero.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=4, n=5. So close_right is true.\n\nSo steps are |pos -4| +1.\n\nWait, what about if pos is already at l or r.\n\nLike in sample 2: pos=3, which is between 1 and3, but the right needs to be closed.\n\nSo, moving to r=3, which is current pos, so no steps. Close right, which is everything beyond 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when l is 1 and r is n-1.\n\nLike n=5, l=1, r=4.\n\nclose_right is true.\n\nSo steps are |pos -4| +1.\n\nSo, if pos is 4, steps are 0 +1=1.\n\nIf pos is 3, steps are 1 +1=2.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when l=2 and r=3, n=3.\n\nclose_left is true, close_right is false.\n\nWait, wait n=3, r=3. So r is equal to n. So close_right is false.\n\nSo, close_left is true.\n\nSo steps are |pos -2| +1.\n\nSo, if pos is 2: 0 steps to move, close left (tabs 1), which is 1 step.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: l=2, r=3, n=4.\n\nclose_left is true, close_right is true.\n\nSo steps for option1: move to 2 (from pos), close left, move to3, close right.\n\nIf pos is 3:\n\noption1: |3-2|=1, +1, +1 (move from2 to3), +1. Total 4.\n\noption2: |3-3|=0, +1, +1. Total 2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for option2:\n\nmove to r=3: 0 steps.\n\nclose right: 1 step. Now, open tabs are 1-3. So to close left, which is tab 1, you need to move from3 to2 (1 step), close left (1 step). So total steps: 0+1 +1+1=3.\n\nWait, wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the case where close_left and close_right are both true, the steps are:\n\nFor option1:\n\nsteps to move to l: |pos - l|\n\n+1 (close left)\n\n+ steps to move from l to r: (r-l)\n\n+1 (close right)\n\nTotal: |pos-l| + (r-l) +2.\n\nOption2:\n\nsteps to move to r: |pos - r|\n\n+1 (close right)\n\n+ steps to move from r to l: (r-l)\n\n+1 (close left)\n\nTotal: |pos-r| + (r-l) +2.\n\nWait, in the case where pos is 3, l=2, r=3, n=4.\n\noption1: |3-2|=1 → 1+ (3-2)=1 → +2 → 1+1+2=4.\n\noption2: |3-3|=0 → 0+ (3-2)=1 → +2 → 0+1+2=3.\n\nSo option2 is better.\n\nBut according to the earlier formula, option2 is |3-3|=0 + (3-2) + 2 = 0+1+2=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code correctly calculates it.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nTesting another scenario: n=5, pos=4, l=2, r=3.\n\nclose_left is true, close_right is true.\n\noption1: move to 2 (2 steps), close left (1), move to3 (1 step), close right (1). Total 5 steps.\n\noption2: move to3 (1 step), close right (1), move to2 (1 step), close left (1). Total 4 steps.\n\nSo the code returns min(5,4) =4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo now, the code should handle all cases.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when l is 1, but r is not n. So close_right is true.\n\nFor example, n=10, l=1, r=5.\n\nclose_left is false, close_right is true.\n\nsteps: |pos -5| +1.\n\nSo, if pos is5: 0+1=1.\n\nIf pos is6:1+1=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nSo, now, the plan is:\n\nRead four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n\nCheck if l==1 and r==n. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse, compute whether we need to close left and/or right.\n\nIf both are needed: compute both options, choose the minimal.\n\nElse, compute the required steps.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nRead the input line as a string, split into four integers.\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen:\n\nclose_left = (l > 1)\n\nclose_right = (r < n)\n\nif not close_left and not close_right:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelif close_left and close_right:\n\n    # compute option1 and option2\n\n    option1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l)\n\n    option2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l)\n\n    min_step = min(option1, option2)\n\n    print(min_step)\n\nelif close_left:\n\n    steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    print(steps)\n\nelif close_right:\n\n    steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    print(steps)\n\nWait, but let's test when l=1 and r=3, n=5.\n\nSo close_left is false, close_right is true.\n\nSo steps are |pos -3| +1.\n\nSo for pos=3: 0+1=1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=4.\n\nclose_left is true, close_right is true.\n\noption1: move to2 (1 step), close left (1), move to4 (2 steps), close right (1). Total 5 steps.\n\noption2: move to4 (3 steps), close right (1), move to2 (2 steps), close left (1). Total 7 steps.\n\nSo option1 is better, steps 5.\n\nSo code returns 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, pos=3, l=3, r=3.\n\nWait, l=r=3. So close_left is 3>1: yes. close_right is 3<5: yes.\n\nSo steps for option1: |3-3|=0 +1 + (3-3)=0 → 1 step.\n\noption2: |3-3|=0 +1 +0 →1 step.\n\nSo minimal is 1.\n\nWait, but wait: in this case, l=3 and r=3, which is exactly the desired range. So why are we trying to close anything?\n\nBecause l=3>1, so close_left is true. Also, r=3<5, so close_right is true.\n\nSo according to the problem statement, we need to close all tabs outside [3,3], which is tabs 1-2 and 4-5.\n\nSo steps needed are 1+1=2? Or wait, perhaps the code is miscalculating.\n\nWait, no: according to the code, for this case, close_left and close_right are both true.\n\nSo steps for option1: move to3 (0 steps), close left (1 step), move to3 (0 steps), close right (1 step). Total 2 steps.\n\nSimilarly for option2: move to3 (0 steps), close right (1), move to3 (0), close left (1). Total 2 steps.\n\nSo code returns 2 steps.\n\nBut wait, why can't we just close left and right in one step? No, because each step can only do one action.\n\nSo yes, it's correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle this correctly.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=5, l=3, r=3.\n\nclose_left: 3>1 → yes.\n\nclose_right:3<5 → yes.\n\noption1: move to3 (2 steps), close left (1), move to3 (0 steps), close right (1). Total 4 steps.\n\noption2: move to3 (2 steps), close right (1), move to3 (0 steps), close left (1). Total 4 steps.\n\nSo code returns 4 steps.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specific range [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves calculating the optimal steps to move the cursor and close the necessary tabs efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Need to Close Tabs**: Determine if tabs need to be closed to the left of `l` or to the right of `r`. This is done by checking if `l > 1` (close left) and if `r < n` (close right).\n2. **Check for No Closure Needed**: If no tabs need to be closed (i.e., `l == 1` and `r == n`), the result is 0.\n3. **Calculate Steps for Both Scenarios**: If both left and right tabs need to be closed, compute the steps required for two scenarios:\n   - Closing left tabs first, then right tabs.\n   - Closing right tabs first, then left tabs.\n4. **Choose Minimum Steps**: Compare the steps from both scenarios and choose the minimum.\n5. **Handle Single Side Closure**: If only left or right tabs need to be closed, compute the steps directly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nclose_left = l > 1\nclose_right = r < n\n\nif not close_left and not close_right:\n    print(0)\nelif close_left and close_right:\n    option1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l)\n    option2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l)\n    print(min(option1, option2))\nelif close_left:\n    print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\nelse:\n    print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Identify Tabs to Close**: Check if `l > 1` and `r < n` to determine if tabs on either side of the desired range need closing.\n2. **Immediate Check**: If no tabs need closing, output 0 immediately.\n3. **Calculate Steps for Both Scenarios**: When both sides need closing, calculate the steps for moving to `l` first and then `r`, and vice versa. The steps include moving to the target position, closing the tabs, and moving back if necessary.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the minimum steps from the calculated scenarios or the direct steps if only one side needs closing.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal steps required to close the necessary tabs, considering both possible orders of operations.",
