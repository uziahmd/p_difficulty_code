Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Guard Duty,\" and from the description, I understand that we need to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases in such a way that each base has exactly one guardian, each spaceship also has exactly one assigned base (so it's a perfect matching), and importantly, no two paths between a base and its spaceship intersect. \n\nHmm, right, the key here is that the paths shouldn't intersect. So each path is a straight line from the base to the spaceship, and these lines must not cross each other. So the challenge is to find if there's a way to pair the R spaceships with B bases so that all these conditions are satisfied.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Since R and B are both up to 10, which isn't too big, maybe a brute-force approach is feasible. But wait, the constraints also mention that no three points are colinear, so that's helpful because it avoids some edge cases where multiple points lie on the same line.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input: R and B, then R spaceship coordinates, followed by B base coordinates.\n2. Check if R equals B. Because each spaceship must be assigned to exactly one base and vice versa, the number of spaceships must equal the number of bases. If R != B, immediately output 'No'.\n3. Generate all possible perfect matchings between the spaceships and bases.\n4. For each perfect matching, check two things:\n   a) Each spaceship is assigned to a unique base.\n   b) The lines connecting the bases to their assigned spaceships do not intersect each other.\n5. If any such matching exists, output 'Yes'. Otherwise, output 'No'.\n\nWait, but generating all possible perfect matchings could be computationally expensive if R is 10, but since 10! is 3,628,800, which is manageable for Python, especially considering the rest of the checks per matching are manageable.\n\nBut wait, R and B are up to 10, but the number of possible perfect matchings is (R choose B) multiplied by B! / (B-R)! ), but since R must equal B, it's just R! which is 10! as above. So for R=10, 10! is about 3.6 million, which is acceptable for a brute-force approach.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- First, read all the points into separate lists: one for spaceships and another for bases.\n- Then, generate all possible permutations of B bases, selecting R of them? Wait no, because R equals B. So it's a permutation of the bases, assigning each base to a spaceship. So for each permutation of the bases (since each base is used exactly once), we can pair the i-th base with the i-th spaceship in the permutation.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the permutation would be a mapping from spaceship indices to base indices. Or perhaps, the other way around. Let me think: the perfect matching is a bijection between spaceships and bases. So for each spaceship, assign it to exactly one base, and each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship.\n\nSo to generate all possible matchings, we can iterate through all possible permutations of the B bases. For each permutation, we can pair the first spaceship with the first base in the permutation, the second with the second, etc. Wait, no—because the order of the spaceships matters. Oh, right, because each spaceship is unique. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider all possible matchings where each spaceship is assigned to a distinct base, and the lines don't cross.\n\nBut generating all possible matchings is equivalent to finding all possible permutations of the bases, and for each permutation, checking whether the resulting assignment satisfies the non-crossing condition.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the algorithm outline is:\n\nFor each possible permutation of the B bases:\n    Assign the i-th spaceship to the i-th base in the permutation.\n    Then, check if any two lines connecting spaceship to base intersect.\n    If for any permutation, none of the lines intersect, return 'Yes'.\n\nIf after checking all permutations none satisfy, return 'No'.\n\nWait, but wait. How do we check for intersections between the lines?\n\nEach line is from a spaceship to its assigned base. So for each permutation, we have R lines (but R equals B). We need to make sure that no two lines cross each other.\n\nSo for the permutation, collect all the lines, and for every pair of lines, check if they intersect. If any pair does, this permutation is invalid. Only if none of the pairs intersect is the permutation acceptable.\n\nBut wait, R can be up to 10, so for each permutation, the number of pairs is C(10, 2) = 45. Which is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop over all possible",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. Additionally, the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B). Then read the coordinates of the spaceships and bases.\n2. **Check for Perfect Matching**: Since each spaceship must be assigned to exactly one base and vice versa, R must equal B. If they are not equal, output 'No'.\n3. **Generate Permutations**: For each permutation of the B bases, check if the resulting assignment of spaceships to bases forms non-intersecting paths.\n4. **Check for Intersection**: For each permutation, generate the lines connecting spaceships to their assigned bases and ensure no two lines intersect. If any permutation satisfies this condition, output 'Yes'. If none do, output 'No'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef readints():\n    return list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nR, B = map(int, input().split())\nspaceships = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(R)]\nbases = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(B)]\n\nif R != B:\n    print(\"No\")\n    exit()\n\nfound = False\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(bases):\n    lines = []\n    for i in range(R):\n        s = spaceships[i]\n        b = perm[i]\n        lines.append((s, b))\n    \n    valid = True\n    for i in range(R):\n        for j in range(i+1, R):\n            line1 = lines[i]\n            line2 = lines[j]\n            s1, b1 = line1\n            s2, b2 = line2\n            x1, y1 = s1\n            x2, y2 = s2\n            bx, by = b1\n            bx2, by2 = b2\n            \n            denom = (x1 - bx) * (y2 - by2) - (y1 - by) * (x2 - bx2)\n            if denom == 0:\n                continue\n            u = (x1 - bx) * (y2 - by2) - (y1 - by) * (x2 - bx2)\n            v = (x1 - bx) * (bx - bx2) - (y1 - by) * (x2 - bx2)\n            w = (y1 - by) * (bx - bx2) - (x1 - bx) * (by - by2)\n            \n            if u * v + w == 0:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n    if valid:\n        found = True\n        break\n\nprint(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the input values and stores the coordinates of the spaceships and bases.\n2. **Perfect Matching Check**: It first checks if the number of spaceships equals the number of bases. If not, it immediately outputs 'No'.\n3. **Generating Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, it generates all possible permutations of the bases.\n4. **Checking Lines for Intersection**: For each permutation, it generates lines between each spaceship and its assigned base. It then checks if any two lines intersect using the cross product method to avoid division and potential floating-point errors.\n5. **Output Result**: If any permutation results in non-intersecting lines, it prints 'Yes'. If all permutations fail, it prints 'No'.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible assignments and correctly determine if a valid non-intersecting configuration exists.",
