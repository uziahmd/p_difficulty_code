And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Average Sleep Time.\" Hmm.\n\nThe task says that Polycarp has been keeping track of his sleep times for n days. But a week in Berland is k days long. So the doctor wants to find the average sleep time per week over all possible consecutive weeks. Oh right, like sliding windows of size k.\n\nSo the input gives me two integers, n and k, followed by a list of n integers representing each day's sleep time. My goal is to compute the average of these k-day windows.\n\nWait, how do I approach this? Well, let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to process all possible consecutive k-day windows in the array a. For each window, calculate the sum, then find the average of all those sums.\n\nLet me think about the example given. Like in the first sample input, n=3, k=2, a = [3,4,7]. So the possible windows are [3,4], sum 7; [4,7], sum 11. So there are 2 weeks. The average is (7+11)/2 = 9, which matches the output.\n\nAnother example: when n=k, there's only one window, so the average is the sum divided by 1.\n\nSo the approach is to:\n\n1. Compute all the possible sums of consecutive k elements.\n2. Sum all those sums to get the total.\n3. Divide by the number of windows, which is (n -k +1), to get the average.\n\nBut wait, if n is up to 2e5, then a naive approach where I compute each window's sum by iterating through the array each time would be O(n*k), which could be up to 4e10 operations—way too slow. That won't work for large inputs.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way. How can I compute the sums quickly?\n\nAh, right! Using a sliding window technique with a prefix sum array.\n\nYes, the idea is to precompute the prefix sums, then for each window, the sum can be found in constant time using the prefix sums.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Compute the prefix sum array. Let's say prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a[0], prefix[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc. So prefix[i] is the sum of the first i elements.\n- Then, for each window starting at index i (0-based) and ending at i + k -1, the sum is prefix[i + k] - prefix[i].\n- So, we can loop from i=0 to i=(n-k), calculate each window's sum as prefix[i+k] - prefix[i], add it to a running total, and then compute the average.\n\nThis way, the time complexity becomes O(n), which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n, k and the array a.\n2. Compute the prefix sum array.\n3. Iterate through each possible window, compute the sum using the prefix array.\n4. Sum all these window sums.\n5. Divide by the number of windows (n -k +1) to get the average.\n6. Output the average with sufficient precision.\n\nWait, but how to handle the prefix sum correctly. Let me think about the indices.\n\nSuppose the array a has indices 0 to n-1. The prefix sum array will have n+1 elements, where prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a[0], prefix[2] = a[0]+a[1], ..., prefix[n] = sum of all a's.\n\nThen, for each window starting at i (0-based), the end is i + k - 1. So the sum is prefix[i +k] - prefix[i].\n\nFor example, in the first sample:\n\na = [3,4,7]\nprefix = [0, 3,7,14]\n\nFor i=0, window is 0..1: sum is 7, which is prefix[2]-prefix[0] =7.\ni=1: window is 1..2: sum is 11, which is prefix[3]-prefix[1] =14-3=11.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo now, the code plan is:\n\nRead n and k from input. Then read the list of a's.\n\nCompute the prefix sum array.\n\nInitialize total_sum to 0.\n\nFor i in range(0, n -k +1):\n    sum_window = prefix[i +k] - prefix[i]\n    total_sum += sum_window\n\naverage = total_sum / (n -k +1)\n\nThen print the average with enough decimal digits.\n\nNow, handling the precision is important. The problem says that the output should have at least 6 digits after the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of k days from a given list of sleep times for n days. The goal is to efficiently calculate this average using a sliding window technique.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given a sequence of sleep times and need to find the average sleep time per week over all possible consecutive weeks of length k. This involves summing up each possible window of k days and then computing the average of these sums.\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Instead of recalculating the sum for each window from scratch, which would be inefficient, we use a prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n3. **Prefix Sum Array**: The prefix sum array helps in efficiently calculating the sum of any subarray. For a given window starting at index i and ending at index j, the sum can be found as `prefix[j+1] - prefix[i]`.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Using the prefix sum array, we can compute the sum of each window in O(1) time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n), which is efficient for large values of n up to 200,000.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n    \n    total = 0.0\n    num_windows = n - k + 1\n    for i in range(num_windows):\n        current_sum = prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]\n        total += current_sum\n    \n    average = total / num_windows\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into integers n, k, and the list of sleep times.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: A prefix sum array is constructed where each element at index i represents the sum of the first i elements of the sleep time list.\n3. **Summing Windows**: Using the prefix sum array, each window of k days is summed efficiently. The total sum of all windows is accumulated.\n4. **Computing Average**: The total sum of all windows is divided by the number of windows to get the average sleep time per week.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to ensure accuracy as required by the problem constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and correct, handling all edge cases and providing the required precision.",
