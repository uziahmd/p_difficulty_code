He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Prefixes and Suffixes.\" Hmm, Ivan has a string s of length n, and I don't know it. He tells me all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so lengths from 1 to n-1). But he doesn't say which are which—whether they're prefixes or suffixes. My task is to determine for each of the 2n-2 given strings whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the actual string s.\n\nWait, the output is a string of 'P's and 'S's where each character corresponds to one of the input strings. So for each input string, I have to decide if it's a prefix (mark as P) or a suffix (mark as S).\n\nThe first thing I need to figure out is how to determine the correct labels for each string. Since the problem says that the input is such that exactly two strings exist for each length from 1 to n-1, and they can be in any order, but each is either a prefix or a suffix.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the possible string s. The string s must have certain prefixes and suffixes. For example, all prefixes are the first k characters for k=1 to n-1, and all suffixes are the last k characters for k=1 to n-1.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says that the given strings are all the prefixes and suffixes, except the full string. So for each length l in 1..n-1, there are two strings: one is a prefix of some possible s, and the other is a suffix. Or maybe both could be prefixes of different possible s's? No, because the problem says that the given set is consistent with some s. So for each l, the two strings are such that one is a prefix of s, and the other is a suffix of s.\n\nHmm. So for each l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\nSo the approach is to find a way to assign each string as either a prefix or a suffix for its length l, such that when we build the string s, all the prefixes and suffixes are correctly assigned.\n\nBut how do I find which ones are prefixes and which are suffixes?\n\nI remember that in a string s, the proper prefixes and suffixes form a kind of chain. For example, the prefix of length k must be a substring of the prefix of length k+1. Similarly for suffixes.\n\nWait, but for the entire set, the prefixes form a tree-like structure. Each longer prefix contains the shorter ones. For example, if the prefix of length 3 is 'abc', then the prefix of length 2 could be 'ab' or 'bc'? No, wait, no. Because the prefix of length 3 must start with the prefix of length 2. So the prefix of length 3 must have the prefix of length 2 as its first two letters. So the prefixes form a chain where each longer one includes the shorter.\n\nSimilarly for the suffixes. The suffix of length 3 must consist of the last three letters, which must include the suffix of length 2 as its last two letters.\n\nSo for the given list of strings, for each length l, the two strings can be ordered in a way that one is a superset of the other, or the other way around. Wait, no. Because for prefixes, each longer prefix must be an extension of the shorter. So for l=3, the prefix could be 'a', 'aa', 'aaa', etc., but each step must add one more character at the end.\n\nSo perhaps the strategy is to group the strings by their lengths and for each group, determine which string is the prefix and which is the suffix based on whether one is a proper prefix of the other.\n\nWait, but for a given length l, the two strings could be any two strings that are both prefixes or both suffixes, but that's not necessarily true. Because for each l, exactly one is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\nWait, no. Because for each l, the two strings are of that length and part of the overall set. One of them is a prefix, the other is a suffix of the same length.\n\nSo for example, for l=3, the two strings could be 'aba' and 'bab'. Then, neither is a prefix of the other, but one could be a prefix of the overall string and the other a suffix.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because the overall string would have a certain structure. Let me think: if the overall string is 'ababa', then for l=3, the prefix is 'aba' and the suffix is 'aba' as well. Oh, right! So in that case, both could be the same, but that's not allowed because the problem says that for each l, there are exactly two strings. So if the two are the same, that's a problem. But the problem statement says that the inputs are such that they form a valid set, so that won't happen.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to correspond to some string. So each pair for a length l consists of two different strings, one being a prefix and the other a suffix.\n\nSo back to the problem: for each l, we have two strings, s1 and s2. We need to decide which is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nHow to determine that? Well, let's think about the structure of the full string s. The full string s must have, for each l, a prefix p_l and a suffix q_l, where p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n-1} form a chain of prefixes, and similarly for the suffixes q_1, q_2, ..., q_{n-1}.\n\nWait, no. Because the prefixes of s are the first l characters, for l from 1 to n-1. So each p_l is the prefix of s of length l, and p_{l+1} must start with p_l.\n\nSimilarly, the suffixes q_l are the last l characters of s, so q_{l} is the last l characters of s, and q_{l+1} must end with q_l.\n\nSo for each l, p_l must be the first l characters of s, and q_l must be the last l characters.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings given are p_l and q_l, but we don't know which is which.\n\nSo the idea is to find a way to assign each string as either p or q, such that for all l, the p_l and q_l satisfy the above conditions.\n\nNow, the key is that for l and l+1, the p_{l+1} must start with p_l, and q_{l+1} must end with q_l.\n\nSo for each l, if I can find which of the two strings is p_l and which is q_l, then I can build the chain upwards and downwards.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, for each l, the two strings can be ordered such that one is a prefix of the other. Then, for l, one is p_l, the other is q_l.\n\nWait, no. Because for l=1, p_1 is the first character, and q_1 is the last character. They could be the same, like in the second example, where s is 'aaa'. So for l=1, the two strings are 'a' and 'a'—wait, but the problem says that for each l, the two strings are different. So maybe the initial example was a typo.\n\nWait, the note in the example says that for the second test case, the answer is 'PPSS', but the only possible s is 'aaa'. So for l=1, the two strings are 'a' and 'a' again. That seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem allows for the same string to be both a prefix and a suffix for the same length l. But according to the problem statement, the input is such that for each l, there are exactly two strings, which are prefixes and suffixes of some s. So for l=1, the two strings could be the same, but that would mean that the first and last character are the same. But that's allowed.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each l from 1 to n-1, collect the two strings.\n\n- For each l, determine which string is the prefix (p_l) and which is the suffix (q_l).\n\nOnce we have p_l and q_l for all l, we can build the full string s.\n\nBut how to find p_l and q_l for each l?\n\nAn alternative approach is to find the longest possible chain for the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find the full string s by building the maximum possible prefix and the maximum possible suffix, and then see if they fit together.\n\nAlternatively, here's another idea: the full string s can be uniquely determined by the prefixes and suffixes. Because for each l, the prefix p_l is the first l characters, and the suffix q_l is the last l characters. So the full string s is built by the intersection of these constraints.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAnother thought: for each l, the prefix p_l must be a substring of s starting at position 0, and the suffix q_l must be a substring ending at position n-1.\n\nSo, for each l, the p_l and q_l must agree on the overlapping part when considering their positions in s.\n\nFor example, the last character of p_l (which is the l-th character of s) must equal the first character of q_l (which is also the l-th character from the end of s). So p_l[-1] == q_l[0], because s[l-1] = p_l[-1] and s[n-l] = q_l[0].\n\nWait, yes! Because s's l-th character from the start is the last character of p_l, and the l-th character from the end is the first character of q_l. So for the full string s, these two must be equal.\n\nSo for each l, the two strings must satisfy that the last character of the prefix equals the first character of the suffix.\n\nWait, but wait: For a particular l, the two strings are the prefix and suffix. So for that l, the prefix ends with some character c, and the suffix starts with c. So the two strings must have the same first and last character for that l.\n\nBut in our input, for each l, the two strings may or may not have this property.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the input is valid, meaning that there exists some s where the given strings are the prefixes and suffixes. So for each l, the two strings must satisfy that the last character of the prefix candidate equals the first character of the suffix candidate.\n\nBecause in s, the l-th character from the start is equal to the l-th character from the end.\n\nSo for each l, among the two strings, one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. So for that l, the last character of the prefix must equal the first character of the suffix.\n\nWait, no: the last character of the prefix is s[l-1], and the first character of the suffix is s[n-l]. These two must be equal.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for each l, the two strings for that l must have their last character of the prefix equal to the first character of the suffix.\n\nSo for each l, among the two possible strings, one will be the prefix, the other the suffix. So for that l, the prefix's last character should match the suffix's first character.\n\nSo, for each l, I can check which of the two strings satisfies that condition.\n\nWait, but how? Because for each l, I don't know which is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nSo, for each l, I can compute for both possibilities:\n\nCase 1: s1 is prefix, s2 is suffix.\n\nCheck if s1's last character == s2's first character.\n\nCase 2: s2 is prefix, s1 is suffix.\n\nCheck if s2's last character == s1's first character.\n\nIf for case 1, it's true, then maybe s1 is the prefix and s2 is the suffix.\n\nElse, case 2.\n\nBut wait, for some l, both cases may hold. How to handle that?\n\nWell, perhaps for some l, both possibilities are possible. Then, we have to choose which option is consistent across all l.\n\nThis suggests that the problem can be approached by trying to assign each string as prefix or suffix for each l, ensuring that for all l, the assignment is consistent.\n\nBut since the number of possible assignments is 2^(n-1), and n can be up to 100, this approach is computationally expensive.\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's assume that for each l, the two strings are the prefix and the suffix, and for each l, the prefix must start with the previous prefix, and the suffix must end with the previous suffix.\n\nWait, perhaps for the entire chain of prefixes, each p_{l+1} must start with p_l. Similarly, each q_{l+1} must end with q_l.\n\nSo, for the prefixes, p_1 is the first character, p_2 starts with p_1, p_3 starts with p_2, etc.\n\nSimilarly, for the suffixes, q_1 is the last character, q_2 ends with q_1, q_3 ends with q_2, etc.\n\nSo, for the prefixes, the entire sequence forms a chain where each is a prefix of the next.\n\nSame for the suffixes, but in reverse.\n\nSo, for each l, the prefix p_l must be the first l characters of the full string s.\n\nWhich implies that p_1 is the first character, p_2 is the first two characters, p_3 is the first three, and so on.\n\nSimilarly for the suffixes.\n\nSo, for the prefixes, the chain is p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n-1}, and each p_{i+1} starts with p_i.\n\nSimilarly, for the suffixes, the chain is q_1, q_2, ..., q_{n-1}, and each q_i is the suffix of q_{i+1}.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings for that l must be either p_l and q_l, or q_l and p_l, but in a way that the chains are consistent.\n\nWait, but for each l, one of the two is p_l and the other is q_l.\n\nSo, the steps I can take:\n\n1. For each l, collect the two possible strings.\n\n2. For each l, try both possibilities (s1 as prefix, s2 as suffix; or s2 as prefix, s1 as suffix) and check which option is possible, i.e., whether the last character of the prefix matches the first character of the suffix.\n\n3. Once a choice is made for l, update the possible prefixes and suffixes for larger l.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit vague. Maybe I can model the possible prefixes and suffixes as sets.\n\nAlternatively, here's a more concrete approach:\n\nWe can model the possible prefixes as a trie. For each l, the prefix must be a prefix of the full string s, so it must be a child of the previous prefix.\n\nSimilarly, the suffixes must form a trie where each is a suffix of the full string, so each suffix must be a child of the previous suffix.\n\nSo, for each l, we can determine the possible prefixes and suffixes.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to consider that for the entire s, the set of prefixes is a chain where each is a proper prefix of the next. Similarly for the suffixes.\n\nSo, for the prefixes, the order must be p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n-1}, where p_1 is the first character, p_2 is first two, etc. Similarly for the suffixes.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings for that l must be either p_l and q_l, or vice versa.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings are the candidates for p_l and q_l.\n\nBut how to find which is which.\n\nAn alternative idea is to build the possible s string by combining the possible prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to realize that the full string s can be constructed by the intersection of the possible prefixes and suffixes.\n\nWait, for the full string s, the prefix p_{n-1} is the first n-1 characters, and the suffix q_{n-1} is the last n-1 characters. So the full string s must start with p_{n-1} and end with q_{n-1}.\n\nMoreover, p_{n-1} and q_{n-1} must agree on the overlapping part of s.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find the full string s by combining the possible prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach is to find for each l, the possible candidates for p_l and q_l, and then for each possible assignment, check if the resulting chains are consistent.\n\nBut since n is up to 100, and for each l there are 2 choices, this approach is O(2^{n}), which is not feasible for n=100.\n\nSo, we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps the full string s can be reconstructed as follows:\n\nThe full string s must start with the p_{n-1} and end with q_{n-1}.\n\nMoreover, the first n-1 characters are p_{n-1}, and the last n-1 are q_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the full string s must be equal to p_{n-1} concatenated with some character, but wait, no. Because s has length n. So s is p_{n-1} plus a new character, but the suffix q_{n-1} is the last n-1 characters, which must be equal to the last n-1 characters of s.\n\nSo, s = [some string] + [q_{n-1}].\n\nBut s is also p_{n-1} followed by a single character.\n\nWait, no. Because p_{n-1} is the first n-1 characters of s. So s is p_{n-1} + c, where c is the nth character.\n\nSimilarly, q_{n-1} is the last n-1 characters of s, so s is some string ending with q_{n-1}.\n\nSo, putting it together, s must be equal to p_{n-1} + c, and also equal to s' where s' ends with q_{n-1}.\n\nMoreover, the last n-1 characters of s are q_{n-1}.\n\nSo, s is p_{n-1} + c, and the last n-1 characters of s are q_{n-1}.\n\nThus, the last n-1 characters of p_{n-1} + c are q_{n-1}.\n\nWhich means that the last n-1 characters of p_{n-1} + c must be q_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the (n-1)th character from the end of s is the first character of q_{n-1}.\n\nAnd the nth character is c.\n\nSo, the first character of q_{n-1} must be equal to the (n-1)th character of s, which is the last character of p_{n-1}.\n\nAnd the last character of q_{n-1} is c.\n\nSo, s = p_{n-1} + c, and q_{n-1} is the last n-1 characters of s.\n\nThus, q_{n-1} is (p_{n-1} + c)[-(n-1): ].\n\nBut also, for the full string s, the prefix p_{n-2} must be the first n-2 characters of p_{n-1}, and the suffix q_{n-2} must be the last n-2 characters of q_{n-1}.\n\nSo, recursively, the structure is built upon the smaller l.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to build the possible s by starting from the largest l (n-1) and work our way down.\n\nSo, for l = n-1:\n\nWe have two strings: s1 and s2. One is p_{n-1}, the other is q_{n-1}.\n\nWe need to determine which is which.\n\nBut how? Well, the full string s is p_{n-1} + c, and the last n-1 characters of s are q_{n-1}.\n\nSo, s = p_{n-1} + c.\n\nSo, q_{n-1} must be equal to s[-(n-1): ], which is (p_{n-1} + c)[- (n-1): ].\n\nWhich is (p_{n-1}[1:] + c).\n\nWait, no. Let me think: suppose n-1 is 3, then s is 4 characters long. The last 3 are s[1:4] = p_{n-1}[1:] + c.\n\nSo, in general, q_{n-1} is p_{n-1}[1:] + c.\n\nSo, for l = n-1, the two possible options are:\n\nOption 1: s1 is p_{n-1}, s2 is q_{n-1}.\n\nThen, s2 must be equal to s1[1:] + c.\n\nOption 2: s2 is p_{n-1}, s1 is q_{n-1}.\n\nThen, s1 must be equal to s2[1:] + c.\n\nSo, for each of these options, we can check if s2 starts with s1[1:] (for option 1) or s1 starts with s2[1:] (for option 2).\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nIn option 1: s1 is p_{n-1}, which is the first n-1 characters of s.\n\ns2 is q_{n-1}, which is the last n-1 characters of s.\n\nSo, s2 must be the substring of s starting from position 1 to the end.\n\nWhich is s[1:].\n\nSince s is p_{n-1} + c, s[1:] is s1[1:] + c.\n\nSo, s2 must be equal to s1[1:] + c.\n\nSimilarly, in option 2: s2 is p_{n-1}, s1 is q_{n-1}.\n\nSo, s1 must be equal to s2[1:] + c.\n\nSo, for l = n-1, we can test both possibilities:\n\nCase 1: s1 is p_{n-1}, s2 is q_{n-1}.\n\nCheck if s2 starts with s1[1:] and ends with a character c not present in s1.\n\nWait, but more precisely, s2 must be equal to s1[1:] + c.\n\nSo, for case 1, check if s2 == s1[1:] + c, where c is a single character.\n\nSimilarly for case 2: check if s1 == s2[1:] + c.\n\nBut wait, c is the nth character of s, which is not present in p_{n-1} or q_{n-1}, because p_{n-1} is the first n-1, and q_{n-1} is the last n-1.\n\nSo, c is a new character not present in p_{n-1} or q_{n-1}.\n\nSo, in case 1, s2 must end with a new character c, which is not present in s1.\n\nSo, for case 1:\n\nif s2 is equal to s1[1:] + some_char.\n\nSimilarly for case 2.\n\nSo, for each of the two possible assignments, we can check whether s2 is formed by appending a new character to s1[1:], or s1 is formed by appending a new character to s2[1:].\n\nOnce we have determined which is p_{n-1} and which is q_{n-1}, we can proceed to determine the lower l's.\n\nFor example, for l = n-2:\n\nWe have two strings, say a and b. One is p_{n-2}, the other is q_{n-2}.\n\np_{n-2} must be the first n-2 characters of p_{n-1}, which is a prefix of s.\n\nq_{n-2} must be the last n-2 characters of q_{n-1}, which is a suffix of s.\n\nSo, once we have p_{n-1} and q_{n-1}, we can find p_{n-2} and q_{n-2} as follows:\n\np_{n-2} must be the prefix of p_{n-1} of length n-2.\n\nq_{n-2} must be the suffix of q_{n-1} of length n-2.\n\nWait, but the two strings for l = n-2 could be in any order, so we need to see which is p and which is q.\n\nBut wait, for each l, the two strings are p_l and q_l, which are the prefix and suffix of length l for s.\n\nSo, for l = n-2, the two strings are p_{n-2} and q_{n-2}, but they may not be directly related to p_{n-1} and q_{n-1}.\n\nWait, no. Because p_{n-1} is the first n-1 characters of s, and p_{n-2} is the first n-2. So, p_{n-2} is a prefix of p_{n-1}.\n\nSimilarly, q_{n-2} is a suffix of q_{n-1}.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings are the prefix and suffix of that length.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings are the p_l and q_l, but for l < n-1, they are not directly connected to the higher l's except via their prefixes and suffixes.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, the two strings are p_l and q_l, which must form a chain with p_{l+1} and q_{l+1}.\n\nSo, perhaps for each l, we can find the possible pairs (a, b) such that a is the prefix and b is the suffix, and a is a prefix of some possible s, and b is a suffix of that s.\n\nBut this seems a bit abstract.\n\nAnother approach: Once we have determined p_{n-1} and q_{n-1}, then for l = n-2, the p_{n-2} must be a prefix of p_{n-1}, and the q_{n-2} must be a suffix of q_{n-1}.\n\nSo, for each l, the p_l must be a prefix of p_{l+1}, and q_l must be a suffix of q_{l+1}.\n\nThus, for l = n-2, the two strings for that l are either (p_{n-2}, q_{n-2}) or (q_{n-2}, p_{n-2}).\n\nBut wait, for l = n-2, the two strings are the p_{n-2} and q_{n-2}.\n\nSo, for l = n-2, the two strings must satisfy:\n\np_{n-2} is the first n-2 characters of p_{n-1}, and q_{n-2} is the last n-2 characters of q_{n-1}.\n\nSo, once p_{n-1} and q_{n-1} are known, we can extract p_{n-2} and q_{n-2} from them.\n\nBut wait, the two strings for l = n-2 may not match exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps the two strings for l = n-2 are the p_{n-2} and q_{n-2}, but one of them is a prefix of p_{n-1}, and the other is a suffix of q_{n-1}.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings are the p_l and q_l, which must be consistent with the higher l's.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For l = n-1, determine which of the two strings is p_{n-1} and which is q_{n-1}.\n\n   To do this, check if s2 == s1[1:] + c, where c is a new character not in s1. Or s1 == s2[1:] + c.\n\n   If neither is true, then something's wrong, but the problem says the input is valid.\n\n2. Once p_{n-1} and q_{n-1} are known, then for l = n-2:\n\n   The two strings are either (a, b) or (b, a), where a is p_{n-2} and b is q_{n-2}.\n\n   So, a must be the first n-2 characters of p_{n-1}.\n\n   And b must be the last n-2 characters of q_{n-1}.\n\n   So, among the two strings for l = n-2, one must be a's prefix, the other must be b's suffix.\n\n   Wait, no. Because a is p_{n-2}, which is the first n-2 characters of p_{n-1}. So a is a prefix of p_{n-1}.\n\n   Similarly, b is q_{n-2}, which is the last n-2 characters of q_{n-1}.\n\n   So, for the two strings at l = n-2, one is a, the other is b.\n\n   So, for the two strings s_a and s_b, one must be equal to a and the other to b.\n\n   So, for each possibility:\n\n   Case 1: s_a is a, s_b is b.\n\n   Check if a is the first n-2 chars of p_{n-1}, and b is the last n-2 chars of q_{n-1}.\n\n   Case 2: s_b is a, s_a is b.\n\n   Same checks.\n\n   Choose the assignment that works.\n\n3. Repeat this process for l = n-3, n-4, etc., until l=1.\n\nAt each step, for l, the two strings are the current p_l and q_l. We need to determine which is which based on the previous l+1's p and q.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings are the candidates for p_l and q_l.\n\nEach candidate must satisfy:\n\np_l is a prefix of p_{l+1}.\n\nq_l is a suffix of q_{l+1}.\n\nAdditionally, for the current l, the p_l and q_l must satisfy that the last character of p_l is equal to the first character of q_l.\n\nWait, yes! Because in s, the l-th character from the start is the last character of p_l, and the l-th character from the end is the first character of q_l. So for all l, p_l's last character must equal q_l's first character.\n\nSo, for each l, after assigning p_l and q_l, we must ensure that p_l[-1] == q_l[0].\n\nThis gives us a way to cross-check our assignments.\n\nSo, the algorithm steps would be:\n\nFor each l from n-1 down to 1:\n\n   For each possible assignment of the two strings as p_l and q_l:\n\n      Check if p_l is a prefix of p_{l+1} (if l+1 <=n-1).\n\n      Check if q_l is a suffix of q_{l+1} (if l+1 <=n-1).\n\n      Also, check that p_l[-1] == q_l[0].\n\n      If all conditions are met, assign p_l and q_l and proceed.\n\nBut this is still a bit vague. Perhaps a better approach is to model the possible p and q for each l as we go down from n-1 to 1.\n\nLet me outline the steps more concretely.\n\nInitialize:\n\nFor l = n-1:\n\n   Let the two strings be s1 and s2.\n\n   Check if s2 can be formed by appending a character to s1 (i.e., s2 == s1[1:] + c), where c is a single character not present in s1.\n\n   Or, check if s1 can be formed by appending a character to s2 (s1 == s2[1:] + c).\n\n   If s2 starts with s1[1:], then s1 is p_{n-1}, s2 is q_{n-1}.\n\n   Else, if s1 starts with s2[1:], then s2 is p_{n-1}, s1 is q_{n-1}.\n\n   Once p_{n-1} and q_{n-1} are determined, proceed.\n\nFor l = n-2:\n\n   The two strings are s_a and s_b.\n\n   We need to assign one as p_{n-2} and the other as q_{n-2}.\n\n   The conditions are:\n\n   - p_{n-2} must be the first n-2 characters of p_{n-1}.\n\n   - q_{n-2} must be the last n-2 characters of q_{n-1}.\n\n   - p_{n-2}[-1] must equal q_{n-2}[0].\n\n   So, check if s_a is equal to p_{n-1}[0 : n-2], and s_b is equal to q_{n-1}[- (n-2) : ].\n\n   Or vice versa.\n\n   Also, the last character of s_a must equal the first character of s_b.\n\nOnce p_{n-2} and q_{n-2} are determined, proceed.\n\nRepeat this for each l down to 1.\n\nOnce all l's are processed, the labels for each string are determined.\n\nFinally, construct the output string by going through each input string, checking if it was assigned as a prefix or suffix.\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\n- Read all the input strings, grouped by their lengths.\n\n- For each l, store the two strings.\n\n- For l from n-1 down to 1:\n\n   For the two strings in l, try both possible assignments (s1 as p, s2 as q; and s2 as p, s1 as q).\n\n   For each assignment, check:\n\n      - For p, if l > 1, p must be a prefix of p_{l+1}.\n\n      - For q, if l > 1, q must be a suffix of q_{l+1}.\n\n      - The last character of p must equal the first character of q.\n\n   If an assignment meets these conditions, proceed with that assignment.\n\nOnce all assignments are made, the full s can be reconstructed, and the output can be generated.\n\nWait, but reconstructing s may not be necessary. Because for the output, we just need to mark each input string as P or S based on whether it's a prefix or suffix of the full s.\n\nBut perhaps during the assignment process, we can track for each string whether it's a prefix or suffix.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe can create two dictionaries, one for prefixes and one for suffixes.\n\nFor each l, we'll assign the two strings to either prefix or suffix.\n\nOnce all assignments are done, for each input string, we look up its length l, and based on whether it was assigned as a prefix, mark 'P' or 'S'.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead all the 2n-2 lines into a list.\n\nGroup the strings by their length. For each l from 1 to n-1, there are two strings.\n\nCreate a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the two strings for a given l.\n\nThen, process l from n-1 down to 1:\n\n   For each possible assignment of the two strings as p and q.\n\n   Check if p is a prefix of p_prev (if l > 1).\n\n   Check if q is a suffix of q_prev (if l > 1).\n\n   Check if p's last char == q's first char.\n\n   If all conditions are satisfied, assign p and q to current l.\n\nProceed.\n\nOnce all l's are processed, collect the assignments and generate the output.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nLet me think about data structures.\n\nWe can represent for each l, the two strings. For each l, we'll track which string is p and which is q.\n\nWe can represent this as a dictionary where the key is l, and the value is a tuple (p_str, q_str).\n\nWe'll initialize this for l = n-1.\n\nOnce that is done, for l = n-2 down to 1:\n\n   Get the two strings for l.\n\n   Try both possible assignments.\n\n   For each possible assignment:\n\n      Check if p is a prefix of the p for l+1 (if l+1 exists).\n\n      Check if q is a suffix of the q for l+1 (if l+1 exists).\n\n      Check if p's last character == q's first character.\n\n   If an assignment meets all conditions, proceed.\n\nOnce all assignments are done, the output can be generated.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read the input:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nstrings = []\nfor _ in range(2*n -2):\n    s = input().strip()\n    strings.append(s)\n\nThen, group the strings by their length.\n\nlength_to_strings = {}\nfor s in strings:\n    l = len(s)\n    if l not in length_to_strings:\n        length_to_strings[l] = []\n    length_to_strings[l].append(s)\n\nThen, for each l from 1 to n-1, the two strings are in length_to_strings[l].\n\nNow, create a dictionary to store the assignments:\n\nassignments = {}\n\nStart with l = n-1.\n\nFor l = n-1:\n\ns_list = length_to_strings[l]\ns1, s2 = s_list\n\nCheck two cases:\n\nCase 1: s1 is p, s2 is q.\n\nCheck if s2 == s1[1:] + c, where c is a single character not in s1.\n\nAlso",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of a hypothetical string `s` of length `n`. The input provides exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1, which are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Strings by Length**: First, we group the given strings by their lengths. This helps us efficiently process each length group separately.\n2. **Determine Prefix and Suffix for Each Length**: Starting from the largest length (n-1) down to 1, we determine which of the two strings at each length is the prefix and which is the suffix. We check if the suffix can be formed by appending a character to the prefix or vice versa, ensuring consistency with the previous levels.\n3. **Check Consistency**: For each length, ensure that the determined prefix is a valid extension of the previous prefix and that the suffix is a valid truncation of the previous suffix. Additionally, ensure that the last character of the prefix matches the first character of the suffix.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nstrings = [input().strip() for _ in range(2 * n - 2)]\n\nlength_to_strings = {}\nfor s in strings:\n    l = len(s)\n    if l not in length_to_strings:\n        length_to_strings[l] = []\n    length_to_strings[l].append(s)\n\nassignments = {}\n\n# Start with the largest length, n-1\nl = n - 1\ncandidates = length_to_strings.get(l, [])\nif not candidates:\n    raise ValueError(\"No candidates found for l = {}\".format(l))\n\ns1, s2 = candidates\n\ndef get_char(s):\n    return s[-1] if s else ''\n\n# Check both possibilities for l = n-1\np_prev = None\nq_prev = None\n\n# Case 1: s1 is p_prev, s2 is q_prev\nif len(s1) == l:\n    c = get_char(s2)\n    if s2 == s1[1:] + c:\n        p_prev = s1\n        q_prev = s2\nelse:\n    # Check if s2 is a prefix of s1\n    if len(s2) < len(s1):\n        if s1 == s2 + (s1[len(s2):]):\n            p_prev = s2\n            q_prev = s1\n    else:\n        if s1 == s2[1:] + s2[0]:\n            p_prev = s2\n            q_prev = s1\n\nif p_prev is None:\n    # Try the other way around\n    if s2 == s1[1:] + s1[-1]:\n        p_prev = s2\n        q_prev = s1\n    elif s1 == s2[1:] + s2[-1]:\n        p_prev = s2\n        q_prev = s1\n    else:\n        # Determine based on the last character matching\n        if s1[-1] == s2[0]:\n            if len(s1) == l-1:\n                p_prev = s1\n                q_prev = s2\n            else:\n                p_prev = s2\n                q_prev = s1\n\n# Assign for l = n-1\nassignments[l] = (p_prev, q_prev)\n\n# Now process lower l's\nfor l in range(n-2, 0, -1):\n    candidates = length_to_strings.get(l, [])\n    if not candidates:\n        continue  # Shouldn't happen as per problem statement\n    \n    s_list = candidates\n    s_a, s_b = s_list[0], s_list[1]\n    \n    possible_assignments = []\n    # Try both orders\n    for (current_p, current_q) in [(s_a, s_b), (s_b, s_a)]:\n        # Check if current_p is a prefix of the previous p and current_q is a suffix of the previous q\n        valid = True\n        if l > 1:\n            prev_p, prev_q = assignments[l+1]\n            if not current_p.startswith(prev_p):\n                valid = False\n            if not current_q.endswith(prev_q):\n                valid = False\n        # Check last char of p equals first char of q\n        if valid and (current_p[-1] == current_q[0]):\n            possible_assignments.append((current_p, current_q))\n    \n    # Choose the first valid assignment\n    if possible_assignments:\n        p, q = possible_assignments[0]\n        assignments[l] = (p, q)\n    else:\n        # If none found, try swapping\n        if (s_b, s_a) not in possible_assignments:\n            p, q = (s_b, s_a)\n            valid = True\n            if l > 1:\n                prev_p, prev_q = assignments[l+1]\n                if not s_b.startswith(prev_p):\n                    valid = False\n                if not s_a.endswith(prev_q):\n                    valid = False\n            if valid and (s_b[-1] == s_a[0]):\n                assignments[l] = (s_b, s_a)\n        else:\n            # This case should not occur as per problem constraints\n            raise ValueError(\"No valid assignment found for l = {}\".format(l))\n\n# Generate the result\nresult = []\nfor s in strings:\n    l = len(s)\n    if l in assignments:\n        p, q = assignments[l]\n        if s == p:\n            result.append('P')\n        elif s == q:\n            result.append('S')\n        else:\n            # This should not happen as per problem constraints\n            result.append('X')\n    else:\n        # This should not happen as per problem constraints\n        result.append('X')\n\nprint(''.join(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and grouped by the length of the strings.\n2. **Assigning Prefix and Suffix**: Starting from the largest length, we determine which string is the prefix and which is the suffix by checking if one can be formed by extending the other and ensuring the last character of the prefix matches the first character of the suffix.\n3. **Consistency Check**: For each length, we ensure the determined prefix and suffix are consistent with the previous levels and satisfy the necessary conditions.\n4. **Output Generation**: After determining the correct labels for each string, we generate the output string by marking each string as 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix).\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the correct labels by leveraging the properties of prefixes and suffixes and ensures all constraints are met.",
