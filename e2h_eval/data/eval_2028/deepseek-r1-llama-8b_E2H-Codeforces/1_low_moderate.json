    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem called \"Golden Plate\". Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have a rectangular plate divided into w x h cells. We need to add gilded rings, and each ring is defined in a specific way. The first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away from the edge, and so on. Each ring has a width of one cell. The i-th ring consists of all bordering cells of an inner rectangle whose dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). \n\nOur task is to compute the total number of gilded cells after adding k such rings.\n\nHmm. So for each ring from 1 to k, we calculate the perimeter of a rectangle, then sum them all up.\n\nWait, but what's the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle? Oh right, it's 2*(width + height) - 4. Because when you count the four corners twice, you subtract 4.\n\nSo for each ring i, the current width is w_i = w - 4*(i-1), and similarly for height h_i = h -4*(i-1). But wait, no—wait, for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w -4*(i-1)) by (h -4*(i-1)). So for i=1, it's w x h. For i=2, it's (w-4) x (h-4), and so on.\n\nBut wait, for each ring, the perimeter is the number of cells around it. So for each ring, we calculate 2*(w_i + h_i - 2). Because the perimeter of a rectangle with w and h cells is 2*(w + h - 2). Let me think: if w is 3 and h is 3, the perimeter is 8, which matches the first example where input was 3 3 1, output was 8.\n\nYes, because 2*(3+3-2) = 8.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each i from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute current w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute current h_i = h -4*(i-1)\n   c. Compute the perimeter as 2*(w_i + h_i - 2)\n   d. Add this to the total.\n\nBut wait, we have to ensure that for each i, both w_i and h_i are at least 3, otherwise, the ring can't be formed. Or does the problem ensure that k is chosen such that it doesn't go beyond the possible rings?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: the input constraints say that k is <= floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 = 1, so k can be 1. If min is 7, (7+1)/4 is 2, so k can be up to 2.\n\nWait, let's see: for a 7x9 grid, min is 7. So (7+1)/4 is 2, so k can be 2. Which matches the second sample input where k=2 gives 40. Let's check that:\n\nFor i=1: w=7, h=9 → perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14 =28.\n\nFor i=2: w=7-4=3, h=9-4=5 → perimeter is 2*(3+5-2)=2*6=12. 28+12=40. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach is safe because the input ensures that for each i up to k, the dimensions are valid.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize total =0.\n\nLoop i from 1 to k:\n\n   current_w = w -4*(i-1)\n   current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h -2)\n   total += perimeter\n\nReturn total.\n\nWait, but let me think about how to handle the loop. Since k can be up to (min(w,h)+1)/4, but perhaps in some cases, the subtraction could result in a zero or negative? No, because the problem constraints ensure that the given k is valid.\n\nSo, implementing this in Python should be straightforward.\n\nNow, let's test it against the examples.\n\nFirst example: 3 3 1 → 8.\n\nAs above, yes.\n\nSecond example:7 9 1 → 28.\n\nThird example:7 9 2 → 28+12=40.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case: Let's say w=5, h=5, k=1 → perimeter is 2*(",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells that will be gilded on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is formed by the perimeter of an inner rectangle, and each subsequent ring is placed two cells inward from the previous one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is formed by the perimeter of a rectangle. The first ring is along the edge of the plate, the second ring is two cells inward, and so on. Each ring reduces the dimensions of the rectangle by 4 cells (2 cells from each side).\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the perimeter of the rectangle can be calculated using the formula \\(2 \\times (width + height - 2)\\). This accounts for the four corners which are counted twice in a simple sum of width and height.\n3. **Iterative Summation**: We iterate through each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter for each, and accumulate the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the current width and height by subtracting 4 from each dimension for each subsequent ring.\n3. **Compute Perimeter**: For each ring, calculate the perimeter using the formula and add it to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output the Result**: After processing all rings, print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring that all edge cases are handled within the given constraints.",
