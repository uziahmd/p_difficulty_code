Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles that satisfy certain conditions based on given integers A, B, C, D.\n\nHmm, let me read the problem statement carefully again. Oh right, the triangle has sides x, y, z where A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle must be non-degenerate, meaning x + y > z. Because for a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x <= y <= z, checking x + y > z is sufficient.\n\nSo the task is to find all possible triplets (x, y, z) that meet these conditions and satisfy x + y > z.\n\nFirst, let's think about the constraints. A, B, C, D can be as large as 5e5, which is 500,000. So any solution with O(N^3) time complexity is definitely out of the question. We need an efficient approach, probably O(N) or O(N log N) time.\n\nLet me break down the problem. We need to iterate over possible x, y, z within the given ranges, but in a way that avoids redundant calculations.\n\nWait, the variables are linked by inequalities. So x can vary from A to B, inclusive. For each x, y can vary from max(B, x) to min(C, ... ), but wait, no: the condition is x ≤ B and y ≥ B, and also y ≤ C. So for each x, y starts at B if x < B, or y starts at x if x is equal to B? Wait, no. Wait, the condition is x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C. So for x, the maximum is B. For y, the minimum is B, but y can't be less than x because x ≤ B and y >= B, so y >= x.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the condition says A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be up to B, and y starts at B and goes up to C. So for any x in [A, B], y is in [max(x, B), C], but since x can't exceed B, and y is at least B, so y is in [B, C], but y must be >= x. So for a given x, y can range from max(x, B) to C. But wait, since x ≤ B, the max(x, B) is B if x is ≤ B. So y starts at B when x is <= B. So for x in [A, B], y ranges from B to C, but must be >= x. So y starts at max(x, B). Since x is <= B, max(x, B) is B. So for any x, y starts at B, but must be >= x. So for x <= B, y can be from max(x, B) = B to C. But wait, that can't be right because if x is larger than B, but according to the condition x cannot be larger than B. So for any x in [A, B], y is in [B, C] and y >= x.\n\nWait, no. Because x can't be larger than B. So for example, if x is 2, B is 3, then y has to be at least 3. But if x is 3, then y has to be at least 3. So in any case, y starts at B and goes up to C, but must also be >= x. So for a given x, y starts at max(B, x) but since x can't be larger than B, it's just B. So y ranges from B to C, but only if y >= x.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Because the condition is A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C. So y is between B and C. But y must also be >= x. So for a given x, y can be as low as max(B, x). But since x is <= B, max(B, x) is B. So y starts at B and goes up to C, but y must also be >= x. So for x, the y starts at B, but if x is greater than B, then y must be >= x. But since x is <= B, that's not possible. So y can always start at B, as long as B >= x.\n\nWait, no. Suppose x is 5 and B is 4. Then x can't be larger than B because x is ≤ B. So x is always ≤ B. So y is always ≥ B. So for a given x, y starts at B and goes up to C, but also y must be >= x. So for x, the minimal y",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\) holds. A triangle is non-degenerate if \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: Given the constraints \\(A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D\\), we can deduce that \\(x\\) ranges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), \\(y\\) ranges from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), and \\(z\\) ranges from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\). For each valid triplet \\((x, y, z)\\), we need to check if \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n2. **Efficient Range Iteration**: Instead of iterating over all possible triplets, which would be computationally expensive, we can optimize by considering the ranges for \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) based on \\(x\\). For each \\(x\\), \\(y\\) starts from \\(B\\) (since \\(y \\geq x\\) and \\(y \\geq B\\)) up to \\(C\\). For each valid pair \\((x, y)\\), \\(z\\) must be greater than \\(C\\) but less than \\(x + y\\).\n\n3. **Mathematical Insight**: For each pair \\((x, y)\\), the maximum value \\(z\\) can take is \\(x + y - 1\\). Thus, the number of valid \\(z\\) values is the number of integers from \\(C\\) up to \\(x + y - 1\\). This count can be computed using the formula \\( \\max(0, \\min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) \\).\n\n4. **Summing Valid Counts**: Sum the counts of valid \\(z\\) values for each valid pair \\((x, y)\\) to get the total number of non-degenerate triangles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nA, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor x in range(A, B + 1):\n    # y must be >= B and >= x, so y starts at max(x, B)\n    # but since x <= B, y starts at B\n    min_y = B\n    max_y = C\n    if min_y > max_y:\n        continue\n    for y in range(min_y, max_y + 1):\n        if y < x:\n            continue  # y must be >= x\n        # Now z must be > C and <= D, and also z < x + y\n        # So lower bound is C + 1, upper bound is min(D, x + y - 1)\n        lower_z = C + 1\n        upper_z = min(D, x + y - 1)\n        if lower_z > upper_z:\n            continue\n        count += upper_z - lower_z + 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Range Iteration**: We iterate over each possible value of \\(x\\) from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\).\n- **Pair Iteration**: For each \\(x\\), we iterate over each possible \\(y\\) from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\).\n- **Valid \\(z\\) Calculation**: For each pair \\((x, y)\\), we determine the range of valid \\(z\\) values and count how many such \\(z\\) exist.\n- **Summing Up**: The total count of valid triangles is accumulated by summing the valid \\(z\\) counts for each pair \\((x, y)\\).\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space and ensures that we only consider valid triplets, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
