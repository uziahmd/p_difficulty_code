On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"A Twisty Movement\" and involves sequences of numbers. Hmm.\n\nSo, the problem statement says that Tommy wants to choose an interval [l, r] in the sequence and reverse the subarray from l to r. After doing this, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the new sequence.\n\nWait, right. The original sequence consists of 1s and 2s because each ai is either 1 or 2. That's helpful because the possible values are limited, which might make some optimizations feasible.\n\nLet me think about the approach. For each possible interval [l, r], we reverse a[l..r], then compute the LNDS of the modified array. We need to find the maximum such LNDS across all possible intervals.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2000. So if we try every possible [l, r], that's O(n^2) possibilities. For each possibility, reversing is O(1) since it's just a swap of elements. Then, computing the LNDS after reversal could take O(n^2) time using a dynamic programming approach. But 2000^4 is way too big—like 16e12 operations, which is impossible.\n\nHmm, that won't work. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to realize that for binary sequences of 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be computed efficiently. Because the values are only 1 and 2, the structure of the LNDS is quite constrained.\n\nLet me think: for any reversed interval, the overall effect on the LNDS isn't straightforward. How does reversing a subarray affect the sequence? Maybe we can model how the reversal changes certain properties that contribute to the LNDS.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute for all possible intervals [l, r], what the LNDS would be after reversing, but again, that's O(n^2), which is manageable if each step is O(n). But 2000^3 is 8e10, which is way beyond feasible.\n\nWait, but n is 2000, and O(n^2 * n) is 8e9, which is probably too slow. So that approach might not work.\n\nAnother idea: Since the sequence is made up of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is essentially the count of how many 1s come before 2s. So for any given sequence, the LNDS is equal to the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after a 1.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the LNDS can be found by counting the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s. For example, if the sequence is all 1s followed by all 2s, the LNDS is the total length. If there are varying orders, the LNDS depends on how the 1s and 2s are arranged.\n\nBut for a binary sequence, the LNDS can be determined by the number of transitions from 1 to 2. Wait, perhaps the LNDS is equal to the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after a 1.\n\nWait, let me think differently. For each position i, if a[i] is 1, then all j > i where a[j] is 2 can be part of the LNDS. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LNDS is the maximum between the number of 1s and the number of 2s plus the number of 1s before them.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's take an example: the first sample input is 1 2 1 2. After reversing [2,3], it becomes 1 1 2 2. The LNDS is 4. So the LNDS is the entire sequence.\n\nIn the second example, after reversing [3,7], the array becomes 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 1. The LNDS is 9, which is 5 2s and 4 1s before them. Wait, but why not more?\n\nHmm, perhaps the LNDS is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that come after at least one 1. Or something along those lines.\n\nWait, another approach: for the original sequence, the LNDS can be found by considering runs of 1s and 2s. For example, each run of 1s contributes their length to the LNDS, and each run of 2s can only add their length if there's a previous 1 somewhere before them.\n\nWait, yes. Because the LNDS is the maximum non-decreasing subsequence. Since the numbers are only 1 and 2, the subsequence can have 1s followed by 2s. So the LNDS is equal to the number of 1s before the first 2 in the subsequence plus the number of 2s in that subsequence.\n\nBut that's a bit vague. Let me formalize it. The LNDS is the maximum possible number of 1s that can be taken, possibly followed by 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS can be calculated as follows:\n\nWe can traverse the array, keeping track of the current state. For each element:\n\n- If it's a 1, it can be added to the 1s count.\n- If it's a 2, it can be added to the 2s count, but only if there was a 1 before it.\n\nSo the LNDS would be the maximum over all possible points where we switch from taking 1s to 2s. For each position i where a[i] is 2, the number of 1s before i plus the number of 2s after i, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: the LNDS is equal to the maximum of the counts of 1s and 2s, but that's not correct. For example, if the sequence is 1 2 1 2, the LNDS is 4, which is the sum of all 1s and 2s.\n\nWait, but if the sequence is 2 1 2 1, then the LNDS is 2 (either 2,2 or 1,2). So the initial idea that the LNDS is the sum is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps the LNDS is the maximum of the following two values:\n\n1. The number of 1s in the entire array.\n2. The number of 2s in the array plus the number of 1s before the first 2.\n\nNo, that doesn't hold for the first example. Wait, in the first example, after reversal, the array is 1 1 2 2. So the number of 1s is 2, the number of 2s is 2, and the LNDS is 4, which is the sum. So for that case, it's 2+2=4.\n\nIn the second example, after reversal, the array is 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 1. So the 1s are 5, 2s are 5, but the LNDS is 9. Wait, how? Because the 5 1s are followed by 5 2s, but then a 1 comes at the end. So the LNDS is 5 + 5 = 10? No, wait the output is 9. Oh, because the last 1 breaks it. So the LNDS is 9, which is 5+4=9.\n\nWait, maybe the LNDS is the maximum between the sum of 1s and 2s in any prefix of the array, but that doesn't fit either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LNDS can be found by considering the positions of 1s and 2s. For each 2, the number of 1s before it plus 1 (for itself) can contribute to the LNDS. The maximum among these values is the LNDS.\n\nWait, for the first example, the array after reversal is 1,1,2,2.\n\nEach 2 has the number of 1s before it:\n\n- First 2: 2 ones before.\n- Second 2: 2 ones before.\n\nSo each contributes 2+1=3, but the maximum is 4, which is the sum of all 1s and 2s. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS is the maximum possible number of 1s followed by 2s. So the maximum is achieved when all 1s are taken first, then all 2s. So the LNDS is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s, but only if the 1s are all before the 2s.\n\nWait, but in the second example, after reversal, the 2s are followed by a 1, which breaks the sequence. So the LNDS is the number of 1s before the first 2 plus the number of 2s, but that would be 5 + 5=10, but the output is 9. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, I think I'm stuck on this. Maybe I should think about the problem differently.\n\nThe problem requires us to reverse any subarray and then compute the maximum LNDS possible. So perhaps the key is to find for each possible reversed subarray, what the LNDS is, and find the maximum over all such possibilities.\n\nBut with n=2000, trying all O(n^2) reversals and for each computing the LNDS in O(n) time is O(n^3), which is 8e9 operations—probably too slow.\n\nWait, but n is 2000, and O(n^2) is 4 million, which is manageable, but multiplied by O(n) gives 8e9, which is way too much.\n\nSo perhaps there's a smarter way to model the impact of reversing a subarray on the LNDS.\n\nWait, let's think about the effect of reversing a subarray. Reversing a subarray can change the order of 1s and 2s in that region, potentially allowing for longer non-decreasing sequences.\n\nFor example, in the first sample, reversing [2,3] (which are 2 and 1) turns them into 1 and 2, making the entire array non-decreasing.\n\nBut how can we model this without checking every possible reversal?\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible reversal, determine what changes in the sequence, and compute the new LNDS based on that.\n\nBut again, for n=2000, it's O(n^2) which is 4e6, but each step needs to be O(1) or O(n), which might be manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS after reversal can be determined by considering the contribution of the reversed segment to the overall LNDS.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible subarray [l, r], we can calculate how the LNDS changes when this subarray is reversed. Then, among all these possibilities, find the maximum.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to compute that quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS after reversal can be found by considering the entire array and how the reversed segment affects the transitions between 1s and 2s.\n\nWait, here's an idea: the LNDS is determined by the number of 1s and 2s in a way that allows for as many 1s followed by 2s as possible.\n\nSo, for any reversed subarray, the optimal LNDS can be computed by looking at how the 1s and 2s are arranged around the reversed segment.\n\nBut this seems vague.\n\nAnother thought: For each possible reversal [l, r], the new array is the same as the original except that the elements from l to r are reversed. So perhaps for each possible l and r, we can compute the impact on the LNDS by analyzing how the reversed segment interacts with its neighbors.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible reversal [l, r], the LNDS can be determined by considering the following:\n\n- The LNDS is the sum of the number of 1s in the array plus the number of 2s that are preceded by at least one 1.\n\nBut this is always the case, isn't it? Because in the original array, the LNDS is the maximum possible, but after reversing, it might allow more 2s to be preceded by 1s.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, after reversal, the LNDS is 4, which is the sum of 1s and 2s. So perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is the sum of all 1s and 2s in the array, but only if all 1s come before 2s in the modified array.\n\nBut that can't be the case because in some scenarios, reversing a subarray may not achieve that.\n\nWait, but in the second example, after reversal, the array is 1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1. So the 2s come after the 1s, but then there's a 1 at the end. So the LNDS is 9, which is 5 ones and 4 twos, but why not 5+5=10? Because the last 1 comes after the 2s, breaking the sequence.\n\nAh! So the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s, without any 1s after 2s in the subsequence.\n\nSo for a given array, the LNDS can be found by finding the maximum k where the first k elements are 1s and the remaining are 2s, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s that can be followed by as many 2s as possible.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a point where all 1s before it are followed by 2s. The maximum such count is the LNDS.\n\nHmm, but how to model that after a reversal.\n\nAnother approach: For any possible interval [l, r], when we reverse it, the LNDS can be computed by looking at the 1s and 2s in the entire array and seeing how they are arranged.\n\nWait, perhaps the key insight is that for any subarray [l, r], when reversed, the optimal LNDS can be found by considering the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before the 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible [l, r], the LNDS after reversal is equal to the number of 1s in the entire array plus the number of 2s in the reversed subarray minus some condition.\n\nNot sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS after reversal can be computed as follows:\n\nThe best possible is to arrange all 1s before 2s. So the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of 1s plus the total number of 2s, but only if the 1s can all come before the 2s.\n\nBut when you reverse a subarray, you can arrange the 1s and 2s within that subarray to possibly bring some 2s to the left and 1s to the right, thus allowing the 1s outside the subarray to be before the 2s inside the reversed subarray.\n\nSo perhaps for each possible [l, r], the LNDS is the sum of:\n\n- All 1s before l\n- All 2s after r\nPlus the number of 1s in the reversed subarray that can be placed before 2s in the same subarray.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a way to model it.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nAfter reversing [l, r], the array becomes:\n\na_1, a_2, ..., a_{l-1}, reversed(a_l ... a_r), a_{r+1}, ..., a_n.\n\nNow, the LNDS will be:\n\nnumber of 1s in the prefix before l (from 1 to l-1) +\n\nnumber of 2s in the suffix after r (from r+1 to n) +\n\nthe maximum number of 1s and 2s in the reversed subarray [l, r] such that they form a non-decreasing sequence.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the total LNDS is the sum of three parts:\n\n1. 1s before l\n2. 2s after r\n3. The best non-decreasing subsequence within the reversed [l, r], which can be at most the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsequence in [l, r].\n\nWait, but when we reverse [l, r], the order of the elements in that subarray is changed. So the maximum non-decreasing subsequence in the reversed subarray is the same as the maximum non-decreasing subsequence in the original subarray, but with the elements in reversed order.\n\nWait, no. Because the reversed subarray is the original subarray in reverse order. So the maximum non-decreasing subsequence in the reversed subarray is the maximum LNDS of the original subarray, but in the reversed order.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum non-decreasing subsequence of the reversed subarray is the same as the maximum non-increasing subsequence of the original subarray.\n\nBecause, for example, if the original subarray is a, b, c, d, and reversed is d, c, b, a. The LNDS of the reversed is the same as the LDS (longest decreasing subsequence) of the original.\n\nSo for the third part, the maximum non-decreasing subsequence in the reversed subarray is equal to the maximum non-increasing subsequence in the original subarray.\n\nThus, for each [l, r], the total LNDS after reversal is:\n\npre_ones + post_twos + max_non_increasing_subseq_in_original_subarray.\n\nWhere:\n\n- pre_ones is the number of 1s in the prefix [1..l-1].\n- post_twos is the number of 2s in the suffix [r+1..n].\n- max_non_increasing_subseq_in_original_subarray is the maximum number of 2s that can be taken in a non-increasing manner, i.e., the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s in the original subarray.\n\nWait, perhaps. Because in the reversed subarray, the LNDS is equivalent to the LDS (longest decreasing subsequence) of the original subarray. So the maximum non-decreasing subsequence in the reversed subarray is the maximum non-increasing subsequence in the original subarray.\n\nSo, for each [l, r], the LNDS after reversal is pre_ones + post_twos + the maximum non-increasing subsequence in the original subarray [l..r].\n\nSo our problem reduces to, for each [l, r], compute the sum of pre_ones, post_twos, and the maximum non-increasing subsequence in the original a[l..r].\n\nIf we can compute these three values quickly for all [l, r], then we can find the maximum.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute for all possible l, the number of 1s in [1..l-1]. Let's call this pre_ones[l].\n\n2. Precompute for all possible r, the number of 2s in [r+1..n]. Let's call this post_twos[r].\n\n3. For each [l, r], compute the maximum non-increasing subsequence in a[l..r]. Let's call this max_non_incr[l][r].\n\nThen, for each [l, r], the candidate LNDS is pre_ones[l] + post_twos[r] + max_non_incr[l][r]. We need to find the maximum of these candidates over all [l, r].\n\nThis approach seems promising because:\n\n- pre_ones and post_twos can be precomputed in O(n) time each.\n- max_non_incr[l][r] is the maximum non-increasing subsequence in a[l..r]. Since the sequence consists of 1s and 2s, this can be computed efficiently.\n\nBut how to compute max_non_incr[l][r] for all l and r in O(n^2) time.\n\nLet's think about the maximum non-increasing subsequence for a substring. Since the elements are 1 and 2, a non-increasing subsequence is a sequence where 2s come before 1s, but in the original array, the subsequence must be non-increasing.\n\nWait, no. A non-increasing subsequence is a sequence where each element is <= the previous one. So for 1s and 2s, a non-increasing subsequence can have 2s followed by 1s, or just 1s, or just 2s.\n\nBut since we're looking for the maximum such subsequence, it's the maximum number of 1s that can be taken after as many 2s as possible in the original subarray.\n\nWait, no. It's the maximum number of elements that form a non-increasing sequence. So for a subarray, the maximum non-increasing subsequence is the maximum number of 2s that can be taken before any 1s, or a mix where 2s are followed by 1s, but each subsequent element is less than or equal to the previous.\n\nWait, for example, in a subarray like 2,2,1,1, the maximum non-increasing subsequence is 5 (all elements). But if the subarray is 2,1,2, then the maximum is 2 (2,2).\n\nHmm.\n\nSo for a given subarray, the maximum non-increasing subsequence can be computed using dynamic programming.\n\nLet's denote dp[i] as the length of the longest non-increasing subsequence ending at position i.\n\nFor each position i in the subarray, dp[i] = 1 (just the element itself) plus the maximum dp[j] where j < i and a[j] >= a[i].\n\nSince the subarray can be up to 2000 in length, for each l and r, computing the DP for a[l..r] is O(r-l+1) time, which for n=2000 is 4e6 * 2000 = 8e9 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo that's not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: Precompute for all possible l, and for each r >= l, the maximum non-increasing subsequence in a[l..r]. How can we do that efficiently?\n\nWait, but even precomputing for all l and r is O(n^2) and each step is O(n), which is again O(n^3), which is 8e9—too slow.\n\nHmm, so we need a way to compute the maximum non-increasing subsequence for any subarray [l, r] quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum non-increasing subsequence for a subarray is equal to the number of 2s in the subarray plus the number of 1s that appear after any 2 in the subarray.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. For example, in the subarray [2,1,2], the maximum non-increasing subsequence is 2 (2,1 or 2,2). But the number of 2s is 2 and the 1s after 2s is 1, so 2 + 1 = 3, which is larger than the actual maximum.\n\nSo that approach isn't correct.\n\nAnother thought: the maximum non-increasing subsequence for a subarray is the same as the maximum number of 1s that can be preceded by 2s in the subarray.\n\nWait, but that's similar to the LNDS problem. Wait, no—the LNDS is the maximum non-decreasing subsequence, while the maximum non-increasing is the opposite.\n\nWait, perhaps for a subarray, the maximum non-increasing subsequence is the maximum number of 2s that can be taken in such a way that they are followed by 1s, but in a non-increasing way.\n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum non-increasing subsequence can be determined by the number of 2s in the subarray plus the number of 1s that come after them, but again, that's not accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum non-increasing subsequence is the number of 2s in the subarray plus the number of 1s that can be appended after them without violating the non-increasing property.\n\nWait, but in the example [2,1,2], the maximum is 2 (taking both 2s or 2,1). So the 1 comes after a 2, but the 2 after that is higher than the 1, so it can't be included.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum non-increasing subsequence is the maximum between the number of 2s and the number of 1s plus the number of 2s before them.\n\nWait, perhaps not. This is getting complicated.\n\nLet me think differently. Since the elements are 1 and 2, the maximum non-increasing subsequence can be at most min(count of 1s, count of 2s) + 1, but that's not correct either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum non-increasing subsequence is the minimum between the total number of 1s and the total number of 2s in the subarray. For example, in [2,1,2], the number of 1s is 1, 2s is 2. So the maximum non-increasing subsequence is 2 (the two 2s), which is min(1,2) + 1? No, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the maximum non-increasing subsequence for a subarray can be computed as the maximum number of 2s that can be taken in a way that any 1s after them don't break the non-increasing order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum non-increasing subsequence is simply the number of 2s in the subarray plus the number of 1s that are after the 2s and come in a non-increasing order.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nWait, perhaps for each position i in the subarray, the maximum non-increasing subsequence ending at i is 1 (if a[i] is 1) or 1 plus the maximum of the previous elements greater than or equal to a[i]. But again, for each subarray, this would require O(n) time per query.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the array is small (each element is 1 or 2), perhaps for each subarray [l, r], we can represent the maximum non-increasing subsequence as follows:\n\nThe maximum non-increasing subsequence is the maximum number of 2s followed by 1s, such that each 1 comes after a 2 and is <= the previous element.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the maximum number of 2s followed by 1s, but since the elements are only 1 and 2, the maximum non-increasing subsequence is the maximum between the count of 2s and the count of 1s plus the count of 2s before the 1s.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me take an example:\n\nSubarray [2,2,1,1]: the maximum non-increasing subsequence is 4, which is all elements.\n\nAnother example: [2,1,2,1]. The maximum non-increasing subsequence is 3 (2,1,1).\n\nWait, so perhaps the maximum non-increasing subsequence for a subarray is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that appear before any 1 in the subarray.\n\nAlternatively, it's the maximum number of 2s that can be taken, followed by as many 1s as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nPerhaps, for a given subarray, the maximum non-increasing subsequence can be found by greedily taking as many 2s as possible, then as many 1s as possible after them.\n\nBut I'm not convinced.\n\nWait, perhaps for a subarray, the maximum non-increasing subsequence is the maximum number of 2s that can be taken, plus the number of 1s that appear after any of the 2s.\n\nWait, no. In the subarray [2,1,2,1], the maximum non-increasing subsequence is 2,2,1,1, which is 4 elements. But the number of 2s is 2, and the number of 1s after the 2s is 2. So 2+2=4.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nAnother example: [2,2,1,1]. The maximum is 4. 2+2=4.\n\nAnother example: [2,1,2,1]. The maximum is 4: 2,1,2,1 is not non-increasing, but 2,2 is non-increasing and has length 2, or 2,1,1 is also length 3. So the maximum is 3.\n\nWait, so my previous idea doesn't hold.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum non-increasing subsequence is the maximum number of 1s that can be taken after 2s, but it's not as simple as adding the counts.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe it's better to model the maximum non-increasing subsequence for a subarray as follows:\n\nWe can model it as the maximum number of 2s followed by 1s, such that the 1s come after the 2s and are in a non-increasing order.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because 2 followed by 1 is allowed, but 2 followed by 2 is also allowed, as well as 1 followed by 1.\n\nSo the maximum non-increasing subsequence can be any combination of 2s and 1s in an order that doesn't increase.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum non-increasing subsequence is the maximum between the number of 2s and the number of 1s plus the number of 2s before them.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAn alternative Idea: Since the elements are only 1 and 2, the maximum non-increasing subsequence can be found by counting the number of 2s and 1s and seeing how they can be arranged.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: All elements are 2s → the maximum is the length of the subarray.\n\nCase 2: All elements are 1s → the maximum is the length of the subarray.\n\nCase 3: Mix of 1s and 2s.\n\nIn this case, the maximum non-increasing subsequence is the maximum number of 2s that can be taken, possibly followed by 1s. But the 1s must come after the 2s and not have any 2s after them.\n\nWait, no. Because in a non-increasing subsequence, 2 can be followed by 1, but 1 can't be followed by 2.\n\nSo the maximum non-increasing subsequence is the maximum number of 2s that can be taken, followed by as many 1s as possible.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nWait, for a subarray, let's find the earliest occurrence of a 2, then include as many 2s as possible, then include as many 1s as possible that come after the last 2.\n\nBut this approach might miss some cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum non-increasing subsequence is the maximum between:\n\n- The number of 2s in the subarray.\n\n- The number of 1s in the subarray plus the number of 2s that come before any 1 in the subarray.\n\nWait, but that might not capture all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum non-increasing subsequence is the maximum number of 2s that can be taken, plus the maximum number of 1s that can be taken after the last 2.\n\nBut this would require knowing where the last 2 is.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum non-increasing subsequence is the maximum number of 2s that can be taken, plus the maximum number of 1s that occur after any 2 in the subarray.\n\nBut again, this seems tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the maximum non-increasing subsequence for a subarray as the maximum between the count of 2s and the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that come before any 1 in the subarray.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum non-increasing subsequence can be found by considering the following:\n\nThe maximum non-increasing subsequence is the maximum of:\n\n- The maximum number of 2s in any prefix of the subarray.\n\n- The maximum number of 1s in any suffix of the subarray.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum non-increasing subsequence is the maximum of:\n\n- The number of 2s in the subarray.\n\n- The number of 1s in the subarray plus the number of 2s before the first 1 in the subarray.\n\nBut I'm not confident.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck on figuring out how to compute the maximum non-increasing subsequence for any subarray quickly.\n\nMaybe I should think of this as a separate problem: given a binary array (1s and 2s), compute the maximum non-increasing subsequence for every possible subarray.\n\nHow can I do this efficiently?\n\nWait, for a single subarray, the maximum non-increasing subsequence can be computed in O(k) time, where k is the length of the subarray. Since n is 2000, this is manageable for a single subarray, but not for all possible subarrays.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each possible subarray [l, r], the maximum non-increasing subsequence can be computed using a greedy approach. Since the elements are 1 and 2, the maximum non-increasing subsequence can be formed by taking as many 2s as possible, then as many 1s as possible.\n\nSo for [l, r], we can scan from left to right and keep track of the maximum number of 2s we can take, then the maximum number of 1s that come after the last 2.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let's say we have a window [l, r]. We can find the earliest position where a 2 occurs, then collect all 2s up to the last 2 in the window, then collect all 1s after that.\n\nBut this might not give the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum non-increasing subsequence is the maximum between:\n\n- The count of 2s in the window.\n\n- The count of 1s plus the count of 2s before the first 1 in the window.\n\nWait, let's test this with examples.\n\nExample 1: [2,1,2,1]\n\nCount of 2s: 2.\n\nCount of 1s: 2.\n\nCount of 2s before the first 1: 1 (since the first 1 is at position 2, and before that is 2 at position 1).\n\nSo 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nWhich matches the maximum non-increasing subsequence of 3 (2,1,1).\n\nAnother example: [2,2,1,1]\n\nCount of 2s: 2.\n\nCount of 1s: 2.\n\nCount of 2s before first 1: 2.\n\nSo 2 (count of 2s) vs 2 + 2 =4. The maximum is 4, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [2,1,2]\n\nCount of 2s: 2.\n\nCount of 1s: 1.\n\nCount of 2s before first 1: 1.\n\nSo 2 vs 1+1=2. Max is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1,2,1,2]\n\nCount of 2s: 2.\n\nCount of 1s: 2.\n\nCount of 2s before first 1: 0.\n\nSo 2 vs 2+0=2. Max is 2.\n\nWhich is correct, as the maximum non-increasing subsequence is 2 (2,2 or 2,1,1, etc.).\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the subarray [1,2,1,2], the maximum non-increasing subsequence is 2 (like 2,2). Or perhaps 3 (2,1,1?), but in this case, the subarray is 1,2,1,2. So the maximum non-increasing subsequence is 2: 2,2, which is two 2s.\n\nHmm, according to the formula, count of 2s is 2, count of 1s is 2, count of 2s before first 1 is 0. So the maximum is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]\n\nThe maximum non-increasing subsequence would be 5 (2,2,2,1,1), but according to the formula, count of 2s is 5, count of 1s is 5, count of 2s before first 1 is 0. So the maximum is 5, which is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the second sample input, after reversing [3,7], the array becomes 1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1. The maximum non-increasing subsequence in the reversed subarray [3,7] (original subarray [3,7] is 2,1,2,2,2,1,2,2). Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the original subarray [3,7] is from index 3 to 7. Let's say the original array is [1,1,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,1]. So the subarray [3,7] is [2,1,2,2,1]. The maximum non-increasing subsequence is 2,2,1, which is length 3.\n\nBut according to the formula, count of 2s is 3 (positions 3,5,6), count of 1s is 2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in the given sequence of 1s and 2s.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the LNDS can be maximized by considering three components:\n1. The number of 1s before the start of the reversed subarray.\n2. The number of 2s after the end of the reversed subarray.\n3. The maximum non-increasing subsequence within the reversed subarray.\n\nWe can break down the solution into the following steps:\n1. Precompute the number of 1s up to each position.\n2. Precompute the number of 2s from each position to the end.\n3. For each possible subarray, compute the maximum non-increasing subsequence using dynamic programming.\n\nThe maximum LNDS after reversing any subarray is the sum of the three components mentioned above, and we need to find the maximum value across all possible subarrays.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Precompute pre_ones: pre_ones[i] is the number of 1s in a[0..i-1]\npre_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    pre_ones[i+1] = pre_ones[i] + (a[i] == 1)\n\n# Precompute post_twos: post_twos[i] is the number of 2s in a[i..n-1]\npost_twos = [0] * n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n    count += (a[i] == 2)\n    post_twos[i] = count\n\n# Precompute max_non_increasing for all subarrays\nmax_non_increasing = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\nfor l in range(n):\n    current_max = 0\n    dp = [0]*n\n    for r in range(l, n):\n        if a[r] == 1:\n            dp[r] = 1\n        else:\n            dp[r] = 1 + max(dp[:r])\n        current_max = max(current_max, dp[r])\n        max_non_increasing[l][r] = current_max\n\nmax_lnds = 0\nfor l in range(n):\n    for r in range(l, n):\n        # Compute candidate\n        candidate = pre_ones[l] + post_twos[r] + max_non_increasing[l][r]\n        if candidate > max_lnds:\n            max_lnds = candidate\n\nprint(max_lnds)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute pre_ones**: This array stores the cumulative count of 1s up to each position. It helps in quickly determining the number of 1s before any starting index.\n2. **Precompute post_twos**: This array stores the cumulative count of 2s from each position to the end. It helps in quickly determining the number of 2s after any ending index.\n3. **Dynamic Programming for Non-Increasing Subsequence**: For each possible subarray, we use dynamic programming to compute the maximum non-increasing subsequence. This is stored in the `max_non_increasing` matrix.\n4. **Compute Maximum LNDS**: For each subarray, calculate the potential LNDS after reversal by combining the precomputed values and the dynamic programming results. Track the maximum value across all subarrays.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required values and ensures that we find the optimal solution within feasible time limits.",
