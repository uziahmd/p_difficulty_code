Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about finding two vouchers that don't overlap, their durations add up exactly to x, and the total cost is as minimal as possible. If no such pair exists, we return -1.\n\nLet me break down the problem. We have n vouchers. Each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost costi. The duration of each voucher is ri - li + 1. We need to choose two different vouchers i and j. These two must not intersect, meaning either the end of i is before the start of j or vice versa. Also, the sum of their durations should be exactly x. And among all such possible pairs, we need the one with the smallest total cost.\n\nHmm, okay. So the approach is to find all possible pairs of vouchers where their durations add up to x and they don't overlap. Then, among those pairs, find the one with the minimum cost.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2e5. So a naive O(n^2) approach would be way too slow. We need a more efficient method.\n\nSo how do we do this efficiently?\n\nLet's think about the constraints for two vouchers. Let's say voucher A has duration d1, voucher B has duration d2. So d1 + d2 = x. And their time intervals don't overlap.\n\nWait, but the sum of durations must be exactly x. So for each voucher, maybe we can look for another voucher whose duration is x minus the current one's duration.\n\nSo first, for each voucher, compute its duration. Then, for each voucher, we can look for another voucher with duration x - d, and check if they can be non-overlapping.\n\nBut even then, considering all vouchers, this might still be O(n^2), which is not feasible for n=2e5.\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: group the vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, we'll keep track of the vouchers with that duration and their end times and costs.\n\nThen, for each voucher i with duration d, we look for vouchers j with duration (x - d). But we also need to ensure that their intervals don't overlap.\n\nWait, but how? Because checking all vouchers j for each i is O(n), which would again lead to O(n^2) time.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can pre-process the vouchers in a way that allows us to quickly find suitable j's for each i.\n\nAnother thought: for each voucher, we can note its end time and cost. Then, when looking for another voucher of duration x - d, we need to find the earliest ending vouchers after the current voucher ends, or the latest starting vouchers before the current voucher starts.\n\nWait, no. Let's think about the two cases where the vouchers don't overlap:\n\nCase 1: voucher j ends before voucher i starts. So j's end <= i's start.\n\nCase 2: voucher i ends before voucher j starts. So i's end <= j's start.\n\nSo for a given voucher i, we can split the search into two parts:\n\n- Find all vouchers j where j's duration is (x - d_i), and j's end <= i's start.\n\n- Or, find all vouchers j where j's duration is (x - d_i), and j's start >= i's end.\n\nWait, but if j's duration is (x - d_i), then j's duration is fixed. So for case 1, j's end <= i's start. Since j's duration is d_j = x - d_i, the latest j's start is (j_end - d_j + 1). Wait, no. Because j's end is ri, which is ri = li + d_j - 1. So j's li is ri - (d_j - 1).\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to represent each voucher by their end times and start times, and for each possible duration, keep track of the earliest end times and earliest start times.\n\nWait, perhaps for each duration d, we can precompute two arrays:\n\n- min_end: an array where for each possible duration, we store the earliest end time.\n\nNo, maybe not. Alternatively, for each duration d, we can store the list of end times and start times, sorted. Then, for a given voucher i, we can query the vouchers with duration (x - d_i) that have end <= i.start, and also vouchers with duration (x - d_i) that have start >= i.end.\n\nWait, but for the first case (j ends before i starts), j's end must be <= i's start. So for vouchers j of duration x - d_i, we can find all j where j_end <= i_start.\n\nSimilarly, for the second case (i ends before j starts), j's start must be >= i_end. So for vouchers j of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers such that their total duration equals the given vacation duration and their combined cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently searching for valid pairs of vouchers using preprocessed data structures.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers based on their duration. This helps in quickly finding pairs of vouchers whose durations sum up to the required vacation duration.\n2. **Preprocess Voucher Data**: For each duration, we maintain two sorted lists:\n   - One sorted list of end times of vouchers.\n   - Another sorted list of start times of vouchers.\n3. **Efficient Search Using Binary Search**: For each voucher, we determine the required complementary duration to sum up to the vacation duration. We then use binary search to find the earliest ending vouchers that can precede the current voucher and the latest starting vouchers that can follow the current voucher.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    x = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[idx])\n        r = int(input[idx+1])\n        c = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx +=3\n        vouchers.append( (l, r, c) )\n    \n    # Preprocess: for each duration, store end times and start times\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    duration_dict = defaultdict(lambda: {'ends': [], 'starts': []})\n    for l, r, c in vouchers:\n        d = r - l + 1\n        duration_dict[d]['ends'].append(r)\n        duration_dict[d]['starts'].append(l)\n    \n    min_cost = float('inf')\n    found = False\n    \n    for voucher in vouchers:\n        l_i, r_i, c_i = voucher\n        d_i = r_i - l_i + 1\n        required_d = x - d_i\n        if required_d < 0:\n            continue\n        # Check for case 1: j ends before i starts\n        if required_d in duration_dict:\n            ends_list = duration_dict[required_d]['ends']\n            starts_list = duration_dict[required_d]['starts']\n            # Find all j where j_end <= l_i\n            # Since ends_list is not necessarily sorted, sort it once\n            ends_list.sort()\n            pos = bisect.bisect_right(ends_list, l_i -1)\n            for j_end in ends_list[:pos]:\n                # j's start is j_end - (d_j-1), since d_j = required_d\n                j_start = j_end - (required_d -1)\n                if j_start + (r_i - l_i +1) <= j_end:\n                    # They don't overlap\n                    total_cost = c_i + ?\n                    # Wait, no: j is a voucher with duration required_d, so we need to find its cost\n                    # Hmm, this approach may not work because we only have j's end and start, not the cost.\n                    # So, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.
