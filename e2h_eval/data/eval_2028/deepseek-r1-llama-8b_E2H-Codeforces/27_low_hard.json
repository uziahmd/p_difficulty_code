On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"A Twisty Movement\" and involves sequences of numbers. Hmm.\n\nSo, the problem statement says that Tommy wants to choose an interval [l, r] in the sequence and reverse the subarray from l to r. After doing this, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the new sequence.\n\nWait, right. The original sequence consists of 1s and 2s because each ai is either 1 or 2. That's helpful because the possible values are limited, which might make some optimizations feasible.\n\nLet me think about the approach. For each possible interval [l, r], we reverse a[l..r], then compute the LNDS of the modified array. We need to find the maximum such LNDS across all possible intervals.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2000. So if we try every possible [l, r], that's O(n^2) possibilities. For each possibility, reversing is O(1) since it's just a swap of elements. Then, computing the LNDS after reversal could take O(n^2) time using a dynamic programming approach. But 2000^4 is way too big—like 16e12 operations, which is impossible.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nHmm, maybe we can precompute for each possible interval [l, r] what the LNDS would be after the reversal. But again, with n=2000, this seems challenging.\n\nWait, but the sequence only contains 1s and 2s. So the LNDS is related to the counts of increasing runs. Maybe there's a pattern here that can be exploited.\n\nAnother idea: since the array is made of 1s and 2s, any non-decreasing subsequence will consist of a series of 1s followed by 2s, possibly. Because once a 2 appears, any subsequent 1 breaks the non-decreasing order. So the LNDS is determined by how many 1s come before 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. For example, in the array [1, 2, 1, 2], the LNDS is 4, as all elements are non-decreasing when reversed. Or in the example given, after reversing [2,3], the array becomes [1,1,2,2], which has an LNDS of 4.\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, the original array is [1,2,1,2]. The LNDS without any reversal is 2 (like 1,2,2 or 1,1,2). But after reversing positions 2-3, the array becomes [1,1,2,2], whose LNDS is 4.\n\nSo the key is to maximize the number of 1s that come before 2s in the entire array.\n\nSo perhaps, for any interval [l, r], reversing it may change the arrangement of 1s and 2s in a way that affects the overall count of the LNDS.\n\nHmm, maybe the optimal reversal is one that allows as many 1s as possible to precede the 2s.\n\nWait, but when you reverse a subarray, the relative order of elements within that subarray is flipped. So for example, in the original subarray, if there are a lot of 1s at the end, reversing it would bring them to the front, increasing the number of leading 1s before the first 2 in the subarray.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal reversal is to find a subarray where, when reversed, the number of 1s in that subarray that can come before the 2s outside is maximized.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible l and r, we can calculate how much the LNDS would increase by reversing that particular subarray.\n\nBut even that seems computationally heavy. Let's think about what determines the LNDS.\n\nThe LNDS is equal to the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1 in the array. Or wait, no. Actually, the LNDS is the maximum number of elements that form a non-decreasing sequence. Since all 1s are <= 2s, the best possible is to take all 1s and then all 2s.\n\nWait, no. Because the 1s and 2s can be interleaved. For example, in [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 4. So the optimal is to have all 1s followed by all 2s. But in the array, they are interleaved, so reversing certain parts can help in arranging them in a more optimal way.\n\nWait, but perhaps the LNDS after reversal depends on how many 1s are in the prefix and how many",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in the given sequence of 1s and 2s.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the LNDS can be maximized by considering how the reversal of any subarray affects the arrangement of 1s and 2s. Since the sequence consists only of 1s and 2s, the optimal LNDS will be achieved by having as many 1s as possible followed by as many 2s as possible.\n\n1. **Precompute Prefix and Suffix Counts**: For each position, compute the number of 1s to the left (prefix) and the number of 2s to the right (suffix). This helps in quickly evaluating how a reversal affects the LNDS.\n2. **Evaluate Each Subarray Reversal**: For each possible subarray [l, r], calculate the potential increase in the LNDS if this subarray is reversed. This is done by checking how many 1s are in the reversed subarray and how they contribute to the overall LNDS.\n3. **Maximize LNDS**: Track the maximum LNDS across all possible subarray reversals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Precompute prefix_ones and suffix_twos\nprefix_ones = [0] * n\nprefix_ones[0] = 1 if a[0] == 1 else 0\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    prefix_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i-1] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n\nsuffix_twos = [0] * n\nsuffix_twos[-1] = 1 if a[-1] == 2 else 0\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n    suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n\nmax_length = 0\n\nfor l in range(n):\n    for r in range(l, n):\n        # Calculate the number of 1s in the current subarray\n        current_ones = sum(1 for i in range(l, r+1) if a[i] == 1)\n        # The new prefix_ones would be prefix_ones[l-1] + current_ones\n        # The new suffix_twos would be suffix_twos[r+1] + (current_ones - new_prefix)\n        # The total would be new_prefix + new_suffix_twos\n        new_prefix = prefix_ones[l-1] + current_ones\n        new_suffix_twos = suffix_twos[r+1] + (current_ones - new_prefix)\n        total = new_prefix + new_suffix_twos\n        if total > max_length:\n            max_length = total\n\nprint(max_length)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: We precompute the number of 1s up to each index (prefix) and the number of 2s from each index to the end (suffix). These arrays help in quickly determining how a reversal affects the count of 1s and 2s.\n2. **Subarray Evaluation**: For each subarray [l, r], we calculate how many 1s are present within the subarray. Upon reversal, these 1s contribute to the prefix count before the subarray and the suffix count after the subarray.\n3. **Maximization**: By iterating through all possible subarrays and calculating the potential LNDS for each, we keep track of the maximum value found.\n\nThis approach efficiently evaluates all possible reversals and computes the optimal LNDS, ensuring we handle the constraints effectively.",
