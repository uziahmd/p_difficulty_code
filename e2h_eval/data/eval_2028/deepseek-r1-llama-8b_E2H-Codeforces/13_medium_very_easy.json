For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem defines a major triad as having two intervals: 4 semitones and 3 semitones when the notes are ordered in a specific way. The minor triad is similar but with the intervals reversed—3 semitones first, then 4. Also, the order of the notes matters because we can arrange them in any order to find if either condition holds.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. **Understand the note order**: The notes are cyclically ordered as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So each note has a position in this list, which can be used to calculate the distances between them.\n\n2. **Convert each note to its position index**: For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, and so on up to H being 11.\n\n3. **Generate all possible permutations of the three notes**: Since the triad can be arranged in any order, I need to check all possible orderings of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\n4. **Check for major and minor conditions**: For each permutation (X, Y, Z), calculate the distances between X-Y and Y-Z. If the distances are 4 and 3 (in that order) for a major triad, or 3 and 4 for a minor, then it's classified accordingly.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says that the triad is unordered, so the same set of notes might form both a major and minor triad? No, the problem states that the answer will always be unambiguous, so no such cases exist.\n\nSo, for each possible ordering of the three notes, I'll compute the semitone distances between consecutive notes in that order. Then, I'll see if any of these orderings meet the major or minor criteria.\n\nBut wait, how do I compute the distance between two notes? Since the scale is circular, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but since the distance is measured from the lower to the higher note, I think the correct way is to take (Y - X) mod 12. Because if X is before Y in the cycle, the distance is Y-X. But if Y comes after X in the next cycle, like H to C, the distance is (0 - 11 + 12) = 1? Wait, no, the problem says that the distance is from the lower to the higher. So H to C is one semitone, right? Because H is followed by C. So for any two notes X and Y, the distance is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. Because if Y is after X, it's straightforward; if not, adding 12 gives the correct number of steps in the circle.\n\nWait, no: for example, the distance from C (0) to H (11) is 11 semitones. Because moving from C to H is 11 steps. But according to the problem statement, the distance is measured from the lower to the higher, but what if X is higher than Y in the order?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppermost tone.\" So the distance between X and Y is the minimal number of semitones when you move upward along the scale. So the distance from E to C would be 8 semitones (since going from E to C requires wrapping around the scale: E to F is 1, F to F# is 2, ..., C is 8 semitones away). So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y >= X, else (Y + 12 - X). Or, more simply, (Y - X) % 12. Because for X=11 (H) and Y=0 (C), (0 - 11) mod 12 is 1, which is correct.\n\nWait, no: H to C is one semitone. But (0 -11) is -11, mod 12 is 1. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. Because if Y is after X in the scale, it's Y - X. If Y is before X, then adding 12 gives the correct count.\n\nWait, let's test some examples:\n\n- C to E: 4 semitones.\nC is 0, E is 4. 4-0=4 → correct.\nE to C: (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. Correct.\n\nAnother example:\nB to C# is 3 semitones. B is 10, C# is 1. 1-10 = -9 mod 12 is 3. Correct.\nC# to F: C# is 1, F is 5. 5-1=4. Correct.\n\nSo the formula for distance between X and Y is (Y - X) % 12.\n\nSo, for each permutation (x, y, z) of the three notes, compute d1 = (y - x) mod 12, d2 = (z - y) mod 12.\n\nIf d1 is 4 and d2 is 3, then it's a major triad.\nIf d1 is 3 and d2 is 4, then it's a minor triad.\n\nBut wait, the order of the notes could be any of the permutations. So for a given set of three notes, say [A, B, H], their indices might be, for example, 0, 1, 11.\n\nWe need to generate all possible orderings of the three notes, and for each ordering, compute the distances between consecutive notes.\n\nIf any permutation meets the major condition, it's a major triad. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the triad is an unordered set. So the same three notes can be arranged in different orders, and we have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit either major or minor.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input as a list of three strings.\n2. Convert each string into a note, then map each note to its index in the scale.\n   - Create a dictionary for mapping note names to their positions.\n   - The order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n   - So the indexes are 0 to 11.\n3. Once we have the three indexes, generate all possible permutations of these three indexes.\n4. For each permutation (x, y, z):\n   a. Compute d1 = (y - x) % 12\n   b. Compute d2 = (z - y) % 12\n   c. Check if d1 is 4 and d2 is 3 → major.\n   d. Else, check if d1 is 3 and d2 is 4 → minor.\n5. If any permutation satisfies major, output 'major'.\n6. Else, if any permutation satisfies minor, output 'minor'.\n7. Else, output 'strange'.\n\nNow, the question is: how to handle the permutations. Since there are only 3! = 6 permutations, it's manageable.\n\nLet's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, create a list of the note names in order, then create a dictionary to map each note to its index.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_idx = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nThen, read the input line as a list of three strings:\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nThen, get their indices:\n\ntriad = [note_to_idx[note] for note in input_notes]\n\nThen, generate all permutations of the triad:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nperms = permutations(triad)\n\nFor each perm in perms:\n\nx, y, z = perm\n\nCompute d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\nd2 = (z - y) % 12\n\nif d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major found.\n\nelif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor found.\n\nOnce a permutation is found to satisfy major or minor, we can immediately decide and break.\n\nBecause once any permutation fits, that's the classification.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as:\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(triad):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n        found_major = True\n        break\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n        found_minor = True\n        break\n\nAfter checking all permutations:\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nThat seems solid.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nSample Output:\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nLet's process each case.\n\nFirst case: C, E, G.\n\nIndices: C=0, E=4, G=6.\n\nPermutations include (0,4,6):\n\nd1=4, d2=2 → not 4 and 3.\n\nWait, but another permutation: 0,4,6 → 4, 2.\n\nWait, maybe another permutation like 4,6,0?\n\nd1 = (6-4) mod12=2, d2= (0-6) mod12=6 → no.\n\nWait, maybe another permutation like 0,6,4.\n\nd1=(6-0)=6 mod12=6, d2=(4-6)=-2 mod12=10 → no.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nWait, the first case is C, E, G.\n\nLooking for a permutation where the two intervals are 4 and 3.\n\nWhat's another permutation: E, C, G.\n\nNo, because E is 4, C is 0, which would give d1 as (0-4) mod12=8, which is not 4 or 3.\n\nWait, maybe E, G, C.\n\nE=4, G=6, C=0.\n\nd1 =6-4=2, d2= (0-6) mod12=6.\n\nNope.\n\nWait, perhaps another permutation: G, C, E.\n\nG is 6, C is 0, E is 4.\n\nd1 = (0-6) mod12=6, d2= (4-0)=4.\n\nSo d1 is 6, d2 is4. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recompute.\n\nWait, for the triad C, E, G:\n\nLooking for a permutation where the first interval is 4, second is 3.\n\nLet's see: C, E, G.\n\nd1=4, d2=2. No.\n\nHow about E, C, G.\n\nE is4, C is0, G is6.\n\nd1 = (0-4) mod12= 8. No.\n\nWait, maybe E, G, C.\n\nE(4), G(6), C(0).\n\nd1=6-4=2 mod12=2.\n\nd2=0-6= -6 mod12=6. No.\n\nWhat about G, E, C.\n\nG(6), E(4), C(0).\n\nd1=4-6= -2 mod12=10.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a permutation where the order is C, G, E.\n\nC(0), G(6), E(4).\n\nd1=6-0=6 mod12=6.\n\nd2=4-6= -2 mod12=10. No.\n\nHmm, this isn't working. Did I make a mistake in considering the possible permutations?\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the correct order. The major triad C E G is formed when ordered as C, E, G.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the distance between C and E is 4, and E to G is 3. So in that order, yes.\n\nWait, but according to our code, the permutation is (0,4,6).\n\nd1=4, d2= (6-4)=2. Oh wait, no! Because in that permutation, d2 is (6-4) mod12=2. So the sum is 6, not 7.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because in the problem statement, a major triad requires the total to be 7 semitones. So the code is currently checking for d1=4 and d2=3, which sums to 7.\n\nBut in the permutation (C,E,G), d1=4, d2=2. So why is it considered a major triad?\n\nWait, this indicates a misunderstanding. Oh, wait no: the problem statement says that in a major triad, the first distance is 4, the second is 3. So the sum is 7.\n\nIn the example, C-E is 4, E-G is 3. So the sum is 7.\n\nBut according to the code, for permutation (C, E, G), d1 is 4, d2 is 3? Wait, because E is at index4, G is at 6. So d2 is (6-4)=2.\n\nWait, that's 2 semitones. So that's wrong.\n\nWait, that's a big problem. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, no, wait! The notes are C, E, G.\n\nC is 0, E is4, G is7? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the note order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nWait, wait, G is note 6, G# is 7, A is8, etc.\n\nWait, no. Let me recount the order:\n\nIndex 0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nYes, so G is at index7.\n\nSo, for the triad C, E, G: C is 0, E is4, G is7.\n\nSo, in permutation (0,4,7):\n\nd1 =4, d2=3.\n\nYes, because 7-4=3.\n\nSo in that case, the code would correctly identify it as a major triad.\n\nWait, but in my initial processing, I thought G was at 6. That was my mistake.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo, for the first sample input:\n\nCase 1: C E G → indices 0,4,7.\n\nLooking for a permutation where the first interval is 4, second is 3.\n\nOne such permutation is 0,4,7.\n\nThus, found_major is True.\n\nSo the code would output 'major' for the first case.\n\nSecond case: C#, B, F.\n\nNotes: C# is 1, B is10, F is5.\n\nSo, possible permutations:\n\nCheck each permutation.\n\nLooking for any where the two distances are 4 and3.\n\nLet's see permutation (B, C#, F): 10,1,5.\n\nd1 = (1-10) mod12= (1-10)= -9 mod12=3.\n\nd2=(5-1)=4 mod12=4.\n\nSo d1=3, d2=4 → minor triad.\n\nThus, the code will find this and output 'minor'.\n\nThird case: A, B, H.\n\nIndices: A=8, B=9, H=11.\n\nCheck all permutations.\n\nPossible permutation: B, H, A.\n\nWait, no, the triad is A, B, H.\n\nWait, looking for any permutation where the intervals are 4 and3.\n\nCheck permutation (B, H, A):\n\nB is9, H is11, A is8.\n\nd1= (11-9)=2.\n\nd2= (8-11)= -3 mod12=9.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAnother permutation: H, A, B.\n\nH is11, A is8, B is9.\n\nd1= (8-11) mod12= ( -3 ) mod12=9.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: A, H, B.\n\nA=8, H=11, B=9.\n\nd1=11-8=3.\n\nd2=9-11= -2 mod12=10.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H.\n\nB=9, A=8, H=11.\n\nd1=8-9= -1 mod12=11.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: B, H, A.\n\nWait, tried that.\n\nAnother permutation: H, B, A.\n\nH=11, B=9, A=8.\n\nd1=9-11= -2 mod12=10.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: A, B, H.\n\nA=8, B=9, H=11.\n\nd1=9-8=1.\n\nd2=11-9=2.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: H, A, B.\n\nH=11, A=8, B=9.\n\nd1=8-11= -3 mod12=9.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, so none of the permutations satisfy either major or minor.\n\nThus, output is 'strange'.\n\nSo the code works for the sample.\n\nAnother test case: C, C#, D.\n\nNo, because it's a three-note chord, but the problem requires exactly three notes.\n\nWait, but the input is always three.\n\nWhat about a chord that is a minor triad.\n\nFor example, C, D#, G.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nC is0, D# is3, G is7.\n\nIn permutation (C, D#, G):\n\nd1=3, d2=4.\n\nWhich is 3 and4 → minor.\n\nThus, the code will output 'minor'.\n\nAnother test case: D, F, A.\n\nWait, D is2, F is5, A is9.\n\nPermutation D, F, A.\n\nd1=5-2=3.\n\nd2=9-5=4.\n\nSo minor.\n\nThus, code would output 'minor'.\n\nWhat about a triad that is neither.\n\nLike C, D, F.\n\nC is0, D is2, F is5.\n\nCheck all permutations.\n\nAny permutation that satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\nFor example, permutation C, D, F:\n\nd1=2-0=2.\n\nd2=5-2=3.\n\nSo 2 and3 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: D, F, C.\n\nd1=5-2=3.\n\nd2=0-5= -5 mod12=7.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: F, C, D.\n\nd1=0-5= -5 mod12=7.\n\nd2=2-0=2.\n\nNo.\n\nNo permutation satisfies major or minor, so output is 'strange'.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nNeed to import permutations from itertools.\n\nAlso, the note order is fixed, so the note_to_idx is built accordingly.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- All three notes are the same. Wait, but the problem says the triad is an unordered set of three notes. So, can they be the same note? No, because a triad requires three distinct notes. Because a triad is a set, not a multiset. So the input won't have duplicates.\n\nThus, the code doesn't have to handle that case.\n\nAnother edge case: the three notes wrap around the scale.\n\nLike H, C, E.\n\nH is11, C is0, E is4.\n\nCheck permutation H, C, E.\n\nd1=0-11= -11 mod12=1.\n\nd2=4-0=4.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: C, E, H.\n\nd1=4, d2= (11-4)=7.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, no, because H is 11.\n\nWait, C, E, H: d1=4, d2= (11-4) =7 mod12=7.\n\nSo 4 and7 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: E, H, C.\n\nd1=11-4=7 mod12=7.\n\nd2=0-11= -11 mod12=1.\n\nNo.\n\nSo, no major or minor.\n\nThus, output is 'strange'.\n\nAnother case: F, A, C.\n\nF is5, A is9, C is0.\n\nPermutation F, A, C.\n\nd1=9-5=4.\n\nd2=0-9= -9 mod12=3.\n\nThus, d1=4, d2=3 → major.\n\nSo output is 'major'.\n\nThus, code should work.\n\nThus, I think the code is correct.\n",
