The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

The key insight is that the number of distinct integers reachable by the frog at position `i` is equal to the minimum of the number of steps it takes to reach `i` with jumps of size `a` and the number of steps it takes to reach `i` with jumps of size `b`. This is because the frog can either jump `a` units or `b` units from any position, so the maximum distance it can cover in one step is the larger of `a` and `b`.\n\nThe script reads the input from standard input, calculates the sum of `f(i)` for all `i` from `0` to `m`, and prints the result to standard output. It uses a simple loop to iterate over all values of `i` from `0` to `m`, and for each `i`, it calculates the maximum of `0` and the minimum of `i // a + 1` and `(i + b) // b + 1`. The result is accumulated in the variable `ans`, which is printed at the end.\n\nNote that this script assumes that the input is well-formed and does not contain any errors. In a real-world scenario, you would want to add error handling code to handle cases where the input is malformed or invalid.",
