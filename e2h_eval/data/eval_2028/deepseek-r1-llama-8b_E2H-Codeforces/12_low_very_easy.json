The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, Xenia is in a city with houses arranged in a ring, right? She needs to do some tasks, and each task requires her to be at a specific house. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks.\n\nWait, the problem says that each task i must be done after all tasks j where j < i. Oh, right, because the list is given in order. So for each task ai, she must reach it after completing all previous ones.\n\nHmm, how do we model this? Well, since the ring is one-way and clockwise, moving from a house to the next takes one unit of time. So, the movement is only forward around the ring.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Maybe we can process each task in order and keep track of the current position. For each ai, we need to calculate the distance from the current position to ai, considering the ring structure.\n\nBut wait, the ring is circular, so the distance could be either clockwise or counter-clockwise. But since traffic is only clockwise, she can't move backward. So, the path is always in one direction. So, the minimal distance between two points on the ring is the minimum of (ai - current) mod n or (current - ai) mod n, but since movement is only clockwise, she can only go the shorter way if that's possible.\n\nWait no, because she can't go the other way. So, the distance from current to ai is (ai - current) % n, because the ring is arranged in a circle, and she can only move clockwise.\n\nWait, for example: if current is 3 and ai is 1 in a 4-house ring. The distance would be (1 - 3) mod 4 = 2? No, wait, that's not right. Because moving clockwise, from 3 to 4 is 1 step, then to 1 is another. So total 2 steps. Which is indeed (1 - 3 +4) %4 = 2. So yes, the formula is correct.\n\nSo, for each ai in the sorted list, we compute the distance from the current position to ai, add that to the total time, and update the current position to ai.\n\nWait, but the tasks are given in a certain order. Oh wait, no! Wait, the input is m integers a1, a2,...am. But the problem states that she needs to complete all tasks with numbers less than i. So she has to process them in the order they are given. So a1 must be completed first, then a2, etc.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" So for the i-th task, she must have already done all j < i. So the processing order is the order of the array a.\n\nWait, but looking at the example:\n\nIn the first sample input, the second line is 3 2 3.\n\nSo the sequence is 1 →2 →3 →4 →1 →2 →3. Let's see:\n\nShe starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 3: she needs to get there. From 1 to 2 is 1, 2 to 3 is another, so 2 steps. Time is now 2. Current position is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2: she needs to go back from 3 to 2. But since movement is only clockwise, the distance is (2-3) mod4= ( -1) mod4= 3? Or is it (2 +4 -3) =3? So she moves 3 steps: 3→4→1→2. So time increases by 3, making total 5. Then current is 2.\n\nThird task is 3: from 2, moving to 3 is 1 step. Time becomes 6. So total time is 6.\n\nWait, but why did she have to go back to 2 and then again to 3? Because the second task is 2, which is before 3 in the list. So she had to do that.\n\nAh, so the approach is to process each task in the order they are given, keeping track of the current position and the cumulative time.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the list of tasks? No, because the order matters. Wait no, the problem says that for the i-th task, she must have done all j < i. So the i-th task must be processed in the given order.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- Initialize current_position as 1.\n- Initialize time as 0.\n- For each ai in the list of tasks:\n   a. Compute the distance from current_position to ai. Since movement is only clockwise, the distance",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks given that she starts at house number 1 and can only move clockwise around a ring of houses.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Understanding**: Xenia must complete each task in the given order, moving from one house to another in a clockwise direction. Each move between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n2. **Movement Constraints**: Since movement is only allowed in a clockwise direction, the distance from any house `current` to a target house `ai` can be calculated as `(ai - current) % n`, where `n` is the total number of houses.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each task in the given order, compute the distance from the current position to the target house, update the total time, and set the current position to the target house for the next iteration.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent = 1\ntime = 0\nfor ai in a:\n    distance = (ai - current) % n\n    time += distance\n    current = ai\nprint(time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with zero time elapsed.\n2. **Processing Each Task**: For each task in the given order:\n   - Calculate the clockwise distance from the current house to the target house using modulo arithmetic.\n   - Add this distance to the total time.\n   - Update the current position to the target house.\n3. **Output the Result**: After processing all tasks, print the total time accumulated.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum time required by iterating through each task once, ensuring an optimal solution.",
