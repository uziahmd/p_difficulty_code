They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem is about a playoff tournament where 2^n teams compete. The structure of the tournament is such that in each phase, the number of games halves until only one champion remains. Each game's outcome depends on a character in a string s. If s[i] is '0', then in that phase, the lower-skilled team wins. If it's '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nWe're given the string s, and we need to find all x such that there exists a permutation p of skill levels (1 to 2^n) where x is the champion. So, the output is all possible x values in ascending order.\n\nHmm. So the approach is to model the tournament and determine for each possible team whether they can win given the rules.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Maybe using a bitmask or some kind of binary representation since n can be up to 18, which gives 2^18=262144, but wait, no—wait, 2^18 is about 260k, which is manageable for certain algorithms, but not if we do anything exponential beyond that.\n\nWait, the tournament has log2(2^n) = n phases. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half. For example, phase 1: 2^(n) teams, 2^(n-1) games. Phase 2: 2^(n-1) teams, 2^(n-2) games. And so on until phase n, which has one game.\n\nSo, for each possible team x, we need to check whether x can be the winner under the given rules.\n\nBut how? Because the permutation determines the initial pairing, and the way the winners proceed affects the next phases.\n\nWait, but the permutation isn't fixed. We can choose any permutation p such that the tournament results in x being the champion. So perhaps for each x, we can model whether x can be the top based on the rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the tournament as a series of binary trees. Each phase is a level in the tree, where each node represents a match between two subtrees.\n\nWait, yes. The tournament structure is similar to a single-elimination bracket. Each game is a node in the binary tree, with leaves being the initial teams. The root is the final game, whose winner is the champion.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to building such a binary tree where each non-leaf node has two children (the previous matches), and the outcome of each node depends on the s string for its level.\n\nWait, but the structure of the tree is determined by the initial pairings. Oh, right, because in the first phase, the teams are paired as 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc. So the initial tree is a complete binary tree, where each leaf is a team, and internal nodes represent matches at each phase.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first phase is the initial round, so each game is between adjacent teams in groups of two. So the initial pairings are 1&2, 3&4, ..., up to 2^{n-1}+1 and 2^{n-1}+2, etc. Then the winners form the next round, which is again paired similarly, but over larger groups.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial pairings can be represented as a binary heap-like structure. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering each phase as a level in the tournament. For each phase i (starting from 0 to n-1), the games are grouped into 2^{n-i-1} matches, each consisting of two teams from the previous phase.\n\nWait, perhaps the key idea is to model the tournament as a series of rounds, where each round corresponds to a phase. For each round, the way the teams are paired is determined by their initial positions, but the actual pairings depend on the outcomes of previous rounds.\n\nBut this seems complicated because the structure of the tournament depends on the outcomes of previous matches. So for each x, we need to simulate whether it can reach the final, considering all possible matchups along the path.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for each position x, determine the earliest phase where x must win to become the champion, and check if it's possible for x to reach that point.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. For each team x, it needs to win all the matches in each phase along the path to the final. The way it progresses through each phase depends on the s string.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, we can compute the set of required conditions for x to win in each phase.\n\nLet me consider the tournament structure:\n\n- The tournament is a binary tree with n levels (since 2^n teams, each round halves the count until 1 remains). The levels correspond to the phases.\n\nEach node in the tree represents a match. The leaves are the initial teams. Each internal node has two children, which are the previous matches that feed into it.\n\nIn each match, the winner proceeds to the parent node.\n\nThe outcome of each match is determined by s[i], where i is the phase index (but I'm not entirely sure about the indexing).\n\nWait, the string s has length n. For each i-th phase (from 0 to n-1?), the rule applies. So for each phase, s[i] tells us whether in that phase, the higher or lower skilled team wins.\n\nSo, for each phase, the matches are determined by the current group of teams. In phase 0, the matches are between consecutive pairs (1v2, 3v4, etc.). In phase 1, the winners of those matches are grouped into new pairs, and so on.\n\nBut the structure is such that each phase's pairings are based on the initial arrangement of teams, not their progression.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial match structure is fixed: the first phase has pairs 1-2, 3-4, ..., up to 2^{n-1}-1 and 2^{n-1}, then the next phase groups the winners into 1-2, 3-4, etc., but over a larger group.\n\nNo, wait, no. Because after the first phase, the remaining 2^{n-1} teams are the winners of their respective matches. Then, in phase 2, these teams are paired as the first 2^{n-2} teams, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model each phase's grouping. Let's take n=3 as an example:\n\nPhase 0: 8 teams → 4 matches. Pairs are (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), (7,8).\n\nPhase 1: 4 teams → 2 matches. The first match is between the winners of (1,2) and (3,4). The second is between (5,6) and (7,8).\n\nPhase 2: 2 teams → 1 match. Winner of phase 1 matches.\n\nSo, the structure is a binary tree with 3 levels. Each match is a node, and the leaves are the initial teams.\n\nBut the way the initial matches are grouped is fixed: phase 0 is the bottom level, phase 1 above, etc.\n\nWait, no. Because in phase 1, the grouping is determined by the initial phase 0's winners. So, for phase 1, the first two winners come from the first two phase 0 matches, the next two from the next two, etc.\n\nSo, the way the matches are structured is a perfect binary tree of height n.\n\nGiven that, for each team, the path to the root is determined by the way the tournament is structured.\n\nNow, for a given x, to determine if it can be the champion, we need to ensure that in each phase, when x plays against someone, it wins according to the phase's rule.\n\nBut since the structure is fixed, perhaps for each x, we can compute the required set of matches it must win, and see if it's possible under the s string.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, the path it takes through the tournament is fixed based on the initial pairings. So, for x, the first match is in phase 0, then in phase 1, etc.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial pairing is fixed, but the opponents in later phases depend on the outcomes of previous matches.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to think differently.\n\nEach phase i (0-based) has 2^{n-i} games. The number of teams in phase i is 2^{n-i+1}? Or wait, perhaps the number of teams decreases by half each phase. So phase 0: 2^n teams, phase 1: 2^{n-1}, phase 2: 2^{n-2}, ..., phase n-1: 2 teams, phase n: 1 team.\n\nEach phase i is characterized by s[i], which is either 0 or 1. So for each phase, the way matches are resolved depends on s[i].\n\nSo, for a team x to be the champion, it must win all the matches in every phase along its path to the final.\n\nBut the exact path depends on the initial pairings and the outcomes of other matches. However, since we can choose the permutation p, perhaps we can arrange the teams in such a way that x can reach the final.\n\nWait, but the permutation p is the order of the teams' skills. So for x to be the champion, it must have a higher or lower skill than its opponents in each match, depending on the phase's rule.\n\nSo, the key is: for each phase i, when x is involved in a match in that phase, the condition based on s[i] must be satisfied.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, we can determine the minimal and maximal possible teams that can be present in the matches at that phase, and then see if x can be among them and satisfy the condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each phase i, we can model the constraints on the teams that must be in the matches at that phase, based on the previous phases.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAnother idea: For each phase i, the matches are between certain ranges of teams. For example, in phase 0, the matches are between (1,2), (3,4), etc. In phase 1, the matches are between the winners of the first two phase 0 matches, then the next two, etc. So the matches in phase i are formed by grouping the winners from 2^{i} consecutive phase (i-1) matches.\n\nWait, perhaps the group of 2^{i} teams in phase i is composed of 2^{i-1} matches from phase i-1.\n\nSo, the way the tournament is structured is a perfect binary tree, and each phase corresponds to a certain level.\n\nThus, for each phase i, the matches are between consecutive 2^{i} teams, grouped into 2^{i-1} matches.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the initial structure is such that in phase i, the matches are between teams from positions [k*2^{i+1} + 1, (k+1)*2^{i+1}] for k in some range, but that might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial matches are arranged in a way that the tournament forms a complete binary tree. So, for a team x, the path to the final is determined by the binary representation of x-1, perhaps.\n\nWait, maybe each team's position in the initial list can be represented in binary, and the tournament structure is such that the matches are determined by the highest set bit in their index.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each team can be represented in binary, and the tournament's structure is such that each match is determined by the least significant bits that differ.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe another approach: for each x, the path to becoming champion requires that in each phase, when it's matched against another team, it must win according to the phase's rule. So for each phase i, we can determine whether x can reach that phase, and if so, what constraints must be satisfied.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let's think recursively. For a team x to win the tournament, it must first win all the matches in phase 0, then phase 1, and so on, until phase n-1.\n\nBut in phase 0, x is in a specific group. For example, if x is in group (1,2), then x must beat the other team in that group. But which team is it? It depends on the permutation, right?\n\nAh, right! Because the permutation p is a permutation of the skills, the initial pairings are based on the indices of the teams. So, for example, team 1 is paired with team 2, team 3 with 4, etc., regardless of their skill levels. So the initial pairings are fixed based on the team's index, not their skill.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem statement says that in the first phase, the teams are split into pairs: 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc. So the initial pairings are fixed as per the team's initial numbering, not their skill levels. So the initial structure is fixed; the permutation p determines the skill levels of the teams, but the initial pairings are based on the team's index.\n\nSo, the initial pairings are fixed. The permutation p only determines the skills, but the way teams are paired is based on their original indices.\n\nSo, for example, if the permutation is [3,1,2,4], then team 1 has skill 3, team 2 has skill 1, etc. But the initial pairings are 1v2, 3v4, regardless of their skills.\n\nThis is crucial because it means that the structure of the tournament is fixed, and the permutation p only determines the strengths of the teams, but not the pairings.\n\nSo, for any permutation, the initial pairings are the same as per the team's original indices.\n\nTherefore, for each team x, the path it takes through the tournament is determined by the initial pairings. So, for example, team x will always face a specific set of opponents in each phase, depending on its initial pairing.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because in each phase, the pairings are determined by the current group of teams. So after phase 0, the winners are grouped into new pairs for phase 1. The way they are grouped is again in adjacent pairs.\n\nWait, for example, in phase 0, the 8 teams are paired as (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), (7,8). The winners of these four matches are then paired in phase 1 as (w1, w2), (w3, w4), etc., where w1 is the winner of 1v2, w2 of 3v4, etc.\n\nSo in phase 1, the first match is between the winners of the first two phase 0 matches.\n\nSo, for any team x, the path it takes through the tournament is fixed, based on the initial pairing.\n\nSo, for team x, in phase 0, it is in a specific match. The winner of that match proceeds to phase 1, and so on.\n\nSo, for each team x, the path through the tournament is determined by its initial position. Thus, the initial pairings fix the structure of the tournament.\n\nWait, but that's not the case because the permutation p can change which team is assigned to each index. For example, the permutation could assign a high-skill team to index 1, making it likely to win early matches.\n\nBut the initial pairings are based on the original indices, not the permutation. So, for any permutation, the initial pairings are fixed as per the indices. So the structure of the tournament is fixed, but the skills vary.\n\nTherefore, for a given permutation, the tournament's structure is fixed, and the outcome depends on the skills and the structure.\n\nSo, for each team x, the path it takes through the tournament is fixed based on its index. Wait, no, because the permutation is a permutation of the skills. So, for example, if x is the team at index 1, it will face the team at index 2 in phase 0. But the skills of these two are determined by the permutation.\n\nSo, in phase 0, team 1's opponent is team 2. Whether team 1 wins depends on their skills and the phase's rule.\n\nThus, for each phase, the teams that meet are determined by the initial structure, but their skills are determined by the permutation.\n\nSo, for a given permutation p, the initial pairings are fixed, and the winners proceed as per the phase rules.\n\nOur goal is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the champion.\n\nSo, perhaps for each x, we can model the conditions that x must satisfy in each phase along its path to the final, given the s string.\n\nWait, but the path depends on x's initial position. So, for example, team 1's path is different from team 2's.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, the path it takes through the tournament is determined by the structure, and the phase in which x faces certain other teams.\n\nBut since the structure is fixed, the phases in which x is involved are determined by the initial pairings.\n\nWait, perhaps each team x has a certain set of matches it must win in each phase. For example, in phase 0, x is in a certain match, and in phase 1, it may meet another team, and so on.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, it must win all its matches, which are determined by the structure, and for each phase, the outcome depends on the s string.\n\nThus, for each x, we can precompute the set of matches it must win, and for each phase, determine whether x can have the required skill relative to its opponent in that match.\n\nBut the problem is that the opponents in each phase are also determined by the initial structure and the permutation.\n\nWait, but in the permutation p, the skill levels are arbitrary. So, for x to win all its required matches, it's necessary that for each match in its path, the condition imposed by the phase's rule is satisfied.\n\nSo, perhaps for each x, the minimal and maximal possible skill values are determined by the path it takes, and whether x can be placed in such a way that it meets those conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the tournament as a series of layers, where each layer represents a phase, and for each team, track the possible range of skills it must have relative to its opponents in each phase.\n\nWait, perhaps it's similar to a binary tournament bracket where each round imposes certain constraints on the participants.\n\nSo, for each x, the minimal and maximal possible values are determined by the path x would take through the tournament.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFor each phase i (0-based), the teams are grouped into 2^{n - i - 1} matches. Each match is between two teams that were winners of the previous phase's matches.\n\nWait, no. Because in each phase, the matches are between consecutive teams in the current group, which is formed by the winners of the previous phase's matches.\n\nSo, for example, phase 0: 8 teams, 4 matches.\n\nPhase 1: 4 winners, 2 matches. Each match is between the first two winners, next two, etc.\n\nPhase 2: 2 winners, 1 match.\n\nSo, for a team x, to reach phase i, it must have won all the matches in phases 0 to i-1.\n\nMoreover, in phase i, x is matched with a specific other team, say y, determined by the initial structure.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial structure determines the pairings in each phase.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is a binary tree, and for each team, the path to the root is determined by the binary representation of their index minus 1.\n\nWait, that rings a bell. For instance, in a tournament of 8 teams, the binary representations of 0-7 (assuming 0-based) can be used to determine the matches.\n\nYes! I recall that in a standard single-elimination tournament with 2^k players, each player's path through the tournament is determined by their index in binary. For example, for 8 teams, the binary representation of their index (0-7) can be used to determine the order in which they face each other.\n\nSpecifically, each bit in the binary representation indicates which side of the bracket the player is on. For example, the least significant bit determines the left or right half of the bracket in each round.\n\nWait, more accurately, in each round, the teams are paired based on their current position in the bracket. So, the initial bracket is filled in a way that the first round matches are 0 vs 1, 2 vs 3, 4 vs 5, 6 vs 7. The second round matches are (winners of 0-1) vs (winners of 2-3), and similarly for others.\n\nSo, the bracket is a binary tree, and the path of each team is determined by the binary digits of their index.\n\nSo, for a team x (1-based?), we can convert x-1 to binary and determine the path through the tournament.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the initial pairings are 1v2, 3v4, etc. So perhaps for 1-based indices, the pairings are (2k-1, 2k) for k=1 to 2^{n-1}.\n\nThen, in the next phase, the winners are paired again as (2k-1, 2k), but now the group size is 2^{n-1}.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the bracket as a binary heap.\n\nAlternatively, for each team x, we can compute its \"path\" in the tournament by looking at the binary representation of x-1 (assuming 0-based indexing).\n\nFor example, for 8 teams (x from 1 to 8):\n\n- Team 1: index 0 → binary 000 → path goes left, left, left, ... ?\nWait, perhaps for each round, the teams are grouped into blocks of size 2^{round}, and within each block, the first half is paired with the second half.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a pattern.\n\nIn a tournament with 8 teams, the initial matches are 1v2, 3v4, 5v6, 7v8.\n\nThe next round has the winners of 1v2, 3v4, 5v6, 7v8, which are grouped as (w1, w2), (w3, w4), etc., so in the second round, the matches are (w1 vs w2), (w3 vs w4), etc.\n\nWait, but the way the matches are structured is that in each phase, the teams are divided into consecutive blocks of size 2^{phase}, and each block is split into pairs.\n\nSo, for phase i, the block size is 2^{i+1}, and each block is split into 2^i pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model it is:\n\nFor a team x, in each phase i, it is part of a group of 2^{i+1} teams, which are split into 2^i matches of 2 teams each.\n\nWait, perhaps each phase can be thought of as a level in the binary tree, with the root being the final match.\n\nSo, the initial phase (phase 0) has 2^1 matches, each involving two teams.\n\nThe next phase (phase 1) has 2^0 matches, each involving the winners of two phase 0 matches.\n\nAnd so on, until phase n-1, which has 1 match.\n\nBut wait, the total number of phases is n. Because 2^n teams require n phases to reduce to 1.\n\nSo, for each team x, its path to the final is determined by the structure of the tournament, which is fixed.\n\nThus, for each x, we can precompute the set of matches it must win, and for each match, the condition on the team's skill relative to its opponent.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the tournament as a binary tree where each node represents a match. The leaves are the teams, and each internal node represents a match between two subtrees.\n\nEach match in the tree has a rule (based on s) that determines whether the higher or lower-skilled team wins.\n\nFor each match node, the two children are the matches that feed into it.\n\nSo, for a team x to be the champion, it must be the winner of all the matches along the path from the leaf to the root.\n\nEach match in this path has a rule (s[i] for some i) that determines whether x must be higher or lower than its opponent.\n\nThus, for x to be a winning integer, there must exist a permutation p where, for each match along x's path, the rule is satisfied.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nPerhaps we can model this as a binary decision tree, where each node represents a match, and for each match, we can determine the required relation between the two teams.\n\nThen, for x, the path from the leaf (x's node) to the root must satisfy all the relations dictated by the s string.\n\nBut wait, the s string is given, so each match has a fixed rule. So for each match, the rule is known, and the required relation is known.\n\nThus, for x to be the champion, along its path, for each match, x must be >= (if s[i] is 1) or <= (if s[i] is 0) than its opponent in that match.\n\nBut the problem is that the opponents in each match are not known in advance—they depend on the permutation p.\n\nWait, but the permutation p is a permutation of the skills. So, for x to win, we can arrange p such that in each of x's matches, the required condition holds.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem reduces to checking whether, for the path of x, the constraints imposed by the s string can be satisfied.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think in terms of constraints. For each match along x's path, x must be either greater than or less than its opponent, depending on s[i].\n\nSo, for each match, we can write a constraint: x > y if s[i] is 1, or x < y if s[i] is 0.\n\nBut the problem is that y is another team, and their skill is determined by p.\n\nBut since p is a permutation, all the skills are unique and cover all numbers from 1 to 2^n.\n\nThus, for each match in x's path, the opponent y must be either less than or greater than x, based on the phase's rule.\n\nSo, the problem is to determine if x can be placed in such a way that, for each match in its path, the required condition is met, considering all the other constraints from the other matches.\n\nWait, but this seems like a graph of constraints that may be difficult to model.\n\nAlternative approach: for each x, determine the maximum and minimum possible values that x must have in order to satisfy all the constraints along its path.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, we can compute the set of possible y values that it must face in each match, and the constraints for each match.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: since the structure is fixed, perhaps for each x, the path it takes through the tournament is fixed, and thus the set of matches it must win is fixed.\n\nWait, no, because the opponents are determined by the permutation. But perhaps the constraints on the opponents' skills can be determined based on the phase's rule and the required outcome.\n\nWait, maybe for x to win, in each match along its path, the opponent must be less than x if s[i] is 1, or greater than x if s[i] is 0.\n\nBut since the permutation is arbitrary, except for the fixed initial pairings, perhaps the constraints can be modeled as x needing to be in a certain order relative to certain other teams.\n\nWait, but the permutation is a single permutation. So, for x to be the champion, all the constraints along its path must be satisfied by the same permutation.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to determining whether x can be arranged in a way that satisfies all the constraints imposed by the s string on its path.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nPerhaps, for each x, we can perform a recursive check of the path it must take, ensuring that each match's condition is met.\n\nWait, let's model the tournament as a binary tree where each node is a match. The leaves are the teams, and each internal node has two children representing the matches that lead into it.\n\nFor each match, the two children are the sub-matches that produce the winners for that match.\n\nThus, for a given x, the path from x's leaf node to the root is the sequence of matches x must win.\n\nEach match in this path has a rule (s[i]) that determines whether the winner must be higher or lower than the loser.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, along this path, in each match, x must be the winner, which depends on the rule of the match.\n\nBut how do the other teams in the matches affect this?\n\nWait, perhaps for each match in x's path, we can determine the required relation between x and its opponent in that match.\n\nFor example, if the match's rule is 1, then x must be higher than the opponent. If it's 0, x must be lower.\n\nBut the opponent is another team, and their placement in the permutation must satisfy this.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, all the matches along its path must have x in the correct relation to each opponent, given the rules.\n\nThus, for each match in x's path, we can record the required relation (x > y or x < y) and then find if there exists a permutation p that satisfies all these constraints.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps it's similar to a system of inequalities. For each match in x's path, we have an inequality between x and its opponent.\n\nThe question is whether these inequalities can be satisfied simultaneously.\n\nBut since the permutation is a bijection, all the variables are distinct and cover all integers from 1 to 2^n.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to checking if the system of inequalities is feasible.\n\nBut with n up to 18, 2^18=262144, which is manageable for certain algorithms.\n\nWait, but for each x, the number of matches in its path is equal to n (since the tournament has n phases). So, for each x, we need to collect n constraints.\n\nBut for each x, the constraints involve other variables (other teams), which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the constraints can be transformed into ranges that x must lie within, considering the other constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps for each match in x's path, we can model the minimal and maximal possible values that x must have, given the constraints.\n\nWait, for example:\n\n- Suppose in a match, the rule is 1 (higher skill wins). So, x must be > y.\n\nIn another match, the rule is 0 (lower skill wins), so x must be < z.\n\nThese constraints impose that x must be greater than y and less than z.\n\nBut since y and z are other teams, their skills are also determined by the permutation.\n\nBut the problem is that y and z are other variables, and their constraints are interdependent.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, the constraints can be represented as a set of inequalities between x and other teams, and then we can determine if such a permutation exists.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive, especially since for each x, we have to handle n constraints.\n\nBut perhaps we can model the constraints in a way that allows us to compute the possible range for x.\n\nWait, here's an alternative idea: for each x, the path it takes through the tournament is fixed. Each match along this path has a rule that imposes a condition on x relative to its opponent in that match.\n\nSo, for each match, the opponent is determined by the initial structure, but their skill is variable. So, for x to win all matches, in each match, it must satisfy the condition based on the rule.\n\nThus, for each match in x's path, we can model the required condition as follows:\n\n- If s[i] is '1', x must be > y.\n\n- If s[i] is '0', x must be < y.\n\nBut y is the opponent in that match, which is another team that x must face in the tournament.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, all these conditions must be satisfied.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nPerhaps the solution is to represent the constraints as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where edges represent the required ordering between x and its opponents.\n\nThen, we can check for any cycles or contradictions in the constraints. If there's a cycle, it's impossible for x to be the champion. Otherwise, it's possible.\n\nBut building such a graph for each x might be computationally expensive, especially for large n.\n\nWait, but perhaps the constraints can be represented in terms of intervals, where for each match, x must be in a certain relation to its opponent.\n\nAnother idea: since the permutation is a complete rearrangement, perhaps the constraints can be transformed into a set of inequalities that x must satisfy, regardless of the other variables.\n\nWait, for example, if in a match, x must be greater than y, then in the permutation, x's value must be higher than y's. But since y is another variable, this creates a chain of dependencies.\n\nBut handling all these dependencies for each x seems challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps the key insight is that for each x, the constraints along its path can be represented as a series of inequalities, and the maximum and minimum possible values for x can be computed based on these.\n\nFor example, if in the first match, x must be > y, and in the second match, x must be < z, then x must be between y+1 and z-1.\n\nBut then, for the next matches, similar constraints apply, narrowing down the possible range for x.\n\nIf at any point, the constraints become impossible (e.g., x must be both greater and less than another team), then x cannot be the champion.\n\nOtherwise, if the constraints allow for a feasible range, then x is a winning integer.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nPerhaps for each x, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) along its path, tracking the required constraints and ensuring that they are compatible.\n\nAlternatively, since the path is fixed for each x, perhaps we can model the constraints in a way that allows us to compute the minimal and maximal possible values for x.\n\nWait, let's think of it as a series of constraints:\n\nFor each match in x's path, x must be > y_i if s[i] is 1, or x must be < y_i if s[i] is 0.\n\nEach y_i is another team that x must face in that match.\n\nBut since the permutation is a bijection, each y_i must be a distinct integer not equal to x.\n\nMoreover, all these y_i's are part of the permutation, so their values are determined by the permutation.\n\nBut how can we model this without knowing the permutation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a system where for each match, x must be ordered relative to its opponent in a certain way. The question is whether such an ordering is possible.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother idea: For each x, we can compute the set of required inequalities along its path and see if they can be satisfied.\n\nFor example, if in the path, x must be greater than y1, greater than y2, and less than z1, etc., then the permutation must arrange x, y1, y2, z1, etc., in a way that satisfies all these inequalities.\n\nBut checking this for each x is non-trivial.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the constraints as a partial order and check for consistency.\n\nIf the partial order has any cycles (like x must be greater than y and y must be greater than x), then it's impossible.\n\nOtherwise, it's possible.\n\nBut for each x, the constraints form a DAG, and we need to check for any cycles.\n\nBut for 2^18 teams, this approach may be too slow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent the constraints for x in terms of ranges and intervals, and see if the constraints can be satisfied.\n\nWait, perhaps for each match in x's path, we can compute the minimum and maximum possible values that x must have, based on the constraints.\n\nFor example:\n\n- In a match where x must be > y and the next match requires x < z, then x must be between y+1 and z-1.\n\nBut this depends on the other constraints as well.\n\nSo, perhaps for each x, we can compute the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have, given the constraints.\n\nIf the interval [min_x, max_x] is non-empty, then x can be the champion.\n\nOtherwise, it's not possible.\n\nBut how to compute min_x and max_x.\n\nWait, let's consider that for each match in x's path, the constraint is:\n\n- If s[i] is '1', then x > y_i.\n\n- If s[i] is '0', then x < y_i.\n\nEach y_i is another team that x must face in that match.\n\nBut since the permutation is a bijection, all y_i's are distinct and not equal to x.\n\nThus, for each constraint, we can model the minimal and maximal possible values for x.\n\nBut the problem is that the y_i's are also variables, and their constraints affect each other.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps, for each x, we can perform a BFS or DFS to compute the required ranges.\n\nWait, here's a plan:\n\nFor each x, we'll process the matches along its path in order.\n\nFor each match, we'll determine the required relation to the opponent (y), and update the possible range for x based on that.\n\nBut since the opponents are not known yet, perhaps we can model the possible ranges as intervals.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. For each x from 1 to 2^n:\n\n   a. Compute the path of matches that x must go through to become the champion.\n\n   b. For each match in this path, determine the required relation between x and the opponent (y_i) based on s[i].\n\n   c. For each such relation, x must be > y_i or x < y_i.\n\n   d. Now, the question is whether it's possible to assign values to x",

Each match imposes a constraint on the relative skill levels of the teams involved.\n4. **Range Constraints**: For each team, compute the minimum and maximum possible values it can have while still satisfying all constraints imposed by the rules of the tournament.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    size = 1 << n\n    log_table = [0] * (size + 1)\n    for i in range(2, size + 1):\n        log_table[i] = log_table[i >> 1] + 1\n    \n    # Precompute the path for each team\n    path = [[] for _ in range(size)]\n    for x in range(1, size + 1):\n        x0 = x - 1  # convert to 0-based\n        current = x0\n        for i in range(n):\n            current >>= 1\n            path[x].append((current, i))\n    \n    winning = []\n    \n    for x in range(1, size + 1):\n        current_x = x\n        constraints = {}\n        valid = True\n        min_x = 1\n        max_x = size\n        for (parent, i) in path[x]:\n            phase = i\n            rule = s[phase]\n            if rule == '1':\n                required = '>'\n            else:\n                required = '<'\n            \n            y = parent\n            if y not in constraints:\n                constraints[y] = []\n            if required == '>':\n                if y in constraints:\n                    if not constraints[y]:\n                        constraints[y] = [x]\n                    else:\n                        if x <= constraints[y][0]:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                        new_min = max(min_x, constraints[y][0] + 1)\n                        new_max = min(max_x, size - 1)\n                        if new_min > new_max:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                        min_x = new_min\n                        max_x = new_max\n                        constraints[y].append(x)\n                else:\n                    constraints[y] = [x]\n                    min_x = max(min_x, x + 1)\n                    max_x = min(max_x, size - 1)\n            else:  # required is '<'\n                if y in constraints:\n                    if not constraints[y]:\n                        constraints[y] = [x]\n                    else:\n                        if x >= constraints[y][0]:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                        new_min = max(min_x, 1)\n                        new_max = min(max_x, constraints[y][0] - 1)\n                        if new_min > new_max:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                        min_x = new_min\n                        max_x = new_max\n                        constraints[y].append(x)\n                else:\n                    constraints[y] = [x]\n                    min_x = max(min_x, 1)\n                    max_x = min(max_x, x - 1)\n        \n        if valid and min_x <= x <= max_x:\n            winning.append(x)\n    \n    print(' '.join(map(str, sorted(winning))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is modeled as a binary tree where each node represents a match.
