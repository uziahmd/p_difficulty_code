Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem statement says that Andrew and Eugene are playing a game where they manipulate a string of digits through a series of substitution queries. After processing all the queries, we need to compute the resulting number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nHmm. So the initial string is s, and each query is of the form di → ti. This means that every occurrence of digit di in the current string is replaced by ti. For example, if s is '123123' and the query is \"2→00\", then every '2' becomes '00', making the string '10031003'. Another example is replacing '3' with an empty string, turning '123123' into '1212'.\n\nThe output should be the numeric value of the resulting string after all queries, modulo 1e9+7. Also, leading zeros should be ignored, except when the string is empty, which is treated as zero.\n\nWait, but how do the substitutions work when there are multiple queries? Because each query is applied in order. So the first substitution happens, then the next, etc. So for each step, the substitution is done on the current string.\n\nThe challenge here is to process all these substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be up to 105 characters long, and there can be up to 105 queries. But wait, the sum of the lengths of the ti strings across all queries is also up to 105. So that's manageable.\n\nBut how to model this in code? Doing each substitution step-by-step could be computationally feasible, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the process. Each substitution replaces certain digits with other strings. So, perhaps for each digit, we can keep track of what it's replaced with after all queries have been processed.\n\nWait, but the substitutions are applied in order. So the later queries can override earlier ones for certain digits. Hmm, no. Because each substitution is applied sequentially. So, for example, if the first query is '0→5', and the second is '5→6', then after both queries, any '0' in the original string will become '5' after the first substitution, and then each '5' in that result will become '6' in the second substitution.\n\nSo the order matters. So it's not sufficient to just build a mapping from each digit to its final replacement; because the replacements can depend on the order in which they are applied.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the only way is to process each substitution in order, updating the string each time.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the approach would be:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n2. For each query, in the given order:\n   a. Split the query into di and ti.\n   b. Replace every occurrence of di in the current string with ti.\n3. After all queries, process the resulting string into a number, ignoring leading zeros, except when the string is empty (which is zero).\n4. Compute this number mod 1e9+7.\n\nSo the key steps are processing each substitution step and then handling the final string correctly.\n\nNow, the main issue is efficiently performing the substitution for each query. Since the string can be up to 105 characters, and each substitution could potentially replace each character in the string, this is feasible even for 105 queries.\n\nWait, but for each substitution, for each character in the current string, we check if it's equal to di. If yes, we replace it with ti. Otherwise, we leave it as is.\n\nSo for each query, the substitution could take O(len(current string)) time. Since len(current string) can be up to 105, and n is up to 105, this gives a total of 105*105 = around 11,000 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about how to represent the string during substitutions.\n\nWe can represent the string as a list or a string. Since strings are immutable in Python, using a list might be more efficient for multiple substitutions. Alternatively, each substitution can be done by creating a new string each time.\n\nWait, but for each substitution, the entire string is being processed, and each character is checked. So for a string of length L, each substitution is O(L) time.\n\nSo, for example, for the initial string '123123', the first substitution replaces '2's with '00', making the string longer. Then the next substitution replaces '3's with empty, making the string shorter again.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Start with s as the initial string.\n- For each query in order:\n   - Split the query into di and ti.\n   - Iterate over each character in the current s, and build a new string.\n   - For each character c in s:\n      - if c == di: append ti to the new string.\n      - else: append c to the new string.\n   - Set s to this new string.\n- After all queries, process s to compute the number.\n\nWait, but that's correct. Because each substitution is applied in order, and each character is processed in sequence.\n\nOnce all substitutions are done, the string s is processed into a number. However, leading zeros must be ignored. So, for example, if s is '00012', the numeric value is 12. But if s is '0', it's 0.\n\nWait, no. According to the problem statement: ignore leading zeroes. So, for example, if the string is '000', the number is zero. Similarly, '0123' becomes 123.\n\nSo, the steps to process the string after substitutions are:\n\n- If the string is empty: number is 0.\n- Else: strip leading zeros, then if the result is empty, the number is 0. Otherwise, it's the integer represented by the remaining string.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that leading zeros are not removed when the string is non-empty. Wait, no. Let me read the note again.\n\nIn the note, it says that leading zeros are not removed after the replacement. So for example, in the third sample input, the resulting string is '777', which is treated as 777. But what about if it's '07777'? It would be considered as 7777, but according to the problem statement, leading zeros are ignored. Or wait, the note says that in the third sample, the leading zeros are not removed—no, wait, looking back:\n\nIn the third sample, the input is '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7'. So initial s is '222'.\n\nFirst query: 2→0. So s becomes '000'.\n\nSecond query: 0→7. So each '0' in '000' becomes '7', making s '777'.\n\nThe output is 777, which is correct.\n\nSo the problem statement says that leading zeros should be ignored when you represent the number as a decimal. So in the case of '07777', the leading zero is ignored, and the number is 7777.\n\nSo, after all substitutions, the string s may start with multiple zeros. We need to compute the numeric value of s, treating it as a number without leading zeros.\n\nSo, the steps after substitutions are:\n\n1. If s is empty: the number is 0.\n2. Else:\n   a. Strip leading zeros.\n   b. If the resulting string is empty: number is 0.\n   c. Else: the number is the integer value of the stripped string.\n\nThen, compute this number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nSo, for example:\n\ns = '0000' → stripped is '' → number is 0.\n\ns = '00123' → stripped is '123' → number is 123.\n\ns = '0' → stripped is '' → number is 0.\n\ns = '123' → stripped is '123' → number is 123.\n\nSo, the code needs to handle this correctly.\n\nNow, thinking about the implementation.\n\nIn Python, we can process the string as follows.\n\nAfter processing all substitutions, we get s.\n\nCompute the number as:\n\nif s is empty:\n    num = 0\nelse:\n    stripped = s.lstrip('0')\n    if stripped == '':\n        num = 0\n    else:\n        num = int(stripped)\n\nThen, compute num % MOD, where MOD is 1e9+7.\n\nSo, now the plan is clear.\n\nNow, considering how to implement the substitution.\n\nEach substitution is a loop over each character in the current string. For each character, if it equals di, replace it with ti, else leave it as is.\n\nIn Python, for each substitution, we can create a new string by concatenating the appropriate parts.\n\nSo, the code structure would be something like this:\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    query = input().strip()\n    # parse di and ti\n    # split on \"->\"\n    parts = query.split('->')\n    di = parts[0]\n    ti = parts[1] if len(parts) >1 else ''\n    # replace di in s with ti\n    new_s = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == di:\n            new_s.append(ti)\n        else:\n            new_s.append(c)\n    s = ''.join(new_s)\n\n# Now process s into a number\nif not s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    stripped = s.lstrip('0')\n    if not stripped:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        num = int(stripped)\n        print(num % MOD)\n\nWait, but wait: in the sample input, the first line is ['123123\\n1\\n2->00', ...], which suggests that the input is read as lines, possibly containing newlines. So perhaps the initial s is read correctly.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input is given as a list of strings, each representing a line. So in the sample input, the first line is '123123\\n1\\n2->00'—but perhaps the actual input is three lines: the first line is '123123', the second is '1', the third is '2->00', etc.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the sample input description:\n\nInput is:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWhich probably represents the standard input as four lines, each containing the respective parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The input is read as the first line is the initial string, followed by n lines of queries. So in the sample, the first line is '123123', the second line is '1', which is n=1, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh, perhaps the sample is written in a way that the initial string is the first element of the list, followed by n elements representing the queries.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual input is read via standard input, and the first line is s, the second is n, and then the next n lines are the queries.\n\nSo, perhaps in the sample, the first line is '123123', then the second line is '1', meaning n=1, and the third line is '2->00'—so one query.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So the sample input is:\n\n123123\n\n1\n\n2->00\n\nThen, after processing, the string becomes '10031003', which is the first output.\n\nSo the code should read s as the first line, n as the second line, and then n lines for the queries.\n\nAh, okay. So the code should read s as input(), then n as int(input()), then for _ in range(n): read each query.\n\nSo, the code should be:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nqueries = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nfor query in queries:\n    process each query...\n\nYes.\n\nSo, that's the correct way to read the input.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the possibility of di being a multi-digit character, but according to the problem statement, di is exactly one digit. So, each query has exactly one di and a corresponding ti.\n\nThus, in the code, when splitting, each query is split on \"->\" into two parts: di is the first part (length 1), ti is the second part (could be empty).\n\nSo, the code can safely split on '->' and take the first part as di.\n\nWait, but what if the query is '3->'? Then parts[0] is '3', parts[1] is ''.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['123123', '1', '2->00']\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first line is '123123', n=1, and the query is '2->00'.\n\nProcessing:\n\nInitial s is '123123'.\n\nQuery is '2->00': replace '2's with '00'.\n\nSo the string becomes:\n\nFor each c in '123123':\n\nc is '1' → remains.\n\nc is '2' → replaced with '00'.\n\nc is '3' → remains.\n\nc is '1' → remains.\n\nc is '2' → replaced with '00'.\n\nc is '3' → remains.\n\nSo the new string is '1' + '00' + '3' + '1' + '00' + '3' → '10031003'.\n\nWhich matches the sample's first output.\n\nThen, the second query is '3->', which replaces '3's with empty string.\n\nSo the string is processed again:\n\nEach '3' is replaced with empty string. So '10031003' becomes '1' followed by '00', then '1' followed by '00', and the '3's are gone. So the string is '100100'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, '10031003' is:\n\nLooking at each character:\n\n1 → stays.\n\n0 → stays.\n\n0 → stays.\n\n3 → replaced with nothing.\n\n1 → stays.\n\n0 → stays.\n\n0 → stays.\n\n3 → replaced with nothing.\n\nSo the new string is '1' followed by '00', then '1' followed by '00', and the two '3's are removed. So the new string is '100100'.\n\nWait, but the sample output shows '1212' as the second output.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sample input.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input provided:\n\nThe sample input is:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, perhaps the way the input is structured is as four separate lines, each being a line in the input file.\n\nSo, the first line is '123123', the second is '1', the third is '2->00', the fourth is '123123', the fifth is '1', the sixth is '3->', the seventh is '222', the eighth is '2', the ninth is '2->0', the tenth is '0->7', and the eleventh is '1000000008', the twelfth is '0'.\n\nSo, n is 3, and the three queries are '2->00', '3->', and '2->0\\n0->7'.\n\nWait, no. Because each query is a separate line. So the third line is '2->00', the fourth is '3->', the fifth is '222', which is s, then the sixth is '2', then '2->0', then '0->7', and then another line.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is a bit confusing. Let me look at the problem statement's example.\n\nIn the example, the outputs are:\n\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\nSo, the first query transforms s into '10031003', the second query transforms it into '1212', the third query transforms it into '777', and the fourth query transforms it into '1'.\n\nWait, but the fourth query is '1000000008' with n=0, which is unclear. Or perhaps the fourth line is a query with n=0, which is an empty set of queries.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is not well-formatted. Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the code logic.\n\nAnother point to consider: when di is replaced by ti, which can be empty. So, for example, in the third query in the sample, '2->0' followed by '0->7', the initial string is '222', which becomes '000' after the first substitution. Then, substituting '0' with '7' results in '777'.\n\nNow, considering the code, when processing the substitution, the order is crucial.\n\nAnother test case: if the same digit is substituted multiple times in different queries, the last substitution takes precedence.\n\nFor example, suppose s is '111', and the first query is '1→a', the second is '1→b'. So, after both queries, the string would be 'aaa' → then 'bbb'.\n\nSo, the order of substitution is important.\n\nThus, the code must process each query in the given order, as per the problem statement.\n\nAnother edge case: when the substitution leads to an empty string. For example, s is '3', and the query is '3→'. Then, the string becomes empty. So, the resulting number is zero.\n\nAnother case: when after substitution, the string is empty, but then another substitution adds some characters. But since the substitutions are processed in order, that's handled automatically.\n\nNow, thinking about how to process the substitution in Python.\n\nEach substitution can be implemented by iterating over each character in the current s, and building a new string by appending ti if the character is di, else the character itself.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor each query in queries:\n\n    di, ti = split the query into parts.\n\n    new_s = []\n\n    for c in s:\n\n        if c == di:\n\n            new_s.append(ti)\n\n        else:\n\n            new_s.append(c)\n\n    s = ''.join(new_s)\n\nThis is correct.\n\nSo, the code is manageable.\n\nNow, the only thing left is processing the final string into a number, stripping leading zeros.\n\nSo, after all substitutions, s is the final string.\n\nIf s is empty, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nstripped = s.lstrip('0')\n\nif stripped is empty, output 0.\n\nElse, output the integer value of stripped modulo 1e9+7.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe first line is '123123'\n\nn is 1, and the query is '2->00'.\n\nProcessing:\n\ns becomes '10031003'.\n\nThen, the second query is '3->', but wait, no. Wait, perhaps the sample is a bit more complex.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is as follows:\n\nThe first line is the initial string '123123'.\n\nSecond line is n=1.\n\nThird line is the query '2->00'.\n\nSo, the code processes one query, leading to '10031003'.\n\nWhich is the first output.\n\nBut in the sample output, the second output is '1212'. So perhaps the sample includes more queries.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is part of a larger input. Let me look again.\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nSo, the first line is the initial string '123123', then n=1, then the query '2->00' is processed. The output is '10031003'.\n\nThen, the second line is the initial string '123123' again, with n=1, then the query '3->', which turns '123123' into '1212'.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the initial string is supposed to be modified by previous queries. So perhaps the sample input is incorrect in the way it's presented, but the actual code should process each query in order, regardless of the initial string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample is a collection of test cases, each with their own initial string and queries.\n\nBut that's unlikely. Probably, the sample input is a list of multiple test cases.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is a list of four test cases, each represented by a line.\n\nIn that case, the first test case has:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn=1\n\nquery: '2->00' → output '10031003'\n\nSecond test case:\n\ns='123123'\n\nn=1\n\nquery: '3->' → output '1212'\n\nThird test case:\n\ns='222'\n\nn=2\n\nqueries: '2->0' and '0->7' → output '777'\n\nFourth test case:\n\ns='1000000008'\n\nn=0 → output '1000000008' mod 1e9+7 → which is 1000000008 mod 1e9+7. Since 1e9+7 is 1000000007, 1000000008 mod 1e9+7 is 1.\n\nSo, the outputs are as given.\n\nThus, the code should handle each test case correctly.\n\nSo, in the code, each test case is processed by reading s, then n, then n queries.\n\nThus, in the code, the structure is:\n\nRead s.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n queries.\n\nProcess each query in order.\n\nCompute the final number.\n\nPrint the result.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, considering the constraints.\n\nThe maximum possible length of s after substitutions is unbounded, but the initial s is up to 105 characters, and each substitution can add or remove characters. However, in practice, the maximum length after processing all substitutions is bounded by 105 * 105, since each substitution can replace a single character with up to 105 characters (since the sum of ti lengths is up to 105). So the maximum possible length is manageable.\n\nIn Python, strings can handle this.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nAnother point to consider: the modulo operation. Since the numbers can be very large, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, but to compute the modulo, perhaps it's better to perform the modulo at each step to prevent memory issues. However, given the constraints, the final number is up to (1e5)^105, which is way beyond what can be stored. So, for example, if s becomes 1e5 characters long, each being 9, the number is 1e5^9, which is 1e45, which is way beyond the capacity of standard data types.\n\nWait, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, but computations can become slow for very large numbers. So, to avoid this, perhaps we can compute the number modulo 1e9+7 on-the-fly as we build the string.\n\nThat's a good idea. Because otherwise, when s is large, the final conversion to integer could be slow or even impossible due to memory constraints.\n\nSo, the alternative approach is to compute the number modulo MOD as we build the string, digit by digit.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nWell, the number can be computed as a sum of each digit multiplied by 10^position, but since the string is built step by step, perhaps we can track the current value mod MOD, and for each new digit added, update the value accordingly.\n\nYes.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\nInstead of storing the entire string, which could be very long, we can represent the number as a value mod MOD, and track the current position's power of 10 mod MOD.\n\nWait, but the string may have leading zeros, which are stripped before computing the numeric value. So, perhaps it's better to compute the number mod MOD as the digits are added, but also track whether the number is non-zero yet.\n\nSo, let's think about it.\n\nInitialize a variable, say, result = 0.\n\nAlso, track the current power of 10, which starts as 1. Because the first digit is the most significant.\n\nBut wait, when adding digits from left to right, each new digit is added as (current_result * 10 + new_digit_value) mod MOD.\n\nYes.\n\nBut leading zeros complicate this. Because, for example, '00123' is 123, but if we process it as 0, then 0, then 1, etc., the initial zeros would be added to the result as 0, then 0, then 1, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to track whether any non-zero digit has been encountered yet. Once a non-zero digit is found, we start accumulating the number.\n\nSo:\n\nInitialize:\n\nresult = 0\n\npower_of_10 = 1  # 10^0 =1\n\nleading_zero = True\n\nfor each c in s:\n\n    if leading_zero and c == '0':\n\n        continue  # skip adding to result\n\n    else:\n\n        if leading_zero:\n\n            leading_zero = False\n\n        digit = int(c)\n\n        result = (result * 10 + digit) % MOD\n\n        power_of_10 = (power_of_10 * 10) % MOD\n\nWait, no. Because when leading zeros are present, the result remains zero until the first non-zero digit is found.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model it as:\n\nresult = 0\n\nhas_non_zero = False\n\ncurrent_power = 1\n\nfor c in s:\n\n    if c == '0' and has_non_zero is False:\n\n        continue  # skip\n\n    else:\n\n        if not has_non_zero:\n\n            has_non_zero = True\n\n        digit = int(c)\n\n        result = (result * 10 + digit) % MOD\n\n        current_power = (current_power * 10) % MOD\n\nBut wait, this would process each digit, but the current_power is being tracked, but perhaps it's not needed.\n\nAlternatively, the result can be updated as:\n\nresult = (result * 10 + digit) % MOD\n\nBut for '00123', the first two zeros are skipped, then 1 is added as (0 *10 +1) =1, then 2 becomes 12, 3 becomes 123, etc.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nqueries = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nfor q in queries:\n\n    # process each query as before...\n\n# Now compute the number mod MOD.\n\nresult = 0\n\nhas_non_zero = False\n\nfor c in s:\n\n    if has_non_zero:\n\n        result = (result * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n\n    else:\n\n        if c == '0':\n\n            continue\n\n        else:\n\n            has_non_zero = True\n\n            result = (int(c)) % MOD\n\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because for the case where s is '0000', the code would set has_non_zero to True when it finds the first '0' and continues. Wait, no. Because the condition is: if has_non_zero is False, and c is '0', it skips. So for all '0's, if has_non_zero is False, they are skipped. Once a non-zero is found, has_non_zero is set to True, and the rest are processed.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this logic:\n\nCase 1: s is '0000'\n\nLoop through each c:\n\nc is '0', has_non_zero is False → skip.\n\nSame for all four '0's. result remains 0.\n\nCase 2: s is '00123'\n\nLoop:\n\nc is '0' → skip.\n\nc is '0' → skip.\n\nc is '1' → has_non_zero becomes True, result is 1.\n\nc is '2' → result is 12.\n\nc is '3' → result is 123.\n\nSo the final result is 123.\n\nCase 3: s is '0' → result is 0.\n\nCase 4: s is '123' → result is 123.\n\nCase 5: s is '1000000008' → after processing, stripped is '1000000008' → 1000000008 mod MOD is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: s is '10000000000' → after stripping, it's '10000000000' → which is 10000000000, mod 1e9+7.\n\nWhat's 1e10 mod 1e9+7?\n\nWell, 1e9+7 is 1000000007.\n\n1e10 = 10 * 1e9 = 10 * (1e9+7 -7) = 10*(1e9+7) -70 → mod 1e9+7 is (-70) mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut 1e10 mod 1e9+7 is 1e10 - (1e9+7)*10 → 1e10 - 10e9 -70 = 0 -70 = -70 → mod 1e9+7 is 1e9+7 -70 = 999999937.\n\nWait, but perhaps the code handles this correctly.\n\nSo, the code can be modified to compute the result modulo MOD as we process each character.\n\nThis approach avoids handling very large numbers, which is crucial for the problem's constraints.\n\nThus, in the code, after processing all substitutions, we process each character of s, and compute the result mod MOD on the fly, keeping track of whether we've encountered a non-zero digit yet.\n\nSo, the code becomes:\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nqueries = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nfor q in queries:\n\n    # process each query as before, modifying s...\n\n# Now compute the result.\n\nresult = 0\n\nhas_non_zero = False\n\nfor c in s:\n\n    if has_non_zero:\n\n        result = (result * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n\n    else:\n\n        if c != '0':\n\n            has_non_zero = True\n\n            result = int(c) % MOD\n\n# After processing all characters:\n\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but wait: for c in s, if has_non_zero is True, we multiply result by 10 and add the new digit.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this with s = '1000000008' → the result is 1000000008 mod MOD.\n\nAs 1000000008 = MOD +1 → mod is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: s is '0000' → result is 0.\n\ns is '0' → 0.\n\ns is '000123' → 123.\n\nThus, the code correctly computes the result.\n\nThus, the code should be written as such.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nSo, the complete code is:\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nqueries = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nfor query in queries:\n    # Parse the query\n    parts = query.split('->')\n    di = parts[0]\n    ti = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n    # Process substitution\n    new_s = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == di:\n            new_s.append(ti)\n        else:\n            new_s.append(c)\n    s = ''.join(new_s)\n\n# Compute the result\nresult = 0\nhas_non_zero = False\nfor c in s:\n    if has_non_zero:\n        result = (result * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n    else:\n        if c != '0':\n            has_non_zero = True\n            result = int(c) % MOD\n\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but wait: in the code above, when di is a single digit, but in the code, di is taken as the first part of the split on '->'. So, for example, if the query is '3->', parts is ['3', ''], which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst test case:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn=1\n\nquery: '2->00'\n\nAfter substitution, s is '10031003'.\n\nProcessing each character:\n\n1 → has_non_zero becomes True, result is 1.\n\n0 → result is 10.\n\n0 → 100.\n\n3 → 1003.\n\n1 → 10031.\n\n0 → 100310.\n\n0 → 1003100.\n\n3 → 10031003.\n\nBut wait, the code is processing each character in s, including the ti parts. So for '2' replaced by '00', each '00' in the ti adds two '0's to the string.\n\nThus, the code correctly appends '0's.\n\nWait, but in the substitution, the code appends the ti as a string, so for '2' replaced by '00', each '2' in s becomes '00', which is two '0's. So, the substitution is correctly done.\n\nThus, the code should handle it.\n\nAnother test case: s is '222', n=2, queries are '2->0' and '0->7'.\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst query: '2->0' → each '2' becomes '0' → s becomes '000'.\n\nSecond query: '0->7' → each '0' becomes '7' → s becomes '777'.\n\nProcessing s: '777' → result is 777 mod MOD → 777.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code should work correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on an initial string of digits. Each query specifies replacing a digit with another string, which can be empty. After processing all queries, we compute the numeric value of the resulting string modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: Read the initial string and the number of queries.\n2. **Processing Queries**: For each query, replace every occurrence of the specified digit in the current string with the given substring.\n3. **Modulo Calculation**: Compute the numeric value of the resulting string modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). To handle large numbers efficiently, we process each character of the string on-the-fly, updating the result as we go.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\nqueries = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nfor query in queries:\n    parts = query.split('->')\n    di = parts[0]\n    ti = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n    new_s = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == di:\n            new_s.append(ti)\n        else:\n            new_s.append(c)\n    s = ''.join(new_s)\n\nresult = 0\nhas_non_zero = False\nfor c in s:\n    if has_non_zero:\n        result = (result * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n    else:\n        if c != '0':\n            has_non_zero = True\n            result = int(c) % MOD\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from standard input. Each query is processed in order.\n2. **Processing Queries**: For each query, split it into the digit to replace (`di`) and the replacement string (`ti`). Construct a new string by replacing each occurrence of `di` in the current string with `ti`.\n3. **Modulo Calculation**: After processing all queries, convert the resulting string into a numeric value. To handle large numbers, we compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) on-the-fly. We track whether we have encountered a non-zero digit yet to correctly compute the numeric value, ignoring leading zeros.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle the potentially large size of the resulting string and compute the result without running into memory issues.",
