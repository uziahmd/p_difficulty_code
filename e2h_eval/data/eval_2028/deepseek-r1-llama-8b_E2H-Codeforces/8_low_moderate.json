Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about determining the direction of each edge in a flow network such that the resulting directed graph satisfies certain conditions. Hmm.\n\nAlright, the problem says that for each vertex v (not the source or sink), the sum of incoming edges' flows equals the sum of outgoing edges' flows. Also, the source (vertex 1) shouldn't have any incoming edges, and the graph must be a DAG (no cycles). So the task is to assign a direction to each undirected edge such that all these conditions are met.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Well, I remember that in a flow network, especially when considering maximum flows, the residual graph plays a role. But I'm not exactly sure how that helps here.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this as finding a way to direct each edge such that the flow conservation is satisfied at every intermediate node. Since the given graph is connected and has no two edges between the same pair of vertices, each edge is unique.\n\nLet me think about the structure. Each edge connects two vertices, ai and bi. For each such edge, choosing the direction will affect the balance of flow at both ai and bi.\n\nI recall that in a flow network, the maximum flow can be found using algorithms like Dinic's. But how does that help with the directions?\n\nOh right! Because the given graph is already a flow network (with the maximum flow), each edge's capacity is determined by the maximum possible flow between its endpoints. So, perhaps the directions can be determined based on how the flow was routed in the maximum flow solution.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't give the maximum flow; it just gives the capacities of each edge. So maybe I need to compute the max flow first, then use that to determine the directions.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the maximum flow from the source (vertex 1) to the sink (vertex n).\n2. For each edge, determine whether it was used in the direction from ai to bi or bi to ai in the maximum flow.\n3. Assign the direction accordingly.\n\nBut wait, how does that work? Because some edges might be part of multiple paths in the flow network.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each edge's flow direction is determined by the residual graph. In the residual graph after the max flow, an edge from u to v with capacity c indicates that the original edge was directed u→v with capacity c, contributing to the flow. So maybe we can build the residual graph and then extract the directions from there.\n\nBut building the residual graph might be a bit involved. Let's think about the steps again.\n\nFirst, construct the flow network with the given edges. Then compute the maximum flow from 1 to n. Once the flow is computed, for each original undirected edge, determine if the flow is in one direction or the other.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the given graph is such that a solution exists. So we can proceed.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n- Read the input: n, m, and the list of edges.\n- For each edge, add it to the graph in both directions with capacity ci, since the graph is undirected.\n- Compute the maximum flow from 1 to n. This will give us the flow value, which is the maximum possible flow.\n- Then, for each edge, determine whether it was used in the direction ai→bi or bi→ai during the max flow computation. If the flow is positive in ai→bi direction, then the direction is ai→bi. Otherwise, it's bi→ai.\n\nWait, but how do I determine the direction for each edge in the original undirected edge? Because in the residual graph, each edge is split into two: one in each direction. The presence of a flow in one direction indicates that the original edge was directed that way.\n\nSo for each original edge (ai, bi) with capacity ci, after running the max flow, if the flow from ai to bi is equal to ci, then the edge was used in that direction. Otherwise, it was used in the reverse direction.\n\nWait no. Because the residual capacity may have been used. Hmm, perhaps not exactly. Let me think.\n\nIn the residual graph, an edge from u to v with some residual capacity implies that in the original graph, the edge was directed u→v, and the flow through that edge contributes to the total flow.\n\nSo, for each original edge (u, v) with capacity c, during the max flow, if the flow from u to v is f, then the residual graph will have a forward edge u→v with capacity c - f, and a backward edge v→u with capacity f. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me get this right.\n\nIn the residual graph, for an original edge u-v with capacity c and flow f:\n- The residual edge u→v has capacity c - f.\n- The residual",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the direction of each edge in a flow network such that the resulting directed graph satisfies specific conditions: flow conservation at each intermediate vertex, no incoming edges to the source, and no cycles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Construct the Flow Network**: We start by constructing a flow network where each undirected edge is represented as two directed edges in both directions with their respective capacities.\n2. **Compute Maximum Flow**: Using an efficient algorithm like Dinic's, we compute the maximum flow from the source (vertex 1) to the sink (vertex n). This gives us the maximum possible flow through the network.\n3. **Determine Edge Directions**: For each original undirected edge, we check the residual graph to see if the flow was routed in one direction or the other. If the flow is positive in one direction, that direction is taken; otherwise, the reverse direction is used.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Edge:\n    def __init__(self, to, rev, capacity):\n        self.to = to\n        self.rev = rev\n        self.capacity = capacity\n\nclass Dinic:\n    def __init__(self, n):\n        self.size = n\n        self.graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    def add_edge(self, fr, to, cap):\n        forward = Edge(to, len(self.graph[to]), cap)\n        backward = Edge(fr, len(self.graph[fr]), 0)\n        self.graph[fr].append(forward)\n        self.graph[to].append(backward)\n    \n    def bfs_level(self, s, t, level):\n        q = deque()\n        level[:] = [-1] * self.size\n        level[s] = 0\n        q.append(s)\n        while q:\n            v = q.popleft()\n            for edge in self.graph[v]:\n                if edge.capacity > 0 and level[edge.to] == -1:\n                    level[edge.to] = level[v] + 1\n                    q.append(edge.to)\n                    if edge.to == t:\n                        return\n        return\n    \n    def dfs_flow(self, v, t, flow, level, ptr):\n        if v == t:\n            return flow\n        while ptr[v] < len(self.graph[v]):\n            edge = self.graph[v][ptr[v]]\n            if edge.capacity > 0 and level[v] < level[edge.to]:\n                min_flow = min(flow, edge.capacity)\n                result = self.dfs_flow(edge.to, t, min_flow, level, ptr)\n                if result > 0:\n                    edge.capacity -= result\n                    self.graph[edge.to][edge.rev].capacity += result\n                    return result\n            ptr[v] += 1\n        return 0\n    \n    def max_flow(self, s, t):\n        flow = 0\n        level = [-1] * self.size\n        while True:\n            self.bfs_level(s, t, level)\n            if level[t] == -1:\n                return flow\n            ptr = [0] * self.size\n            while True:\n                f = self.dfs_flow(s, t, float('inf'), level, ptr)\n                if f == 0:\n                    break\n                flow += f\n            level = [-1] * self.size\n        return flow\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx +=1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx +=1\n    edges = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        a = int(input[idx])-1 # zero-based\n        idx +=1\n        b = int(input[idx])-1\n        idx +=1\n        c = int(input[idx])\n        idx +=1\n        edges.append( (a, b, c) )\n    \n    # Create the Dinic's graph\n    dinic = Dinic(n)\n    for a, b, c in edges:\n        dinic.add_edge(a, b, c)\n    \n    maxf = dinic.max_flow(0, n-1)\n    \n    # Now, for each edge, determine the direction\n    for a, b, c in edges:\n        # Check if the original edge was used in a->b direction\n        # We need to find if the flow from a to b is c (i.e., all the flow went through a->b)\n        # So, in the residual graph, after BFS and DFS, the forward edge has capacity c\n        # But since the Dinic's graph may have multiple flows, perhaps we can't directly check.\n        # Alternative approach: use BFS to find augmenting paths and see how the flow was routed.\n        # But that might be complicated.
