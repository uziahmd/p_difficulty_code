    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Rudolf and Snowflakes, hard version. Hmm.\n\nFrom the description, a snowflake is an undirected graph built in a specific way. The initial step is one vertex. Then, each of the k new vertices is connected to the initial one. Then, each vertex that has only one edge (so, degree 1) gets connected to k new vertices, and this step must be done at least once.\n\nWait, so the structure is like a central node connected to k nodes, and then each of those k nodes in turn branches out into their own k nodes, and so on for each level.\n\nSo the task is, given n, determine whether there exists some k>1 such that a snowflake with exactly n vertices can exist.\n\nHmm. So for each test case, we have to check if n can be written as 1 + k * m, where m is the number of nodes in the next layer, but considering that each step adds more layers.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the total number of nodes as a function of the number of steps and k.\n\nLet me think about how the snowflake grows. The initial node is step 0. Then, step 1 adds k nodes connected to it. Step 2 adds k^2 nodes, because each of those k nodes from step 1 adds k children. But wait, no—because in step 2, each of the nodes from step 1 (which are leaves) will add k new nodes. So after step s, the number of nodes added is k^s.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The process starts with step 0: 1 node.\n\nThen, step 1: connect initial node to k nodes → total nodes = 1 + k.\n\nStep 2: each of the k nodes adds k new nodes → total nodes added in step 2: k * k =k². So total is 1 + k + k².\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the step where each node (with degree 1) adds k new nodes must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we do step 1 and step 2.\n\nWait, no. The initial step is the initial node. Then step 1 is adding the first k nodes. Then, step 2 is adding another layer by connecting each of those k nodes to k new nodes. So the minimal snowflake has 1 + k + k² nodes.\n\nBut perhaps the process can stop after any number of steps, but the step 2 must be done at least once. So the minimal is 1 + k + k².\n\nWait, but the problem says that the step should be done at least once. So the process must include at least one expansion beyond the initial step.\n\nSo for a snowflake, the number of vertices n must satisfy n = 1 + k*(m), where m is the sum of all the layers beyond the initial.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the number of nodes as a geometric series.\n\nWait, the structure is a tree. The root has k children. Each of those children has k children, except for the root. Wait, no. Because the root is connected to k nodes, each of which is a leaf. Then, each of those leaves must have their own k children. So the tree has depth at least 2.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k² + ... + k^d, where d is the depth. But wait, no. Because each step adds a layer. So for example, the minimal snowflake is depth 2: 1 (root) + k (first layer) + k² (second layer). So the sum is 1 + k + k².\n\nWait, but that's the case when you perform the step once (step 2). But the problem says the step should be done at least once. So the minimal is 1 + k + k².\n\nBut what if you perform the step multiple times? Like, for step 3, each of the second layer nodes adds k children. So the third layer is k³ nodes. So the total becomes 1 + k + k² + k³.\n\nWait, but wait: no, because the initial step is step 1, which adds k nodes. Then step 2 adds k², step 3 adds k³, etc. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k² + ... + k^m, where m is the number of steps performed beyond the initial. But the minimal requires m ≥1, because the step must be done at least once.\n\nSo for the snowflake, the number of nodes is 1 + k*(1 + k + k² + ... +k^{m-1}), where m ≥1. Because after the initial, each step adds a layer.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nEach time we perform a step, the number of nodes added is multiplied by k.\n\nFor example, initial: 1 node.\n\nAfter step 1: 1 + k.\n\nAfter step 2: 1 + k + k².\n\nAfter step 3: 1 + k + k² +k³.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is the sum of a geometric series: S = 1 + k*(1 + k + k² + ... +k^{m-1} ), where m is the number of steps performed. But since the step must be done at least once, m must be ≥1.\n\nWait, but the initial step is adding k nodes, which is the first step. Then step 2 is adding k², etc.\n\nSo for m steps beyond the initial node, the sum is 1 + k + k² + ... + k^m.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial node is 1. Then, each step adds a layer. So after m steps, the total is 1 + k*(1 + k + ... +k^{m-1}).\n\nBecause the first step adds k nodes, which are the first layer. The second step adds k² nodes, which are the second layer. And so on.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + k*( (k^m - 1)/(k-1) ) ), assuming m is the number of steps beyond the initial. Wait, no, because the sum is 1 + k + k² + ... +k^m. Because each step adds a new layer.\n\nSo n must equal 1 + k + k² + ... +k^m, where m ≥1.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the step where each node (leaf) adds k new nodes must be done at least once. So the minimal m is 1, which gives n=1 +k +k²?\n\nNo, wait. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe initial step is 1 node. Then, the initial node is connected to k new nodes. That's step 1. Then, each vertex that is connected by only one edge (the ones added in step 1) must add k new nodes. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the initial node is connected to k nodes (step 1). Then, step 2 is done: each of those k nodes adds k new nodes, making the second layer k² nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo yes, the minimal n is 1 +k +k², which corresponds to m=2 steps (since step 1 is the initial adding, step 2 is the expansion). Or perhaps m is the number of steps beyond the initial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m is the number of layers beyond the root. So the root is layer 0, its children are layer 1, their children layer 2, etc. So for m layers beyond the root, the sum is 1 + k + k² + ... +k^m.\n\nSo n must be equal to 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m≥1.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be expressed as 1 +k*( (k^m -1)/(k-1) ), where k>1 and m≥1.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum 1 +k +k² + ...+k^m is equal to (k^{m+1}-1)/(k-1). So n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), for some k>1 and m≥1.\n\nSo our task is, for a given n, to determine if there exists integers k>1 and m≥1 such that n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo the approach is to factor n-1 and see if it can be represented as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) for some k>1 and m≥1.\n\nAlternatively, for n to be a valid, n must be of the form (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) for some k>1 and m≥1.\n\nSo the question becomes: does n-1 +1 =n can be written as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nHmm. So how can we compute this for large n up to 1e18?\n\nWe need an efficient way to check for each possible n whether it's expressible in that form.\n\nLet me think about the possible values of k and m.\n\nFirst, note that for fixed k, the sum (k^{m+1}-1)/(k-1) increases rapidly as m increases.\n\nSo for a given n, we can try all possible k up to sqrt(n), perhaps, and for each k, check whether n-1 is divisible by k-1, and then compute whether (n-1)/(k-1) +1 equals k^{m+1} for some m≥1.\n\nWait, but that might not be feasible for large n. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible k, find if (n-1) is divisible by (k-1), and then see if the quotient plus 1 is a perfect power of k.\n\nWait, let me formalize this:\n\nGiven n, check if there exists k>1 and m≥1 such that:\n\nn = 1 + k*(1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m-1}) )\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nn = 1 + k*( (k^m -1)/(k-1) )\n\nSo n-1 = k*( (k^m -1)/(k-1) )\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(k^(m+1) -1)/(k-1) = n\n\nWait, no. Let me compute:\n\n1 + k*(sum_{i=0}^{m-1} k^i ) = 1 + k*( (k^m -1)/(k-1) )\n\nYes.\n\nSo n-1 = k*( (k^m -1)/(k-1) )\n\nBut (k^m -1)/(k-1) is the sum 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m-1}.\n\nSo n-1 = k * sum_part.\n\nWhere sum_part = (k^m -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo for a given k, sum_part must be (n-1)/k, and sum_part must be an integer.\n\nOnce we have sum_part, we need to check whether sum_part = (k^m -1)/(k-1) for some m≥1.\n\nSo for each possible k, compute s = (n-1)/k. If s is not integer, skip this k. Else, check if s is a sum of the form (k^m -1)/(k-1) for m≥1.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case, n:\n\n1. Check if n is 1: then no, because k>1 is needed.\n\n2. Else, for each possible k from 2 up to sqrt(n), compute s = (n-1)/k. If s is not integer, continue.\n\n3. For each k where s is integer, check if s = (k^m -1)/(k-1) for some m≥1.\n\nIf any such k exists, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, iterating through all possible k up to sqrt(n) is not feasible, as 1e9 would be too slow.\n\nThus, we need a more efficient approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Precompute all possible forms of n, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea is to consider that for m≥1, the sum s = (k^m -1)/(k-1) is the sum of a geometric series. So for fixed s and k, m can be determined as the smallest integer such that s >= (k^m -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut again, for large n, enumerating all k is impractical.\n\nWait, but for a given n, how many possible k's can we have? Since k must be a divisor of (n-1), and also, k must be greater than 1.\n\nSo for each n, the possible k's are the divisors of (n-1) that are greater than 1. So the steps could be:\n\nFor a given n:\n\n- Compute m = n-1.\n\n- Find all divisors of m that are greater than 1.\n\n- For each such divisor k, compute s = m /k.\n\n- Now, check if s is equal to (k^m' -1)/(k-1) for some m' ≥1.\n\nWait, but for each k, s must be an integer, and s must be equal to the sum of a geometric series of the form (k^m'-1)/(k-1).\n\nSo for each k dividing m, compute s = m/k.\n\nThen, check whether s can be written as (k^m' -1)/(k-1) for some m'>=1.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each pair (k, s), where k is a divisor of m and k>1, check if s is a sum of the form (k^m' -1)/(k-1).\n\nHow to check that quickly?\n\nWell, for a given k and s, the equation is:\n\ns = (k^m' -1)/(k-1)\n\nMultiply both sides by (k-1):\n\ns*(k-1) +1 = k^m'\n\nSo, for a given k and s, compute lhs = s*(k-1) + 1.\n\nWe need to check if this value is a perfect power of k.\n\nMoreover, the exponent m' must be ≥1.\n\nSo for each (k, s), compute lhs and see if it's a perfect power of k.\n\nBut for large k and s, computing this directly might be difficult.\n\nWait, but how big can m' be? Let's see.\n\nFor example, if k=2, then s can be 1 (m'=1), 3 (m'=2, 2²-1=3), 7 (m'=3, 2^3-1=7), etc.\n\nSo for each k, the maximum possible m' is log_k(lhs), which is manageable.\n\nBut for each (k, s), we can compute lhs and then check if it's a power of k.\n\nHow to do that efficiently?\n\nWe can compute the logarithm base k of lhs and see if it's an integer.\n\nBut for very large numbers, even that might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, for each (k, s), compute lhs and then check if it's a perfect power.\n\nBut for very large lhs, this can be computationally expensive unless we have a smart way.\n\nWait, but for a given k, the exponents m' can be up to log_k(lhs). So for small k, m' can be larger, but for larger k, m' is smaller.\n\nSo perhaps, for each (k, s), we can compute lhs, then try to compute the integer m' such that k^m' = lhs. We can do this by binary search.\n\nWait, but for each (k, s), the maximum possible m' is log_k(s*(k-1)+1). So for each (k, s), the binary search would run in O(log m') time, which is acceptable.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor a given n:\n\n- If n < 3: return NO (since the minimal n is 1 + 2 + 4 =7?)\n\nWait, wait, no. Let's think again.\n\nWait, for k=2, m=2: n=1 +2 +4=7.\n\nWait, but wait earlier steps: for k=2, minimal is 1+2+4=7.\n\nWait, but what about k=3? Minimal is 1+3+9=13.\n\nSo for n=7, it's possible.\n\nWait, in the sample input, n=6 returns NO, but n=7 is not in the sample. Oh, wait the sample input is:\n\nSample Input:\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\nSample Output:\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nWait, for n=6, the output is 'YES'? No, looking back: the fifth entry is 6, which outputs 'YES'? Wait, no, the sample output shows the fifth output as 'YES'.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\nInput lines are 9,1,2,3,6,13,15,255,10101, 1e18.\n\nThe sample outputs are:\n\nNO, NO, NO, NO, YES, YES, YES, YES, NO.\n\nSo n=6 returns YES. How?\n\nWait, what's the structure for n=6.\n\nLooking back, for n=6: n-1=5.\n\nWe need to find k>1 such that 5 is divisible by k.\n\nPossible k's are 5 and possibly others.\n\nCheck k=5: s=5/5=1.\n\nNow, s=1: check if 1 = (5^m' -1)/(5-1) → 1 = (5^m' -1)/4 → 5^m' -1 =4 → 5^m' =5 → m'=1.\n\nSo yes. So n=6 can be formed as 1 +5 +5^2=1+5+25=31? Wait, no. Wait wait, no. Because for k=5 and m'=1, s=(5^1 -1)/(5-1)= (4)/4=1. So n=1 +5*1=6.\n\nYes, so the snowflake is root (1) connected to 5 nodes (step 1). Then step 2 is done once: each of those 5 nodes adds 5 new nodes. Wait, but wait, m' is the exponent for the sum s, which is 1. So s is 1, meaning that the sum is (k^m' -1)/(k-1) =1.\n\nWhich happens when m' is 1: (5^1 -1)/4=1.\n\nSo the snowflake has 1 +5*1=6 nodes. So yes, it's valid.\n\nAh, right. So for n=6, k=5 and m'=1.\n\nSo the code needs to handle cases where the sum s is 1.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each n:\n\n1. If n ==1: return NO.\n\n2. Compute m = n-1.\n\n3. Find all the divisors of m that are greater than 1. These are the possible k's.\n\n4. For each k in these divisors:\n\n   a. Compute s = m /k.\n\n   b. Compute lhs = s*(k-1) +1.\n\n   c. Check if lhs is a perfect power of k, i.e., exists m' ≥1 such that k^m' = lhs.\n\n   d. If yes, then return YES.\n\n5. After checking all k's, if none work, return NO.\n\nSo now the steps are to find all the divisors of m=n-1, which is up to 1e18.\n\nWait, but for n up to 1e18, m can be up to 1e18-1. Finding all the divisors of such a large number is not feasible via trial division, as it's O(sqrt(m)).\n\nBut for t=1e4 test cases, each with m up to 1e18, this approach may be too slow.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.\n\nAlternative Idea: Instead of enumerating all divisors, perhaps we can find the possible k's by considering that for each k, m must be divisible by k, so k must be a divisor of m.\n\nBut for very large m, enumerating all the divisors is impossible.\n\nSo perhaps, instead, we can iterate over possible k's in a limited range, say up to 1e6, and for each k, check if m is divisible by k, and if so, proceed.\n\nBut what's the maximum possible k we need to check?\n\nWell, for a given m, the maximum possible k is m itself. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, note that for a given k, the sum s = (k^m' -1)/(k-1). As k increases, the maximum possible m' decreases.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: The sum s must be at least 1, which is achieved when m'=1.\n\nSo for each k, the minimal s is 1. So for each k, s can be as small as 1.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that helps.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think about the possible values of k.\n\nWe can note that for k>sqrt(m), m/k < sqrt(m). So for each k > sqrt(m), s = m/k < sqrt(m), which is small. So for k larger than sqrt(m), s is small.\n\nBut for each possible s, the possible k's are factors of m.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible s, which is up to sqrt(m), we can find if s is a divisor of m, and then find k= m/s.\n\nBut then, for each s in [1, sqrt(m)], we can check if s divides m, and then k = m/s.\n\nBut since s can be up to 1e9, for each test case, this would be O(1e9) which is way too slow.\n\nHmm, this seems challenging.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's consider that for a given k, the sum s can be computed as (k^m' -1)/(k-1). So for each possible k, we can compute s for varying m' and see if it equals m/k.\n\nBut again, for large k and m, this is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each possible k, we can compute the maximum possible m' such that k^m' ≤ s*(k-1)+1. So for each k, s is known, and thus we can compute m' via binary search.\n\nBut again, for each k, the binary search would take O(log s) time.\n\nBut how do we get the list of possible k's?\n\nWait, perhaps instead of finding all the divisors of m, we can iterate k up to a certain limit, say 1e6, and for each k, check if it divides m. If it does, proceed.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, m can be up to 1e18-1. So the square root of m is up to 1e9, which is too large to iterate for each test case.\n\nBut perhaps, for each test case, we can iterate k up to 1e6, and see if any of them works.\n\nWait, but 1e6 iterations per test case for 1e4 test cases would result in 1e10 operations, which is way too much.\n\nHmm, that's not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps precompute all possible k's that could possibly generate n up to 1e18, but that's impossible since k can be up to 1e9.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps find that for a given m, the possible k's are limited. For example, k must be a divisor of m, but perhaps for each test case, we can find the prime factors of m, and then generate all possible divisors from the prime factors.\n\nBut for m up to 1e18, factoring is time-consuming.\n\nSo perhaps, for each test case, we can factorize m, and then generate all possible divisors from the factors.\n\nBut factorizing a number up to 1e18 is feasible using Pollard's Rho algorithm, especially since t is 1e4.\n\nOnce we have the factors, we can generate all possible divisors, and for each divisor k>1, check if s=m/k is valid.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each n:\n\n1. If n <=3: output NO.\n\nWait, for n=6, it's YES. So n can be as low as 6.\n\nWait, what's the minimal possible n?\n\nAs discussed earlier, for k=2, m=1: n=1+2+4=7.\n\nBut for k=5, m=1: n=6.\n\nSo the minimal n is 6.\n\nSo for n less than 6, output is NO.\n\nWait, n=6 is allowed.\n\nSo for n <6: output NO.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute m = n-1.\n\nFactorize m into its prime factors.\n\nGenerate all the divisors of m.\n\nFor each divisor k>1:\n\n   a. Compute s = m /k.\n\n   b. Compute lhs = s*(k-1) +1.\n\n   c. Check if lhs is a perfect power of k.\n\nIf any (k, s) satisfies this, output YES.\n\nElse, after all k's, output NO.\n\nSo the crux is factorizing m, generating all its divisors, and for each divisor k, perform steps b and c.\n\nNow, the key is to implement this efficiently.\n\nImplementing Pollard's Rho algorithm for factorization is necessary, as trial division would be too slow for large m.\n\nOnce we have the factors, generating all divisors can be done recursively.\n\nBut for very large m, the number of divisors can be huge. For example, m=1e18 could have a lot of divisors if it's highly composite.\n\nWait, but in practice, for m up to 1e18, the number of divisors is manageable, especially since for each test case, we can process them.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nImplement a factorization function that uses Pollard's Rho.\n\nOnce factors are found, generate all the divisors.\n\nFor each divisor k>1:\n\n   compute s = m/k.\n\n   compute lhs = s*(k-1)+1.\n\n   check if lhs is a perfect power of k.\n\nSo, how to implement the check for whether lhs is a perfect power of k.\n\nWe can compute the logarithm base k of lhs and see if it's an integer.\n\nBut for very large numbers, we need to avoid floating point inaccuracies.\n\nAn alternative is to use binary search to find m' such that k^m' = lhs.\n\nWe can do this by:\n\n- Initialize low=1, high= some upper bound (like 60 for k up to 1e9, since 2^60 is about 1e18).\n\n- While low <= high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) //2.\n\n   Compute k^mid.\n\n   Compare with lhs.\n\n   If k^mid == lhs: return True.\n\n   elif k^mid < lhs: low = mid +1.\n\n   else: high = mid -1.\n\nBut computing k^mid for mid up to 60 is manageable, as 1e9^60 is way beyond 64-bit integers, but Python can handle big integers.\n\nWait, but for very large k, like 1e9, and mid=60, k^mid is 1e540, which is a very large number. Comparing it with lhs (which can be up to 1e18*1e9=1e27) is not feasible.\n\nSo we need a way to compute whether k^m' equals lhs without actually computing k^m', which can be too large.\n\nAlternative Idea: Use exponentiation by squaring, and during the process, if the current value exceeds lhs, break early.\n\nYes, that's possible.\n\nImplement a function is_power(k, target):\n\n   if k ==1:\n\n      return False (since m' must be ≥1, but k=1 would give 1^m'=1, which is handled elsewhere).\n\n   if target ==1:\n\n      return True.\n\n   res =1.\n\n   while True:\n\n      res *=k\n\n      if res > target:\n\n          return False\n\n      if res == target:\n\n          return True\n\n      if res < target:\n\n          continue\n\n      # Check if we can proceed further.\n\n      # But if res is already larger than target, return False.\n\nBut wait, this won't work correctly because it stops as soon as res exceeds target, but perhaps a higher exponent could reach target.\n\nWait, no. Because for exponents larger than log_k(target), k^m' will be larger than target. So once res exceeds target, we can safely return False.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, k=2, target=8.\n\nInitially res=1.\n\nres *=2 →2 → less than 8.\n\nres *=2 →4 → less than 8.\n\nres *=2 →8 → equals target → return True.\n\nSo the function would correctly return True.\n\nAnother example: k=3, target=81.\n\nres starts at 1.\n\nMultiply by 3 →3.\n\nAgain →9.\n\nAgain →27.\n\nAgain →81 → return True.\n\nAnother example: k=2, target=16.\n\nres=1→2→4→8→16 → return True.\n\nWhat about k=3, target=28.\n\nres=1→3→9→27 → now 27 <28.\n\nMultiply by 3 →81 >28 → return False.\n\nSo function correctly returns False.\n\nSo the function can be implemented as:\n\ndef is_power(k, target):\n\n    if k == 1:\n\n        return False  # because 1^m' is always 1, but target must be >=1.\n\n    if target ==0:\n\n        return False\n\n    if target ==1:\n\n        return True\n\n    res =1\n\n    while True:\n\n        res *=k\n\n        if res == target:\n\n            return True\n\n        elif res > target:\n\n            return False\n\n        # Continue looping.\n\nBut wait, in cases where target is 0, but since our problem only considers k>1 and m>=1, which makes s >=1, and then lhs = s*(k-1)+1 >= (1)*(k-1)+1 =k, which for k>1 is >=2. So target is always >=2.\n\nSo the function can be optimized.\n\nWait, but what about when k=2 and target=2: res=1 → multiply by 2 →2 → return True.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: k=5, target=5 → res=1 →5 → return True.\n\nBut in our problem, the minimal case is when m' is 1, which gives target=k^1 =k.\n\nSo for s=1, the target is k.\n\nThus, the function correctly returns True.\n\nSo the function is correct.\n\nBut the problem is that for very large k and m', computing k^m' could be computationally expensive.\n\nBut in Python, big integers are handled well, so perhaps it's manageable.\n\nWait, but for k=1e9 and m'=2, k^m' is 1e18, which is manageable.\n\nBut for m'=60, it's 1e540, which is a very big number. Comparing it with target (up to 1e18) is not feasible, as the multiplication would take a lot of time.\n\nSo we need an efficient way to check whether k^m' equals target without computing k^m' directly.\n\nAn alternative approach is to use logarithms.\n\nCompute log(k) * m' and see if it's equal to log(target).\n\nBut due to floating point precision issues, this can be error-prone.\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nBut in code, implementing this could be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the logarithm and check if it's an integer, within a certain precision.\n\nBut this can be risky due to floating point inaccuracies.\n\nAnother Idea: Use binary search with exponentiation.\n\nCompute the maximum possible exponent m_max such that k^m_max <= target.\n\nWe can compute m_max via binary search.\n\nBut for large k and target, even this can be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, for each k, compute the maximum possible m' such that k^m' <= target. Then check if k^m' equals target.\n\nBut again, for very large exponents, this can be slow.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut perhaps, in practice, the number of divisors for m is manageable, and the binary search for each k is not too bad.\n\nSo let's outline the steps in code:\n\nImplement a function to factorize m into its prime factors.\n\nImplement a function to generate all the divisors from the prime factors.\n\nFor each test case:\n\n   Read n.\n\n   if n <6: output NO.\n\n   else:\n\n       m =n-1.\n\n       if m==0: output NO.\n\n       factors = factorize(m)\n\n       divisors = generate_divisors(factors)\n\n       for k in divisors:\n\n           if k ==1:\n\n               continue\n\n           if m %k !=0:\n\n               continue\n\n           s = m //k\n\n           target = s*(k-1) +1\n\n           if is_power(k, target):\n\n               print(\"YES\")\n\n               break\n\n       else:\n\n           print(\"NO\")\n\nBut the key is to implement the factorization, divisor generation, and the is_power functions.\n\nSo, now, the code.\n\nBut first, the factorization function.\n\nImplement Pollard's Rho algorithm for factorization.\n\nI remember that Pollard's Rho is a probabilistic algorithm for integer factorization.\n\nSo I'll need to write a function that returns the prime factors of a number.\n\nOnce we have the factors, we can generate all the divisors.\n\nSo, the code outline:\n\nImplement Pollard's Rho.\n\nImplement a function to find all the prime factors.\n\nOnce factors are found, collect the exponents.\n\nGenerate all the divisors by taking all combinations of exponents.\n\nThen, for each divisor k>1, compute s=m/k.\n\nCompute target = s*(k-1)+1.\n\nCheck if target is a perfect power of k.\n\nIf any of them returns true, output YES.\n\nElse, output NO.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement all these steps correctly.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['NO','NO','NO','NO','YES','YES','YES','YES','NO']\n\nLet's take n=6: m=5.\n\nFactors of 5: 5.\n\nDivisors: 1,5.\n\nFor k=5:\n\ns=5/5=1.\n\ntarget=1*(5-1)+1=5.\n\nCheck if 5 is a power of 5: yes, 5^1=5.\n\nSo YES.\n\nAnother sample: n=13.\n\nm=12.\n\nFactors of 12: 2^2,3^1.\n\nDivisors: 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nFor each divisor k>1:\n\nk=2:\n\ns=12/2=6.\n\ntarget=6*(2-1)+1=7.\n\nCheck if 7 is a power of 2: 2^3=8>7 → no.\n\nk=3:\n\ns=4.\n\ntarget=4*(3-1)+1= 4*2+1=9.\n\nCheck if 9 is a power of 3: yes, 3^2=9 → yes.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with exactly `n` vertices can exist. A snowflake graph is defined as an undirected graph constructed by repeatedly adding layers of `k` new vertices connected to each existing leaf node, starting from a single initial vertex.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The snowflake graph grows in layers where each layer adds `k` new vertices. The number of vertices in the snowflake graph after `m` layers is given by the sum of a geometric series. Specifically, the total number of vertices `n` can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n   \\]\n   where `k > 1` and `m >= 1`.\n\n2. **Mathematical Insight**: The sum of the geometric series can be written as:\n   \\[\n   n = 1 + k \\frac{k^m - 1}{k - 1}\n   \\]\n   Rearranging, we get:\n   \\[\n   n - 1 = k \\frac{k^m - 1}{k - 1}\n   \\]\n   This means for a given `n`, we need to check if there exists integers `k > 1` and `m >= 1` such that the above equation holds.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each test case, compute `m = n - 1`.\n   - Factorize `m` to find all possible divisors `k`.\n   - For each divisor `k`, check if `m / k` (denoted as `s`) can be expressed as a geometric series sum of the form `(k^m' - 1) / (k - 1)` for some `m' >= 1`.\n\n4. **Efficiency Considerations**: Using Pollard's Rho algorithm for factorization allows us to handle large values efficiently. We then generate all divisors from the prime factors and check each potential `k` to see if it fits the required form.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport random\nfrom math import gcd\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            return n == p\n    d = n - 1\n    s = 0\n    while d % 2 == 0:\n        d //= 2\n        s += 1\n    for a in [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]:\n        if a >= n:\n            continue\n        x = pow(a, d, n)\n        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:\n            continue\n        for _ in range(s - 1):\n            x = pow(x, 2, n)\n            if x == n - 1:\n                break\n        else:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef pollards_rho(n):\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return 2\n    if n % 3 == 0:\n        return 3\n    if n % 5 == 0:\n        return 5\n    while True:\n        c = random.randint(1, n-1)\n        f = lambda x: (pow(x,2,n) + c) % n\n        x, y, d = 2, 2, 1\n        while d == 1:\n            x = f(x)\n            y = f(f(y))\n            d = gcd(abs(x - y), n)\n        if d != n:\n            return d\n\ndef factor(n):\n    factors = []\n    def _factor(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return\n        if is_prime(n):\n            factors.append(n)\n            return\n        d = pollards_rho(n)\n        _factor(d)\n        _factor(n // d)\n    _factor(n)\n    return factors\n\ndef generate_divisors(factors):\n    factor_counts = {}\n    for p in factors:\n        if p in factor_counts:\n            factor_counts[p] +=1\n        else:\n            factor_counts[p] =1\n    divisors = [1]\n    for p, cnt in factor_counts.items():\n        temp = []\n        for d in divisors:\n            current = d\n            for i in range(1, cnt+1):\n                current *= p\n                temp.append(current)\n        divisors += temp\n    return list(set(divisors))\n\ndef is_power(k, target):\n    if k == 1:\n        return False\n    if target == 1:\n        return True\n    res = 1\n    while True:\n        res *= k\n        if res == target:\n            return True\n        elif res > target:\n            return False\n\ndef solve():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if n <6:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        m = n -1\n        if m ==0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        factors = factor(m)\n        divisors = generate_divisors(factors)\n        found = False\n        for k in divisors:\n            if k ==1:\n                continue\n            if m %k !=0:\n                continue\n            s = m //k\n            target = s * (k-1) +1\n            if is_power(k, target):\n                found = True\n                break\n        print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prime Check and Factorization**: The `is_prime` function uses probabilistic checks to determine if a number is prime.
