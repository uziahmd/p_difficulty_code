    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles that satisfy certain conditions based on given integers A, B, C, D.\n\nHmm, let me read the problem statement carefully again. Oh right, the triangle has sides x, y, z where A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle must be non-degenerate, meaning x + y > z. Because for a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since z is the largest here, checking x + y > z is sufficient.\n\nSo the task is to find all possible triplets (x, y, z) that meet these conditions and satisfy x + y > z.\n\nFirst, let's think about the constraints. A, B, C, D can be up to 5e5, which is 500,000. So any solution with O(N^3) time complexity is definitely out of the question. We need an efficient approach.\n\nLet me break down the problem. Since x is between A and B, y is between B and C, and z is between C and D. Also, x ≤ y ≤ z because of the ordering. Wait, no: the problem says x can be up to B, y starts at B and goes up to C, but wait, in the condition it's A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Oh right, so x can be as high as B, and y is at least B and at most C, and z is at least C and at most D. So y can't be less than x because x can't exceed B and y starts at B. So y is >= x.\n\nWait, no. For example, if x is B, y can be B or higher. So y is always >= x. Similarly, z is >= y because y <= C <= z. So in all cases, z >= y >= x.\n\nSo for each possible x, y, z triplet in their respective ranges, we need to check if x + y > z.\n\nBut considering the ranges, perhaps there's a smarter way to compute the total without iterating through all possibilities.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Maybe for each possible y and z, determine how many x's are valid. Or maybe for each z, find the range of y's such that y >= B, y <= C, and for each such y, find the x's that satisfy x ≤ y, x >= A, and x > z - y. Because x has to be at least A, but also x must be > z - y to satisfy x + y > z.\n\nWait, but x also must be <= B. So for each y and z, x can range from max(A, z - y + 1) to min(B, y). But wait, wait: since x must be <= y (because y >= B and x is up to B, but y is >= x?), no, wait: x is up to B, y is at least B. So y can be equal to B, same as x's upper bound. So for a given y, x can vary from A to min(B, y), but also x must be > z - y.\n\nHmm, but this might not be straightforward. Let's reorganize:\n\nThe condition for x is:\nx > z - y\nx >= A\nx <= B\nx <= y (since x <= B <= y)\n\nSo combining these, x must satisfy:\nmax(A, z - y + 1) ≤ x ≤ min(B, y)\n\nAnd x must also be ≥ A.\n\nSo for a given y and z, the number of x's is the number of integers in the interval [lower, upper], where lower = max(A, z - y + 1), upper = min(B, y).\n\nIf lower > upper, then there are zero x's for this y and z.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop over all possible z from C to D.\nFor each z, loop over all possible y from B to C, but y must be >= B and <= C.\nWait, but y can't be more than C. Also, since z >= y, because z starts at C and y is up to C, so z is always >= y.\n\nWait, no. Wait, z is from C to D. y is from B to C. So for a particular z, y can be from B to min(C, z). Because y can't exceed z, since z is the largest side.\n\nWait, no. Because z can be larger than C. For example, if C is 3 and D is 4, z can be 3 or 4. Then y can be up to 3. So for z=4, y can be up to 3, which is less than z.\n\nSo for each z, y can be in [B, C], but also y must be <= z? No, because z is in [C, D], so z >= C. So y can be up to C, which is <= z only when z is >= C. Which it is.\n\nWait, z is in [C, D], so for any y in [B, C], y <= z because z >= C and y <= C. So yes, for a given z, y can be from B to C, but wait, no, because if z is larger than C, then y can be up to C, but if z is smaller than C, then y can't be larger than z.\n\nWait, no, because z starts at C. So for all z in [C, D], y can be from B to C, because y's maximum is C, which is <= z.\n\nSo for each z, y can range from B to C. Because even if z is larger than C, y can go up to C.\n\nSo for each z, y ranges from B to C.\n\nNow, for each z and y, we can compute the range of x's that satisfy the conditions.\n\nBut looping through all possible z, y, x is going to be too slow because z can be up to 5e5, y up to 5e5, and x up to 5e5. That's way too much.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative idea: for each possible y, determine the range of z where y + x > z, and x is within [A, B], and z is within [y, D].\n\nWait, perhaps for each y, find the number of z's such that z < y + x, where x is in [A, B] and x <= y.\n\nWait, but x varies for each y. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, for each y, the minimal z is C (since z >= C), but wait, no: z is from C to D. So for each y, z can vary from C to some upper limit.\n\nWait, the condition is x + y > z. Since x can be as small as A, and as large as B, but also x <= y.\n\nWait, for a fixed y, the maximum x is min(B, y). So the maximum x is y if B >= y, else B.\n\nWait, no: x can be up to B, but since y is >= B, so x can be up to B, which is <= y. So x is up to y.\n\nSo for a given y, x can range from A to min(B, y).\n\nThen, for each y, the minimal z is max(C, (A + y) + 1). Wait, no, because z must be >= C, and also for a given x, z can be up to D. Hmm, this seems a bit messy.\n\nAnother approach: let's consider all possible y and z pairs where z is in [C, D], y is in [B, C], and y <= z.\n\nWait, because z >= y is always true since z is >= C and y <= C.\n\nSo for each z, y can be from B to min(C, z). But since z is >= C, min(C, z) is C, so y ranges from B to C.\n\nWait, no. For example, if z is 10, C is 5. Then y can be up to 5, which is less than z. So for z=10, y can be up to 5.\n\nAh, right! So for each z, y can be from B to min(C, z). But since z can be as low as C, when z=C, y can be up to C, which is equal to z. When z is larger than C, y can be up to C, which is less than z.\n\nSo for each z, y can be from B to min(C, z).\n\nWait, but z is varying from C to D. So for each z, y ranges from B to min(C, z). So for z >= C, y can be from B to C, unless z < C, which is impossible because z starts at C.\n\nSo for z >= C, y ranges from B to C.\n\nWait, no. Because if z is 3, C is 5, then min(C, z) is 3. So y can be from B to 3, but that's only if B <=3. Otherwise, it's not possible.\n\nWait, this complicates things. So for a given z, y can be as high as min(C, z). So for example, if z is 3 and C is 5, then y can't be more than 3. But if B is 4, then y can only be from 4 to 3, which isn't possible. So in that case, for this z, there are no valid y's.\n\nSo perhaps for each z, the possible y's are in [B, min(C, z)], but only if B <= min(C, z). Otherwise, no y's.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nLet me think about the variables:\n\nWe have x, y, z with A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, C ≤ z ≤ D.\n\nConstraints:\n\n- x ≤ y (since x ≤ B, y ≥ B)\n- y ≤ z (since y ≤ C, z ≥ C)\n\nAlso, for the triangle condition: x + y > z.\n\nWe can model this as:\n\nz < x + y.\n\nSo for a given z, the condition is x + y > z.\n\nBut since x can vary from A to B, and y can vary from B to C, but also y must be ≥ x, perhaps we can precompute for each possible z the number of (x, y) pairs where x ≤ y, x is in [A, B], y is in [x, C], and x + y > z.\n\nWait, but y must be at least B, and x must be at least A. So perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate z from C to D.\n\n2. For each z, compute the minimum required x + y, which is z + 1.\n\n3. Then, find the number of (x, y) pairs where x ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C], x ≤ y, and x + y > z.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nHmm.\n\nSo for a given z, the sum x + y must be > z. So x + y >= z + 1.\n\nGiven that x is ≤ y, x can range from A to B, and y can be from x to C.\n\nSo for each x, the minimum y is max(x, (z + 1 - x) + 1). Wait, no: since x + y > z → y > z - x → y >= (z - x) + 1.\n\nBut y must be ≥ x (since x ≤ y), and also y ≥ B.\n\nSo for a given x, the valid y's are in the range [max( (z - x + 1), B ), C], but also y must be ≥ x.\n\nWait, but if (z - x + 1) > x, then the lower bound is (z -x + 1), else it's max(B, x).\n\nSo for each x, the lower bound for y is the maximum of (z - x + 1) and B and x.\n\nWait, no. Because y must be ≥ x and ≥ B.\n\nSo y_min = max( x, B, (z -x + 1) )\n\nWait, no: if (z -x + 1) is less than x, then y just needs to be ≥ x, which is already covered by y ≥ x. So in that case, the lower bound is max(x, B).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nWe have:\n\ny ≥ x\n\ny ≥ B\n\ny > z - x → y ≥ (z -x) + 1\n\nSo y must be ≥ max( x, B, (z -x + 1) )\n\nBut wait, if (z -x + 1) is less than both x and B, then y must be ≥ the maximum of x and B. Because the other condition is automatically satisfied.\n\nSo for each x, the lower bound is the maximum of (x, B, (z -x + 1)).\n\nBut the upper bound is C.\n\nSo for a given x, if this lower bound is <= C, then the number of y's is (C - lower_bound + 1). Otherwise, zero.\n\nSo for each x in [A, B], the number of y's is:\n\nif lower_bound > C → 0\n\nelse → C - lower_bound + 1\n\nBut now, for each z, we have to compute the sum over x in [A, B] of max(0, C - lower_bound + 1), where lower_bound is max(x, B, (z -x + 1)).\n\nBut again, looping through each x for each z is O(z_range * x_range), which could be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nWe need a smarter way to calculate this sum.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can find a mathematical formula that allows us to compute the sum for each z without iterating x.\n\nLet me try to express the lower_bound as L = max(x, B, (z -x + 1)).\n\nWe can split this into cases based on the relationship between x and (z -x + 1).\n\nCase 1: x ≥ B and x ≥ (z -x + 1)\n\nIn this case, L = x.\n\nSo for x >= max(B, (z -x + 1)), which may vary depending on x.\n\nCase 2: x < B or x < (z -x + 1)\n\nIn this case, L is the maximum of B and (z -x + 1).\n\nWait, but if x >= B and x >= (z -x +1), then L is x.\n\nElse, if x < B but x >= (z -x +1), then L is B.\n\nElse, if x < B and x < (z -x +1), then L is max(B, (z -x +1)).\n\nWait, this seems complicated.\n\nPerhaps we can find the x's for which (z -x + 1) <= x, and those where (z -x + 1) > x.\n\nLet me find the x where (z -x +1) <= x → z +1 <= 2x → x >= (z+1)/2.\n\nSo for x >= ceil( (z+1)/2 ), (z -x +1) <= x.\n\nFor x < ceil( (z+1)/2 ), (z -x +1) > x.\n\nSo, for x >= m (where m = ceil( (z+1)/2 )), the condition (z -x +1) <= x holds.\n\nSo for x >= m, the lower_bound is x, provided x >= B.\n\nWait, no: because for x >= m, (z -x +1) <= x. So the condition for y is y >= x and y >= B.\n\nSo in this case, L is max(x, B).\n\nSo for x >= m, L is the maximum of x and B.\n\nBut since x <= B (since x is up to B), because in the problem statement, x is <= B.\n\nWait, no. x can be up to B, but in the problem statement, x can be up to B, which is part of the initial condition A <= x <= B.\n\nSo x can be at most B. So for x >= m, if x >= B, then L is x. If x < B, then L is B.\n\nWait, but for x >= m, since m is the point where (z -x +1) <= x, and x can be up to B.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nIf x >= m and x >= B → then L is x.\n\nIf x >= m but x < B → then L is max(x, B) → which is B.\n\nSo for x >= m and x >= B → contributes x to L.\n\nFor x >= m and x < B → contributes B to L.\n\nSimilarly, for x < m:\n\nHere, (z -x +1) > x → so the lower bound is max(B, (z -x +1)).\n\nSo for x < m:\n\nL = max(B, (z -x +1)).\n\nSo the sum for each z can be broken down into two parts: x < m and x >= m.\n\nLet me define m as floor((z+1)/2). Or wait, m is the point where x >= m satisfies (z -x +1) <=x.\n\nWait, solving for x in (z -x +1) <= x:\n\nz + 1 <= 2x → x >= (z + 1)/2.\n\nSince x is integer, m is the smallest integer >= (z + 1)/2.\n\nSo m = ceil( (z+1)/2 ).\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nFor example, z = 5:\n\n(z+1)/2 = 3. So x >= 3 → (5 -x +1) =6 -x <= x → 6 -x <=x →6 <=2x →x >=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for x >= m, (z -x +1) <= x.\n\nFor x < m, (z -x +1) >x.\n\nSo now, for each z, we can split the x's into two regions: x < m and x >= m.\n\nThen, for each region, compute the number of x's that contribute to the sum.\n\nLet's handle each case.\n\nFirst, x < m:\n\nIn this case, L = max(B, (z -x + 1)).\n\nSo for each x < m, the lower bound is the maximum between B and (z -x +1).\n\nBut x must be >= A and <= B.\n\nSo for x in [A, min(B, m-1)]:\n\nWe have L = max(B, z -x +1).\n\nBut since x < m, z -x +1 >x.\n\nSo L is either B or (z -x +1), whichever is larger.\n\nSo when is (z -x +1) >= B?\n\nLet's solve for x: z -x +1 >= B → x <= z +1 - B.\n\nSo for x <= s (s = z +1 - B), L is (z -x +1).\n\nOtherwise, for x > s, L is B.\n\nBut wait, x is in [A, min(B, m-1)].\n\nSo the condition depends on whether s is within this range.\n\nSo the x's can be further divided into two regions:\n\na) x <= s → L = (z -x +1)\n\nb) x > s → L = B.\n\nSo for x < m, we can split into these two subcases.\n\nSo the number of y's for each x is:\n\nIf L > C → 0\n\nElse → C - L + 1.\n\nSo for each x, we compute whether L is <= C.\n\nThis seems manageable, but still, for each z, it's a lot of computation.\n\nAlternative approach: for each z, find the range of x where x is in [A, B], and for each x, compute the contribution to the sum.\n\nBut instead of doing this for each x, perhaps find a mathematical expression that can represent the sum over x in terms of intervals.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think about the sum S(z) which is the total number of (x, y) pairs for a given z.\n\nWe can write S(z) as:\n\nS(z) = sum_{x=A}^B [ max( 0, C - max(x, B, z -x +1 ) + 1 ) ]\n\nBut this is computationally expensive.\n\nSo the challenge is to find an efficient way to compute this sum.\n\nAn alternative idea: for each z, precompute the regions of x where the expressions inside max change their behavior, and compute the contributions from each region.\n\nAs before, let's consider m = ceil( (z+1)/2 ), which is the point where (z -x +1) becomes <=x.\n\nSo for x >= m:\n\nx <= B.\n\nSo in this region, L is max(x, B).\n\nSince x <= B (as per the problem constraints), L is B if x < B, and x otherwise.\n\nWait, no: for x >= m, x can be up to B.\n\nSo for x >= m and x <= B, L is max(x, B) → which is B if x < B, and x if x = B.\n\nWait, no: if x is B, then L is max(B, B) → B.\n\nIf x is less than B, then L is B.\n\nSo for x >= m, L is:\n\nif x >= B → L = x.\n\nif x < B → L = B.\n\nSo for x >= m, the lower bound is B if x < B, and x if x == B.\n\nBut wait, x can't exceed B, so x is up to B.\n\nSo for x >= m:\n\nif x < B → L = B.\n\nif x == B → L = B.\n\nSo for x >= m, L is B.\n\nWait, no: if x is B, then max(x, B) is B.\n\nSo for x >= m, L is B if x <= B.\n\nWhich is always the case.\n\nWait, no: x can be up to B.\n\nSo for x >= m, L is B.\n\nWait, no, because if x is larger than B, but that's impossible because x is <= B.\n\nWait, x can't be larger than B.\n\nSo for x >= m, since x <= B, L is B.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nBecause for x >= m, (z -x +1) <=x → so the condition for y is y >=x and y >=B.\n\nBut since x <= B (as per x's definition), then y >= max(x, B) is the same as y >= B.\n\nBecause x <= B.\n\nSo for x >= m, L = B.\n\nSo for x >= m:\n\nnumber of y's is max(0, C - B + 1), but only if B <= C.\n\nWait, because y has to be >= B and <= C.\n\nSo for x >= m, the lower bound is B.\n\nSo if B > C, then there are zero y's.\n\nElse, the number of y's is C - B + 1.\n\nSo for x >= m, each x contributes (C - B + 1) if B <= C and B <= C.\n\nSo the sum over x >= m is the count of x's in [max(m, A), B] multiplied by (C - B + 1), but only if B <= C.\n\nElse, it's zero.\n\nSo the number of x's in [max(m, A), B] is max(0, B - max(m, A) + 1).\n\nSo for x >= m, the contribution is (C - B + 1) * (max(0, B - max(m, A) + 1)).\n\nBut wait, only if B <= C. Otherwise, it's zero.\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nNow, the second part is x < m.\n\nIn this region, for each x, L = max(B, z -x +1).\n\nBut x is in [A, min(m-1, B)].\n\nSo for each x in this range, L is either B or (z -x +1), whichever is larger.\n\nLet me denote t = z -x +1.\n\nSo for x < m, t > x.\n\nSo for each x in [A, min(m-1, B)], the lower bound is max(B, t).\n\nt = z -x +1.\n\nWe can rearrange this as x = z +1 - t.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to find for each x whether t >= B.\n\nIf t >= B → L = t.\n\nElse → L = B.\n\nSo for each x, t = z -x +1.\n\nWe can find the x's where t >= B → x <= z +1 - B.\n\nSo x <= s, where s = z + 1 - B.\n\nSo for x <= s → L = t.\n\nElse → L = B.\n\nBut x is also in [A, min(m-1, B)].\n\nSo the x's can be split into two parts:\n\nx1: x <= s and x >= A.\n\nx2: x > s and x < m.\n\nSo for x1, L = t.\n\nFor x2, L = B.\n\nSo the sum over x < m is the sum for x in x1 plus the sum for x in x2.\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst, x1: x <= s and x >= A.\n\nBut x must also be < m.\n\nSo the x's are in [A, min(s, m-1)].\n\nEach such x contributes (C - t +1) if t <= C.\n\nElse, zero.\n\nWait, for x in x1, L = t.\n\nSo y must be >= t.\n\nSo if t > C → 0.\n\nElse, the number of y's is C - t +1.\n\nSo for x1, the contribution is sum_{x=A}^{x_max} [ max(0, C - (z -x +1) + 1) ] where x_max is min(s, m-1).\n\nWait, z -x +1 is t. So C - t +1 = C - (z -x +1) +1 = C - z + x.\n\nSo for each x in x1, the contribution is max(0, (C - z + x)).\n\nBut only if (z -x +1) <= C.\n\nWait, no: the condition is t <= C → z -x +1 <= C → x >= z +1 - C.\n\nBut x is in x1, which is x >= A and x <= s.\n\nSo for x >= z +1 - C, t <= C.\n\nSo the x's in x1 are split into:\n\nx >= a, where a = max(A, z + 1 - C).\n\nElse, if a > x_max, then no contribution.\n\nSo the x's in x1 that contribute are from a to x_max.\n\nSo the number of such x's is (x_max - a + 1) if a <= x_max.\n\nElse, zero.\n\nAnd for each x in a to x_max, the contribution is (C - z +x).\n\nSo the sum for x1 is sum_{x=a}^{x_max} (C - z +x).\n\nWhich can be written as (C - z)*(x_max - a + 1) + sum_{x=a}^{x_max} x.\n\nThe sum of x from a to x_max is (x_max*(x_max +1)/2) - ((a-1)*a/2).\n\nSo that's manageable.\n\nNow, for x2: x > s and x < m.\n\nIn this case, L = B.\n\nSo for each x in x2, the contribution is max(0, C - B + 1) if B <= C.\n\nElse, zero.\n\nSo the x's are in [s + 1, m - 1], but also within [A, B].\n\nSo the x's are in [max(s+1, A), min(m-1, B)].\n\nThe count of such x's is max(0, min(m-1, B) - max(s+1, A) + 1).\n\nEach contributes (C - B + 1) if B <= C, else 0.\n\nSo putting it all together, for each z, S(z) is the sum of the contributions from x >= m and x < m.\n\nBut wait, what if B > C? Then, for x >= m, the contribution is zero because (C - B +1) would be negative.\n\nSimilarly, for x2, the contribution is zero.\n\nSo for B > C, the only possible contributions are when x < m and t <= C.\n\nWait, but B > C implies that y can't be >= B and <= C, so for any x, there are no y's.\n\nSo in that case, S(z) is zero.\n\nSo the code will have to handle that as a special case.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, B <= C. So perhaps the initial constraints ensure that B <= C, but I should double-check.\n\nThe input constraints are 1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D.\n\nSo B is <= C.\n\nSo in our code, B <= C is always true.\n\nSo no need to worry about B > C.\n\nSo back to the algorithm.\n\nFor each z in [C, D]:\n\nCompute m = ceil( (z +1)/2 )\n\nCompute the sum for x >= m: x ranges from max(m, A) to B.\n\nThe count is (B - max(m, A) +1) if max(m, A) <= B.\n\nElse zero.\n\nEach contributes (C - B +1).\n\nSo the sum for x >= m is (count) * (C - B +1).\n\nThen, compute for x < m:\n\nCompute s = z +1 - B.\n\nx1: x <= s and x >= A.\n\nBut x must also be < m.\n\nSo x ranges from A to min(s, m-1).\n\nBut x must also be <= B.\n\nSo x ranges from A to min(s, m-1, B).\n\nWait, but s is z +1 - B, which could be larger than B, but x can't be larger than B.\n\nSo the upper bound for x1 is min(s, m-1, B).\n\nSo x_max = min(s, m-1, B).\n\nBut wait, x can't be larger than B.\n\nSo x_max = min(s, m-1, B).\n\nThen, a is the lower bound for x in x1 where t <= C.\n\nt = z -x +1 <= C → x >= z +1 - C.\n\nSo a = max(A, z +1 - C).\n\nSo x starts from a.\n\nBut x must also be <= x_max.\n\nSo if a > x_max, then x1 contributes nothing.\n\nElse, the sum is as before.\n\nThen, for x2: x > s and x < m.\n\nx must be >= A and <= B.\n\nSo x ranges from max(s+1, A) to min(m-1, B).\n\nThe count is max(0, min(m-1, B) - max(s+1, A) + 1).\n\nEach contributes (C - B + 1).\n\nSo the sum for x2 is (count) * (C - B + 1).\n\nSo S(z) is the sum of x >= m's contribution, x1's contribution, and x2's contribution.\n\nBut wait, no: x >= m's contribution is (count_x_ge_m) * (C - B +1).\n\nx1's contribution is the sum of (C - z +x) for x in a to x_max.\n\nx2's contribution is (count_x2) * (C - B +1).\n\nSo S(z) = x_ge_m_contribution + x1_contribution + x2_contribution.\n\nOnce S(z) is computed, we add it to the total.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this logic efficiently.\n\nBut for each z, it's manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps for each z.\n\nCompute m = ceil( (z +1)/2 )\n\nCompute s = z + 1 - B\n\nCompute x_ge_m_low = max(m, A)\n\nx_ge_m_high = B\n\ncount_ge_m = max(0, x_ge_m_high - x_ge_m_low + 1) if x_ge_m_high >= x_ge_m_low.\n\nElse 0.\n\nx_ge_m_contribution = count_ge_m * (C - B + 1)\n\nThen, for x < m:\n\nCompute x1_low = A\n\nx1_high = min(s, m-1, B)\n\nif x1_high < x1_low → x1_contribution is 0.\n\nElse:\n\na = max(x1_low, z + 1 - C)\n\nx1_low_new = a\n\nx1_high_new = x1_high\n\nif x1_high_new < x1_low_new → x1_contribution is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nsum_x = (C - z) * (x1_high_new - x1_low_new + 1) + (x1_high_new*(x1_high_new +1)//2 - (x1_low_new-1)*x1_low_new//2 )\n\nx1_contribution = sum_x\n\nFor x2:\n\nx2_low = max(s + 1, A)\n\nx2_high = min(m-1, B)\n\nif x2_high < x2_low → x2_contribution is 0.\n\nElse:\n\ncount_x2 = x2_high - x2_low + 1\n\nx2_contribution = count_x2 * (C - B +1)\n\nSo the total S(z) is x_ge_m_contribution + x1_contribution + x2_contribution.\n\nBut wait, the x1_contribution is the sum of (C - z + x) for x in a to x1_high.\n\nWhich is (C - z) * (x1_high - a + 1) + sum(a to x1_high of x).\n\nSum of x from a to x1_high is (x1_high*(x1_high +1)//2) - ( (a-1)*a//2 )\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this.\n\nBut what about the computational efficiency?\n\nSince z can be up to 5e5, and for each z, the steps are O(1), the total time should be acceptable.\n\nBut let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nTest Case 1:\n\nInput: 1 2 3 4\n\nExpected Output: 4.\n\nSo for each z from 3 to4.\n\nLet's compute for z=3.\n\nm = ceil( (3+1)/2 )=2.\n\ns = 3 +1 -2= 2.\n\nx_ge_m_low = max(2, 1) =2.\n\nx_ge_m_high =2.\n\ncount_ge_m=1.\n\ncontribution: 1*(3-2+1)=2.\n\nx < m:\n\nx ranges from 1 to 1 (since m=2).\n\ns=2.\n\nx1_high = min(2, 1, 2) =1.\n\na = max(1, 3+1 -3=1) →1.\n\nso x runs from 1 to1.\n\nt=3 -1 +1=3.\n\nC=3, so t <=3 → yes.\n\nsum_x = (3-3)*1 + (1*2/2 -

The key steps are:\n\n1. **Iterate over \\(z\\)**: Loop through each possible value of \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\).\n2. **Determine the midpoint \\(m\\)**: For each \\(z\\), compute the midpoint \\(m\\) as the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\((z + 1) / 2\\). This helps in splitting the problem into two manageable parts.\n3. **Calculate contributions for \\(x \\geq m\\)**: For \\(x\\) values greater than or equal to \\(m\\), the contribution is straightforward since the lower bound for \\(y\\) is determined by \\(B\\).\n4. **Handle \\(x < m\\) cases**: For \\(x\\) values less than \\(m\\), further split the problem into two parts where the lower bound for \\(y\\) can be either \\(B\\) or \\(z - x + 1\\), whichever is larger.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_triangles(A, B, C, D):\n    total = 0\n    for z in range(C, D + 1):\n        m = (z + 1 + 1) // 2  # ceil((z+1)/2)\n        s = z + 1 - B\n        \n        # Contribution from x >= m\n        x_ge_m_low = max(m, A)\n        x_ge_m_high = B\n        if x_ge_m_high >= x_ge_m_low:\n            count_ge_m = x_ge_m_high - x_ge_m_low + 1\n            contrib_ge_m = count_ge_m * (C - B + 1)\n        else:\n            contrib_ge_m = 0\n        \n        # Contribution from x < m\n        x1_low = A\n        x1_high = min(s, m - 1, B)\n        if x1_high >= x1_low:\n            a = max(x1_low, z + 1 - C)\n            if a > x1_high:\n                contrib_x1 = 0\n            else:\n                n = x1_high - a + 1\n                term1 = (C - z) * n\n                sum_a_to_b = (x1_high * (x1_high + 1)) // 2 - ((a - 1) * a) // 2\n                contrib_x1 = term1 + sum_a_to_b\n        else:\n            contrib_x1 = 0\n        \n        # Contribution from x2\n        x2_low = max(s + 1, A)\n        x2_high = min(m - 1, B)\n        if x2_high >= x2_low:\n            count_x2 = x2_high - x2_low + 1\n            contrib_x2 = count_x2 * (C - B + 1)\n        else:\n            contrib_x2 = 0\n        \n        S_z = contrib_ge_m + contrib_x1 + contrib_x2\n        total += S_z\n    \n    return total\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    A = int(input[0])\n    B = int(input[1])\n    C = int(input[2])\n    D = int(input[3])\n    result = count_triangles(A, B, C, D)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Iterating over \\(z\\)**: We loop through each possible value of \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\).\n2. **Midpoint Calculation**: For each \\(z\\), the midpoint \\(m\\) is calculated to split the problem into two parts.\n3. **Contribution Calculation for \\(x \\geq m\\)**: For \\(x\\) values greater than or equal to \\(m\\), the contribution is straightforward as the lower bound for \\(y\\) is \\(B\\).\n4. **Handling \\(x < m\\)**: For \\(x\\) values less than \\(m\\), we further split the problem into two parts where the lower bound for \\(y\\) can be either \\(B\\) or \\(z - x + 1\\), whichever is larger.
