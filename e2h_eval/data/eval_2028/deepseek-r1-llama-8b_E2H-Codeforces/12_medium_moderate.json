The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, Xenia is in a city with houses arranged in a ring, right? She needs to do some tasks, and each task requires her to be at a specific house. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again. Oh right, the traffic is one-way, clockwise. So she can't go against the flow; she can only move to the next house in the clockwise direction each step. Each move takes one unit of time.\n\nSo, how do we model this? Well, the initial position is house 1. For each task ai, she needs to reach it after completing all previous tasks. Wait, no, wait: the i-th task is to be done when she arrives at ai, but she has to do all tasks numbered less than i before that. Or wait, the note says that in order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in ai and have completed all tasks with numbers less than i. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, the second line says she has m tasks, a1, a2, ..., am. To complete the i-th task, she must be at ai and have already done all tasks j where j < i. So the order of tasks is important here—she can't skip earlier tasks. But since they are given as a list, perhaps the order is not fixed, but she must process them in the order of their indices. Wait, no, the problem says she needs to be in ai for task i, but she can't do task i until she's arrived there after doing all earlier tasks. So the sequence is such that for each task, she must visit it in order.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the sequence of tasks is given as a list a1 to am, but she can choose the order in which she does the tasks. Because in the sample input, the first example is 3,2,3, and the output is 6. So she goes 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. So she did task 1 at 3, task 2 at 2, and task 3 at 3. Wait, but the order of tasks is according to their indices? Or is she doing them in any order as long as she's at the required positions?\n\nHmm, I think the correct approach is that she must do the tasks in the order of their indices. That is, she first completes task 1 (needs to be at a1), then task 2 (needs to be at a2), etc., up to task m. Because otherwise, the problem becomes more complicated. Wait, but the problem statement isn't entirely clear on that. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nThe problem says: \"In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" So, for the i-th task, she must have already completed tasks 1..i-1. So the order is fixed: she must process the tasks in the order of 1 to m, each time moving to ai for the i-th task.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because, for example, if a1 is 3, then she has to go to 3, but to get there from 1, she has to go through 2. But perhaps she doesn't need to process other tasks yet. Hmm, no, because for the first task, she's at a1. Then for the second task, she has to go to a2, but she must have completed all tasks before i=2, which is task 1. So, yes, the tasks are processed in order, and for each task i, she must be present at ai after having done all tasks j < i.\n\nSo the approach is to model the movement of Xenia as she processes each task in order. So the steps are:\n\n1. Start at position 1.\n\n2. For each task i from 1 to m:\n   a. Move to ai, but considering the current position.\n   b. The time taken is the minimal distance from current position to ai, either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Wait, but since the ring is one-way, she can only move clockwise. So she can't take the counter path. So the distance is always the minimal steps going clockwise.\n\nWait, wait. No, because the ringroad is one way, and the traffic is clockwise. So Xenia can't move counter-clockwise. So she can only move in the direction of increasing house numbers, modulo n.\n\nWait, no. Let's think: the houses are arranged in a ring, 1, 2, 3, ..., n, connected in a circle. Traffic is one way, and moves only clockwise. So from house k, the next house is k+1 mod n. So, to go from 4 to 1, you have to go 4 →5 → ... →n →1.\n\nSo, the movement is strictly in the clockwise direction. So each step is +1, modulo n.\n\nTherefore, the distance between two points a and b is the minimal steps to go from a to b in the clockwise direction. But wait, sometimes it's shorter to go the other way. Like, for n=4, from 4 to 2: the direct path is 4→1→2, which is 2 steps, but going the other way is 4→3→2, which is also 2 steps. So same in both cases. Hmm, but in general, for n=5, from 5 to 3: clockwise is 5→1→2→3 (3 steps), but counter-clockwise is 5→4→3 (2 steps). So the minimal steps would be 2.\n\nWait, but since the movement is strictly clockwise, she can't go the other way. So she must take the longer path if needed. So for the problem, the movement is only in the clockwise direction, and each step is one unit.\n\nWait, the problem says that moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time. So, she can only move to the next higher-numbered house in a clockwise direction. So, the movement is always forward, but when the next house is the next in the sequence.\n\nSo, for example, in a ring of 4 houses, the order is 1→2→3→4→1→2... So, from 4, moving to 1 is considered a step, but it's the next house.\n\nSo, the distance from a to b is the number of steps you'd take moving in the clockwise direction from a to b.\n\nSo, for a and b, the distance is (b - a) mod n, but if that's zero, it's n steps.\n\nWait, no. Because for a=4, b=2, in a ring of 4, moving clockwise from 4 to 2 would require passing through 1 and 2, which is 2 steps. So the calculation is (2 -4) mod 4 = (-2) mod 4 = 2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but (b - a) mod n gives the positive difference. For a=4, b=2, (2-4) mod 4 is (-2) mod 4 is 2. So that's the correct number of steps.\n\nWait, but what if a=3, b=1, n=4: (1-3) mod4 is -2 mod4 is 2, but the actual steps are 3→4→1: 2 steps. So yes, correct.\n\nSo the formula is: the minimal steps from a to b is (b - a) mod n, but if that's negative, mod n ensures it's positive. Alternatively, (b - a + n) % n.\n\nSo, the distance is (b - a) % n.\n\nBut wait, since the movement is only in the clockwise direction, is this the case? Because for a=2, b=3: (3-2) mod4 is 1, which is correct.\n\nYes, so the minimal time to go from a to b is (b -a) mod n steps.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nThe output is 6.\n\nSo, let's compute the steps:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nTask 1: a1=3.\n\nShe needs to go from 1 to 3. Distance is (3-1) mod4 = 2 steps.\n\nTime taken: 2 units.\n\nNow, she's at 3.\n\nTask 2: a2=2.\n\nShe needs to go from 3 to 2. Distance is (2-3) mod4 = (-1 mod4)=3. Wait, but in the sample explanation, she goes 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps. So that's correct.\n\nTime taken: 3 units. Total so far 5.\n\nThen, Task 3: a3=3.\n\nShe's already at 3, so no steps needed. Time remains 5.\n\nBut wait, the sample output is 6. Oh, because she's still at 3, but then she has to process all tasks. So what happens after all tasks? Does she have to return to 1? Or no? Wait, the problem says nothing about returning to 1. So the total steps are the sum of all the individual movements, regardless of where she ends.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: the output is the total time she needs to complete all tasks. So, for each task, she must move to ai, starting from the previous position. The sum of all these movements is the answer.\n\nSo, in the sample:\n\nTask 1: 1 →3: 2 steps.\n\nTask 2: 3 →2: 3 steps.\n\nTask 3: 2 →3: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 2+3+1=6.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAh, okay, I see now.\n\nSo the approach is to simulate the movement step by step, adding the distance for each task.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize current_position to 1.\n\ntime = 0.\n\nFor each task in the list a1 to am:\n\n   target = a_i\n\n   distance = (target - current_position) % n\n\n   time += distance\n\n   current_position = target\n\nSo, the total time is the sum of all these distances.\n\nWait, but in the sample, for the third task, the target is 3, current_position is 2. So (3-2) mod4=1. So added 1, making total 6.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother sample: the second input is 4 3, with a list 2 3 3.\n\nSo the steps:\n\ncurrent is 1.\n\nTask1: a1=2.\n\ndistance is (2-1) mod4=1. time=1.\n\ncurrent is 2.\n\nTask2: a2=3.\n\ndistance is (3-2)=1. time=2.\n\ncurrent is3.\n\nTask3: a3=3. distance 0. time remains 2.\n\nSo total is 2, matching the sample.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the plan is to process each task in the given order, calculate the distance from current position to target, add to the time, and update current position.\n\nNow, the question is: how to handle the input.\n\nThe input is read as two lines. The first line is n and m, the second line is m integers.\n\nBut wait, the user provided the input as ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3'], but in the actual code, we'll have to read from standard input.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that the input is in the form of two lines. The first line has n and m, the second has m integers.\n\nSo, the code should read n and m from the first line, then read m integers from the second line.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBut we need to make sure that len(a) == m.\n\nOnce we have a, we process each element in order.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase 1: m=0. Well, according to the problem statement, m is >=1, right? Wait, the input constraints say 1 ≤ m ≤105. So m can't be zero.\n\nCase 2: All a_i are 1. Then, time is zero, because she's already there.\n\nCase3: a_i is the same as the previous. Then, distance is zero, so no steps added.\n\nCase4: Tasks are in non-increasing order. For example, n=5, m=3, a=[5,4,3]. So, first she starts at 1.\n\nTask1: 5. distance is (5-1) mod5=4 steps. time=4.\n\ncurrent position is5.\n\nTask2:4. (4-5) mod5= ( -1 ) mod5=4. So 4 steps. time=8.\n\ncurrent is4.\n\nTask3:3. (3-4) mod5=4. time=12.\n\nBut wait, 4 →5 →1 →2 →3 is 4 steps? Wait, 4 to 3 in clockwise direction is 4→5→1→2→3: four steps. Yes.\n\nSo the total is 4+4+4=12.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1].\n\nProcessing:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nTask1: 2. (2-1) mod2=1. time=1.\n\ncurrent is2.\n\nTask2:1. (1-2) mod2= ( -1 ) mod2=1. time=2.\n\nTotal is 2.\n\nWhich makes sense: 1→2 (1 step), then 2→1 (1 step).\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=4, a=[3,4,5,1].\n\nProcessing:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nTask1:3 → (3-1) mod5=2 steps. time=2.\n\ncurrent is3.\n\nTask2:4 → (4-3)=1 step. time=3.\n\ncurrent is4.\n\nTask3:5 →1 step. time=4.\n\ncurrent is5.\n\nTask4:1 → (1-5) mod5= ( -4 ) mod5=1. time=5.\n\nSo total 2+1+1+1=5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nWe can read n and m, then the list a.\n\nInitialize current =1.\n\ntime=0.\n\nLoop over each x in a:\n\n   d = (x - current) %n\n\n   time +=d\n\n   current =x\n\nPrint(time)\n\nThat's the code.\n\nWait, but what about the case when x is 0? Oh, but according to the input constraints, 1<=ai <=n, so x is at least 1.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample1: a = [3,2,3]\n\nn=4.\n\nProcess:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nx=3: d=(3-1)%4=2 → time=2. current=3.\n\nx=2: d=(2-3) mod4= ( -1 ) mod4=3 → time=5. current=2.\n\nx=3: d=(3-2) mod4=1 → time=6. current=3.\n\nOutput 6.\n\nSample2: a = [2,3,3].\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nx=2: d=1 → time=1. current=2.\n\nx=3: d=1 → time=2. current=3.\n\nx=3: d=0 → time remains 2.\n\nOutput 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, the Python code is straightforward.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks given that she can only move in a clockwise direction around a ring of houses. Each task must be completed in the order they are given, and each movement from one house to another takes exactly one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to visit specific houses in a given order. The key insight is that she can only move clockwise, so the distance between two houses is calculated as the number of steps required to move from the current house to the target house in the clockwise direction.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each task, calculate the minimal steps required to move from the current house to the target house using modular arithmetic to handle the ring structure. The distance from house `a` to house `b` in a ring of `n` houses is `(b - a) % n`.\n\n3. **Algorithm**: \n   - Read the input values.\n   - Initialize the current position to house 1.\n   - For each task, compute the distance to the target house and update the total time.\n   - Update the current position to the target house after each task.\n   - Output the total time after processing all tasks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent = 1\ntime = 0\nfor x in a:\n    d = (x - current) % n\n    time += d\n    current = x\nprint(time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks). The second line contains `m` integers representing the target houses for each task.\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with `time` initialized to 0.\n- **Processing Tasks**: For each target house, compute the clockwise distance from the current house using modular arithmetic. Add this distance to the total time and update the current position to the target house.\n- **Output**: Print the total time after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the ring structure and ensures that each movement is counted accurately.",
