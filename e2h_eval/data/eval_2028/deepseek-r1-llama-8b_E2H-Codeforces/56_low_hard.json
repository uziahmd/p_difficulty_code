Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Guard Duty,\" and from the description, I understand that we need to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases in such a way that each base has exactly one spaceship, and each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base. Plus, there's an important constraint: the paths connecting each base to its spaceship must not intersect any other such path.\n\nHmm, right. So the problem boils down to finding a perfect matching between R Rebel ships and B bases, with the additional condition that the straight lines (paths) from each ship to its base don't cross each other. Oh wait, no, more precisely, any two paths shouldn't intersect. So if I have two ships assigned to two bases, their connecting lines shouldn't meet anywhere except at their respective points.\n\nWait, but the problem says that any two straight paths from a base to its assigned spaceship shouldn't intersect in the galaxy plane. So all these line segments must be non-crossing. So for all pairs of line segments (s_i, b_j) and (s_k, b_l), the segments should not cross each other unless they share an endpoint.\n\nSo how can I model this? Well, the key is to find a bipartite matching between the ships and bases, such that the corresponding segments are non-crossing.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Since R and B can be up to 10 each, which is manageable, perhaps a backtracking approach is feasible here. Because 10! is 3.6 million, which is manageable for a computer.\n\nBut wait, even with backtracking, the state might involve selecting a subset of ships and bases, making sure that each is matched, and that the new segment doesn't cross any existing ones.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a bipartite graph and look for a perfect matching, with an additional constraint on the edges (i.e., the segments don't cross). But how do we represent the non-crossing condition?\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be transformed into checking whether the set of points (ships and bases) can be connected in a non-crossing way. Since each ship is matched to a base, the order in which the ships are placed around the convex hull must correspond to the order of the bases.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Because if you have a set of points that form a convex polygon, then any non-crossing matching must follow the cyclic order around the convex hull. So perhaps the idea is to arrange the ships and bases in such a way that their cyclic order is consistent.\n\nWait, but ships and bases are separate sets of points. So maybe the approach is:\n\n1. Sort all the points (ships and bases) in clockwise or counter-clockwise order around the convex hull.\n2. Then, check if the matching is possible by pairing each ship with a base in the same order, ensuring that each ship is matched to a base that comes after it in the convex hull order, or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the case. Because if you have a set of points where some are ships and others are bases, then to avoid crossings, the order in which they are connected must follow the convex hull's cyclic order.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n- Combine the list of ships and bases into a single list.\n- Compute their convex hull.\n- Then, within the convex hull, determine the order of the points (either clockwise or counter-clockwise).\n- Then, check if there's a way to match ships to bases such that each ship is paired with a base that comes after it in the convex hull order.\n\nWait, but not exactly. Because the convex hull could include both ships and bases, and the matching must pair them in such a way that the segments don't cross. So the idea is that the matching must be such that the points are ordered in a way that each ship is connected to a base that's either entirely contained within a region or appears after it in the convex hull order.\n\nThis sounds similar to the problem of matching parentheses correctly or ensuring that the matching is planar.\n\nAnother thought: for a set of segments, the non-crossing condition is equivalent to the segments being a non-crossing perfect matching of the points. So the problem reduces to whether such a matching exists when the points are divided into two sets: R ships and B bases.\n\nSo how do I model this? One approach is to generate all possible perfect matchings between the ships and bases and then check for each matching whether the segments are non-crossing.\n\nBut generating all possible perfect matchings might be computationally expensive if R and B are up to 10 each, leading to O((R)!/( (R-B)! B! )) possibilities. For R=10 and B=5, that's 30240 possibilities, which is manageable. But for larger values, say R=10 and B=10, that's just 10! = ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. Additionally, the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect with any other paths.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that this problem can be transformed into checking for a non-crossing perfect matching between two sets of points: Rebel spaceships and bases. The approach involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Convex Hull Calculation**: Compute the convex hull of all combined points (ships and bases). This helps in determining the cyclic order of the points.\n2. **Check Non-Crossing Matchings**: For each possible perfect matching between ships and bases, check if the segments connecting the points are non-crossing. A perfect matching here means each ship is assigned to exactly one base and vice versa.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef readints():\n    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ndef cross(o, a, b):\n    return (a[0] - o[0]) * (b[1] - o[1]) - (a[1] - o[1]) * (b[0] - o[0])\n\ndef convex_hull(points):\n    points = sorted(points)\n    lower = []\n    for p in points:\n        while len(lower) >= 2 and cross(lower[-2], lower[-1], p) <= 0:\n            lower.pop()\n        lower.append(p)\n    upper = []\n    for p in reversed(points):\n        while len(upper) >= 2 and cross(upper[-2], upper[-1], p) <= 0:\n            upper.pop()\n        upper.append(p)\n    return lower[:-1] + upper[:-1]\n\ndef make_pairs(ship_indices, base_indices):\n    if len(ship_indices) != len(base_indices):\n        return False\n    pairs = []\n    for s in ship_indices:\n        for b in base_indices:\n            pairs.append((s, b))\n    return pairs\n\ndef is_non_crossing(matching, ships, bases):\n    n = len(matching)\n    if n == 0:\n        return True\n    ship_points = [ships[i] for i in matching[0]]\n    base_points = [bases[i] for i in matching[1]]\n    line_segments = [(ship_points[i], base_points[i]) for i in range(n)]\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            s1, e1 = line_segments[i]\n            s2, e2 = line_segments[j]\n            if ((e1[0]-s1[0])*(e2[1]-s2[1]) - (e1[1]-s1[1])*(e2[0]-s2[0])) > 0:\n                return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve():\n    R = 0\n    B = 0\n    points = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        points.append((x, y))\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        points.append((x, y))\n    \n    ch = convex_hull(points)\n    ship_indices = [i for i in range(R)]\n    base_indices = [i for i in range(B)]\n    \n    total = 0\n    max_match = min(R, B)\n    from itertools import permutations\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    \n    for perm in permutations(range(R), R):\n        if sum(1 for i in range(R) if perm[i] in base_indices[:B]):\n            continue\n        else:\n            continue\n        ship_to_base = {}\n        for s, b in zip(perm, range(B)):\n            if b in ship_to_base:\n                break\n            ship_to_base[b] = s\n        if len(ship_to_base) == B:\n            if is_non_crossing(list(ship_to_base.items()), points[:R], points[R:R+B]):\n                print(\"Yes\")\n                return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into coordinates for both ships and bases.\n2. **Convex Hull Calculation**: The convex hull of all points (ships and bases) is computed to determine their cyclic order.\n3. **Perfect Matching Check**: Using permutations, each possible perfect matching between ships and bases is checked.
