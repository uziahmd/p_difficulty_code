Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Vasily has some candles and can create new ones from the stubs. The goal is to find out how many hours he can keep the room lit. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nHmm, let's see. The initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for exactly one hour before it goes out. So the first thing that happens is that all 'a' candles burn, contributing 'a' hours. Then, the stubs are collected.\n\nWait, but wait. Once a candle is burned, it becomes a stub. And every 'b' stubs can be turned into a new candle. So after burning the initial 'a', we have 'a' stubs. Then, using those, we can make (a // b) new candles. Those new candles add to the total hours. But then, after burning them, they become stubs again, which can be combined with any remaining stubs.\n\nSo the process is: calculate the initial hours, then repeatedly convert stubs into new candles as long as there are enough stubs to do so.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Start with total_hours = a.\n2. current_stubs = a.\n3. While current_stubs >= b:\n   a. new_candles = current_stubs // b\n   b. total_hours += new_candles\n   c. current_stubs = (current_stubs % b) + new_candles\n4. Return total_hours.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each time we make new candles, they contribute their own hours, and their stubs are added back to the total stubs.\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 4 2\nInitial: a=4, current_stubs=4, total=4.\nSince 4 >=2, new_candles=4//2=2. Add 2 → total=6.\ncurrent_stubs becomes (4%2)+(2)=0+2=2.\nAgain, 2 >=2: new_candles=1. Add 1 → total=7.\ncurrent_stubs now is 0 +1=1, which is less than 2. So loop ends. Total is 7. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: 6 3.\nInitial: 6, current=6, total=6.\n6 >=3 → new=2. total=8. current=(6%3=0)+2=2.\n2 <3, so done. So output 8. Correct.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: a=1, b=1000. Then only 1 hour, no stubs left.\n\nCase 2: a=5, b=5. Initial 5, stubs 5. Make 1 new candle, adding 1 → total 6. Then stubs from that is 1, not enough. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=3.\n\nInitial: 10 → 10 hours. Stubs 10.\n10 /3 =3, remainder 1. So new 3 candles. Add 3 → 13. Stubs:1 +3=4.\n4 >=3 → new 1, add 1 →14. Stubs:1+1=2. No more. So total is 14.\n\nWait, let's compute step by step.\n\n10 → 10 hours. Stubs 10.\n\nFirst iteration: 10 //3=3, remainder 1. So new=3, total=13. Stubs=1+3=4.\n\nSecond iteration:4//3=1, rem 1. New=1, total=14. Stubs=1+1=2. Now 2<3. So yes, 14.\n\nSo the algorithm seems to handle that.\n\nSo the plan is to implement this logic in Python.\n\nNow, the input is given as two integers a and b on a single line. So the code should read them, process, and output the result.\n\nThe steps in code:\n\nRead the input line, split into a and b as integers.\n\nCompute the total as per the algorithm above.\n\nPrint the total as an integer string.\n\nSo code structure:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\ncurrent_stubs = a\nwhile current_stubs >= b:\n    new = current_stubs // b\n    total += new\n    current_stubs = (current_stubs % b) + new\nprint(total)\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nTesting this with the samples:\n\nFor 4 2: code computes 7, correct.\n\nFor 6 3: computes 8, correct.\n\nEdge case a=1, b=1000: returns 1.\n\nAnother test: a=5, b=5: returns 6.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWhat about when",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has. Each candle burns for exactly one hour before it goes out, and Vasily can create new candles from the stubs of burned-out candles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a`. Each candle will burn for one hour, so the initial number of hours is `a`.\n2. **Stub Collection**: After burning all initial candles, collect the stubs. Each stub can be used to create new candles when enough stubs are collected.\n3. **Candle Creation**: For every `b` stubs, a new candle can be created. This process is repeated as long as there are enough stubs to form at least one new candle.\n4. **Iterative Process**: Keep track of the total hours by adding the hours from newly created candles. Update the count of stubs after each iteration to include both the remaining stubs from previous operations and the stubs from the newly burned candles.\n\nThe algorithm efficiently calculates the total hours by iterating through the process of creating new candles until no more can be made.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\ncurrent_stubs = a\nwhile current_stubs >= b:\n    new = current_stubs // b\n    total += new\n    current_stubs = (current_stubs % b) + new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `a` and `b`, which are read and converted into integers.\n2. **Initial Hours Calculation**: The initial number of hours is set to `a` because each candle burns for one hour.\n3. **Loop for Candle Creation**: Using a while loop, we repeatedly check if we can create new candles from the current stubs. If possible, calculate how many new candles can be made, add their contribution to the total hours, and update the stub count.\n4. **Update Stubs Count**: After creating new candles, update the stub count to include both the remainder from the division and the stubs from the newly burned candles.\n5. **Output Result**: Once the loop exits (when no more candles can be made), print the total number of hours.\n\nThis approach ensures that we optimally use every available stub to maximize the illumination time, efficiently handling all edge cases.",
