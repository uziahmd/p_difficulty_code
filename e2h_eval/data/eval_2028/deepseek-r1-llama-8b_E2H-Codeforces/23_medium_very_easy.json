            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles, and I have to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form at least one mentsu. Mentsu can be either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nHmm, let's think about how to approach this. The input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s' is one tile. My goal is to determine for each of these three inputs what's the minimal number of additional tiles needed.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the output is three lines, right? Like in the example, the input is three strings, and the output is three integers, each indicating the minimal for each possible scenario. Wait, no, wait. Oh no, maybe I misunderstood. Let me look at the example again.\n\nIn the sample input, it's three lines, but the output is three lines, each being 0, 0, 1. So perhaps each line corresponds to each of the three initial hands? Or maybe not. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: the input is three strings, and the output is a single integer. Oh wait, no, the output is to print a single integer, but in the sample, they show ['0', '0', '1']—wait, maybe the sample is illustrative, but actually, the output is just one integer. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, the problem says the output should print a single integer—the minimal number of extra tiles needed. But in the sample, the output is three lines, which is confusing. Maybe that's a typo in the problem description. Because the example shows three outputs, but according to the problem statement, the output is a single integer.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to read the problem again. Oh, the problem says the output is a single integer. But in the sample, the input is three tiles, and the output is three numbers. Hmm, maybe I misread the problem.\n\nWait, no, looking back: the problem says, \"print a single integer—the minimal number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\" So the output is a single integer, not three lines. So the example must have been a mistake in presentation. So regardless of the input, the output is one integer.\n\nSo, for the given three tiles, we need to compute the minimal number of additional tiles required such that after adding them, the entire collection (original three plus any added) contains at least one mentsu.\n\nOkay, so the steps are:\n\n1. Generate all possible ways to add 0, 1, 2, or 3 tiles, and check if any of these leads to having at least one mentsu.\n\nBut since adding more than needed would not be optimal, we can try adding 0, then 1, etc., until we find the minimal number.\n\nBut considering that for each case, we can have up to 4 possibilities (adding 0,1,2,3 tiles), but the minimal could be as high as 4, but likely much lower.\n\nWait, but the maximum needed is 4, because with 4 tiles, you can form a triplet if you have four copies, but that's only possible if you have four of the same. But wait, no, a triplet requires exactly three. So for example, if you have three of a kind, you're already done. If you have four, you can still form a triplet by choosing any three.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For the current set of tiles, consider all possible ways to add tiles (including multiple copies of the same tile) and see if any combination, when added, allows for a mentsu.\n\nBut considering that adding more than necessary isn't useful, the minimal number of additions is between 0 and 4, perhaps.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum possible minimal additions? It depends on the worst case.\n\nFor example, if none of the initial tiles can form a triplet or sequence, and the user needs to add enough tiles to create a triplet. For example, if you have three different tiles, each from different suits and non-consecutive.\n\nWait, suppose the initial tiles are 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, the minimal number of tiles to add would be 3, because you can add 1m, 2m, 3m to make a sequence. Or, alternatively, add 1m, 1m, 1m to make a triplet. So adding 3 tiles.\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, in that case, you could also add two tiles: say, add 1m and 1m, making four 1ms. Then, you have a triplet. So minimal addition is 2.\n\nWait, because 2 is less than 3. So that suggests that sometimes adding fewer tiles can suffice.\n\nSo, the approach is to generate all possible subsets of tiles (including the original ones) and check if any of them forms a mentsu.\n\nBut how do I model this?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible number of added tiles (from 0 to 3, perhaps?), try adding all possible combinations of those tiles, and see if any combination allows for a mentsu.\n\nBut considering that for each added tile, there are 9*3=27 possible tiles, adding k tiles gives 27^k possibilities, which for k=3 is 19683, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but for each possible way of adding k tiles, including all possibilities, including duplicates.\n\nWait, but when adding k tiles, the order doesn't matter, but the count does. So for example, adding two 1ms is better than adding one 1m and another tile.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to model the problem as follows:\n\nWe have the initial three tiles. We can add any number of tiles (including zero). We need to find the minimal number of tiles to add such that the union of the initial and added tiles contains at least one mentsu.\n\nSo, for each possible k from 0 to 3, check if adding k tiles can result in having a mentsu. Once we find the smallest such k, return it.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to consider all possible triplets or sequences that can be formed by the initial tiles plus some added tiles, and find the minimal number of additions needed for any such triplet/sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible triplet or sequence (each possible mentsu), calculate how many tiles are missing from the initial set, and then the number of tiles to add is the minimal needed to cover those missing tiles.\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Enumerate all possible mentsu options. That is, all possible triplets and sequences.\n\n2. For each such mentsu, calculate how many tiles are already present in the initial hand.\n\n3. The minimal number of tiles to add is the number of missing tiles needed to complete the mentsu.\n\n4. Find the minimal such number across all possible mentsu.\n\nThe minimal among all these is the answer.\n\nBut wait, this approach may miss cases where adding multiple mentsu is possible, but perhaps the minimal is achieved by a different configuration.\n\nNo, because the problem only requires that there is at least one mentsu. So the minimal is determined by the minimal required to form any possible mentsu.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n- For all possible mentsu (all possible triplets and sequences), compute the number of tiles needed to reach that mentsu from the initial hand.\n\n- Take the minimal number across all possible mentsu.\n\nThat will give the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nBut now, how to enumerate all possible mentsu.\n\nLet's think about all possible mentsu:\n\nTriplet (koutsu): any three identical tiles. So for each tile (like 1m, 2p, etc.), there is a triplet mentsu.\n\nSequence (shuntsu): any three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So for each suit, the sequences are 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9. So per suit, 7 possible sequences.\n\nSo total mentsu is 9 (triplets) + 3 *7 (sequences) = 9+21=30 possible mentsu.\n\nSo for each of the 30 mentsu, compute how many of their required tiles are already present.\n\nWait, but each mentsu has exactly three tiles. So for each mentsu, check which of its three tiles are present in the initial hand.\n\nThen, the number of tiles to add is 3 minus the count of unique tiles in the mentsu that are present in the initial hand.\n\nWait, but wait: for a triplet mentsu like [1m,1m,1m], it's the same as just having three 1ms. So, the initial hand may have zero, one, two, or three 1ms.\n\nSimilarly, for a sequence like 1m,2m,3m: the initial hand may have any subset of these, and we need to see how many are missing.\n\nWait, but in the initial hand, the count for each tile is at most one, because each tile is unique. Because the input is three distinct tiles.\n\nYes, the input is three strings, each is a tile, and each tile is unique.\n\nSo, for each mentsu, the mentsu consists of three specific tiles. For each of those three, if the initial hand has it, it contributes one to the count. So the maximum possible count is 3.\n\nWait, but for a triplet, the mentsu requires three copies of the same tile. So, for example, if the initial hand has two 1ms, then adding one more 1m would complete the triplet.\n\nBut in our initial hand, each tile is unique. So, the initial hand has exactly one of each tile. So, for a triplet mentsu, the initial hand can contribute at most one tile towards the triplet.\n\nSo, for a triplet mentsu, the number of tiles to add is 2, because we need two more copies of that tile.\n\nWait, but wait: if the initial hand has three copies, but that's impossible because the initial hand is three tiles, each unique.\n\nSo, for triplet mentsu, the initial hand can have 0, 1, or 2 copies of a particular tile. Wait, no: the initial hand has three unique tiles, so for any triplet, the initial hand can have at most one copy of the tile in the triplet.\n\nBecause each tile is unique in the initial hand.\n\nWait, no: the initial hand has three tiles, but each tile is unique. So, for any triplet, the initial hand can have at most one occurrence of each tile in the triplet.\n\nWait, because the initial hand has three tiles, each being distinct.\n\nSo, for a triplet mentsu, the maximum number of tiles in the initial hand that match the triplet is one.\n\nThus, for a triplet mentsu, the number of tiles needed to add is 2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for example, if the initial hand has one 1m, then adding two more 1ms would make three, forming a triplet.\n\nBut for a sequence, say 1m,2m,3m: the initial hand may have 1m, 2m, and 3m. Then, no tiles needed. Or, perhaps it has 1m, 2m, 4m: then, to form a sequence, it's missing 3m, so adding one tile.\n\nWait, but the initial hand has three tiles, each unique.\n\nSo, for each mentsu, which is a set of three tiles, the initial hand may have any subset of those three tiles, possibly all, possibly none, or one, two, etc.\n\nWait, but the initial hand is three unique tiles, so the maximum number of overlapping tiles between the mentsu and the initial hand is three, but that's only possible if all three tiles in the mentsu are present in the initial hand.\n\nSo, for each mentsu, the initial hand has some number of tiles in common with the mentsu.\n\nThe number of tiles to add is 3 - (number of tiles in common between mentsu and initial hand).\n\nBut wait, for a triplet mentsu, which requires three copies of the same tile, the initial hand can have at most one tile from that triplet. So the number of tiles in common is 1 (if the initial hand has one of the triplet's tile), leading to 3-1=2 tiles to add.\n\nFor a sequence mentsu, which requires three distinct tiles, the number of tiles in common with the initial hand can be 0,1,2, or 3.\n\nFor example, if the initial hand has all three tiles of the sequence, then no tiles needed.\n\nIf two of the three are present, then one tile is needed.\n\nIf one is present, two are needed.\n\nIf none are present, three are needed.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each possible mentsu (all triplets and sequences), compute how many tiles from the mentsu are present in the initial hand. Then, the required tiles to add are (3 - count_present). The minimal of these values across all mentsu is the answer.\n\nWait, but wait: for a triplet mentsu, the initial hand can have at most one tile of the triplet. So, for each triplet mentsu, the count_present is min(1, 1) because the initial hand can have either 0 or 1 of that tile.\n\nWait, for a triplet mentsu, the count_present is 1 if the initial hand contains that tile, else 0.\n\nSo for each triplet, the required tiles to add is 2.\n\nFor a sequence mentsu, the count_present can be up to 3.\n\nSo, for each sequence, the required tiles to add can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\nSo, for each of the 30 mentsu, compute the required tiles, and take the minimal.\n\nBut wait, what about when the initial hand already has a mentsu? Then, the required tiles is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the initial three tiles into a set.\n\n2. Enumerate all possible mentsu (30 in total).\n\n3. For each mentsu, compute how many of its tiles are present in the initial hand.\n\n4. For each mentsu, compute required = 3 - count_present.\n\n5. Find the minimal required value across all mentsu.\n\n6. Output this minimal value.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nNow, how to represent the tiles.\n\nEach tile is a string like '1m', '2s', etc.\n\nWe can represent the initial hand as a set of these strings.\n\nFor each mentsu, we can represent it as a set of three strings.\n\nThen, the intersection of the initial hand's set and the mentsu's set is the count_present.\n\nSo, for each mentsu, required = 3 - len(intersection).\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead the three tiles into a set, say initial = {'1s', '2s', ...}.\n\nGenerate all possible mentsu:\n\n- All triplets: for each suit (m, p, s), and each number 1-9, create a triplet consisting of three copies of that tile. But since each mentsu is a set, the triplet is represented as a set with one element (since all three are same tile). Wait no, for a triplet, the mentsu is three same tiles. So for example, the mentsu is {'1m', '1m', '1m'}, but as a set, it's just {'1m'}. So to represent a triplet, it's a set containing one tile.\n\nWait, no. No, because in terms of checking, if the initial hand has one '1m', then the count_present is 1.\n\nBut for a triplet mentsu, we need three '1m's. So in the initial hand, if it has one '1m', then we need two more.\n\nBut the code will treat the triplet as a set with one tile, and the count_present is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nThen, for sequences:\n\nEach sequence is three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So for each suit, the sequences are 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9. So for each suit, 7 sequences.\n\nSo, for each of these, the mentsu is a set of three tiles: {tile1, tile2, tile3}.\n\nSo, for each of these, compute the count_present.\n\nSo, the code will generate all 30 mentsu sets.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read the initial three tiles into a set.\n\nThen, for all possible mentsu:\n\nTriplet mentsu:\n\nFor each suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n   for num in 1 to 9:\n\n       create a mentsu consisting of three copies of (str(num)+suit). As a set, it's just one element.\n\nWait, no. Because the triplet requires three copies, but the initial hand can have at most one. So for each triplet mentsu, the required is 2.\n\nWait, but in code, each triplet mentsu is represented as a set with one tile. So when we compute the intersection with the initial set, the count is 1 if the initial set contains that tile, else 0.\n\nSo for each triplet, the required is 3-1=2 if the initial set contains it, else 3.\n\nWait, no: if the initial set doesn't contain the triplet's tile, then count_present is 0, required is 3. So for a triplet, the required is always 2 or 3.\n\nBut wait, for a triplet, the mentsu is three copies of a tile. So to form the mentsu, the initial hand must have at least one, and then we can add two more.\n\nBut in the initial hand, the initial set can have zero or one of that tile.\n\nSo, for a triplet mentsu, the required tiles is:\n\nif initial has 0: 3\n\nelse: 2.\n\nWait, but no, because the triplet requires three copies. So if the initial has one, you need two more.\n\nYes, so for a triplet, required is 2 if the initial has one, else 3.\n\nBut wait, the initial hand is three unique tiles, so it's impossible to have more than one copy of any tile. So for a triplet, the initial can have 0 or 1 of the tile.\n\nSo for each triplet mentsu, the required is 2 if initial contains that tile, else 3.\n\nBut that's for each triplet.\n\nBut wait, the triplet is a set of three same tiles, but in code, the mentsu is represented as a set with one tile.\n\nSo, for each triplet mentsu, the required is 2 if initial_set contains that tile, else 3.\n\nBut in code, that's easy.\n\nNow, for the sequences:\n\nEach sequence is a set of three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\nFor each suit, generate all sequences from 1-2-3, up to 7-8-9.\n\nFor each such sequence, the mentsu is the set containing the three tiles.\n\nCompute the count_present as the number of tiles in the initial set that are in the sequence's set.\n\nRequired is 3 - count_present.\n\nSo, for each sequence, required can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\nNow, the code needs to:\n\n1. Read the initial three tiles.\n\ninitial = set(input().split())\n\nWait, but the input is given as a single line with three strings. So, perhaps:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\ninitial = set(tiles)\n\n2. Generate all triplet mentsu:\n\nmentsu_list = []\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for num in range(1,10):\n        mentsu = {f\"{num}{suit}\"}\n        mentsu_list.append(mentsu)\n\n3. Generate all sequence mentsu:\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for start in range(1,7+1):\n        seq = [(start), (start+1), (start+2)]\n        mentsu = set()\n        for n in seq:\n            mentsu.add(f\"{n}{suit}\")\n        mentsu_list.append(mentsu)\n\nWait, yes.\n\nNow, for each mentsu in mentsu_list, compute the count_present as len(initial & mentsu).\n\nrequired = 3 - count_present.\n\nCompute all required, find the minimal.\n\nSo, the code can loop through all mentsu in mentsu_list, compute required, keep track of the minimum.\n\nFinally, output the minimal required.\n\nBut wait, what about when the initial set already has a mentsu? Then, required is 0, which is the best possible.\n\nSo, the code should capture that.\n\nNow, testing with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSo the initial set is {'1s', '2s', '3s'}.\n\nLooking for the minimal required.\n\nFirst, triplet mentsu:\n\nFor '1s' triplet: initial has 1s, so required is 2.\n\nSimilarly for other triplets.\n\nThen, sequences:\n\nLooking at the initial set, it has 1s, 2s, 3s, which is a sequence in 's' suit. So required is 0.\n\nSo the minimal is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example in the note:\n\nThird example: initial is [3p, 9m, 2p].\n\nSo, initial set is {'3p', '9m', '2p'}.\n\nWe need to find the minimal required.\n\nLooking for sequences.\n\nPossible sequences in 'p' suit: 1-2-3, 2-3-4, etc.\n\nThe initial has 2p and 3p, so the sequence 2p,3p,4p is a candidate.\n\nCount present is 2 (2p and 3p). So required is 1.\n\nAlternatively, the sequence 1p,2p,3p: present tiles are 2p,3p. So required is 1.\n\nSo, the minimal is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: initial is three tiles, each in different suits and non-consecutive.\n\nLike '1m', '2p', '3s'.\n\nFor each sequence, none of the sequences are fully present.\n\nSo for each sequence, the required is 3.\n\nBut for triplet mentsu, each requires 2, because the initial has one tile of each suit.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nWait, but wait: for a triplet, the required is 2, but for a sequence, required is 3.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nSo the code would correctly output 2.\n\nAnother test case: initial is '1m', '1m', '1m'—but that's impossible because initial is three unique tiles. So that's not a valid input.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Are the triplet mentsu correctly generated as sets with one element.\n\nYes.\n\n- Are the sequences correctly generated.\n\nYes.\n\n- Are the initial tiles correctly handled as a set.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when the initial set has two tiles of a triplet. But the initial hand is three unique tiles, so that's impossible.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nThe code would look like:\n\nRead the three tiles.\n\nCreate initial = set(tiles).\n\nGenerate all triplet mentsu.\n\nGenerate all sequence mentsu.\n\nFor each mentsu in mentsu_list, compute required = 3 - len(initial & mentsu).\n\nFind the minimal required.\n\nOutput the minimal.\n\nSo, the code:\n\ntiles = input().split()\ninitial = set(tiles)\n\nmentsu_list = []\n\n# Add triplet mentsu\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for num in range(1, 10):\n        mentsu = {f\"{num}{suit}\"}\n        mentsu_list.append(mentsu)\n\n# Add sequence mentsu\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for start in range(1, 7 + 1):\n        mentsu = set()\n        for n in [start, start + 1, start + 2]:\n            mentsu.add(f\"{n}{suit}\")\n        mentsu_list.append(mentsu)\n\nmin_required = 4  # Max possible is 3, but initializing higher\n\nfor mentsu in mentsu_list:\n    count = len(initial.intersection(mentsu))\n    required = 3 - count\n    if required < min_required:\n        min_required = required\n\nprint(min_required)\n\nWait, but wait: the initial hand can have up to three tiles, and adding three tiles would make six, but that's unnecessary. However, in the code above, the max required is 3 (when the initial has none of the mentsu's tiles).\n\nBut the code initializes min_required to 4, which is wrong. It should initialize to 3.\n\nBecause the minimal possible is 0, so setting to 4 is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, initializing to a high value, like 4, and then finding the minimal.\n\nSo the code should:\n\nInitialize min_required to a large value, say 4.\n\nThen, for each mentsu, compute required.\n\nIf required is less than current min_required, update.\n\nAfter processing all, min_required will hold the minimal required.\n\nSo in the code, initializing min_required to 4 is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the required is 0, so the code will find it.\n\nAnother test case: initial has no mentsu.\n\nSay initial is 1m, 2p, 3s.\n\nSo for each triplet mentsu, required is 2.\n\nFor each sequence mentsu, required is 3.\n\nSo the minimal required is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nTesting with the third example:\n\nInput: '3p 9m 2p'\n\nInitial set is {'3p', '9m', '2p'}.\n\nFor the sequence 2p,3p,4p: count is 2, required 1.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nThe code will find that.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) from her initial hand of three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Mentsu Types**: A mentsu can be either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n2. **Generate All Possible Mentsu**: Enumerate all possible triplets and sequences.

Calculate the number of additional tiles needed to complete the mentsu.\n4. **Find Minimum Tiles Needed**: Track the minimum number of tiles needed across all possible mentsu.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ntiles = input().split()\ninitial = set(tiles)\n\nmentsu_list = []\n\n# Add triplet mentsu\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for num in range(1, 10):\n        mentsu = {f\"{num}{suit}\"}\n        mentsu_list.append(mentsu)\n\n# Add sequence mentsu\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for start in range(1, 7 + 1):\n        mentsu = set()\n        for n in [start, start + 1, start + 2]:\n            mentsu.add(f\"{n}{suit}\")\n        mentsu_list.append(mentsu)\n\nmin_required = 4  # Initialize with a value higher than any possible\n\nfor mentsu in mentsu_list:\n    count = len(initial.intersection(mentsu))\n    required = 3 - count\n    if required < min_required:\n        min_required = required\n\nprint(min_required)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The initial three tiles are read and stored in a set for quick lookup.\n2. **Generating Mentsu**: We generate all possible triplets and sequences. Each triplet is represented as a set containing one tile, and each sequence is represented as a set of three consecutive tiles in the same suit.\n3. **Checking Mentsu**: For each generated mentsu, we count how many of its tiles are already present in the initial set. The number of additional tiles needed is calculated as 3 minus this count.\n4. **Finding Minimum**: We keep track of the minimum number of additional tiles needed across all mentsu and print this value.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways to form a mentsu and ensures that we find the minimum number of tiles needed with optimal performance.",
