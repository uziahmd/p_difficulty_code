He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about finding the number of positive integers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeros. And then I have to output all those n's in increasing order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n, because there are usually more 2s than 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is sum of n divided by 5, plus n divided by 25, and so on until n divided by 5^k is zero.\n\nSo, for example, for n=5: 5//5 =1, 5//25=0. So total 1 zero. For n=6, same as 5, since 6//5 is 1. But for n=10, 10//5=2, 10//25=0, so 2 zeros.\n\nBut the problem is, given m, find all n such that their trailing zeros equal m. And return how many such n exist and list them.\n\nWait, but how do I find all possible n's for a given m? Because m can be up to 100,000, which isn't too bad, but I need an efficient way.\n\nI think the approach is to use binary search to find the lower and upper bounds where the number of trailing zeros equals m.\n\nLet me think: the function that counts the trailing zeros is non-decreasing as n increases. So for a given m, there might be a range of n's that have exactly m zeros.\n\nFor example, in the sample input, m is 1. The numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. All these n's give 1 trailing zero.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait 5! is 120, which has one zero. 6! is 720, also one. Similarly, 7! is 5040, 8! is 40320, 9! is 362880. All have one trailing zero. Then 10! has two, right? Because 10//5=2.\n\nSo the count for m=1 is 5 numbers (5-9 inclusive). So the output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nAnother sample input is m=5. The output is 0, meaning there are no n's whose factorial ends with exactly 5 zeros.\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is find the minimal n where the trailing zeros are >=m, and then see if any of the subsequent n's have exactly m zeros.\n\nWait, but how do I find the lower and upper bounds?\n\nI think I can use binary search to find the smallest n where the number of trailing zeros is equal to m. But wait, maybe not exactly. Because sometimes, there's a range of n's that all give the same number of zeros. So I need to find the first n where the trailing zeros is at least m, and then check if it's exactly m. Then, I can find the last n where it's still exactly m.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is:\n\n1. Find the lower bound l, which is the smallest n where the trailing zeros is >=m.\n2. Then, check if the trailing zeros of l is equal to m. If not, then there are no solutions.\n3. If it is equal, then find the upper bound u, which is the largest n where the trailing zeros is <=m.\n4. Wait, no. Wait, because once the trailing zeros reach m at l, they might stay at m for a range of n's. So I need to find the maximum n where the trailing zeros is m.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct steps are:\n\n- Use binary search to find the first n where the trailing zeros is >=m. Let's call this low.\n- Check if the trailing zeros of low is exactly m. If not, return 0.\n- Then, find the next higher n where the trailing zeros is m. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, find all n's between some start and end where the trailing zeros is m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can perform a binary search to find the minimal n where the trailing zeros is m, and then another to find the maximal n where the trailing zeros is m. Then, the numbers from min to max would all have exactly m zeros.\n\nWait, but how do I find the min and max?\n\nWait, let's say for a given m, the minimal n is the smallest n where the trailing zeros is m. Then, the maximal n is the largest n where the trailing zeros is m. So the numbers between min and max, inclusive, will all have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nBut how do I find min and max?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the min is the first n where the trailing zeros is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list all such integers \\( n \\) in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until \\( \\frac{n}{5^k} \\) becomes zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently find the range of \\( n \\) values that yield exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros, we use binary search:\n   - **Lower Bound**: Find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\).\n   - **Upper Bound**: Find the largest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeros is at most \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Check Validity**: After determining the bounds, verify if the actual count of trailing zeros at these bounds equals \\( m \\). If not, it means there are no valid \\( n \\) values for the given \\( m \\).\n\n4. **Collect Results**: If valid, collect all \\( n \\) values between the lower and upper bounds (inclusive) that yield exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m  # Initial estimate, could be adjusted\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if z < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef find_max_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m  # Initial estimate, could be adjusted\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2\n        z = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if z > m:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m = int(input_line)\n    \n    min_n = find_min_n(m)\n    max_n = find_max_n(m)\n    \n    if min_n == 0 or count_trailing_zeros(min_n) != m:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    result = []\n    for n in range(min_n, max_n + 1):\n        if count_trailing_zeros(n) == m:\n            result.append(str(n))\n    \n    k = len(result)\n    if k == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print(k)\n        print(' '.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **count_trailing_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by summing up the contributions from multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc.\n- **find_min_n Function**: Uses binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) has at least \\( m \\) trailing zeros.\n- **find_max_n Function**: Similarly uses binary search to find the largest \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) has at most \\( m \\) trailing zeros.\n- **main Function**: Orchestrates the process by reading input, determining the valid range of \\( n \\) values, and outputting the results.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring the solution is both optimal and handles large values of \\( m \\) effectively.",
