Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem statement says that Andrew and Eugene are playing a game where they manipulate a string of digits through a series of substitution queries. After processing all the queries, we need to compute the resulting number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nHmm. So the initial string is s, and each query is of the form di → ti. This means that every occurrence of digit di in the current string is replaced by ti. For example, if s is '123123' and the query is '2→00', then replacing all '2's with '00' gives '10031003'. Another example is when a query is '3→', which replaces '3's with nothing, so the string becomes '1212'.\n\nThe output should be the number represented by the final string, ignoring leading zeros unless the string is empty (which counts as zero). Then, return that number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but how do we handle multiple substitutions? Because each substitution can change the digits, which affects subsequent substitutions. So the order matters. For instance, if there are two substitutions: first replace '2's with something, then replace '3's, but the initial substitutions could have created new '2's or '3's if not careful. Oh wait, no, because each substitution is applied in the order given. So for each query, we process it in the given sequence, replacing each digit di in the current string with ti.\n\nSo the approach is to process each substitution step by step, modifying the string each time.\n\nBut wait, if we process the substitutions naively by applying each one after another, and replacing each occurrence, it could be computationally expensive, especially since the string can be up to 105 characters long, and n up to 105. But 105^2 is manageable, so perhaps a straightforward approach would work.\n\nHowever, for large numbers, we need to handle the modulo efficiently. Since the resulting string can be very long, directly converting it into a number isn't feasible because it could be up to (sum of lengths of ti per query) * 105, which could be a few thousand digits. But calculating such a huge number mod 1e9+7 isn't practical with standard methods.\n\nWait, but we don't need the actual number; we just need its value mod 1e9+7. So perhaps instead of building the entire string, we can represent the string as a mathematical expression that can be evaluated modulo 1e9+7.\n\nBut how? Let's think about it.\n\nEach substitution can be thought of as a transformation on the current representation. So, for each substitution, we can model the effect on the overall value mod MOD.\n\nLet me consider the initial string. Each character contributes a certain value multiplied by the appropriate power of 10. For example, the string \"123\" represents 1*10^2 + 2*10^1 + 3*10^0. So, the value is the sum of each digit multiplied by 10 raised to the position's exponent.\n\nWhen we perform a substitution, say replacing 'd' with 't', the effect is that every occurrence of 'd' in the current string will be replaced by 't'. So, for each 'd' in the current string, the contribution to the total value changes from d * 10^k to the sum of each digit in 't' multiplied by 10^{k'}, where k' depends on where the substitution occurs.\n\nBut this seems complicated because substitutions can create dependencies between digits. For example, if a substitution introduces a new digit that was previously not present, and there's another substitution for that new digit later on.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model this using a map that tracks for each digit what it's currently mapped to. Then, for each substitution, we update this map, and also track the current multiplier for each digit, which represents how much each digit contributes to the total value.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to represent the current string as a sum of terms, where each term is a digit multiplied by a certain power of 10. Then, each substitution modifies these terms based on the replacement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the entire process as a state, keeping track of for each digit what it expands to, and also the exponents accordingly.\n\nWait, here's an idea: We can represent the current value as a sum of terms, each being a digit multiplied by 10^power. But since the substitutions can change the digits, we need to track for each digit what it's transformed into, and also how the powers change when a substitution happens.\n\nBut this might get tricky because when a substitution replaces a digit, the surrounding digits affect the exponents. For example, if 'd' is replaced by 't', which is longer than one character, the digits before and after 'd' shift their positions, affecting their exponents.\n\nWait, maybe instead of trying to track the entire string, we can model the value as a value and a list of multipliers for each digit. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Instead of building the string, for each substitution, we can keep track of the transformation of each digit. For each digit, we can have a function that tells us what it's replaced with. Then, when computing the final value, we can traverse the initial string, apply all substitutions, and compute the number.\n\nWait, but the substitutions are applied in order. So, each substitution replaces the current digit, which may have been modified by previous substitutions.\n\nYes, so the substitution operations are applied in the given order. So, the way to model this is to process each substitution in the order given, and for each substitution, replace all occurrences of di in the current string with ti.\n\nBut if the string is built by successive substitutions, and for each substitution, we can represent the string as a list of transformations, perhaps via some kind of substitution rules.\n\nWait, but the problem is that each substitution can change the structure of the string, which affects how future substitutions are applied.\n\nSo, for example, let's say the initial string is '1234'. The first substitution is '2→ab', which transforms it to '1ab34'. The second substitution is 'a→cd', which will transform '1ab34' to '1cdd34'. So, the order of substitutions is crucial.\n\nThus, the way to model this is to process each substitution step by step, modifying the string each time. But building the string step by step could be feasible, given that the maximum length of the string is 105 and n is 105, so the maximum possible steps are manageable.\n\nOnce we have the final string, we can compute the number mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the final string can be very long—up to 105 * 105 = 11025 characters, which is manageable for processing.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n2. For each query, process it by replacing all occurrences of di with ti in the current string.\n3. After all queries, compute the numeric value of the resulting string mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that for each substitution, we have to replace all instances of di in the current string. So, for example, if a substitution is '0→5', then all '0's become '5's.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Start with the initial string s.\n- For each query in order:\n   - Extract di and ti from the query.\n   - Replace all occurrences of di in the current string with ti.\n- Once all substitutions are done, compute the numeric value of the resulting string mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut how to compute the numeric value mod 1e9+7 efficiently?\n\nWell, the string can be up to around 11025 characters long, which is manageable. To compute the number mod MOD, we can process each character from left to right, updating the result as follows:\n\nresult = (result * 10 + int(current_char)) % MOD\n\nBut wait, that's only correct if we process the string as a base-10 number, treating each digit as a higher power as we go left to right. For example, '123' is 1*100 + 2*10 + 3*1. So, processing left to right, each digit is added to the result as result = (result * 10 + digit) % MOD.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read s, n, and the n queries.\n2. Process each query in order, modifying s each time.\n3. Compute the resulting number mod 1e9+7 by processing each character of s from left to right.\n\nWait, but what about leading zeros? The problem says to ignore leading zeros, except when the string is empty, which is considered zero. So, after processing all substitutions, if the resulting string has leading zeros, they should be removed.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the third case is:\n\nInput:\n222\n2\n2->0\n0->7\n\nAfter first substitution (2→0), the string becomes 000. Then, substitution 0→7: each 0 is replaced by 7, so the string becomes 777. So the output is 777, which is 777 mod MOD.\n\nBut according to the note, leading zeros are not removed. Wait, no, the note says that leading zeros are ignored when representing the number, but the substitution process doesn't remove them. So, in the substitution steps, the string may have leading zeros, but when you convert it to a number, you treat it as the integer it represents, stripping leading zeros.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says: \"when you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.\"\n\nSo, the final string after substitutions may have leading zeros, but when converting to a number, those are ignored. For example, '000777' becomes 777.\n\nBut when the string is empty, it's zero.\n\nSo, the processing steps are:\n\n- After all substitutions, if the string is empty, output 0.\n- Otherwise, convert the string to an integer, which automatically removes leading zeros, and then take mod 1e9+7.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Process each substitution step, modifying the string s.\n2. After all substitutions, if s is empty, output 0.\n3. Else, process each character of s from left to right, computing the number mod 1e9+7, taking care of leading zeros.\n\nWait, but when processing the string, leading zeros should be stripped. So, perhaps the algorithm for computing the mod is:\n\n- Initialize result to 0.\n- For each character in s:\n   - Add the digit to the current number, considering its position.\n   - But if the digit is zero and it's the first non-zero digit encountered, skip adding any further zeros until the first non-zero digit.\n- But this can be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, after processing all substitutions, we can first strip leading zeros, then compute the mod.\n\nSo, for example, the resulting string could be '000777'. Stripping leading zeros gives '777', which is the number we need.\n\nBut when the string is '0', it's zero. If it's empty, it's zero.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- After substitutions, if s is empty: output 0.\n- Else:\n   - Strip leading zeros.\n   - If the result is empty (all zeros), output 0.\n   - Else, compute the number mod 1e9+7.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nProcess all substitutions on s.\n\nIf s is empty:\n   print 0\nElse:\n   s_stripped = s.lstrip('0')\n   if len(s_stripped) == 0:\n       print(0)\n   else:\n       num = int(s_stripped)\n       print(num % MOD)\n\nBut wait, what if the string is '0000'? Then s_stripped is empty, so output 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code needs to handle this.\n\nNow, the challenge is to process the substitutions correctly.\n\nSo, the first part is to read the initial string and process each query in order, replacing all occurrences of di with ti.\n\nIn Python, strings are immutable, so for each substitution, we need to create a new string.\n\nSo, for each query, we can split the query into di and ti. Then, for the current string, replace all occurrences of di with ti.\n\nBut wait, the di could be a single character, and ti could be any string, including empty.\n\nSo, for example, if di is '3' and ti is '', then any '3' in the string is replaced with nothing.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as:\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\nfor _ in range(n):\n    query = input().strip()\n    # parse into di and ti\n    di_part, ti_part = query.split('->')\n    di = di_part.strip()\n    ti = ti_part.strip()\n    # replace all occurrences of di in s with ti\n    s = s.replace(di, ti)\n# Now, process the resulting s\nif not s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    stripped = s.lstrip('0')\n    if not stripped:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        mod = 10**9 +7\n        res = 0\n        for c in stripped:\n            res = (res *10 + int(c)) % mod\n        print(res)\n\nWait, but wait. What if during the substitution, the replacement ti includes a digit that hasn't been processed yet? For example, suppose a substitution replaces '2' with '3', and then another substitution replaces '3' with '45'. So, in the initial substitution, '2's are replaced with '3's, and then in the next substitution, '3's are replaced with '45's. So the code as written would process the substitution steps correctly.\n\nBut wait, the code processes the substitution in the order of the queries. So, in each query, it replaces all occurrences of di in the current s with ti. So, for the first substitution, '2' is replaced with '3', making s have '3's. Then, in the next substitution, '3' is replaced with '45's, so the s now contains '45's wherever '3's were.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the code uses s.replace(di, ti) for each substitution. However, the replace method replaces all occurrences of di in the string. So, if di is '2' and ti is '3', the code correctly replaces every '2' with '3'. Then, when another substitution comes in, any '3's are replaced as per the next query.\n\nSo, the code correctly models the substitution process.\n\nWait, but let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, wait, the actual input is four lines, but the first line is s, then n, then n lines of queries.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\nFirst line: 123123\n\nSecond line: 1\n\nThird line: 2->00\n\nFourth line: 3->\n\nFifth line: 222\n\nSixth line: 2\n\nSeventh line: 2->0\n\nEighth line: 0->7\n\nNinth line: 1000000008\n\nTenth line: 0\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is written as four lines, but probably the actual input is s as '123123', n=1, then one query.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample provided is a bit confusing, but perhaps the actual input is as described.\n\nWait, the sample input seems to be:\n\nThe first line is '123123' followed by '\\n1', which is perhaps the initial string, then n=1, then one query.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at the sample input as provided in the problem statement.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is actually four lines, but perhaps it's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the sample input is:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn = 1\n\nThen, one query: '2->00'\n\nSo, after substitution, the string becomes '10031003' (since replacing '2's with '00' in '123123' gives '1' '00' '3' '123' — wait, wait, no. Wait, the original string is '123123'.\n\nReplacing '2' with '00' in '123123' would result in '1' followed by '00' (replacing the '2'), then '3', then '123' (but wait, the original string is '1','2','3','1','2','3'. So replacing '2's with '00's would make it '1' '00' '3' '1' '00' '3', which is '10031003'.\n\nThen, the next query is '3->', so replacing '3's with nothing. So the string becomes '10031003' → replacing '3's with '' → '10001003'.\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nOriginal string after first substitution: '10031003' → each '3' is replaced with empty string. So the string becomes '10001003'? Or wait, '10031003' has '3's at positions 3 and 6 (assuming 0-based index?), so replacing those '3's with empty string would result in '10001003'?\n\nWait, no. Let me write it out:\n\nOriginal s: '123123'\n\nAfter first substitution (2→00):\n\nDigits are 1,2,3,1,2,3 → replacing 2 with 00, so it becomes '1' + '00' + '3' + '1' + '00' + '3' → '10031003'.\n\nThen, the second substitution is '3→', so all '3's are replaced with empty. So '10031003' → becomes '1 00 1 00' → '100100'? Or wait, let's break it down:\n\nThe string is '1','0','0','3','1','0','0','3'.\n\nReplacing '3's with nothing:\n\nThe '3's are at positions 3 and 7 (0-based). So removing them, the string becomes '1 0 0 1 0 0' → '100100'?\n\nWait, but the sample output after the second substitution is '1212'. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the order of substitutions.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is more complex. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nThe sample input is:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, perhaps the first line is the string, then the number of queries, then each query.\n\nSo, the first line is '123123'.\n\nSecond line is 1, indicating one query.\n\nThird line is the first query: '2->00'.\n\nSo, after the first substitution, '123123' becomes '10031003'.\n\nThen, the second query is '3->' → replacing '3's with empty string, so '10031003' becomes '10001003' → no, wait, that can't be, because the sample output after the second substitution is '1212'.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is more like:\n\nThe first query is '2->00', the second is '3->', but perhaps after that, the string is '1212'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's see the sample output.\n\nSample Output:\n\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\nSo, the first substitution leads to '10031003', the second substitution leads to '1212', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial substitution is '2->00', so '123123' → '10031003'.\n\nThen, the next substitution is '3->', which replaces '3's with nothing. So, in '10031003', the '3's are at positions 3 and 7 (0-based), so replacing them with empty gives '10001003'? Or wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, '10031003' is 8 characters:\n\nIndices 0: '1'\n\n1: '0'\n\n2: '0'\n\n3: '3'\n\n4: '1'\n\n5: '0'\n\n6: '0'\n\n7: '3'\n\nSo, replacing '3's with empty string would give '1','0','0', (skipping '3'), then '1','0','0' (skipping '3'). So the resulting string is '100100' → '100100'.\n\nBut the sample output says '1212' after the second substitution.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the substitution process.\n\nWait, perhaps the substitution is applied to the entire string, but in the second substitution, it's '3->', so the '3's in the string after the first substitution are replaced.\n\nWait, in the first substitution, '2's are replaced with '00's, so the string becomes '10031003'.\n\nThen, the second substitution is '3->', which replaces all '3's with nothing. So '10031003' → '10001003'? No, that's not matching the sample.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the substitution steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the second substitution is '3→', which is supposed to replace '3's with nothing. So, the string after substitution is '10031003' → replacing '3's with nothing: '100' + '1' '00' → '100100'? Or wait, perhaps the substitution is applied to the initial string, not the modified one.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about how the code would handle the sample.\n\nIn the code I wrote earlier, for each substitution, the code does s = s.replace(di, ti).\n\nSo, in the first substitution, '2' is replaced with '00', so '123123' becomes '10031003'.\n\nIn the second substitution, '3' is replaced with ''. So '10031003' becomes '10031003'.replace('3', '') → '10001003'.\n\nBut the sample output after the second substitution is '1212'.\n\nHmm, that suggests that my code is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is different. Maybe the sample input is:\n\ns = '222'\n\nn = 2\n\nqueries:\n\n2→0\n\n0→7\n\nSo, the initial string is '222'.\n\nFirst substitution: replace '2's with '0's → '000'.\n\nSecond substitution: replace '0's with '7's → '777'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output's third step.\n\nSo, perhaps the code is correct, but the way substitutions are processed is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the code is correct.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, why does the second substitution lead to '1212'?\n\nAh, perhaps the sample is more involved.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nSample Input:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn=1\n\nquery: '2->00'\n\nSo, the string becomes '10031003'.\n\nSample Output after first substitution is '10031003'.\n\nThen, the next substitution is '3->', so replacing '3's with nothing. So '10031003' becomes '10001003'.\n\nBut the sample output after the second substitution is '1212'.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the second substitution is not part of the same sample, but perhaps I'm looking at the wrong sample.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should focus on writing the code correctly, regardless of the sample.\n\nWait, perhaps the code as written is correct, and the sample is just part of the problem description.\n\nSo, the code reads the initial string, processes each substitution in order, replacing all occurrences of di with ti, then computes the resulting number mod 1e9+7.\n\nThus, the code would process the substitution correctly.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn=1\n\nquery: '2->00'\n\nResulting s: '10031003'\n\nCompute the number: 10031003 mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut 10031003 is less than 1e9+7, so the output is 10031003.\n\nWhich matches the first sample output.\n\nWait, but the sample output shows '10031003', then '1212', etc. So perhaps the sample is showing the steps.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: the third sample.\n\nSample Input:\n\ns = '222'\n\nn=2\n\nQueries:\n\n2→0\n\n0→7\n\nProcessing:\n\nAfter first substitution, s becomes '000'.\n\nSecond substitution: replace '0's with '7's → '777'.\n\nCompute 777 mod MOD is 777.\n\nWhich matches the third sample output.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: when s is '0', and n=0.\n\nThen, after processing, s is '0', stripped to '' → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: s='10', n=1, query '0→5'.\n\nResulting s is '15'.\n\nCompute 15 mod MOD is 15.\n\nSo, the code handles that.\n\nWhat about leading zeros after substitution?\n\nFor example, s='000', n=1, query '0→5' → s becomes '555', which is 555.\n\nIf the substitution is '0→0', then s remains '000' → stripped to 0 → output 0.\n\nSo, the code correctly handles leading zeros.\n\nThus, the code seems to be correct.\n\nBut wait, what about the substitution 'd' being replaced by an empty string, which could cause the string to be empty.\n\nFor example, s='3', n=1, query '3→' → s becomes empty. Output is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n1. The substitution is case-sensitive. The problem statement says di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9). So, the code correctly uses di as a single character.\n\n2. The substitution is applied in the order of the queries. The code correctly processes each query in sequence.\n\n3. The substitution replaces all occurrences of di in the current string, not just the first occurrence. The replace() function in Python does that.\n\n4. The code correctly handles the stripping of leading zeros.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nThus, the plan is to implement this logic in Python.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nRead s.\n\nRead n.\n\nFor each of the n queries:\n\n   Split the query into di and ti.\n\n   Replace all occurrences of di in s with ti.\n\nAfter all substitutions, process s:\n\n   If s is empty, output 0.\n\n   Else, strip leading zeros.\n\n      If the result is empty, output 0.\n\n      Else, compute the number mod 1e9+7.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in the code, when reading the input, the first line is s, then the second line is n, then n lines of queries.\n\nBut in the sample input, it's written as:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', ...]\n\nWhich seems to suggest that the first line is the entire initial string, including newline characters.\n\nBut in reality, the first line is the initial string s, which can contain any digits, including newlines? No, because the input is given as a string, so the initial s is a single line.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is provided as a list of lines, where the first element is the initial string s, then the second is n, then the next n elements are the queries.\n\nBut in practice, when running the code, the input is read from stdin, which can be handled via input() functions.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    query = input().strip()\n\n    di, ti = query.split('->')\n\n    s = s.replace(di, ti)\n\nThen, process s as described.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn=1\n\nquery: '2->00'\n\ns becomes '10031003'\n\nCompute 10031003 mod 1e9+7 → 10031003.\n\nSample Output: 10031003.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\ns = '222'\n\nn=2\n\nqueries: '2->0' and '0->7'\n\nAfter first substitution: '000'\n\nAfter second substitution: '777'\n\nCompute 777 mod 1e9+7 → 777.\n\nSample Output: 777.\n\nAnother test case: s = '3', n=1, query '3→', s becomes empty. Output 0.\n\nAnother test case: s = '0', n=0, output 0.\n\nAnother test case: s = '0', n=1, query '0→5' → s becomes '5', output 5.\n\nAnother test case: s = '10', n=1, query '0→5' → '15', output 15.\n\nAnother test case: s = '1000000008', n=0 → output 1000000008 mod 1e9+7 → 1000000008 - 1e9+7 = 1e9+7 is 1000000007, so 1000000008 mod 1e9+7 is 1.\n\nWhich matches the last sample output.\n\nThus, the code should handle all these cases correctly.\n\nHence, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on an initial string of digits and then compute the resulting number modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). The substitutions are applied in the given order, and each substitution replaces all occurrences of a specific digit with another string. After processing all queries, the resulting string is converted to a number, ignoring leading zeros, and then taken modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the initial string and the number of queries.\n2. **Process Queries**: For each query, replace all occurrences of the specified digit in the current string with the given replacement string.\n3. **Compute Result**: Convert the final string to a number, ignoring leading zeros, and compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    query = input().strip()\n    di, ti = query.split('->')\n    s = s.replace(di, ti)\n\nif not s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    stripped = s.lstrip('0')\n    if not stripped:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        result = 0\n        for c in stripped:\n            result = (result * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n        print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from the input.\n2. **Processing Queries**: Each query is processed by splitting it into the digit to be replaced (`di`) and its replacement string (`ti`). The current string `s` is updated by replacing all occurrences of `di` with `ti`.\n3. **Handling Empty String**: If the resulting string `s` is empty after processing all queries, the result is 0.\n4. **Stripping Leading Zeros**: Leading zeros are removed from the resulting string to form the actual number.\n5. **Modulo Calculation**: The resulting number is computed digit by digit, applying the modulo operation at each step to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that all substitutions are correctly applied in sequence and efficiently computes the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).",
