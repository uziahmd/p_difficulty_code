He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Check the string,\" and from the description, it seems a bit tricky but manageable.\n\nHmm, let me read the problem again. So, the string is built in three steps: first by A adding 'a's, then B adding 'b's, and finally C adding 'c's. The conditions are that after each step, certain things must be true.\n\nWait, the process is:\n1. A creates a string with some 'a's. So the initial string has only 'a's, but it's possible that there are multiple.\n2. B appends some 'b's. So now the string has 'a's followed by 'b's, but both counts are at least 1.\n3. C appends 'c's. The number of 'c's must equal the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before C adds them. And also, it's allowed for the count to equal both.\n\nSo, given a string S, I need to check whether it could have been formed through these steps.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the string. It should consist of a sequence of 'a's, followed by 'b's, followed by 'c's. Because each step appends the next letter. So any deviation from this order would make the string invalid.\n\nSo first, the string must be in the form a^+ b^+ c^+, right? Like all the 'a's come first, then 'b's, then 'c's.\n\nSo the first condition is that the string doesn't have any characters out of order. For example, if after the 'a's there's a 'c' before any 'b's, that's invalid.\n\nSecond, the counts must satisfy certain conditions. Let's break it down:\n\nAfter A adds 'a's, the count of 'a's is a_count. Then B adds 'b's, so the count of 'b's is b_count >=1. Then C adds 'c's, which must be equal to either a_count or b_count.\n\nBut wait, when C adds 'c's, the total 'c's added is equal to the current a_count or b_count. So the total c_count is either equal to the a_count (before C appends) or the b_count (before C appends). But since C appends, the a_count and b_count are fixed; C's addition is based on those.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: the string before C appends is a_str + b_str. The a_str has a_count 'a's, the b_str has b_count 'b's. So when C appends, he can add either a_count or b_count 'c's. So the total c_count is either a_count or b_count.\n\nSo the overall structure is:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's in S\ncount_b = number of 'b's in S\ncount_c = number of 'c's in S\n\nThen, count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nWait, but wait: the count_a is the number of 'a's in the entire string, because A added all the 'a's, then B added 'b's, then C added 'c's. So the count_a is exactly the number of 'a's in the string, same for count_b and count_c.\n\nSo yes, the condition is count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says that the number of letters C appends is equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string. So when C appends, the string before appending has a_count 'a's and b_count 'b's. So the number of 'c's added is either a_count or b_count. Therefore, the total count_c is a_count + (if a_count was chosen, then 0? Wait, no. Wait, the 'c's are appended, so the count_c is equal to a_count or b_count. Because C adds exactly that many 'c's.\n\nWait, no. Because the existing string before C's step has a_count 'a's and b_count 'b's. C appends 'c's equal to either a_count or b_count. So the total count_c is equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nFor example, if a_count is 3, b_count is 2, then count_c could be 3 or 2.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. The string is in the form a^+ b^+ c^+.\n2. count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nBut wait, what about the cases where a_count and b_count are zero? No, because the problem says that after B appends, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So a_count and b_count are both at least 1.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Check the order: the string must start with one or more 'a's, then one or more 'b's, then one or more 'c's.\n\nIf the order is not correct, output NO.\n\nElse, compute count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\nCheck if count_c equals count_a or count_b.\n\nIf both conditions are met, output YES. Else, NO.\n\nWait, but what about when the string has all a's? Then B hasn't done anything, but according to the problem statement, both A and B ensure that at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist. So such a string can't be valid.\n\nSimilarly, if the string has all a's and b's, then C hasn't added any 'c's, but the problem says C appends some 'c's. So count_c must be >=1.\n\nWait, the problem says that C appends \"some number of letters 'c'\". So count_c must be at least 1.\n\nSo, another condition: count_c >=1.\n\nAnd also, since C appends, the string must have a's, then b's, then c's. So all three parts must be present.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Check the order: the string must consist of some a's, followed by some b's, then some c's. So, no 'a' comes after a 'b' or 'c', same for 'b's and 'c's.\n\nTo do this, we can split the string into runs. Each run is a group of same characters.\n\nThe runs must be a's, then b's, then c's. All three runs must exist, and each run is non-empty.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- 'aabbbcc' is okay: runs are a, b, c.\n\n- 'aaabbbc' is okay: runs a, b, c.\n\n- 'aaabbb' is not okay because no c's.\n\n- 'aaaabbbbc' is okay.\n\n- 'aaabcb' is not okay because after a comes b, then c, but then b comes again, which breaks the order.\n\nSo the first step is to verify the ordering.\n\n2. Once the order is confirmed, compute count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\n3. Check that count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\n4. Also, count_c must be >=1.\n\nAdditionally, count_a and count_b must be >=1 because after B appends, the string must have at least one a and one b.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nConditions:\n\n- The string is composed of a run of a's, then a run of b's, then a run of c's. All three runs are non-empty.\n\n- count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\n- count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nIf all these are true, output YES. Else, NO.\n\nSo, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, parse the input string.\n\nThen, split the string into runs. For example, for 'aaabccc', the runs are ['a', 'a', 'a'], then 'b's, then 'c's.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to iterate through the string and track the current character and the groups.\n\nAlternatively, we can use regular expressions to find all the runs.\n\nHmm, perhaps using the re module. We can write a regex that captures the runs.\n\nLike, using findall(r'(a+|b+|c+)', s), but that might not work because it'll split into individual runs.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern r'(a+b+c+)' isn't helpful. Maybe it's better to find all the runs as a list of tuples indicating the character and their count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a function that processes the string and returns the list of runs.\n\nLet me think about writing a helper function to get the runs.\n\nFor example:\n\ndef get_runs(s):\n    runs = []\n    if not s:\n        return runs\n    current_char = s[0]\n    count = 1\n    for c in s[1:]:\n        if c == current_char:\n            count +=1\n        else:\n            runs.append( (current_char, count) )\n            current_char = c\n            count = 1\n    runs.append( (current_char, count) )\n    return runs\n\nSo, for 'aaabccc', the runs would be [('a',3), ('b',1), ('c',3)].\n\nThen, we can check the runs:\n\n- The runs must be exactly three: a, b, c.\n\nSo len(runs) == 3.\n\n- The first run is a, second is b, third is c.\n\nSo runs[0][0] == 'a', runs[1][0] == 'b', runs[2][0] == 'c'.\n\nIf this is not the case, then the string is invalid.\n\nAlso, each run must have a count >=1.\n\nOnce the runs are validated, we can compute the counts:\n\ncount_a = runs[0][1]\n\ncount_b = runs[1][1]\n\ncount_c = runs[2][1]\n\nNow, check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nAlso, check that count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc'\n\nRuns: a:3, b:1, c:3.\n\ncount_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3.\n\ncount_c equals count_a, so condition satisfied.\n\nThus, output YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc'\n\nWait, the string is 'bbacc'? Or is the input given as a list? Oh, no, looking back, the input is a single string. Oh, wait the sample input shows ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'], but probably that's a formatting thing.\n\nWait, the problem says the first line consists of a string S. So for the second sample, S is 'bbacc'.\n\nSo, 'bbacc' — let's process it.\n\nProcessing the string:\n\nIt starts with 'b's, then 'a's, then 'c's, then 'c's again. So the runs are b:2, a:1, c:2.\n\nSo len(runs) is 3, but the order is b, a, c — which is incorrect. So the runs are not a, b, c in order. So condition fails, output NO.\n\nThird sample: 'aabc' — wait, no, wait the sample input is ['aabc']?\n\nWait, maybe the sample input is a list of test cases, but in reality, it's a single string. So for the third sample, let's say the input is 'aabc'.\n\nWait, 'aabc' is a string that starts with 'a's, then 'a's again, but then 'b's, then 'c's. So the runs would be a:2, b:1, c:1.\n\nWait, the string is 'aabc' — it's 'aa' followed by 'b' and 'c', but that's not correct. Or wait, 'aabc' is 'a','a','b','c' — so the runs are a:2, b:1, c:1. So the runs are in order a, b, c — good. So len(runs) is 3, and in order.\n\nThen count_a =2, count_b=1, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c is 1, which is equal to count_b (1). So condition satisfied. Thus, output YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abba' — the runs are a:1, b:2, a:1. So len(runs) is 3, but the third run is a, which is not c. So condition fails.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' — runs are a:1, b:1, c:1. So count_c is 1, which is equal to a and b. So condition is satisfied. Output YES.\n\nWhat about 'acb' — runs are a:1, c:1, b:1. So order is wrong, so condition fails.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' — runs a:2, b:2, c:1. count_c is 1. Is 1 equal to 2 or 2? No. So condition fails. Output NO.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nWe need to read a string S, process it.\n\nFirst, check that the runs are a, b, c, each run non-zero.\n\nImplement the runs checking.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead S.\n\nIf S is empty: impossible, but according to constraints, |S| >=1.\n\nCompute the runs.\n\nIf the runs are not exactly 3, or the first is not a, second not b, third not c → output NO.\n\nElse, compute count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\nCheck that count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nCheck count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nIf all conditions met → YES, else NO.\n\nSo, code-wise.\n\nImplementing the runs function as earlier.\n\nSo, let's write the code.\n\nTesting for runs.\n\nNow, in Python, the code will be:\n\nimport sys\n\ns = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n# Function to get runs\ndef get_runs(s):\n    if not s:\n        return []\n    runs = []\n    current = s[0]\n    count = 1\n    for c in s[1:]:\n        if c == current:\n            count +=1\n        else:\n            runs.append( (current, count) )\n            current = c\n            count = 1\n    runs.append( (current, count) )\n    return runs\n\nruns = get_runs(s)\n\n# Check runs\nif len(runs) !=3:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    a, b, c = runs[0], runs[1], runs[2]\n    if a[0] != 'a' or b[0] != 'b' or c[0] != 'c':\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        count_a = a[1]\n        count_b = b[1]\n        count_c = c[1]\n        if count_a <1 or count_b <1 or count_c <1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        elif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is just 'acbc' — no, the runs would be a:1, c:1, b:1, c:1. So len(runs) is 4, which is invalid.\n\nYes, so code correctly handles that.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → runs are a:1, b:1 → len(runs) is 2 → output NO.\n\nTest case: 'abc' → runs are a:1, b:1, c:1 → all conditions met.\n\nAnother edge case: 'aabb' → runs a:2, b:2 → len(runs) is 2 → output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbc' → runs a:2, b:2, c:1 → count_c is 1, which is neither 2 nor 2. So condition fails → output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbbccc' → runs a:3, b:3, c:3. count_c is 3, which equals a and b. So condition holds → YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbbccc' → a:2, b:3, c:3 → count_c is 3, which is equal to b (3). So condition holds → YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbbc' → a:3, b:3, c:1 → count_c is 1, which is neither 3 nor 3 → NO.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → a:1, b:3, c:1 → count_c is 1, which equals a. So condition holds → YES.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nWait, but what about the string 'abba'? The runs would be a:1, b:2, a:1. So len(runs) is 3, but the third run is a, not c → code correctly outputs NO.\n\nSo, the code should handle all the cases correctly.\n\nI think this should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations. The string is constructed in three steps: appending 'a's, then 'b's, and finally 'c's with the count of 'c's equal to either the count of 'a's or 'b's. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Order Check**: The string must be in the form of consecutive 'a's followed by consecutive 'b's and then consecutive 'c's. This means the string should be divided into three runs where each run consists of a single character repeated.\n2. **Count Check**: After verifying the order, we need to check the counts of each character:\n   - The count of 'c's must be equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's.\n   - Each of 'a', 'b', and 'c' must appear at least once in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef get_runs(s):\n    if not s:\n        return []\n    runs = []\n    current = s[0]\n    count = 1\n    for c in s[1:]:\n        if c == current:\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            runs.append((current, count))\n            current = c\n            count = 1\n    runs.append((current, count))\n    return runs\n\ns = input().strip()\nruns = get_runs(s)\n\nif len(runs) != 3:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    a_char, b_char, c_char = runs[0][0], runs[1][0], runs[2][0]\n    if a_char != 'a' or b_char != 'b' or c_char != 'c':\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        count_a, count_b, count_c = runs[0][1], runs[1][1], runs[2][1]\n        if count_a < 1 or count_b < 1 or count_c < 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        elif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Runs Extraction**: The function `get_runs` processes the string to extract runs of consecutive characters. Each run is represented as a tuple containing the character and its count.\n2. **Order Validation**: After extracting runs, we check if there are exactly three runs and if they follow the order 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n3. **Count Validation**: We ensure that each character count is at least 1 and that the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the structure and the counts of the string, ensuring all constraints are met.",
