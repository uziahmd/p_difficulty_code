You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vitaly and Cycle.\" Hmm, I need to find the minimum number of edges to add to a graph to form an odd-length cycle (more than one vertex) and also count the number of ways to do this. \n\nAlright, let's break it down. The input is an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges. No loops or parallel edges. The output should be two numbers: t is the minimum edges to add, and w is the number of ways.\n\nFirst, I think about what constitutes a simple cycle here. A cycle where each vertex appears exactly once, and the length is odd. So for example, a triangle is a 3-length cycle, which is odd. A pentagon would be 5, etc.\n\nWhat's the approach here? Well, the key is to find connected components in the graph. Because adding edges within a component can form cycles, but we need to make sure it's an odd-length cycle.\n\nWait, but wait. Maybe each connected component contributes differently. For example, if a component is already a tree, then adding some edges could create a cycle. But only if certain conditions are met.\n\nLet me think. For a connected component, if it's a tree, then any edge added between two nodes that form a unique path in the tree will create a cycle. The length of the cycle is the number of edges in the path plus one (since adding that edge creates a loop). So for a tree, the minimal cycle is of length 2 plus the length of the path, but wait, no— wait, when you add an edge between two nodes u and v, the cycle formed is the path from u to v in the tree plus the new edge. So the length of the cycle is (number of edges on the path between u and v) + 1.\n\nSo for a tree, the minimal cycle you can form is when u and v are adjacent in the tree, creating a cycle of length 3. Because the path between them is just one edge. Adding another edge between them would create a cycle of length 3.\n\nWait no, wait. If u and v are connected by a single edge, adding another edge between them would create a cycle of length 2? Wait, no. Because in an undirected graph, each edge is counted once. So if you have two edges between u and v, that's a multi-edge, which isn't allowed. Oh right, the problem says no parallel edges or loops. So adding an edge between u and v is possible only once. So if u and v are already connected, adding an edge between them is not allowed.\n\nAh, right. So in a connected component that's a tree, any edge added between two nodes that aren't already connected by an edge will create a cycle. The minimal cycle is formed by adding an edge between two nodes that form a path of length 1 (i.e., are adjacent), thus creating a cycle of length 3.\n\nWait, no. Because if u and v are already connected by an edge, adding another edge between them is not allowed. So to create a cycle, the added edge must connect two nodes that are not directly connected but are part of a path that allows forming a cycle.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think differently.\n\nFor each connected component, I need to determine whether it's possible to form an odd cycle by adding edges. And how many edges are needed.\n\nHmm. Let me think about the cases.\n\nCase 1: The component is already has an odd cycle.\n\nIn this case, t is zero because no edges need to be added. Also, the number of ways is 1, since we can choose any existing cycle.\n\nWait no. Because the existing cycle might have multiple options. Or wait, if the component itself is a cycle, then adding zero edges is sufficient. So in that case, t is zero, w is 1.\n\nBut wait, the problem requires that the cycle consists of more than one vertex. So a cycle of length 3 is acceptable.\n\nCase 2: The component is a tree.\n\nIn a tree, there are no cycles. So to form a cycle, we need to add at least one edge.\n\nWhat's the minimal number of edges to add?\n\nWell, the minimal cycle in a tree can be formed by adding an edge between two nodes that are connected via a path. The minimal cycle is when the path is as small as possible. The smallest possible cycle is 3, which requires adding one edge between two nodes that are at distance 2 apart in the tree.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if I have a path u - a - v in the tree, adding an edge between u and v would create a cycle of length 3: u-a-v-u.\n\nSo to form a 3-cycle, I need to find a pair of nodes u and v such that their path is of length 2, i.e., they are at even distance. Then adding an edge between u and v would create a cycle.\n\nWait, no. The distance between u and v is the number of edges on the shortest path between them. So in the above example, the distance is 2. Adding an edge between u and v would create a cycle of length 3.\n\nSo for a tree, the minimal number of edges to add is 1. And the number of ways is the number of such possible pairs (u, v) in the tree.\n\nWait, but wait. The tree is a connected acyclic graph. So any two nodes have a unique path between them. So for each pair of nodes (u, v), adding an edge between them will create a cycle whose length is equal to the distance between u and v plus one.\n\nSo to find the minimal t, we need to find the minimal possible cycle length, which is 3, achieved by adding an edge between any two nodes at distance 2.\n\nSo for each tree, the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is the number of pairs of nodes at distance 2.\n\nWait, but in a tree, the number of such pairs can be calculated. How?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to compute the number of ways is based on the number of possible edges that can be added to form a 3-cycle.\n\nWait, but how do I find the number of possible edges that can be added to form a 3-cycle in a tree.\n\nAnother approach: For each node, look for its children. For each child, consider the subtrees. Maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, for each edge in the tree, the two nodes connected by it have other branches. Adding an edge between any two nodes that are in different subtrees of the current edge would form a cycle.\n\nWait, maybe that's a way to model it.\n\nWait, for each edge e = (u, v), imagine removing e from the tree. Then, u and v become disconnected, but each has their own subtrees. The number of pairs (a, b) where a is in one subtree and b is in another is equal to the product of the sizes of the subtrees. Each such pair (a, b) can be connected by adding an edge between them, which would form a cycle of length 3 (since the path from a to b is through u and v, which is 2 edges, plus the new edge makes 3).\n\nSo for each edge e, the number of possible edges that can be added to form a 3-cycle is s * (size_of_subtree_u - s) * (size_of_subtree_v - ...). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, for each edge, the number of such possible edges is the product of the sizes of the two resulting trees if that edge is removed.\n\nWait, suppose the edge connects u and v, and after removing it, the tree splits into two parts: one with size s and the other with size (n - s). Then, the number of possible edges that can be added between these two parts is s * (n - s). Because any node in the first part and any node in the second part can be connected.\n\nEach such addition would create a cycle of length 3.\n\nSo for each edge, the contribution to the number of ways is s*(n-s). Summing over all edges gives the total number of ways.\n\nWait, but wait. Because for each edge, the number of possible edges we can add is s*(n-s). So for each edge, the number of possible edges is s*(n-s), but each such possible edge is an option that, when added, forms a 3-cycle.\n\nBut wait, that's the number of edges that can be added to form a 3-cycle. However, each such edge corresponds to a unique 3-cycle.\n\nSo for a tree, the number of ways to form a 3-cycle is the sum over all edges of s*(n-s), where s is the size of one of the subtrees when that edge is removed.\n\nBut wait, in a tree, each edge, when removed, partitions the tree into exactly two subtrees. So for each edge, the sizes of the two subtrees are s and (n-s). So for each edge, the number of possible edges we can add to form a 3-cycle is s*(n-s). So the total number of ways is the sum of s*(n-s) for all edges in the tree.\n\nTherefore, for a tree component, t=1, and w is the sum of s*(n-s) for each edge in the tree.\n\nWait, but wait. What about if the component has multiple trees? Like, if the graph is disconnected, each component is considered separately.\n\nNo, each component is treated separately. So for each component, if it's a tree, then t is 1, and w is the sum over all edges in that component of s*(n-s), where n is the size of the component, and s is the size of the subtree when that edge is removed.\n\nWait, but in a component, n is fixed. So for each edge in the component, when you split the component into two parts, the product is s*(component_size - s).\n\nSo for the entire component, the sum is the sum of s*(k - s) for each edge, where k is the component size.\n\nHmm.\n\nCase 3: The component has a cycle already, but it's even length.\n\nIn this case, can we form an odd cycle by adding edges?\n\nWait, the problem is to find the minimal t edges to add to form an odd cycle.\n\nIf the component already has a cycle, but it's even length, adding edges may allow us to form an odd cycle.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to see whether the component has any possibility to form an odd cycle.\n\nWait, but the initial component may have cycles of even length. Adding edges can create new cycles, including possibly an odd-length one.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to look at the parity of the number of edges in each connected component.\n\nWait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the bipartition of the graph.\n\nWait, in a bipartite graph, all cycles are of even length. So if a connected component is bipartite, then any cycle in it is even. So in that case, to form an odd cycle, we need to add edges in a way that breaks the bipartition.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, if the component is bipartite, then it's impossible to form an odd cycle without adding some edges.\n\nWait, no. Because adding edges can introduce odd cycles. For example, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition.\n\nWait, let's think: if a graph is bipartite, with partitions A and B. Suppose A has at least two nodes, and B has at least two nodes. Adding an edge between two nodes in A would create an odd-length cycle. Because the path from u to v in the bipartition is even (since it's a bipartite graph), adding an edge would create a cycle of length 1 (if u and v are adjacent) but that's a multi-edge, which is not allowed. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, no. Because the graph initially doesn't have any edges between nodes in the same partition except those in the original graph.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently.\n\nIf a connected component is bipartite, then any cycle in it is even. So to form an odd cycle, we need to add edges in such a way that the component is no longer bipartite.\n\nWait, but adding edges can create an odd cycle even if the component is bipartite.\n\nFor example, suppose in a bipartite graph, you add an edge between two nodes that are in the same partition. Then, the graph is no longer bipartite, and there exists an odd-length cycle.\n\nSo for example, the graph is bipartitioned into A and B. Suppose u is in A, v is in A. There is no edge between u and v. Adding such an edge would create a cycle of length 1 (but that's a loop, which is not allowed). Wait, no, because in an undirected graph, adding an edge between u and v, which were previously not connected, would create a cycle if there's a path between them. But if u and v are in the same partition and not connected before, adding an edge between them would create a cycle of length 2, which is even. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if u and v are in the same partition and there's a path between them in the bipartite graph, then adding an edge between them would create a cycle whose length is the length of the path plus 1. So if the path is even, then the cycle is odd.\n\nAh, yes! So for example, if u and v are in the same partition, and the shortest path between them is of even length, then adding an edge between them would create a cycle of odd length.\n\nSo in a bipartite component, to form an odd cycle, we can add an edge between two nodes in the same partition that are at even distance apart.\n\nSo the minimal number of edges to add is 1.\n\nThe number of ways depends on the number of such pairs (u, v) where u and v are in the same partition and their distance is even.\n\nWait, but how to compute that efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a bipartite component, the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is the number of edges that can be added to create a 3-cycle.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to consider each connected component and determine:\n\n- Whether the component is bipartite or not.\n\nBecause if the component is not bipartite, it already contains an odd cycle.\n\nWait, yes. Because if a graph is not bipartite, it contains an odd-length cycle.\n\nSo for each connected component:\n\nIf it's not bipartite: then t=0, w=1.\n\nElse:\n\nIf the component is a tree: t=1, w is the sum over all edges of s*(k-s), where k is the component size and s is the size of one subtree when the edge is removed.\n\nIf the component is already a cycle but even-length: then adding 1 edge to make it have an odd cycle. But wait, no, because adding an edge would create a cycle, but I'm not sure how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in a bipartite component, the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is the number of possible edges that can be added to form an odd cycle.\n\nSo for each connected component:\n\n- If the component is non-bipartite: then it's already possible to form an odd cycle, so t=0, w=1.\n\n- Else:\n\n   - If the component is a tree: t=1, w is sum of s*(k-s) for each edge.\n\n   - Else if the component has cycles but is bipartite (like a cycle of even length): then to form an odd cycle, we need to add 1 edge. The number of ways is the number of possible edges that can be added to create an odd cycle.\n\nWait, but how to compute that.\n\nWait, for a bipartite component that is not a tree, like a cycle of even length, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition at even distance will create an odd cycle.\n\nIn the case of a single cycle of even length, say 4, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition (say, two opposite nodes) will create a 3-length cycle.\n\nWait, no. Let me draw it.\n\nImagine a square: nodes 1-2-3-4-1.\n\nPartition A: 1, 3; Partition B: 2,4.\n\nAdding an edge between 1 and 3 would create a triangle 1-2-3-1, which is a 3-length cycle.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the number of ways is the number of such pairs (u, v) in the same partition and at even distance.\n\nWait, but how to calculate that for a general bipartite component.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I need to think about the number of possible edges that can be added to create an odd cycle in a bipartite component.\n\nWait, in a bipartite component, any edge that connects two nodes in the same partition can potentially create an odd cycle, provided that there's a path between them of even length.\n\nWait, but adding such an edge will create a cycle whose length is the path length plus one. So if the path is even, adding the edge will create a cycle of odd length.\n\nSo for each edge (u, v), if u and v are in the same partition, and the shortest path between them is even, then adding this edge will create an odd cycle.\n\nBut how many such edges exist?\n\nAlternatively, for a bipartite component, the number of such possible edges is the number of pairs (u, v) in the same partition where the distance between u and v is even.\n\nBut calculating this for each component is tricky.\n\nWait, but in a bipartite graph, the distance between two nodes in the same partition is always even, because the graph is bipartitioned into two sets, and any path from u to v must alternate between the sets. So the distance is even if u and v are in the same partition.\n\nWait, no. Because if u and v are in the same partition, the distance is even.\n\nWait, yes, because the number of steps from u to v must be even since each step changes the partition.\n\nSo for any two nodes in the same partition, their distance is even.\n\nSo any edge (u, v) in the same partition, when added, will create a cycle of length equal to the distance plus 1, which is odd.\n\nSo for a bipartite component, the number of possible edges that can be added to form an odd cycle is equal to the number of edges that connect nodes in the same partition.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the existing edges in the graph are already in the same or different partitions.\n\nWait, in a bipartite graph, edges only go between different partitions. So any existing edge is between A and B.\n\nSo the edges that can be added to connect nodes within the same partition are not present in the initial graph.\n\nSo for a bipartite component, the number of possible edges that can be added to form an odd cycle is the number of possible edges that connect two nodes in the same partition.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, the problem allows adding any number of edges, but the minimal t is 1.\n\nSo the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is the number of possible edges that can be added to create an odd cycle.\n\nBut in a bipartite component, any edge added between two nodes in the same partition will create an odd cycle.\n\nSo the number of ways is the number of possible edges that connect two nodes in the same partition.\n\nWait, but how to compute that.\n\nWait, the component is bipartitioned into A and B. Let |A| = a, |B| = b.\n\nThe maximum possible number of edges that can connect A and A is C(a, 2). Similarly for B. But in reality, the component may have some existing edges that connect A and B, but adding edges between A and A is allowed.\n\nSo the number of possible edges that can be added is (a choose 2) + (b choose 2).\n\nWait, but no, because the component may have multiple connected components. Wait, no, we're considering a single connected component.\n\nWait, no, for a connected bipartite component, a and b are the sizes of the two partitions.\n\nSo the number of possible edges that can be added between nodes in A is a*(a-1)/2, and similarly for B.\n\nBut wait, in the initial graph, some edges may already exist between nodes in A and B, but none between A-A or B-B.\n\nSo the number of possible edges that can be added between A-A is a choose 2 minus the number of existing edges between A-A (which is zero). Similarly for B.\n\nSo the total possible edges that can be added is (a*(a-1)/2) + (b*(b-1)/2).\n\nBut that's only if the component is connected. Because if the component is not connected, but it's bipartite, then each connected component is handled separately.\n\nSo for each connected bipartite component, the number of possible edges that can be added to form an odd cycle is (a choose 2) + (b choose 2).\n\nThus, the number of ways is (a*(a-1)/2) + (b*(b-1)/2).\n\nBut wait, in the case where the component is a tree, which is bipartite, the number of edges that can be added is the sum over all edges of s*(k-s), where k is the component size and s is the size of one subtree when the edge is removed.\n\nSo for each connected component:\n\n- If it's not bipartite: t=0, w=1.\n\n- Else:\n\n   - If it's a tree: t=1, w is the sum of s*(k-s) for each edge in the component.\n\n   - Else (it's a bipartite graph with cycles): t=1, w is (a choose 2) + (b choose 2), where a and b are the sizes of the two partitions.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\n1. For each connected component in the graph:\n\n   a. Check if it's bipartite.\n\n   b. If it's not bipartite, then for t, we have 0 edges to add, and w=1.\n\n   c. Else, it's bipartite:\n\n      i. If the component is a tree: t is 1, and w is the sum of s*(k-s) for each edge in the component.\n\n      ii. Else: t is 1, w is (a choose 2) + (b choose 2), where a and b are the sizes of the two partitions.\n\n2. After processing all components, sum up the contributions to t and w.\n\nWait, no. Because for each component, the minimal t for that component is either 0, 1, or something else? Or perhaps not.\n\nWait, the problem is to find the minimal t across all components, but also the sum of ways across all components that contribute to the minimal t.\n\nWait, no. Because the overall graph needs to have at least one cycle of odd length, consisting of more than one vertex.\n\nSo, for each component, the minimal t to form an odd cycle in that component is computed, and then the overall t is the minimum across all components' t. Similarly, the number of ways is the sum of the ways for each component that achieves this minimal t.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because adding edges to one component may affect others.\n\nNo, because the problem allows adding edges to any components. But the way t and w are computed is for each component, and the overall minimal t is the minimal required across all components.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nNo, wait. The problem says: find the minimal number of edges to add to the entire graph to form a simple cycle of odd length. So, the entire graph, after adding the edges, must have at least one such cycle.\n\nSo, for each component, the minimal number of edges to add to form an odd cycle in that component is considered, and the overall minimal t is the minimum among all possible ways.\n\nWait, but each component can contribute to the overall solution. For example, if one component can form an odd cycle with t=0, then the overall t is 0, and w is the sum of the ways for that component.\n\nIf no component can form an odd cycle with t=0, then the minimal t is 1, and w is the sum of the ways for all components that can form an odd cycle with t=1.\n\nWait, perhaps.\n\nSo, for the overall t and w:\n\nt is the minimal value among all components' t (for each component, if it's possible to form an odd cycle with t_i edges, then collect all t_i and take the minimal).\n\nw is the sum of the w_i for each component where t_i equals the minimal t.\n\nSo, for each component:\n\nCompute whether it can contribute a certain t, and how.\n\nNow, the steps:\n\n1. For each connected component, determine:\n\n   a. Is it bipartite?\n\n   b. If it's not bipartite: then t_i = 0, w_i = 1.\n\n   c. Else:\n\n      i. If it's a tree: t_i = 1, w_i is sum of s*(k-s) for each edge.\n\n      ii. Else: t_i = 1, w_i is (a choose 2) + (b choose 2).\n\n2. Now, collect all t_i and find the minimal t among them.\n\n   If all components have t_i = infinity (i.e., cannot form any odd cycle), then output accordingly.\n\n3. Sum all w_i where t_i equals the minimal t.\n\nWait, but what about components that are not bipartite? For example, a component that's not bipartite has t_i=0. So, if any such component exists, then the overall t is 0, and the number of ways is the sum of w_i for all components that can form an odd cycle with t=0 (which is just 1 for each such component).\n\nSo, for example, if one component is non-bipartite, and others are bipartite trees, then t is 0, and w is 1.\n\nBut wait, the way the problem is stated, the cycle must consist of more than one vertex. So a component that is a single edge can't form a cycle, but a component that is a triangle (non-bipartite) can.\n\nSo, for each component:\n\nIf it's non-bipartite, then it can form a cycle (of odd length) with t=0.\n\nBut only if the component has at least one cycle.\n\nWait, no. Because if the component is a tree, it's bipartite, but adding an edge can create a cycle.\n\nBut for a non-bipartite component, it already has a cycle.\n\nSo, for each component:\n\n- If it's non-bipartite: t_i=0, w_i=1.\n\n- Else: t_i is 1 if the component can form a cycle after adding 1 edge.\n\nSo, in the overall problem:\n\nWe need to find the minimal t across all components, where t is the minimal number of edges to add to form an odd cycle in that component.\n\nThen, the overall t is the minimal among all components' t_i.\n\nAnd the number of ways is the sum of w_i for all components where their t_i equals the minimal t.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each component:\n\n   Check if it's bipartite.\n\n   If not:\n\n      if the component has at least 3 nodes and is a cycle (i.e., is it a connected component with a cycle?), then t_i=0, w_i=1.\n\n      else: t_i is not applicable (can't form a cycle).\n\nWait, but for a component that is a single edge, it's a tree (bipartite). So it's not non-bipartite. So, if a component is a single edge, it's a tree, so t_i is 1.\n\nBut wait, a single edge is two nodes connected. It's a tree, so t_i is 1.\n\nBut wait, can a single edge form a cycle? No, because a cycle requires at least three nodes.\n\nSo, for a component that is a single edge, adding one edge can't form a cycle of more than one vertex.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem requires the cycle to consist of more than one vertex. So a cycle must have at least three nodes.\n\nSo, for a component that is a single edge (two nodes), adding one edge between them would create a cycle of length 2, but that's not allowed.\n\nWait, no, because the problem says the cycle must consist of more than one vertex. So a cycle of length 2 is not allowed.\n\nSo, in that case, a component with two nodes and one edge cannot form any cycle, regardless of adding edges.\n\nSo, in that case, for such a component, it's impossible to form a cycle of odd length. So, its t_i is infinity.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n   Determine if it's bipartite.\n\n   If not:\n\n      if the component has at least 3 nodes, then t_i=0, w_i=1.\n\n      else: t_i = infinity.\n\n   Else:\n\n      if the component is a tree:\n\n          t_i = 1, w_i is sum of s*(k-s) for each edge.\n\n      else:\n\n          t_i = 1, w_i is (a choose 2) + (b choose 2).\n\nBut also, if the component has less than 3 nodes:\n\n   If it's a single node: can't form any cycle.\n\n   If it's two nodes connected by an edge: can't form a cycle of more than one vertex.\n\nSo, in these cases, the component can't contribute to any solution.\n\nSo, the overall approach is:\n\n1. Find all connected components.\n\n2. For each component:\n\n   a. If the component has less than 3 nodes: skip (can't form a cycle).\n\n   b. Else, check if it's bipartite.\n\n      i. If not bipartite: add t_i=0, w_i=1.\n\n      ii. Else:\n\n          if the component is a tree: add t_i=1, w_i is sum of s*(k-s) for each edge.\n\n          else: add t_i=1, w_i is (a choose 2) + (b choose 2).\n\n3. Collect all t_i and w_i for components that can contribute.\n\n4. Among all components, find the minimal t_i.\n\n5. Sum all w_i where their t_i equals the minimal t.\n\n6. If no components can contribute (i.e., all have t_i >=1 and no component has t_i=0), then output t=1 and w=sum of w_i for all components.\n\nWait, but in step 4, the minimal t could be 0 or 1.\n\nSo, let's handle cases:\n\nCase 1: At least one component is non-bipartite and has at least 3 nodes.\n\nIn this case, t=0, and w=1 (only one way, because adding 0 edges to that component is the only way).\n\nCase 2: All components are bipartite and can contribute t=1.\n\nIn this case, t=1, and w is the sum of all w_i for each component.\n\nCase 3: Some components are bipartite and can contribute t=1, and others are non-bipartite but have less than 3 nodes.\n\nIn this case, the non-bipartite components can't contribute, so the minimal t is 1, and w is the sum of the w_i for bipartite components.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nCollect all possible t_i and w_i for components that can form a cycle.\n\nFind the minimal t among them.\n\nSum the w_i for components where t_i == minimal t.\n\nIf no components can form a cycle, output t=infinity, but according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain any loops or parallel edges, but it's possible that no component can form a cycle.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the graph is not necessarily connected. So, it's possible that after processing all components, no component can form a cycle.\n\nIn that case, the output would be t=infinity, but the problem expects t and w. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex).\"\n\nSo, if it's impossible to form such a cycle, then the output should be t=0 and w=0? Or perhaps the problem ensures that it's always possible.\n\nWait, no, the problem says nothing about the graph being such that it's possible. So, perhaps in some cases, it's impossible.\n\nBut looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n3 0\n\nSo, 3 nodes, 0 edges. So, each node is a separate component. Each component has 1 node, so can't form a cycle. So, the output is t=3, w=1? Or wait, no. Because in that case, each component is a single node, so adding edges between them is necessary.\n\nWait, in the third sample input:\n\nn=3, m=0.\n\nSo, the graph is three isolated nodes.\n\nTo form a cycle, we need at least three nodes connected.\n\nSo, the minimal t is 2: connect node 1-2, 2-3. Then, the cycle is 1-2-3-1, which is a cycle of length 3.\n\nWait, but wait. Adding 2 edges is required.\n\nSo, t=2, w=1.\n\nBecause there's only one way to add the two edges to form a cycle.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier logic, each component is a single node, so they are treated as separate.\n\nBut in this case, the minimal t is 2, but according to our previous analysis, for each component (single node), t_i is infinity.\n\nSo, the overall minimal t is not determined, and thus the answer is to add edges between these components.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in handling the components.\n\nI think I need to re-examine the problem.\n\nThe problem is to add edges to the entire graph, not per component.\n\nSo, for example, if the graph has multiple components, adding edges between them can form a cycle that spans multiple components.\n\nSo, my earlier approach of considering each component in isolation was incorrect.\n\nOh! This is a crucial point I missed.\n\nSo, the graph may consist of multiple components, and adding edges between them can create cycles that involve nodes from different components.\n\nSo, this completely changes the approach.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the minimal number of edges to add to the entire graph (not per component) to create an odd cycle, and the number of ways to do this.\n\nSo, the previous approach of treating each component independently is wrong.\n\nThis complicates things significantly.\n\nSo, what's the correct approach?\n\nWe need to consider the entire graph and find the minimal t edges to add so that the resulting graph has an odd-length cycle.\n\nSimilarly for w.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal t is determined by the structure of the entire graph, not individual components.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about possible cases.\n\nCase 1: The graph already contains an odd cycle.\n\nIn this case, t=0, w=1.\n\nCase 2: The graph is bipartite, but not connected, and adding edges between two components can create an odd cycle.\n\nWait, for example, if the graph is two triangles (each triangle is a component), but that's not bipartite. Wait, no, a triangle is non-bipartite.\n\nWait, no, a triangle is a cycle of length 3, which is odd. So, if the graph is two components, each a triangle, then the graph already has odd cycles. So t=0, w=1.\n\nAnother example: the graph is a square (even cycle) as a single component. It's bipartite. To create an odd cycle, add an edge between two opposite nodes in the square. That would create a triangle (odd cycle). So t=1, w=1.\n\nBut if the graph has two bipartite components, each a tree, then adding one edge between the two components (if possible) would create a cycle, but the cycle's length depends on the path.\n\nWait, but for example, if you have two trees, each with a bipartition. Adding an edge between any node in one tree and any node in the other would create a cycle of length 2 (since the paths between the two nodes are in their respective trees, but connecting them would form a cycle of length equal to the sum of the distances in each tree plus 1.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because the minimal cycle created would be the sum of the path lengths in each tree plus 1.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the entire graph.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the minimal t edges to add to the entire graph, not per component, such that the resulting graph has an odd cycle.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nIf the graph already has an odd cycle: t=0, w=1.\n\nElse:\n\nWe need to add edges to form an odd cycle.\n\nWhat's the minimal t?\n\nPossibilities:\n\n- If the graph is bipartite: then adding 1 edge between two nodes in the same partition can create an odd cycle.\n\nBut wait, no. Because in a bipartite graph, any edge added between two nodes in the same partition would create an odd cycle.\n\nSo, t=1.\n\nThe number of ways is the number of possible edges that can be added between nodes in the same partition, considering the entire graph.\n\nWait, but in the entire graph, the number of such edges is (sum over all connected components of a_i * (a_i - 1)/2) + (sum over all connected components of b_i * (b_i - 1)/2), where a_i and b_i are the sizes of the two partitions for each connected bipartite",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges to add to an undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length and count the number of ways to achieve this.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Analysis**: The problem can be broken down into analyzing each connected component of the graph.\n2. **Bipartite Check**: If a component is bipartite, it means any cycle formed within it will be of even length. To form an odd cycle, we need to add an edge between two nodes in the same partition.\n3. **Non-Bipartite Components**: If a component is non-bipartite, it already contains an odd cycle, so no edges need to be added.\n4. **Tree Components**: For tree components, adding an edge between two nodes at a distance of 2 will form a cycle of length 3, which is odd.\n5. **Counting Ways**: For each component, calculate the number of ways to form an odd cycle by considering possible edges that can be added.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef
