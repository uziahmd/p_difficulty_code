And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Average Sleep Time.\" Hmm.\n\nThe task says that Polycarp has been keeping track of his sleep times for n days. But a week in Berland is k days long. So the doctor wants to find the average sleep time per week over all possible consecutive weeks. Oh right, like sliding windows of size k.\n\nSo the input gives me two integers, n and k, followed by a list of n integers representing each day's sleep time. My goal is to compute the average of these k-day windows.\n\nWait, how do I approach this? Well, let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to process multiple test cases or just one? Oh, looking at the example, it seems like each line after the first represents a separate case. So my code needs to read multiple lines as separate inputs.\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Read n and k.\n2. Read the list of a_i's.\n3. Compute all possible sums of consecutive k elements.\n4. Sum all those k-length window sums.\n5. Divide by the number of windows (which is n - k + 1) to get the average.\n6. Output the result with at least six decimal places, ensuring precision.\n\nBut wait, when n is up to 2e5, doing this naively could be slow. Because if I have to compute each window sum one by one, that would take O(nk) time, which for 2e5 * 2e5 is 4e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way. Oh right, using a sliding window technique with a prefix sum array can help reduce the computation to O(n) time.\n\nLet me outline the plan:\n\n- Precompute the prefix sum array of the list a. This will allow me to calculate any window sum in O(1) time.\n- The sum of the first window (from index 0 to k-1) is the sum of the first k elements.\n- Each subsequent window starts at i, where i ranges from 0 to (n-k). The sum for window i is the sum of a[i] to a[i+k-1].\n- Using the prefix sum array, the sum of the window starting at i can be computed as prefix_sum[i + k] - prefix_sum[i].\n- Then, I can iterate through all possible windows, compute their sums using the prefix array, accumulate the total sum, and then divide by the number of windows.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the steps are:\n\nCompute the prefix sum, then loop through each window, calculate the sum, add to the total, and finally compute the average.\n\nLet's think about the implementation details.\n\nFirst, reading the inputs. The first line is n and k. The second line is the list a. For each test case, we process these.\n\nComputing the prefix sum: I'll create an array where prefix_sum[0] = 0, prefix_sum[1] = a[0], prefix_sum[2] = a[0] + a[1], etc. So for 0 <= i < j <= n, prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i] is the sum of a[i] to a[j-1].\n\nThen, for each window starting at i, the end is i + k. So the sum is prefix_sum[i + k] - prefix_sum[i].\n\nNow, the number of windows is m = n - k + 1. So I'll loop from i=0 to i = m-1.\n\nWait, no. Because for each window, the starting index is i, which goes from 0 to (n - k). So in terms of the prefix_sum, each window is from i to i + k - 1. So the sum is prefix_sum[i + k] - prefix_sum[i]. So yes.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the list a.\n\nCompute the prefix sum array.\n\nCompute the total sum of all windows.\n\nDivide by m to get the average.\n\nThen, print the average with enough decimal digits.\n\nNow, handling the output correctly is important. The output should have at least six decimal places, but sometimes more might be needed. For example, if the average is an integer, it should show .000000, like in the first sample.\n\nIn Python, formatting the output with something like \"{:.10f}\" would give ten decimal places, which is more than sufficient. But since the problem allows for any output as long as the error is within 1e-6, perhaps we can format to, say, 10 decimal places.\n\nWait, the note says that the answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error is within 1e-6. So printing with 10 decimal digits should be fine.\n\nLet's consider some examples.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\n3 2\n3 4 7\n\nThe windows are [3,4] and [4,7]. Their sums are 7 and 11. Total is 18. Average is 9. So output is 9.0000000000.\n\nAnother sample is when n=8, k=2, and the list is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]. So the windows are:\n\n1+2=3\n\n2+4=6\n\n4+100000=100004\n\n100000+123=100123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789+1=790\n\nAdding all these sums: 3+6=9, +100004=100013, +100123=200136, +579=200715, +1245=201960, +790=202750.\n\nWait, no, let me calculate:\n\nWait, each window is two elements:\n\nIndices 0-1: 1+2=3\n\n1-2: 2+4=6\n\n2-3:4+100000=100004\n\n3-4:100000+123=100123\n\n4-5:123+456=579\n\n5-6:456+789=1245\n\n6-7:789+1=790\n\nSumming all these: 3+6=9, +100004=100013; +100123=200136; +579=200715; +1245=201960; +790=202,750?\n\nWait, 3 +6 is 9. Then 9+100004 is 100,013. Adding 100,123 gives 200,136. Add 579: 200,715. Add 1245: 201,960. Add 790: 202,750.\n\nSo total sum is 202,750. Number of windows is 8-2+1=7. 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857... So the output is 28964.2857142857.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, read n and k from the input. But wait, the input is given as a single string per line. So for each test case, the first line is n and k, and the next line is the a list.\n\nIn Python, we can read all lines at once, split them, and process each case.\n\nBut since the problem is a single test case, perhaps? Or is it multiple test cases?\n\nLooking at the sample input, it's three test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nWait, the first line of input is '3 2\\n3 4 7', which is one test case. Then the next line is '1 1\\n10'—another test case. Then another.\n\nSo the code must read each test case separately.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop over each test case:\n\n- Read the first line: n, k.\n\n- Read the second line: list of integers a.\n\nCompute the prefix sum.\n\nCompute the total sum across all windows.\n\nDivide by m = n -k +1.\n\nPrint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nImplementing this.\n\nNow, let's think about how to compute the prefix sum.\n\nIn Python, perhaps:\n\nprefix = [0]\n\ncurrent_sum = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    current_sum += num\n\n    prefix.append(current_sum)\n\nThen, for each window starting at i, the sum is prefix[i +k] - prefix[i].\n\nWait, because the window is a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[i+k-1], so the sum is prefix[i +k] - prefix[i].\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code can loop through i from 0 to m-1, where m is n -k +1.\n\nWait, wait: i can range from 0 to (n -k), inclusive. Because the last window starts at i = n -k.\n\nBecause the number of windows is m = n -k +1.\n\nSo, for i in 0 to m-1.\n\nBut wait, when you have a list of length n, the indices are 0-based. So the first window is 0 to k-1. Then 1 to k, etc.\n\nSo for each i in 0 to (n -k) inclusive, the sum is prefix[i +k] - prefix[i].\n\nSo, the code can loop i from 0 to (n -k), and for each, add (prefix[i +k] - prefix[i]) to the total.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the edge cases:\n\nWhat if k is 1? Then each window is a single element, and the average is the sum of all a_i divided by n.\n\nWhich the code handles.\n\nAnother edge case: when n equals k. Then there's only one window, the sum is the sum of all a_i, and average is that sum.\n\nWhich is also handled.\n\nAnother edge case: when k is zero? No, according to the problem statement, k is between 1 and n, inclusive.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, considering the data types: since a_i can be up to 1e5, and n is up to 2e5, the maximum sum per window is 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10. And the number of windows is up to 2e5. So the total sum can be up to 2e15. Which is manageable with Python's integers.\n\nSo, no issues with integer overflows.\n\nNow, for the output: the average is a floating-point number, which can be a float or a decimal. So in Python, we can calculate it as a division and then format it.\n\nBut in Python, dividing integers with / gives a float. So, for example, 202750 /7 = 28964.285714285714.\n\nWe need to print it with at least six decimal digits, but the sample shows up to 10.\n\nSo, the output should format the number with exactly 10 decimal digits, regardless of trailing zeros.\n\nSo, in Python, the format string would be something like '{:.10f}'.format(result).\n\nWait, but in the sample, the first output is 9.0000000000, which is 10 decimal places. So the code should print all 10 digits.\n\nSo, in the code, after computing the average, format it as a string with 10 decimal digits.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nSo, the code structure:\n\nRead all lines into a list.\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Read the first line as n, k.\n\n- Read the next line as the list a.\n\nCompute the prefix sum.\n\nCompute the total sum.\n\nCompute the average.\n\nPrint the average formatted to 10 decimal places.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nBut how to read the input?\n\nIn Python, the standard input can be read using input().split() for each line.\n\nBut when there are multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines, perhaps we can read all the lines at once.\n\nAlternatively, for each test case, read two lines: the first for n and k, the second for the list.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nidx = 0\n\nwhile idx < len(lines):\n\n    # Read n and k\n\n    nk_line = lines[idx].split()\n\n    n = int(nk_line[0])\n\n    k = int(nk_line[1])\n\n    idx +=1\n\n    a_line = lines[idx].strip()\n\n    a = list(map(int, a_line.split()))\n\n    idx +=1\n\n    # Process a\n\n    # Compute prefix sum\n\n    prefix = [0]\n\n    current_sum =0\n\n    for num in a:\n\n        current_sum += num\n\n        prefix.append(current_sum)\n\n    m = n -k +1\n\n    total =0\n\n    for i in range(m):\n\n        end = i +k\n\n        total += prefix[end] - prefix[i]\n\n    avg = total / m\n\n    # Print with 10 decimals\n\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(avg))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the outputs are:\n\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\nWait, the third output has 10 decimal digits as well.\n\nWait, no: the third output is 28964.2857142857, which is 10 digits after decimal? Wait, no: 2857142857 is 10 digits. Yes.\n\nWait, 0.2857142857 is 10 digits after decimal point.\n\nSo the code's formatting is correct.\n\nTesting the code against the samples.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nn=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\nprefix is [0,3,7,14]\n\nm=2.\n\ni=0: prefix[2]-prefix[0] =7-0=7\n\ni=1: prefix[3]-prefix[1]=14-3=11\n\ntotal=18, avg=9.0 → printed as 9.0000000000.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=1, k=1, a=[10]\n\nprefix is [0,10]\n\nm=1.\n\ni=0: 10-0=10 → avg=10.0 → printed as 10.0000000000.\n\nThird sample:\n\nn=8, k=2, a=[1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\nprefix is [0,1,3,7, 100007, 100130, 100586, 101375, 102376]\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\na = [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\nprefix starts as [0]\n\nAfter adding 1: 1 → prefix[1] =1\n\nAdd 2: 3 → prefix[2]=3\n\nAdd4:7 → prefix[3]=7\n\nAdd 1e5: 100007 → prefix[4]=100007\n\nAdd 123: 100130 → prefix[5]=100130\n\nAdd 456: 100586 → prefix[6]=100586\n\nAdd 789: 101375 → prefix[7]=101375\n\nAdd 1: 101376 → prefix[8]=101376.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier in the calculation. But in any case, the code computes it correctly.\n\nThen, m =8-2+1=7.\n\nEach window:\n\ni=0: 1+2=3 → prefix[2]-prefix[0]=3.\n\ni=1: 2+4=6 → prefix[3]-prefix[1]=7-1=6.\n\ni=2:4 +1e5=100004 → prefix[4]-prefix[2] =100007 -3=100004.\n\ni=3: 1e5 +123=100123 → prefix[5]-prefix[3]=100130-7=100123.\n\ni=4: 123+456=579 → prefix[6] -prefix[4] =100586-100007=579.\n\ni=5:456 +789=1245 → prefix[7]-prefix[5]=101375-100130=1245.\n\ni=6:789 +1=790 → prefix[8]-prefix[6]=101376-100586=790.\n\nSum all:3+6=9, +100004=100013, +100123=200136, +579=200715, +1245=201960, +790=202,750.\n\nTotal is 202750.\n\nDivided by 7: 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\nWhich is correctly printed.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: when k= n.\n\nSay n=5, k=5.\n\nOnly one window: sum all a_i.\n\nSo the average is sum(a)/1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, k=1.\n\nTwo windows, each is one element. So average is (a[0]+a[1])/2.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the code's efficiency.\n\nWhen n is 2e5, and k is 1e5, the prefix sum is built in O(n) time. Then, the loop runs O(n) times, each step O(1). So overall O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code should pass all test cases.\n\nNow, what about when the list a is empty? No, n >=k >=1, so a has at least one element.\n\nI think that's all. Now, writing the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of size k from a given list of sleep times for n days.

This allows us to compute the sum of each k-day window in constant time.\n3. **Sliding Window Technique**: Use the prefix sum array to compute the sum of each k-day window efficiently.
