The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They each have their own sequences of moves, and after each round, the loser gets a red spot. I need to calculate how many red spots each ends up with after n rounds.\n\nHmm, let me think about the approach here. Both players are cycling through their sequences. So for each round i (from 0 to n-1), Nikephoros uses A[i % m], and Polycarpus uses B[i % k], right? Because their sequences repeat cyclically.\n\nWait, but the problem says that in each round, they choose one of three items independently. So yes, for each round, we pick the next move from their respective sequences, wrapping around as needed.\n\nThe main task is to simulate each of the n rounds, determine who loses each time (and hence who gets a red spot), and accumulate the counts.\n\nSo, how do I model each round?\n\nFor each round:\n1. Determine the moves of both players.\n   - For Nikephoros, it's A[(current_round) % len(A)]\n   - For Polycarpus, it's B[(current_round) % len(B)]\n2. Compare the two moves to see who wins.\n3. If one wins, the loser gets a red spot. If it's a draw, no one gets a spot.\n\nSo the steps are clear. But wait, n can be up to 2e5, which is manageable because even a loop over n will be efficient enough.\n\nLet me think about the data structures. The sequences A and B can be stored as strings, and for each index, we can just take the character at that position modulo their lengths.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps in code:\n\nRead n.\nRead A and B.\n\nInitialize counters for each player's red spots: nike = 0, poly = 0.\n\nFor each round from 0 to n-1:\n   a = A[ (round_num) % lenA ]\n   b = B[ (round_num) % lenB ]\n   determine winner between a and b.\n\nHow to determine the winner?\n\nWell, according to the rules:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beat paper\n- Paper beats rock\n\nIf a == b, it's a draw. Else, check the winning conditions.\n\nSo, for each a and b:\nif a beats b: then Poly gets a spot.\nelse if b beats a: Nike gets a spot.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, when a beats b, then the winner is the one showing a, and the loser is b. So in that case, the loser (Poly) gets a spot.\n\nSo, for each round:\nif a == b: nothing happens.\nelse:\n   check if a beats b. If yes, Poly loses, so add 1 to his count.\n   else, Nike loses, so add 1 to his count.\n\nSo the key is to implement a function that, given a and b, returns whether a beats b or not.\n\nHow to implement that? Let's think.\n\nWe can represent the possible outcomes with a helper function. For example, define a dictionary that maps each move to what it beats.\n\nLike, beats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nSo, if a is R, it beats S. If a is S, it beats P. If a is P, it beats R.\n\nSo, for a given a and b, if a is not equal to b, then check if beats[a] == b. If yes, a wins, so Poly gets a spot. Otherwise, b must win, so Nike gets a spot.\n\nWait, wait. Let me test this logic.\n\nExample 1:\na is R, b is S.\nbeats['R'] is S. So yes, R beats S. So a wins, so Poly loses, so Poly's count increases by 1.\n\nAnother example:\na is S, b is R.\nbeats['S'] is P. R is not P, so S does not beat R. So instead, R beats S. So in this case, a is S, b is R: since S doesn't beat R, R must beat S. So b wins, so a (Nikephoros) loses, so his count increases by 1.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each round:\n\n- Compute a and b.\n- If a == b: nothing.\n- Else:\n   Check if a beats b. If yes: Poly +=1\n   Else: Nike +=1\n\nSo now, how to implement this in code.\n\nIn Python, let's read the input:\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nBut wait, the input is given as separate lines, like in the sample input, it's ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', ...]. So in the actual code, perhaps using splitlines might be better, but I think that the input() function reads until the newline, so for example, the first line is the integer n, the second is A, and third is B.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nThen, lenA = len(A), lenB = len(B).\n\nInitialize counters:\n\nnike = 0\npoly = 0\n\nThen, loop for i in range(n):\n\na_char = A[i % lenA]\nb_char = B[i % lenB]\n\nif a_char == b_char:\n    continue\nelse:\n    if a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S':\n        # a beats b, Poly loses\n        poly +=1\n    elif a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P':\n        poly +=1\n    elif a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R':\n        poly +=1\n    else:\n        # check if b beats a\n        if b_char == 'R' and a_char == 'S':\n            nike +=1\n        elif b_char == 'S' and a_char == 'P':\n            nike +=1\n        elif b_char == 'P' and a_char == 'R':\n            nike +=1\n\nWait, but that's a bit redundant. Maybe a better way is to use a helper function or a dictionary.\n\nAlternatively, create a mapping where for each a, we know what it beats.\n\nSo, beats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\nif a_char != b_char:\n    if beats[a_char] == b_char:\n        # a wins\n        poly +=1\n    else:\n        # b wins\n        nike +=1\n\nYes, that would be more concise.\n\nSo the code inside the loop becomes:\n\nif a_char == b_char:\n    continue\nelse:\n    if beats[a_char] == b_char:\n        poly +=1\n    else:\n        nike +=1\n\nThat's much cleaner.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nWhat if n is 0? Well, per the problem statement, n is at least 1, so we don't need to handle that.\n\nWhat if A or B are empty? No, per the problem statement, m and k are at least 1.\n\nWhat about when i % lenA is beyond the string? No, because in Python, the modulo operator handles that correctly.\n\nWait, for example, if lenA is 3, and i is 5, 5%3 is 2, so A[2] is accessed.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n7\nRPS\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\" (length 3), B is \"RSPP\" (length 4).\n\nRound 0 (i=0):\nA[0] = 'R', B[0] = 'R' → same, no change.\n\nRound 1 (i=1):\nA[1] = 'P', B[1] = 'S'.\nCheck if P beats S: beats['P'] is 'R'. Does 'P' beat 'S'? No. So S beats P. So B (Poly) wins. So Nike (player 1) loses, so his count increases by 1.\n\nWait, wait, no: in the sample explanation, the first round is R-R: draw. Second round is P-S: P beats S, so the winner is P (Nikephoros), so Poly loses, gets a spot. So in that round, Poly gets a spot.\n\nWait, the sample says in the first sample, the output is 3 2.\n\nWait, the sample explanation says:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → P (Nike) wins, so Poly gets a spot.\n\nRound 3: S vs P → S (Poly) wins, so Nike gets a spot.\n\nRound 4: R vs P → R (Nike) wins, so Poly gets a spot.\n\nRound 5: P vs R → P (Poly) wins, so Nike gets a spot.\n\nRound 6: S vs S → draw.\n\nRound 7: R vs P → R (Nike) wins, so Poly gets a spot.\n\nWait, but in the sample, n is 7, so rounds 0-6.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused with 0-based vs 1-based.\n\nIn any case, the code should handle that correctly.\n\nSo in the code, for each i from 0 to n-1, it's the ith round.\n\nSo in the sample, n=7, and i runs from 0 to 6.\n\nSo for each i, compute a and b, then proceed.\n\nSo for i=0: a=R, b=R → no change.\n\ni=1: a=P, b=S. P beats S? Beats['P'] is R. So no. So S beats P. So Poly (b) wins. So Nike's count increases by 1.\n\nWait, no. Because in the code, if a's move beats b's, then Poly (the b player) gets a spot. Else, the a player gets a spot.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify: when a beats b, that means a's move defeats b's. So the loser is b, which is Poly, so he gets a spot.\n\nSo in the code, when a beats b, Poly's count increases.\n\nIn the above case, a is P, b is S.\n\nDoes P beat S? According to the rules, scissors cut paper, so S beats P. So a (P) does not beat b (S). So the else condition is triggered: since b beats a, then a's (Nike's) move loses, so he gets a spot.\n\nWait, no: because if a is P, b is S. Then S beats P. So the winner is S (Poly). So Poly wins, so Nike (a) loses, so his count goes up.\n\nAh, okay, so the code is correct.\n\nIn code:\n\nif a_char != b_char:\n    if beats[a_char] == b_char:\n        # a beats b: Poly loses\n        poly +=1\n    else:\n        # b beats a: Nike loses\n        nike +=1\n\nSo for i=1, a_char is P, b_char is S. beats[P] is R. So beats[P] is R, which is not equal to S. So else clause is taken: so b beats a. So a's move (P) loses, so a (Nike) gets a spot. So nike +=1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo for each round, the code correctly adds to the respective counter.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nAnother test case: when A and B are the same, like A is 'RRRR', B is 'RRRR'.\n\nThen, for each round, the moves are same: no spots.\n\nSo output is 0 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A='R', B='S'. Then, R beats S: Poly gets a spot. So output is 0 1.\n\nI think the code is correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read n, A, B.\n\n- Precompute the beats mapping.\n\n- Initialize counters.\n\n- Loop for each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   a = A[i % m]\n\n   b = B[i % k]\n\n   if a == b: skip.\n\n   else, check if a beats b: if yes, poly +=1.\n\n   else: nike +=1.\n\nFinally, print nike and poly.\n\nSo now, writing the code.\n\nBeats is a dictionary:\n\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\nnike = 0\npoly = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if beats[a] == b:\n        poly += 1\n    else:\n        nike += 1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n\nWait, that's the code.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is 'RPS', B is 'RSPP'.\n\nLet's go through each i from 0 to 6.\n\ni=0:\n\na = R[0] = R\n\nb = R[0] = R → same, no change.\n\ni=1:\n\na = P, b = S.\n\nbeats[P] is R. Is R == S? No. So else clause: b (S) beats a (P). So a's move loses. So add to nike: now 1.\n\ni=2:\n\na = S, b = P.\n\nbeats[S] is P. So beats[a] == b → yes. So poly +=1.\n\ni=3:\n\na = R (since 3 mod 3 is 0 → R), b is R (3 mod 4 is 3 → B[3] is P. Wait wait, wait.\n\nWait, B is 'RSPP', so indices 0: 'R', 1:'S', 2:'P', 3:'P'.\n\nSo for i=3, 3 mod 4 is 3 → B[3] is 'P'.\n\nSo a is R, b is P.\n\nbeats[R] is S. So beats[a] is S, which is not equal to P. So else clause: b (P) beats a (R). So a's move loses, so add to nike: 2.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, a is R, b is P.\n\nR is beaten by P, so P beats R. So in the code, since a is R and beats[a] is S, which is not equal to b (P), so else clause is taken: b beats a. So a (Nike) loses, so his count increases by 1. So now, nike is 2.\n\ni=4:\n\na is 4 mod 3 = 1 → A[1] is P.\n\nb is 4 mod 4 = 0 → B[0] is R.\n\nSo a is P, b is R.\n\nbeats[P] is R. So yes, beats[a] == b. So poly +=1 (now poly is 2).\n\ni=5:\n\na is 5 mod 3 = 2 → A[2] is S.\n\nb is 5 mod 4 = 1 → B[1] is S.\n\nSame, so no change.\n\ni=6:\n\na is 6 mod 3 = 0 → R.\n\nb is 6 mod4= 2 → B[2] is P.\n\nSo a is R, b is P.\n\nbeats[R] is S, which is not equal to P. So else clause: b (P) beats a (R). So a's move loses, so add to nike: 3.\n\nSo after all rounds, nike is 3, poly is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nGreat, so the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, A is 'RRRRRRRR', B is 'R'.\n\nEach round:\n\ni=0: a=R, b=R → same.\n\ni=1: a=R, b=R → same.\n\n... and so on.\n\nAll rounds are draws. So output is 0 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A='R', B='S'.\n\nAs discussed, Poly gets a spot. So output is 0 1.\n\nYes, the code should handle this.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to simulate a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who each follow cyclic sequences of moves. The goal is to determine the number of red spots (pinches) each player receives after playing `n` rounds.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of rounds `n` and the sequences of moves for both players.\n2. **Cyclic Move Handling**: For each round, determine the move of each player by cycling through their respective sequences using modulo operations.\n3. **Determine Winners**: For each round, compare the moves of both players to determine the winner. If the moves are the same, it's a draw, and no one gets a red spot. Otherwise, the player with the winning move gives the other player a red spot.\n4. **Efficiency Consideration**: The solution efficiently handles up to 200,000 rounds using a loop that processes each round in constant time, ensuring optimal performance.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\nnike = 0\npoly = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if beats[a] == b:\n        poly += 1\n    else:\n        nike += 1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of rounds `n` and the sequences `A` and `B` from the standard input.\n- **Cycle Handling**: Using modulo operations (`i % m` and `i % k`), the code ensures that each player's move cycles through their respective sequence correctly.\n- **Winning Check**: The dictionary `beats` helps determine the winner of each round. If a player's move beats the opponent's move, the opponent gets a red spot.\n- **Counting Red Spots**: The counters `nike` and `poly` keep track of the number of red spots each player receives, which are printed at the end.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the game and ensures that the solution is optimal even for the maximum constraints.",
