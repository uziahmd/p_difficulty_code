They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Mushroom Strife. Hmm. So the setup is that Pasha and Akim made a forest map where lawns are vertices and roads are edges. Each road has two numbers: GCD and LCM of the mushrooms on the connected lawns. But now, some of the map is torn, leaving only m roads. My task is to help restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn based on the given roads. If it's not possible, output NO; else, output any valid arrangement.\n\nThe input gives n and m, followed by m lines each with four numbers: the two lawns connected by the road, the GCD, and the LCM of their mushroom counts.\n\nHmm. So, how do I model this? It seems like a graph problem where each edge imposes constraints on the values of the nodes (lawns). Each node must have a value (number of mushrooms), and each edge enforces that for the two nodes u and v, the GCD of their values is g, and the LCM is l.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, GCD(u, v) = g and LCM(u, v) = l. Also, since GCD and LCM are related to two numbers, we know that the product of GCD and LCM equals the product of the two numbers. Because GCD(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So that gives us a relation between u and v: u * v = g * l.\n\nBut also, because GCD(g, l) is 1? Or wait, no. Because g is the GCD of u and v, so g divides both u and v. And l is their LCM, which is the smallest number divisible by both u and v. So l must be a multiple of both u and v. So, l must be a multiple of g, because g is a divisor of both.\n\nWait, yes. So, from the edge, we have u and v such that:\n\ngcd(u, v) = g\nlcm(u, v) = l\n\nAnd we also have that g must divide both u and v, and l must be a multiple of both. So, l is a multiple of g. So, l = k * g for some integer k ≥ 1.\n\nBut since u and v are multiples of g, let's define u = g * a, v = g * b. Then, since gcd(a, b) = 1 (because any common divisor of a and b would multiply into the GCD of u and v, which is g). And the LCM of u and v is g * lcm(a, b). But since the LCM is given as l, we have:\n\ng * lcm(a, b) = l → lcm(a, b) = l / g.\n\nBut since a and b are coprime, their LCM is just a*b. So, a * b = l / g.\n\nSo putting it all together, for each edge, the two nodes u and v must satisfy:\n\nu = g * a\nv = g * b\nwhere a and b are coprimes, and a*b = l / g.\n\nThis is a crucial point. So for each edge, the values of u and v can be expressed in terms of their GCD and LCM. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to solving a system of equations where each equation represents an edge constraint. The variables are the values of the nodes, and each edge gives us certain constraints about those variables.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be modeled as a system of constraints and solved using Union-Find data structure with additional information, perhaps something like a bipartition or tracking of ratios. Alternatively, it might require building a graph where each edge represents a relationship between the variables.\n\nWait, another approach is to model this as a graph where each edge between u and v defines a relation that u / v is equal to a certain ratio. Because from the above, u = g * a and v = g * b, so u/v = a/b. Since a and b are coprimes, this ratio is in its simplest form.\n\nSo, for each edge, the ratio u/v must equal a/b, where a and b are coprimes, and a*b = l/g.\n\nSo, for each edge, we can compute a and b, then set up a ratio constraint between u and v.\n\nThus, the problem becomes a system of equations where each equation is u_i / u_j = r_ij, which can be represented as u_i = r_ij * u_j.\n\nThis system can be checked for consistency using a Union-Find data structure that also tracks the ratios between connected components. If any cycles are found that violate the constraints, the system is inconsistent, and thus no solution exists.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each edge, compute the possible a and b such that a*b = (LCM / GCD), and a and b are coprimes.\n   - Because u = g*a, v = g*b, and a*b = LCM / GCD.\n2. For each edge, create a constraint that u / v = a / b.\n3. Use a Union-Find structure that can track the ratio between each node and the root of its component.\n4. When processing each edge, check if u and v are already in the same component. If they are, compute the expected ratio between them according to the current edge and see if it matches the stored ratio. If it doesn't, the system is inconsistent.\n5. If all edges are processed without conflicts, assign the values to each node. The root of each component will have a value, and all other nodes in the component will be determined by their ratio relative to the root.\n\nBut wait, how do we assign the actual values? Because the roots can be assigned arbitrary values, as long as the constraints are satisfied. So, perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\n- Choose one node as the root (say, node 1).\n- Assign a value to the root (like 1, but it could be anything).\n- Then, propagate the constraints to other nodes based on their edges.\n- However, sometimes the constraints may require certain relationships that force all nodes to have the same value, or certain multiples.\n\nBut wait, the problem allows any valid assignment. So, for the purpose of checking existence, we don't need to assign specific values. We just need to ensure that the constraints are consistent.\n\nWait, but when we have to output the actual values, how do we proceed? Well, perhaps after ensuring consistency, we can assign arbitrary values, starting from the root as 1, and then assign the rest based on the constraints.\n\nWait, but let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, for each edge, the constraints are u = g*a, v = g*b, and a and b are coprimes with a*b = l/g.\n\nSo, for each edge, the ratio u/v must be a/b. So, if we represent each node's value as a multiple of the root, we can handle these ratios.\n\nSo, the Union-Find structure needs to track for each node, its parent and the ratio from the node to the parent. When merging two components, we can check whether the existing ratio is compatible with the new edge's ratio.\n\nIf during the union operation, a conflict is found, the system is inconsistent, and we output NO.\n\nOnce all edges are processed and no conflicts are found, we can assign the values to the nodes. How?\n\nWe can pick a root (like node 1) and assign it a value. Then, for each node in the component, their value is determined by the path from the root and the accumulated ratios.\n\nWait, but since the initial value is arbitrary, perhaps we can assign the root a value of 1, and then calculate all others based on their ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the root's value is fixed, and the other nodes' values are determined accordingly.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the root is node A, and node B is connected to A with a ratio of 2/1 (so B = 2*A). Node C is connected to B with a ratio of 3/2 (C = (3/2)*B = (3/2)*(2A) = 3A). So, C's value is 3A. If A is assigned 1, then B is 2, C is 3.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- For each node, find the path to the root, and compute the product of all the ratios along that path. That gives the node's value relative to the root.\n\nBut how do we compute this? We can perform a BFS or DFS for each node, multiplying the ratios as we go.\n\nAnother point: the edges may form cycles, so during the Union-Find process, any cycles must not introduce conflicting ratios.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each edge (u, v, g, l):\n\n   a. Compute s = l // g. Check if s is divisible by g. Because a*b = s, and a and b are integers. So, if l mod g !=0, then it's impossible.\n\n   Wait, no. Because a*b = l/g, and a and b are coprimes. So, l must be a multiple of g, else s is not an integer, which is impossible because a and b are integers. So, for each edge, first compute s = l / g. If s is not an integer, then the edge is invalid, and the answer is NO.\n\n   So, the first thing to do for each edge is check if l is divisible by g. If not, output NO.\n\n   Also, since a and b are coprimes, s must be equal to a*b where a and b are coprimes. So, for each edge, s must be factorizable into two coprimes a and b.\n\n   So, for each edge, compute s = l / g. Then, find all possible pairs (a, b) such that a * b = s and GCD(a, b) = 1.\n\n   But wait, how? For each edge, the pair (a, b) can be determined as follows: since a and b are coprimes, s must be square-free? No, not necessarily. For example, 12 can be factored into 3*4, but 3 and 4 are coprimes. Or 12 can be factored as 12*1, which are coprimes.\n\n   So, for each s, the possible (a, b) pairs are all pairs of positive integers whose product is s and GCD is 1.\n\n   So, for each edge, compute s = l/g. If s is not an integer, return NO.\n\n   Then, find all possible (a, b) pairs where a*b = s and GCD(a, b) = 1. There may be multiple pairs, but in the context of the problem, each edge enforces exactly one possible ratio between u and v.\n\nWait, but for a given s, there are potentially multiple (a, b) pairs. For example, s=6 can be 1*6 or 2*3, etc. Wait, no: for a given s, the number of distinct (a, b) pairs where a <= b and GCD(a, b)=1 is the number of ways to factor s into two coprimes.\n\nFor example, s=6: possible pairs are (1,6), (2,3). Both are coprimes.\n\nBut for s=4: (1,4) and (2,2). But (2,2) has GCD 2, so only (1,4) is valid.\n\nWait, but for s=8: (1,8), (2,4)—but (2,4) has GCD 2, so only (1,8) is valid.\n\nWait, no: 8 can be written as 8*1, which are coprimes, or 4*2, which aren't. So only (1,8).\n\nSo, for each s, the possible (a, b) pairs are the pairs of divisors of s where a <= b and GCD(a, b) =1.\n\nBut wait, what if s=12? Then possible pairs are (1,12), (3,4). Are there any others? 2 and 6: GCD 2, so no. So yes, (1,12), (3,4) are the valid pairs.\n\nSo, for each edge, once s is computed, we can generate all possible (a, b) pairs, but in the context of the problem, each edge defines a unique ratio between u and v. So, for each edge, there is exactly one (a, b) pair that defines the required ratio.\n\nWait, no. Because for each edge, u and v must satisfy u = g*a, v = g*b, and a*b = s. So, for a given s, there's only one way to factor into coprimes a and b, up to ordering.\n\nWait, no. Because if s is a square number, like 9, then the factors are (1,9) and (9,1), but since a and b are in the ratio u/v, the order matters.\n\nWait, no, because the ratio is u/v = a/b, which is same as (b/a) if you swap a and b. So, for each edge, the direction matters. So, for each edge, we can have two possible (a, b) pairs: (a, b) and (b, a), but depending on the edge's u and v, which is which.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because the edge connects u and v, so in the ratio u/v, u is the first node, v the second. So, for each edge, the ratio is u/v, which is a/b. So, the direction is fixed.\n\nSo, for each edge, we can compute the ratio as u_v = a / b, and v_u = b / a.\n\nSo, for each edge, we must choose which of the possible (a, b) pairs corresponds to the correct ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nEach edge gives u, v, g, l.\n\nWe need to compute a and b such that:\n\na * b = l / g\n\nand GCD(a, b) = 1.\n\nSo, for each edge, the possible a and b are such that a*b = s (s=l/g), and a and b are coprimes.\n\nSo, for each edge, we can find all possible (a, b) pairs where a * b = s, and GCD(a, b) = 1.\n\nBut since the ratio is u / v = a / b, which is fixed by the edge, each edge has exactly one possible (a, b) pair that fits, because the ratio is determined by u and v.\n\nWait, but how? Because for a given s, there could be multiple pairs of (a, b) that satisfy a * b = s and GCD(a, b) = 1.\n\nWait, for example, s=6: (a, b) can be (1,6) or (2,3). So, each of these gives a different ratio.\n\nBut for the edge, the ratio is u / v = a / b, so the direction is fixed. So, for each edge, the a and b are determined based on the order of u and v.\n\nWait, no. Because for each edge, the u and v are fixed. So, the ratio is u / v = a / b, so for each edge, we have to find a and b such that a * b = s, and a / b = u / v. So, a and b are determined uniquely.\n\nSo, the steps for each edge:\n\nCompute s = l / g.\n\nCheck if s is an integer. If not, impossible.\n\nThen, compute a and b such that a * b = s, and a / b = u / v.\n\nBecause u and v are known, a and b can be determined as a = u * k, b = v * k, but this may not hold. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute a and b as follows:\n\nSince a / b = u / v → a = (u / v) * b.\n\nSubstitute into a*b = s:\n\n(u / v) * b * b = s → b^2 = s * v / u → b = sqrt( s * v / u )\n\nBut this requires that s * v must be divisible by u, and the square root must be integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute a and b by cross-multiplying.\n\nGiven a/b = u/v → a = (u * k), b = (v * k) for some k. But a * b = (u v k^2) = s → k^2 = s/(u v). So, k must be sqrt(s/(u v)). So, s/(u v) must be a perfect square.\n\nWait, but that may not always be the case. So perhaps this approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: For each edge, compute a and b such that a * b = s and a / b = u / v. Let's solve for a and b.\n\nCross-multiplying, a * v = b * u → a = (b u) / v.\n\nSubstituting into a * b = s:\n\n(b u / v) * b = s → (b² u)/v = s → b² = (s v) / u → b = sqrt( (s v) / u )\n\nSo, for b to be integer, (s v) must be divisible by u, and the result must be a perfect square.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of u and v, and then express a and b in terms of that.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to compute the ratio u / v as a reduced fraction.\n\nYes! Because a / b must equal u / v, but in the reduced form. So, we can write a / b = (u / d) / (v / d), where d is the GCD of u and v.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: u and v may have a common divisor. So, let d = GCD(u, v). Then, u = d * u', v = d * v', where u' and v' are coprimes.\n\nThen, the ratio a / b must be equal to (d u') / (d v') → u' / v'.\n\nSo, a / b = u' / v'.\n\nBut since a and b must be coprimes, this suggests that a = k u', b = k v' for some k. But then a * b = k^2 u' v' = s.\n\nSo, k^2 u' v' = s.\n\nBut since u' and v' are coprimes, their product is s divided by k squared.\n\nWait, but this might complicate things further.\n\nPerhaps the key is to find, for each edge, the minimal a and b such that a / b = u / v, and a * b = s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the reduced form of u / v.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge, the ratio a / b must be equal to the reduced fraction of u / v.\n\nSo, let's compute the reduced form of u and v. For example, if u=4 and v=6, the reduced form is 2/3.\n\nSo, a / b must be 2/3, and a * b = s.\n\nSo, a = 2k, b=3k. Then, a*b=6k² = s → k² = s/6 → k must be sqrt(s/6). So, s must be divisible by 6 and s/6 must be a perfect square.\n\nHmm. This suggests that for each edge, the ratio a/b is determined by the reduced form of u and v.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the a and b are determined by the edge's constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the reduced fraction of u and v, then use that to determine a and b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each edge, a and b must satisfy a * b = s and a / b = u / v. So, substituting:\n\na = (u / v) * b → a * b = (u / v) * b² = s → b² = (s v) / u → b = sqrt( (s v) / u )\n\nSo, for b to be integer, (s v) must be divisible by u, and the quotient must be a perfect square.\n\nSo, for each edge, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute s = l / g. If l % g != 0 → invalid, return NO.\n\n2. Compute numerator = s * v.\n\n   Denominator = u.\n\n   Check if numerator is divisible by denominator. If not, invalid.\n\n   Else, compute temp = numerator / denominator.\n\n   Check if temp is a perfect square. Let temp = k².\n\n   If not, invalid.\n\n   Then, b = k.\n\n   a = (u / v) * b = (u / v) * k.\n\n   But since a and b must be coprimes, we need to check if GCD(a, b) == 1.\n\n   Wait, but a and b were computed as a = (u / v) * k, and b=k.\n\n   So, a = (u / v) * k.\n\n   But since u and v may have a common divisor, this may complicate.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the way to compute a and b is as follows:\n\n   Let d = GCD(u, v). Then, u = d * u', v = d * v', where u' and v' are coprimes.\n\n   Then, a = (d u') * k, b = (d v') * k.\n\n   So, a * b = d² u' v' k².\n\n   But a * b must equal s → d² u' v' k² = s.\n\n   Since u' and v' are coprimes, their product is s/(d² k²).\n\n   So, u' v' = s/(d² k²).\n\n   But u' and v' are coprimes, so s must be divisible by d², and s/d² must be equal to u' v'.\n\n   But u' and v' are coprimes, so s/(d²) must be equal to u' v', which implies that u' and v' are coprimes.\n\n   So, this suggests that s must be a multiple of d², and s/d² must be the product of two coprimes u' and v'.\n\n   But this seems complicated.\n\n   Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Perhaps I should represent each edge as a ratio, and then build a system of equations to solve.\n\nSo, for each edge, the equation is:\n\nu = g * a\n\nv = g * b\n\nwhere a and b are coprimes and a * b = s.\n\nThus, for each edge, the ratio u : v is a : b.\n\nSo, for each edge, the ratio is (a, b) which are coprimes, and a * b = s.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to building a system of ratios between the nodes, and checking for consistency.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of checking if a graph has a bipartition with certain constraints, but here it's more general.\n\nSo, perhaps using a Union-Find data structure with path compression and tracking of the ratios is the way to go.\n\nIn the Union-Find structure, each node has a parent and a weight, which represents the ratio from the node to its parent.\n\nWhen we merge two sets, we check if the existing paths between the two nodes match the new constraint. If not, the system is inconsistent.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Initialize each node as its own parent, with weight 1.\n\n- For each edge, get u, v, g, l.\n\n   Compute s = l / g. If s is not an integer, output NO.\n\n   Now, find a and b such that a * b = s and GCD(a, b) = 1.\n\n   Then, the ratio is a / b.\n\n   Now, find the current ratio of u to v in the Union-Find structure.\n\n   If u and v are in the same set, compute the expected ratio and compare with the new ratio.\n\n   If they differ, output NO.\n\n   Else, union the sets, setting the new weight such that the ratio is maintained.\n\nBut how do we find a and b for each edge?\n\nWait, for each edge, u and v are known. So, the ratio a / b must be u / v.\n\nBut since a and b are coprimes, this ratio is in its reduced form.\n\nSo, to find a and b, we can compute the reduced form of u and v, and then find a and b such that a = (u / d), b = (v / d), where d is the GCD of u and v.\n\nWait, no. Because a and b need to be such that a * b = s, and a / b = (u / v).\n\nSo, a = (u / v) * b.\n\nBut a * b = s → (u / v) * b² = s → b² = (s v) / u.\n\nWhich brings us back to the earlier approach.\n\nSo, for each edge:\n\ns = l / g.\n\nCheck if s is an integer.\n\nCompute d = GCD(u, v).\n\nCheck if u and v are such that (s * v) is divisible by u.\n\nIf not, invalid.\n\nElse, compute temp = (s * v) / u.\n\nCheck if temp is a perfect square.\n\nIf not, invalid.\n\nElse, compute k = sqrt(temp).\n\nThen, b = k.\n\na = (u / v) * k.\n\nBut wait, because a and b must be integers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent a and b as fractions.\n\nBecause, for example, u and v may not be multiples of each other, leading to a and b being fractions.\n\nSo, perhaps we can represent a and b as fractions in reduced form.\n\nLet me think: For each edge, the ratio a / b is equal to u / v, but a and b are coprimes.\n\nSo, to find a and b, we can represent u and v in their reduced form.\n\nLet d = GCD(u, v). So, u = d * u', v = d * v', where u' and v' are coprimes.\n\nThen, a and b must satisfy a / b = u' / v'.\n\nSince a and b are coprimes, the ratio must be in the form a : b = u' : v'.\n\nSo, a = k * u', b = k * v' for some integer k.\n\nThen, a * b = k² * u' v' = s.\n\nSo, k² = s / (u' v').\n\nThus, s must be divisible by (u' v'), and the quotient must be a perfect square.\n\nSo, the steps for each edge are:\n\n1. Compute s = l / g. Check if s is integer. If not, invalid.\n\n2. Compute d = GCD(u, v).\n\n   u' = u / d.\n\n   v' = v / d.\n\n3. Check if u' and v' are coprimes. They should be, since d is the GCD.\n\n4. Compute the product u' * v'. Call this p.\n\n   Check if s is divisible by p. If not, invalid.\n\n   Else, compute q = s / p.\n\n   Check if q is a perfect square. If not, invalid.\n\n   Else, k = sqrt(q).\n\n5. Then, a = k * u', b = k * v'.\n\n6. Now, a and b must be coprimes. Because any common divisor of a and b would have to divide both u' and v', but u' and v' are coprimes. So, a and b are coprimes.\n\nSo, now, for each edge, we have a and b.\n\nSo, the ratio is a / b, which is (k u')/(k v') = u'/v' = (u/d)/(v/d) = u/v.\n\nWhich makes sense.\n\nSo, this process ensures that a and b are integers, coprimes, and a * b = s.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each edge:\n\nCompute s = l / g. If not integer, output NO.\n\nCompute d = GCD(u, v).\n\nu_prime = u / d.\n\nv_prime = v / d.\n\nCompute p = u_prime * v_prime.\n\nIf s % p != 0 → NO.\n\nq = s // p.\n\nCheck if q is a perfect square. If not → NO.\n\nCompute k = sqrt(q). Must be integer.\n\na = u_prime * k.\n\nb = v_prime * k.\n\nNow, the ratio is a : b.\n\nSo, for the edge, the constraint is u's value is a times some variable, and v's value is b times the same variable.\n\nBut how does this fit into the Union-Find structure?\n\nIn the Union-Find structure, each node has a parent and a weight. The weight represents the ratio from the node to its parent.\n\nSo, for each edge, we need to set the constraint that the ratio of u to v is a : b.\n\nWhich can be represented as:\n\nvalue[u] / value[v] = a / b.\n\nBut in terms of the Union-Find structure, this is equivalent to value[u] * b = value[v] * a.\n\nSo, during the find operation, we can adjust the weights to represent the path from the node to the root, and during the union, we can merge the two components while checking for consistency.\n\nSo, the Union-Find structure needs to support path compression and union by rank, and also track the multiplicative factor from each node to its parent.\n\nSo, for each node x, the structure keeps track of parent[x], and weight[x], where weight[x] is the factor such that value[x] = value[parent[x]] * weight[x].\n\nSo, during the find operation, when we find the root of x, we also update the weight to represent the product of all the weights along the path.\n\nThus, when comparing two nodes u and v, their values are value_root_u * (product along path from root to u) and similarly for v. But since the root is the same, the product is accounted for in their weights.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the weight as the factor from the node to its parent. So, for a node x, value[x] = value[parent[x]] * weight[x].\n\nThus, when finding the root of x, we can compute the product of all weights from x to the root, giving the value of x relative to the root.\n\nSo, during the find operation, we can update the weight of x to be the direct path from x to the root.\n\nThus, for each edge, when we process u and v, we need to find their roots and the current ratio between them. Then, compare with the new ratio a/b.\n\nSo, the process for each edge is:\n\n- Find the roots of u and v, and compute the current ratio between them.\n\n- Compare with the new ratio a/b.\n\n- If they are different, the system is inconsistent → output NO.\n\n- Else, union the two components, adjusting the weights so that the new ratio is maintained.\n\nSo, the key is to implement the Union-Find structure with this capability.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this.\n\nImplementing the Union-Find structure:\n\nEach node has a parent and a weight.\n\nThe find function returns the root of the node, and updates the weight to be the product of the path from the node to the root.\n\nThe union function takes two nodes u and v, along with the ratio a/b that must hold between them.\n\nSo, the steps for the union are:\n\n1. Find the roots of u and v. Let them be ru and rv.\n\n2. If ru == rv, check if the current ratio between u and v matches a/b. If not, return False.\n\n3. Else, attach one tree to the other. Let's say we attach rv's tree to ru's tree. Then, set the weight of rv to be such that the ratio is maintained.\n\nBut how?\n\nThe ratio between ru and rv is determined by the weights.\n\nWait, value[ru] is the root, and value[rv] is value[ru] * weight[rv], because rv's weight is the factor from rv to its parent (which is now ru).\n\nWait, no. Because when attaching rv to ru, the weight of rv should be such that value[rv] = value[ru] * (some factor). But the factor depends on the a/b ratio.\n\nWait, the constraint is value[u] / value[v] = a / b.\n\nAfter the find operation, value[u] = value[ru] * w_u.\n\nvalue[v] = value[rv] * w_v.\n\nSo, the constraint is (value[ru] * w_u) / (value[rv] * w_v) = a / b.\n\nBut when we attach rv's tree to ru's tree, we want to set the weight of rv such that the above holds.\n\nSo, the new weight for rv is w_new, which is value[rv] / value[ru] = ?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this backward.\n\nWait, after the union, the tree is attached such that ru is the parent of rv.\n\nSo, value[rv] = value[ru] * weight[rv].\n\nSo, the ratio between ru and rv is value[ru] / value[rv] = 1 / weight[rv].\n\nBut according to the constraint, the ratio between u and v is a/b.\n\nWhich is:\n\n(value[u] ) / (value[v] ) = a/b.\n\nBut value[u] = value[ru] * w_u.\n\nvalue[v] = value[rv] * w_v.\n\nBut after union, rv's parent is ru, so value[rv] = value[ru] * weight[rv].\n\nSo, value[v] = value[ru] * weight[rv] * w_v.\n\nThus, the ratio becomes:\n\n(value[ru] * w_u) / (value[ru] * weight[rv] * w_v) = w_u / (weight[rv] * w_v) = a / b.\n\nSo, rearranged:\n\nw_u / (w_v * weight[rv]) = a / b → weight[rv] = (w_u * b) / (a * w_v).\n\nBut since weight[rv] must be a rational number, we can represent it as a fraction to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.\n\nWait, but using fractions might complicate the code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent all weights as numerators and denominators, but that could get messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent the weights as integers by storing them as logarithms, but that's probably not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire system can be handled using integers and fractions, but that's going to be computationally expensive.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps using a Union-Find structure with weighted edges, implemented with path compression and handling of the ratios as fractions, is the way to go.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to represent each node's value as a multiple of a base variable. For example, assign a variable to each connected component, and represent each node's value as a multiple of that variable. But then, during the union, we can enforce the constraints.\n\nBut this seems similar to the Union-Find approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to implement the Union-Find structure with path compression and tracking of the ratios as fractions.\n\nBut in code, fractions can be represented as tuples of numerator and denominator.\n\nSo, the weight for each node is a tuple (num, den), representing the factor from the node to its parent.\n\nSo, during the find operation, when we traverse the path from a node to its root, we can accumulate the product of the weights as a fraction.\n\nFor example, when finding the root of node x, we traverse from x to its parent, and multiply the fractions along the way. Once at the root, we update the weight of x to be the direct path from x to the root.\n\nSo, in code, the find function would look something like this:\n\ndef find(x):\n    if parent[x] != x:\n        orig_parent = parent[x]\n        parent[x] = find(parent[x])\n        # Update the weight of x to be the product of the path from x to root\n        # which is the product of the original weight of x and the weight of the root?\n        # Wait, perhaps not. Maybe the weight of x is the product of the path from x to its parent, which is now updated to the root.\n\n        # So, when x's parent is updated to the root, the weight of x becomes the product of the path from x to the root.\n\n        # So, the new weight of x is the product of the old weight and the path from orig_parent to root.\n\n        # So, weight[x] *= weight[orig_parent]\n\n        # Wait, no. Because the weight is from x to its parent. So, when the parent is updated, the new weight is the product of the old weight and the parent's weight.\n\n        # So, weight[x] = weight[x] * weight[orig_parent]\n\n        # But since the parent's weight is now updated to the root's weight, perhaps it's better to recompute the path.\n\n        # Alternatively, perhaps during the find, we can compute the product of the weights along the path.\n\n        # So, in the find function, keep track of the product as we go.\n\n        # For example:\n\n        # def find(x):\n        #     if parent[x] != x:\n        #         orig_parent = parent[x]\n        #         root = find(orig_parent)\n        #         parent[x] = root\n        #         # The weight from x to root is the product of the weight from x to orig_parent and orig_parent to root.\n        #         weight[x] = (weight[x] * weight[orig_parent]) \n        #         return root\n        #     return x\n\n        # But wait, this isn't quite right. Because weight[x] is the factor from x to orig_parent, and orig_parent's weight is now the factor from orig",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of laughy mushrooms on each lawn based on the given roads and their constraints. Each road provides the GCD and LCM of the mushrooms on the connected lawns, which can be used to derive a system of equations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the problem as a graph where nodes are lawns and edges are roads with constraints on mushroom counts.\n2. **Constraints Handling**: Each edge constraint can be translated into a ratio between the two nodes. Specifically, for each edge, compute the ratio of the number of mushrooms on the two lawns using the given GCD and LCM.\n3. **Union-Find Data Structure**: Use a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to manage connected components and track the multiplicative factors (weights) between nodes. This helps in efficiently checking for consistency across the graph.\n4. **Path Compression and Union by Rank**: Implement path compression and union by rank to keep the Union-Find operations efficient.\n5. **Consistency Check**: For each edge, check if the derived ratio is consistent with the existing constraints in the Union-Find structure. If any inconsistency is found, output \"NO\".\n6. **Solution Construction**: If all constraints are consistent, construct the solution by assigning values to each node based on the derived ratios.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom math import gcd\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    m = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    edges = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(input[ptr])-1  # 0-based\n        ptr +=1\n        v = int(input[ptr])-1\n        ptr +=1\n        g = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        edges.append( (u, v, g, l) )\n\n    parent = list(range(n))\n    weight = [ (1, 1) for _ in range(n) ]  # weight is a tuple (num, den), representing x = num/den\n\n    def find(u):\n        if parent[u] != u:\n            orig_parent = parent[u]\n            root = find(orig_parent)\n            parent[u] = root\n            # Update the weight: multiply by the original weight of the parent\n            # Since the parent's weight is now directly to the root,\n            # the weight from u to root is weight[u] * weight[orig_parent]\n            # But since orig_parent's weight is now updated, we need to recompute\n            # Wait, no.

Each edge's constraints are translated into a ratio, and the Union-Find structure ensures these ratios are consistent across the graph. If any inconsistency is found, the solution outputs \"NO\". If consistent, the values of mushrooms on each lawn are computed and printed.",
