He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about finding the number of positive integers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeros. And then I have to output all those n's in increasing order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n, because there are usually more 2s than 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is sum of n divided by 5, plus n divided by 25, and so on until n divided by 5^k is zero.\n\nSo, for example, for n=5: 5//5 =1, 5//25=0. So total 1 zero. For n=6, same as 5, since 6//5 is 1, 6//25 is 0. So 1 zero. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 5! is 120, which has one zero. 6! is 720, which also has one zero. Oh right, because 6 divided by 5 is 1, but 7,8,9 also divide by 5 once. So when m is 1, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9— five numbers. That's why the sample input '1' gives 5 6 7 8 9 as outputs.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n where the count of trailing zeros equals m. Now, how do I find all such n's?\n\nI think the approach is to find the minimal n that gives exactly m zeros, and then see how many consecutive numbers after that also give m zeros.\n\nWait, right. Because the number of trailing zeros increases as n increases, but sometimes it jumps by more than one. For example, moving from 24 to 25: 24! has 4 zeros (from 24//5=4, 24//25=0), but 25! adds an extra zero because 25 is divisible by 5 twice. So 25! has 6 zeros. So between 24 and 25, the zero count increases by 2. So for m=5, the numbers would be 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30? Wait, wait. Wait, let me compute.\n\nWait, 24: 24/5=4, 24/25=0. So 4 zeros.\n\n25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1 → total 6.\n\n26: same as 25, because 26/5 is 5, 26/25 is 1 → 6.\n\nSimilarly, 27,28,29,30: 30 is 5*6, so 30/5=6, 30/25=1 → 7.\n\nWait, so for m=5, is there any n that gives exactly 5 zeros? Because 24 gives 4, 25 gives 6. So no. So the answer for m=5 would be zero.\n\nWait, but the sample input was m=1, which had 5 numbers. So the approach is, for a given m, find all n where the count is m. But sometimes, like m=5, there may be none.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For a given m, find the smallest n such that the number of trailing zeros is >=m. Then check if that n has exactly m zeros. If yes, then the next numbers will also have the same count until another multiple of 5 is found.\n\nWait, but how do I find all possible n's that have exactly m zeros.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, there can be either 0 or 5 or some other numbers, but wait, looking at the sample, when m=1, there are 5 numbers. So maybe for each m, the numbers form a consecutive range of 5 numbers, or if m is too low, perhaps less. Or maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps for each m, the numbers n that satisfy the condition form a contiguous block of 5 numbers, unless m is such that the lower bound is less than 5. Like for m=0, only n=0, but since n must be positive, perhaps no solution. Hmm, but the problem statement says positive integers, so n starts from 1.\n\nWait, let's think differently. For each m, we can find the minimal n where the count is m. Then, the maximal n where the count is m. If the minimal n is such that adding 4 gives the same count, then the numbers are from n to n+4. Otherwise, perhaps no such numbers.\n\nSo, how do I find the minimal n for a given m?\n\nWe can perform a binary search for the minimal n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list all such integers \\( n \\) in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until \\( \\frac{n}{5^k} \\) is zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Minimal \\( n \\)**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is at least \\( m \\). This can be efficiently found using binary search.\n\n3. **Check for Exact Zero Count**: Once the minimal \\( n \\) is found, we need to check if this \\( n \\) actually gives exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. If it does, then we also check the next four consecutive numbers to see if they also give exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros.\n\n4. **Output the Results**: Based on the checks, we will output how many such numbers exist and list them in increasing order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    left = 0\n    right = 5 * m  # Initial estimate, can be adjusted\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            right = mid\n        else:\n            left = mid + 1\n    # Now left is the minimal n with count >= m\n    if count_trailing_zeros(left) != m:\n        return None\n    return left\n\nm = int(input())\n\nresult = []\nif m == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    min_n = find_min_n(m)\n    if not min_n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        # Check from min_n to min_n + 4\n        current = min_n\n        nums = []\n        while True:\n            if count_trailing_zeros(current) != m:\n                break\n            nums.append(current)\n            current += 1\n            if current - min_n >= 5:\n                break\n        print(len(nums))\n        if len(nums) > 0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, nums)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) using the formula mentioned above.\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is at least \\( m \\).\n3. **Main Logic**: After determining the minimal \\( n \\), we check the next four numbers to see if they also have exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. If they do, we collect them and print the results. If no such numbers exist, we print 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the required numbers and handle edge cases where no solution exists.",
