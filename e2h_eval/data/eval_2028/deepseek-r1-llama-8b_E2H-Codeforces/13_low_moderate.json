For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. Let's think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem defines a major triad as having two intervals: 4 semitones and 3 semitones when the notes are ordered in a specific way. Similarly, a minor triad has 3 semitones and then 4 semitones. The order is such that the distances add up correctly to form the triad.\n\nSo, for any given set of three notes, I need to consider all possible orderings (permutations) of these three notes. For each permutation, I calculate the distances between consecutive notes and see if it matches either the major or minor pattern.\n\nWait, but wait—how do I calculate the distance between two notes? Oh right, the notes are arranged in a cyclic manner. So, the distance from a note X to Y is computed by moving forward in the scale, wrapping around as needed. For example, E to C would be 8 semitones because there are 12 notes in total. Because E to F is 1, F to F# is another, and so on, until you reach C again after H.\n\nSo first, I need a way to represent the order of the notes. Let me create a list of the notes in order, including their positions. The notes are given as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, is H correct? Or was it maybe a typo? Because normally, the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, and then back to C. Oh wait, perhaps in the problem statement, H is meant to be B? Or maybe it's a different notation. Hmm, the problem statement says the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's 12 notes, including H instead of A#. Interesting. So the order is:\n\n0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nThen, after H comes C again.\n\nSo the next step is to assign each note an index from 0 to 11.\n\nSo first, I'll create a dictionary mapping each note to its position. Like {'C': 0, 'C#': 1, ..., 'H':11}.\n\nOnce I have that, for any two notes, I can compute the distance as (y - x) mod 12, but since the distance is measured forward, right? So the distance between x and y is (y - x) % 12. Because if y comes after x, it's just y-x. But if y is before x, like E to C, it's (0 - 4) mod 12 = 8, which is correct.\n\nWait no, wait: for E (index 4) to C (0), the distance is (0 -4 +12) mod 12 = 8. Which is correct because from E to C is 8 semitones. So yes, the formula is (y -x) mod 12.\n\nSo for any triplet of notes, say X, Y, Z, I need to consider all permutations of these three notes and for each permutation, compute the distances between the first and second, and between the second and third. Then check if those distances match either major or minor.\n\nBut wait, since the chord is unordered, we need to find any ordering of the three notes that satisfies the major or minor condition. So for each permutation, we calculate the distances and see if they fit.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read the three notes as input.\n\n2. Convert each note into their corresponding indices using the mapping.\n\n3. Generate all possible permutations of these three indices.\n\n4. For each permutation (a, b, c):\n\n   a. Compute distance from a to b: d1 = (b - a) mod 12.\n\n   b. Compute distance from b to c: d2 = (c - b) mod 12.\n\n   c. Compute the total distance from a to c: (d1 + d2) mod 12 should be 7, but wait, maybe not necessary. Because for a major triad, d1 is 4, d2 is 3, summing to 7. For minor, d1 is 3, d2 is4, sum 7.\n\nSo for each permutation, if d1 is 4 and d2 is3 → major. If d1 is 3 and d2 is4 → minor",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of the notes to see if they fit the defined intervals for major or minor triads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Mapping**: First, map each note to its corresponding index in the musical scale. This helps in calculating the distances between notes.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: For the given three notes, generate all possible permutations to consider every possible ordering.\n3. **Calculate Distances**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n4. **Check Triad Type**: Check if the computed distances match the intervals required for a major or minor triad. If they do, classify the chord accordingly; otherwise, classify it as strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Mapping each note to its index\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_indices = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\ndef get_distance(a, b):\n    return (b - a) % 12\n\n# Read input\ninput_notes = input().split()\nnotes = [note_indices[n] for n in input_notes]\n\n# Check all permutations\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    a, b, c = perm\n    d1 = get_distance(a, b)\n    d2 = get_distance(b, c)\n    \n    # Check for major and minor\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\n# If none found\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The notes are mapped to their respective positions in a 12-note scale. This allows us to use these indices to calculate distances.\n2. **Permutations**: Using permutations ensures that every possible order of the notes is considered, which is crucial since the triad can be in any order.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated as the difference modulo 12, which correctly handles the cyclic nature of the scale.\n4. **Triad Check**: For each permutation, we check if the intervals match those of a major or minor triad. If a match is found, we print the result and exit. If no match is found after all permutations are checked, the chord is classified as strange.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the notes to determine the correct triad type, ensuring accuracy and handling all edge cases.",
