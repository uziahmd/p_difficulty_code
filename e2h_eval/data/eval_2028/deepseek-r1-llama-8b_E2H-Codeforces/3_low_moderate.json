Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Lanterns.\" Hmm.\n\nSo, the setup is that Vanya is walking along a straight street of length l. There are n lanterns placed along this street. Each lantern can light all points within a distance d from it. The goal is to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nWait, right. So, the street goes from 0 to l on a number line. Each lantern is at some position ai, and when they light up with radius d, their coverage is [ai - d, ai + d]. But since the street is bounded by 0 and l, we have to make sure that the union of all these intervals covers the entire street from 0 to l.\n\nSo, our task is to determine the smallest possible d where this coverage happens.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nI think the first step is to sort the lanterns' positions. Because if they're not sorted, it's hard to figure out which lanterns cover which parts. Once sorted, we can process them in order and figure out the gaps between their coverage areas.\n\nWait, right. So, for example, imagine two lanterns. After sorting, the first covers from a1-d to a1+d, the second from a2-d to a2+d. But wait, no: actually, each lantern's coverage is a range of [ai -d, ai +d], but the lanterns might overlap. So, after sorting, we can check the maximum coverage from the leftmost lantern, then see if the next lantern starts beyond that point, and calculate the required d based on the gap between the current coverage and the next lantern's start.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could be to model the problem as needing the entire interval [0, l] to be covered by the union of [a_i -d, a_i +d] for all i.\n\nTo find the minimal d, perhaps binary search is a good approach here. Because d can vary, and for each d, we can check if the entire street is covered. If it is, we can try a smaller d; if not, we need a larger one.\n\nYes, binary search seems feasible. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Use binary search on d. The lower bound can be 0, and the upper bound can be the maximum possible needed, which would be the maximum of (l - min(ai), max(ai) - 0). Or perhaps, just set the upper bound to l, since the worst case is when there's only one lantern at one end, requiring d = l.\n3. For each mid value during binary search, check if the entire street is covered.\n4. If yes, set the upper bound to mid, else set the lower bound to mid + epsilon.\n5. Continue until the bounds converge to the minimal d.\n\nBut wait, how do we efficiently check whether a given d is sufficient?\n\nLet's think about the sorted lanterns. We can iterate through each lantern in order and track the farthest point covered so far. For each lantern, its coverage starts at max(0, ai -d) and ends at min(l, ai +d). But since we're processing them in order, the next lantern's coverage must start before or at the current end. Otherwise, there's a gap.\n\nSo, the algorithm for checking is:\n\nInitialize current_end to 0.\n\nFor each ai in sorted list:\n    new_start = ai - d\n    if new_start < 0, then new_start = 0\n    if new_start > current_end:\n        // There's a gap between current_end and new_start. So, the coverage isn't complete.\n        return False\n    current_end = max(current_end, ai +d)\n    // Also, if current_end reaches l, we can break early.\n\nAfter processing all lanterns, also check if current_end >= l.\n\nIf any of these conditions fail, the d is too small.\n\nWait, but wait. Because each lantern's coverage is [ai -d, ai +d], but when you process them in order, the previous lantern's coverage might extend beyond the next lantern's coverage.\n\nWait no, because the next lantern is to the right, so if the next lantern's ai -d is less than or equal to the current_end, then their coverages overlap or meet, so the combined coverage extends further.\n\nBut if ai -d is greater than current_end, then there's a gap between current_end and ai -d, meaning the street isn't fully covered.\n\nSo, the steps for the check function are:\n\n- Sort the lanterns.\n- Set current_end to 0.\n- For each lantern in sorted order:\n   compute the start of this lantern's coverage: s = max(0, ai -d)\n   if s > current_end",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns on a street can illuminate the entire length of the street. The approach involves using binary search to efficiently find the smallest \\( d \\) that ensures full coverage.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns. This helps in processing them in order and checking coverage gaps efficiently.\n2. **Binary Search for Minimum \\( d \\)**: We use binary search to find the smallest \\( d \\). The search range is from 0 to \\( l \\), as the worst-case scenario requires \\( d \\) to be equal to the length of the street.\n3. **Check Coverage for Each \\( d \\)**: For each midpoint \\( d \\) during the binary search, we check if the entire street is covered. This is done by iterating through the sorted lantern positions and ensuring that the coverage intervals overlap or meet without any gaps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef readints():\n    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\na.sort()\n\ndef is_covered(d):\n    current_end = 0\n    for ai in a:\n        start = max(0, ai - d)\n        if start > current_end:\n            return False\n        current_end = max(current_end, ai + d)\n        if current_end >= l:\n            return True\n    return current_end >= l\n\nlow = 0.0\nhigh = l\n\nfor _ in range(100):\n    mid = (low + high) / 2\n    if is_covered(mid):\n        high = mid\n    else:\n        low = mid\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(high))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of lanterns \\( n \\) and the length of the street \\( l \\), followed by the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to facilitate gap checking.\n3. **Binary Search Setup**: The search range for \\( d \\) is initialized from 0 to \\( l \\).\n4. **Coverage Check Function**: For each \\( d \\) during the binary search, this function checks if the entire street is covered by iterating through each lantern and ensuring their coverage intervals do not leave any gaps.\n5. **Adjusting Search Range**: Depending on whether the current \\( d \\) covers the entire street, the search range is adjusted to narrow down to the minimum \\( d \\).\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( d \\) using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
