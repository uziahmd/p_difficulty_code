Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Amusing Joke\" and from the description, it sounds like we need to determine if a pile of letters can be rearranged to form the guest's name and the host's name without any extra letters. Hmm.\n\nSo the input consists of three lines: the first is the guest's name, the second is the host's name, and the third is the pile of letters found. We need to check if combining the letters of the guest and host names gives exactly the pile, with no extras.\n\nRight, so the approach here is to compare the combined letters of the two names with the letters in the pile. If they match exactly in terms of frequency, then output YES; otherwise, NO.\n\nHow do I do that? Well, one way is to count the frequency of each character in the guest and host names, combine them, and then compare with the frequency of the pile.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Read the three input lines.\n2. Concatenate the first two strings (guest + host) into one string.\n3. Count the frequency of each character in this concatenated string.\n4. Do the same for the pile string.\n5. Compare the two frequency dictionaries. If they are identical, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but how to handle the case where the lengths don't match? Oh right, because if the total number of characters in guest and host is not equal to the pile, then it's immediately a NO. So maybe before even counting, we can check the length.\n\nYes, that's a good point. So step 0: check if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, return NO.\n\nOtherwise, proceed to count the letters.\n\nIn Python, how do I count the frequency? Well, the collections.Counter class is perfect for this. It creates a dictionary-like object where the keys are the characters and the values are their counts.\n\nSo, let's outline the code:\n\n- Read the three lines: guest = input().strip(), host = input().strip(), pile = input().strip()\n- combined = guest + host\n- if len(combined) != len(pile): print 'NO' and exit.\n- create counter_combined = Counter(combined)\n- create counter_pile = Counter(pile)\n- if counter_combined == counter_pile: print 'YES' else 'NO'\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, are there any edge cases? For example, when one of the lines is empty? But the problem statement says all lines are not empty, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nWhat about case sensitivity? Oh, the problem says all lines contain uppercase Latin letters, so no issues there.\n\nAnother edge case: what if the sum of guest and host is longer than the pile? Or shorter? Well, the initial length check takes care of that.\n\nLet me test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first line is the guest, second the host, third the pile. So the combined guest+host would be SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ, and the pile is BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMASBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the sample output.\n\nSample Output:\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\nSo for the first case, the combined letters match exactly. For the second, the pile has an extra L and is missing P. Third case has an extra L.\n\nSo the code should correctly handle these.\n\nNow, considering that, the code should work.\n\nPotential issues: What if the guest or host names have different lengths than expected? No, the code doesn't care as long as their combined length equals the pile's length.\n\nAnother thing: using Counter is efficient enough for the constraints, which are up to 100 per line, so combined could be up to 200 characters. That's manageable.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe code will read the three lines, strip any newlines (though in Python, input().strip() will remove trailing and leading whitespace, including newlines), then concatenate the first two.\n\nThen, check lengths. If not equal, print 'NO'.\n\nElse, use Counter on both combined and pile. Compare the two Counters.\n\nIf they are equal, print 'YES'; else, 'NO'.\n\nYes, that's the plan.\n\nNow, writing the code:\n\nRead the three lines:\n\nline1 = input().strip()\nline2 = input().strip()\nline3 = input().strip()\n\ncombined = line1 + line2\n\nif len(combined) != len(line3):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    from collections import Counter\n    cnt_combined = Counter(combined)\n    cnt_pile = Counter(line3)\n    if cnt_combined == cnt_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but importing inside the else clause isn't allowed. Oh right, you can't put the import after else. So better to import at the top.\n\nSo revised code:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nline1 = input().strip()\nline2 = input().strip()\nline3 = input().strip()\n\ncombined = line1 + line2\n\nif len(combined) != len(line3):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    cnt_combined = Counter(combined)\n    cnt_pile = Counter(line3)\n    if cnt_combined == cnt_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\nHost: DEDMOROZ\nCombined: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\n\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nWait, no, the sample input says the first line is guest, second host, third pile.\n\nWait, the first sample in the note says:\n\nFirst sample: the last line can be used to write the names without extra letters. So combined is the guest's name and the host's name.\n\nIn the sample, guest is SANTACLAUS, host is DEDMOROZ, so combined is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ'.\n\nThe pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nWait, but the combined length is len('SANTACLAUS') + len('DEDMOROZ') = 10 + 7 = 17.\n\nThe pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' which is 16 letters?\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me calculate:\n\n\"SANTACLAUS\" is 10 letters:\n\nS A N T A C L A U S → 10.\n\n\"DEDMOROZ\" is 7 letters: D E D M O R O Z → 7. Total 17.\n\nThe pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\": let's count.\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → Wait, how many letters is that?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nBreaking down \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\":\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → Let's count:\n\n1. S\n2. A\n3. N\n4. T\n5. A\n6. M\n7. O\n8. R\n9. O\n10. Z\n11. D\n12. E\n13. D\n14. C\n15. L\n16. A\n17. U\n18. S → So that's 18 letters. But combined was 17. So why does the first sample output YES?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the sample input. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample.\n\nWait, no, the sample note says that the first sample has no extra letters. So perhaps my calculation is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' is 17 letters. Let me recount.\n\nWait, \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\":\n\nLetters:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → Wait, that's 18 letters. Or am I miscounting?\n\nWait, let me count each character:\n\nS (1)\nA (2)\nN (3)\nT (4)\nA (5)\nM (6)\nO (7)\nR (8)\nO (9)\nZ (10)\nD (11)\nE (12)\nD (13)\nC (14)\nL (15)\nA (16)\nU (17)\nS (18)\n\nHmm, that's 18 letters. But the combined length is 17.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. So how does the first sample output YES?\n\nAh, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the guest and host names.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, so the guest is 'SANTACLAUS', the host is 'DEDMOROZ', and the pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nWait, combining guest and host: 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' → length is 10 + 7 = 17.\n\nPile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' → let's count:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → that's 17 letters.\n\nWait, maybe I missed that the pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' which is 17 letters. How?\n\nWait, perhaps it's 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' → S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → let's count:\n\nS(1), A(2), N(3), T(4), A(5), M(6), O(7), R(8), O(9), Z(10), D(11), E(12), D(13), C(14), L(15), A(16), U(17), S(18). Wait that's 18.\n\nHmm, something's off here. Maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS → which is 17 letters. How?\n\nWait, perhaps it's SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS → let's count each letter:\n\nS, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S → 18 letters. Or perhaps I'm wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the guest and host combined have 17 letters, and the pile also has 17 letters. So the code would pass.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The code should handle this correctly regardless.\n\nIn any case, the code logic is correct.\n\nSo the code reads the three lines, combines the first two, checks if the lengths match. Then, count each character's occurrence in both combined and the pile. If they match, output YES.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nI think that's all.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters can be rearranged to form the names of a guest and a host without any extra letters. The approach involves comparing the frequency of each character in the combined names with the frequency of characters in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the three lines of input which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names:** Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Check Lengths:** Ensure the combined length of the guest's and host's names is equal to the length of the pile. If not, immediately return \"NO\".\n4. **Count Frequencies:** Use a frequency counter to count the occurrences of each character in both the combined names and the pile.\n5. **Compare Frequencies:** If the frequency counters for the combined names and the pile are identical, print \"YES\". Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match of character frequencies using Python's `collections.Counter`, ensuring that no extra letters are present and all necessary letters are accounted for.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the three input lines\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Combine the guest and host names\ncombined = guest + host\n\n# Check if the total number of letters matches the pile\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Count the frequency of each character\n    cnt_combined = Counter(combined)\n    cnt_pile = Counter(pile)\n    \n    # Compare the two frequency dictionaries\n    if cnt_combined == cnt_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The code reads three lines from the input, each representing the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n- **Combining Names:** The guest's and host's names are concatenated into a single string to form the target string.\n- **Length Check:** Before proceeding to count characters, the code checks if the combined length matches the pile's length. This quick check ensures efficiency.\n- **Frequency Counting:** Using `Counter` from the `collections` module, the code counts how many times each character appears in both the combined names and the pile.\n- **Comparison:** The frequency counts are compared. If they match exactly, it means the pile can be rearranged to form both names without any extra letters, so the result is \"YES\". Otherwise, the result is \"NO\".\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem constraints and ensures correctness by leveraging character frequency analysis.",
