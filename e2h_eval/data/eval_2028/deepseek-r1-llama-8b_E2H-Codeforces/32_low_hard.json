    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Array Stabilization. Hmm.\n\nThe task is, given an array of integers, to remove exactly one element such that the instability of the remaining array is minimized. Instability is defined as the maximum element minus the minimum element in the array.\n\nSo, I need to find which single element to remove so that the resulting array has the smallest possible max - min. And then output that minimal instability.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this efficiently? Because n can be up to 1e5, so any O(n^2) approach is definitely out of the question. We need something linear or O(n log n), probably.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. The initial idea is that removing a certain element could potentially reduce the max and/or increase the min, thus decreasing the instability.\n\nWait, but for each element, if I remove it, I have to compute the new max and min of the array excluding it. But computing that directly for each element would be O(n) per element, leading to O(n^2) time, which is not feasible for n=1e5.\n\nSo I need a smarter way to compute for each possible removal whether it gives a better (smaller) instability.\n\nWhat's the original max and min? Let's call them current_max and current_min.\n\nWhen I remove an element, the new max could either stay the same or decrease, depending on whether the removed element was the current max. Similarly, the new min could stay the same or increase.\n\nWait, right. So for each element a[i], if a[i] is the current_max, then the new max would be the second maximum of the array. Similarly, if a[i] is the current_min, the new min would be the second min. Otherwise, the max and min remain the same.\n\nBut wait, that's not entirely correct. For example, if you have multiple instances of the current_max, removing one of them won't change the max. So perhaps the approach is to precompute for each position whether it's a max candidate or a min candidate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can precompute the global max and min, and also track the second max and second min. Or perhaps track all the elements except the current max and min, and see what happens when we remove them.\n\nWait, another thought: the minimal instability after removal can't be better than the original instability minus some value. So perhaps the optimal solution is to remove either the current max, current min, or some other element that affects both.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nFirst, find the original max and min of the array. Then, for each element, consider what happens when we remove it.\n\nCase 1: The element being removed is the current max.\n\nIn this case, the new max will be the second maximum of the array. The min remains the same as before. So the new instability is (second_max - min).\n\nCase 2: The element is the current min.\n\nThe new min becomes the second min, and the max remains the same. So the new instability is (max - second_min).\n\nCase 3: The element is neither the current max nor the current min.\n\nThen, the new max and min are the same as the original. So the new instability is (max - min), same as before.\n\nWait, no. Because in this case, when we remove an element that's neither max nor min, the max and min of the remaining array could potentially change. Wait, no—because if the element is not max or min, then there are still other elements that are the max and min. So removing this element doesn't affect the max or min.\n\nAh, right! So if the element is neither the max nor the min, then the max and min of the remaining array are the same as the original. So the instability remains the same.\n\nSo the key insight is: when we remove an element that's either the max or the min, the instability could potentially decrease. Otherwise, the instability remains the same.\n\nSo the minimal instability can only be achieved by removing either the current max, current min, or possibly other elements that are part of the max or min.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple max elements? Like, if the array is [3, 3, 1]. The max is 3, and there are two occurrences. If I remove one of them, the new max is still 3. So the new instability is max (3) minus min (1) = 2. Which is same as before.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Find the current max and min of the entire array.\n- Also, find the second max and second min, but only if they exist.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's see.\n\nThe plan is:\n\n1. Compute the current max and min of the array.\n\n2. For each element in the array,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Key Values**: First, find the current maximum (max_val) and minimum (min_val) values of the array.\n2. **Track Second Max and Min**: Additionally, track the second maximum (second_max) and second minimum (second_min) values. These are crucial because removing the first max or min might affect the instability.\n3. **Evaluate Each Element Removal**: For each element in the array:\n   - If the element is the current max, the new max becomes the second_max.\n   - If the element is the current min, the new min becomes the second_min.\n   - If the element is neither the max nor the min, the max and min remain unchanged.\n4. **Calculate Instability**: Compute the instability for each scenario and keep track of the minimum instability observed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal instability without having to recompute the entire array's max and min for each possible removal, which would be computationally expensive.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, *rest = map(int, open(0).read().split())\na = rest[0]\na = list(map(int, a.split()))\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\nmax_val = max(a)\nmin_val = min(a)\n\n# Find all elements that are either max or min\ncandidates = []\nfor num in a:\n    if num == max_val or num == min_val:\n        candidates.append(num)\n\n# Now, for each candidate, see what happens when it's removed\nmin_instability = float('inf')\ncurrent_max = max_val\ncurrent_min = min_val\n\n# Also find the second_max and second_min\nsecond_max = -float('inf')\nsecond_min = float('inf')\n\nfor num in a:\n    if num > current_max:\n        second_max = current_max\n        current_max = num\n    elif num < current_min:\n        second_min = current_min\n        current_min = num\n    if num < current_max:\n        if num > second_max:\n            second_max = num\n    if num > current_min:\n        if num < second_min:\n            second_min = num\n\n# Now, for each candidate, calculate the potential instability\nfor num in candidates:\n    if num == max_val:\n        new_max = second_max\n        new_min = min_val\n        inst = new_max - new_min\n    elif num == min_val:\n        new_min = second_min\n        new_max = max_val\n        inst = new_max - new_min\n    else:\n        inst = max_val - min_val  # same as before\n\n    if inst < min_instability:\n        min_instability = inst\n\n# Now, check the cases where the removed element is not a candidate\n# But wait, these cases can't give a better result than the current min_instability\n# Because the instability remains the same as original when you remove non-candidate\n# So no need to process them separately\nprint(min_instability)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Identify Key Values**: We start by determining the maximum and minimum values of the array. This helps us understand the baseline instability.\n- **Track Second Max and Min**: By tracking the second highest and lowest values, we can quickly adjust the instability when we remove the max or min.\n- **Evaluate Each Removal**: For each candidate element (either max or min), we simulate its removal and compute the new instability. This allows us to efficiently find the minimal instability without unnecessary recomputations.\n- **Efficient Calculation**: By focusing on the critical points (max and min) and their alternatives, we ensure the solution runs efficiently even for large arrays.\n\nThis method ensures that we handle up to 100,000 elements efficiently, providing an optimal solution to the problem.",
