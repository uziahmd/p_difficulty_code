Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Cards.\" Hmm. Let me read the description carefully.\n\nSo, Vanya has some cards with numbers on them. Each number can be positive, negative, or zero, but their absolute value doesn't exceed x. Natasha hid all his cards, but he found n of them. He wants the sum of all the found cards to be zero. But right now, the sum isn't zero. So, he needs to find some more cards (from the infinite supply of -x to x) to add to the found ones so that the total sum is zero. The goal is to find the minimum number of additional cards required.\n\nThe input gives us n and x, followed by the list of n found cards. We need to output the minimal number of cards needed.\n\nWait, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I need to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. The target is to make the total sum zero, which means we need the additional cards to contribute a sum of -S. Because the sum of all cards plus the new ones should be zero.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of integers (each between -x and x) whose sum is exactly equal to -S. Also, each card added can be any integer in that range, including zero. Oh, wait no—wait, can they be zero? Because if you add a zero, it doesn't change the sum. So adding zeros would not help unless the sum is already zero.\n\nWait, but the initial sum S might not be zero. So, for example, if S is 5, then the new cards' sum must be -5. So we need to find the minimal number of integers (each at most x in absolute value) that add up to -5.\n\nBut wait, wait. The new cards can have any values as long as their absolute values are ≤x. So, each new card contributes a certain amount to the sum. We need the sum of these contributions to be equal to -S. And we want to minimize the number of such cards.\n\nHmm, so the problem becomes: given a target T = -S, find the minimal number of terms (each term is an integer between -x and x, inclusive) such that their sum is T.\n\nSo, the key is to find the minimal k such that T can be written as the sum of k integers, each of which is ≤x in absolute value.\n\nLet me think about how to compute this.\n\nCase 1: If T is zero. Then no additional cards are needed, since the sum is already zero. Wait, no—the found cards sum to S, which is not necessarily zero. Wait, no: if the sum is zero, then no additional cards are needed. So the first step is to compute S, the sum of the found cards. If S is zero, then the answer is zero.\n\nOtherwise, T is -S. We need to find the minimal k where T can be expressed as the sum of k numbers, each with absolute value ≤x.\n\nLet me think about how to compute k.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible sum we can get with k cards? Well, each card can contribute up to x. So the maximum sum is k * x. Similarly, the minimum sum is -k*x.\n\nSo, for T, the sum we need, to have a solution:\n\n- The absolute value of T must be ≤ k * x. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nWait, no. Because each card can be any integer from -x to x. So for a given k, if |T| ≤ k * x, then it's possible to reach T with k cards.\n\nBut wait, for example, when k=2 and x=3, T could be 4 (if each card is 2). Or T=-5: perhaps 3 + (-2) =1, no. Wait, no—wait, 3+2=5, but 3+3=6 which is larger than 5. So, for T=5, you can have two 3's, but if x is 3, then 3+2=5 is allowed if x is 2. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, each card can contribute up to x in absolute value. So for each card, the contribution is at most x (could be positive or negative). So for k cards, the maximum possible sum is k*x, and the minimum is -k*x.\n\nSo, if T is outside of [-k*x, k*x], it's impossible to reach T with k cards.\n\nBut our goal is to find the minimal k such that T is within that range and also that |T| can be achieved with k steps.\n\nWait, but perhaps even if |T| is ≤k*x, it's",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his found cards equals zero. Each card can have an integer value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: Compute the sum of the values on the found cards. Let's call this sum S.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: The target sum for the additional cards is -S, as we need the total sum to be zero.\n3. **Find Minimum Cards**: We need to find the smallest number of additional cards (k) such that the sum of these k cards equals the target sum. Each card can contribute a value between -x and x. Therefore, the sum of k cards must be at least -k*x and at most k*x. If the target sum T is within this range, it is achievable with k cards.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nif s == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    t = -s\n    if t == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        # Find the minimal k where |t| <= k * x\n        k = abs(t) // x\n        if k == 0:\n            k = 1\n        print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum (S)**: Sum the values of the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum (T)**: The target sum for the additional cards is -S.\n3. **Check for Zero Sum**: If the current sum S is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Compute Minimum Cards (k)**: The minimum number of cards required is the smallest integer k such that the absolute value of T is less than or equal to k times x. This ensures that the sum can be achieved with k cards each contributing up to x in absolute value.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of additional cards needed by leveraging the constraints on the possible values of each card.",
