Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Vasily has some candles and can make new ones from the stubs. The goal is to find out how many hours he can keep the room lit. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nHmm, the problem says that each candle burns for one hour before going out. Then, b of these stubs can be made into a new candle. So the process is: burn as many candles as possible, collect the stubs, exchange them for new candles, and repeat until you don't have enough stubs left to make any more.\n\nLet me take the example given. For input 4 2: initially, 4 candles. They burn for 4 hours. Then, he takes those 4 stubs and makes 2 new candles. He burns those, adding 2 hours, making total 6. Then, he has 2 stubs again, which he uses to make another candle. That's another hour, totaling 7. Now, he only has one stub, which isn't enough to make another candle. So the answer is 7.\n\nSo the approach is to simulate this process step by step. Start with the initial number of candles 'a'. Burn all of them, add 'a' to the total hours. Then, collect 'a' stubs. Exchange them for (a // b) new candles. The remaining stubs are a % b. Add the new candles to the total, and then burn them, adding their count to the total hours. The stubs from these new candles are added to the existing ones.\n\nWait, no. Wait: when you make new candles, each candle comes from b stubs. So for every x new candles made, you spend b*x stubs and get x candles. Each of those x candles contributes 1 hour each, so x more hours. Also, after burning, they produce x stubs, which are added back to the pool.\n\nSo perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize total_hours = 0\n2. current_stubs = a\n3. while current_stubs >= b:\n   a. Make new_candles = current_stubs // b\n   b. total_hours += new_candles\n   c. current_stubs = (current_stubs % b) + new_candles  # because new_candles are burned and now become stubs.\n4. Return total_hours.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait let's test this logic with the first example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ncurrent_stubs =4.\n\nLoop since 4>=2.\n\nnew_candles=2.\n\ntotal becomes 2. current_stubs =4%2=0 +2=2.\n\nAgain, 2>=2: new_candles=1. total becomes 3. current_stubs =0+1=1.\n\nNow 1<2, loop ends. total is 3? Wait wait, that's not right. Because in the example, the total was 7.\n\nWait, I must have missed something. Oh wait, the initial a is 4. So the initial step is to burn all 4, which adds 4 hours. Then, the stubs are 4, which can make 2 new candles. So the total is 4+2=6. Then, those 2 new candles burn, adding 2 hours, total 8. Then, the stubs are 2, which make 1 new candle. So total 9. But wait the example says 7. Hmm, maybe my initial understanding is wrong.\n\nWait wait no, the example says that the initial four candles are burned, giving 4 hours. Then, using 4 stubs, make 2 candles, which add 2 hours. Then, after burning those, stubs are 2, which can make another candle. So 2 hours from that candle, making the total 4+2+2=8? Or wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait the sample input is 4 2, output is 7. How?\n\nLet me re-examine the note. It says: for the first four hours, he lights up the candles. Then, he uses four stubs to make two new ones, which burn for two hours. Then, those two stubs make another candle, which burns for one hour. So total is 4+2+1=7.\n\nAh, I see. So my initial approach misses that. Because when you exchange stubs, you get new candles which also generate stubs when burned.\n\nSo in the algorithm, each time you create new_candles, you have to account for the fact that those new candles will be burned, adding to the total, and also their stubs will be added back.\n\nBut in my initial approach, I only added new_candles once. So I think I need to model each step properly.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- Each time, calculate how many new candles can be made.\n- Burn those candles, adding to the total.\n- Collect the stubs from those candles.\n\nBut how do I model this in code?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the process as:\n\nStart with 'a' candles. These give 'a' hours, and 'a' stubs.\n\nThen, while the number of stubs is >= b, do:\n\n- Make as many new candles as possible (stubs // b)\n- Add these new candles to the total hours.\n- The new candles, when burned, will add their count to the stubs (since each gives a stub).\n- The remaining stubs are (stubs % b), which are carried over.\n\nSo the process is:\n\ntotal = a\n\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n\n    new = stubs // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    stubs = (stubs % b) + new\n\nSo let's see for a=4, b=2:\n\ntotal starts at 4.\n\nstubs =4.\n\nLoop:\n\nnew=4//2=2. total becomes 6.\n\nstubs =4%2=0 +2=2.\n\nLoop again:\n\nnew=1. total becomes 7.\n\nstubs=0 +1=1.\n\nLoop ends.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: input 6 3.\n\nInitial total=6, stubs=6.\n\nLoop:\n\n6//3=2. total=8.\n\nstubs=0 +2=2.\n\nLoop ends.\n\nSo output is 8, which matches the sample.\n\nGreat! So the algorithm is correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read a and b.\n\n2. Compute the initial total as a.\n\n3. Compute stubs as a.\n\n4. While stubs >=b:\n\n   a. new = stubs //b\n\n   b. total += new\n\n   c. stubs = (stubs % b) + new\n\n5. Output total.\n\nSo the code needs to read a and b from input.\n\nIn Python, we can read the input as two integers.\n\nImplementing this should handle all cases.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nTest case 1: a=1, b=1000. Then stubs=1 <1000, so total is 1.\n\nTest case 2: a=1000, b=1000. Then stubs=1000. new=1. total becomes 1001. stubs becomes 1+1=2. Since 2<1000, loop ends. So total is 1001.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5. Initial total 5. stubs=5. new=1. total 6. stubs=0+1=1. Loop ends. So total is 6.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=3.\n\nInitial: total=10, stubs=10.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nnew=3 (10//3=3). total=13. stubs=10%3=1 +3=4.\n\nSecond iteration: new=1 (4//3=1). total=14. stubs=4%3=1 +1=2. Now 2<3, loop ends.\n\nSo total is 14.\n\nCheck:\n\nBurn 10 → 10h.\n\nMake 3 from 10 stubs, burn 3 → 3h. Now stubs 10 -3*3=1 +3=4.\n\nFrom 4 stubs, make 1, burn → 1h. Stubs:4-3=1 +1=2.\n\nTotal 10+3+1=14.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute total = a.\n\nstubs = a.\n\nloop:\n\nif stubs < b: break.\n\nnew = stubs // b\n\ntotal += new\n\nstubs = (stubs % b) + new\n\nRepeat.\n\nSo in code:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n\n    new = stubs // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes, that should do it.\n\nTesting with the examples:\n\nFor 4 2:\n\nLoop 1: new=2, total=6, stubs=2.\n\nLoop 2: new=1, total=7, stubs=1.\n\nPrint 7.\n\nFor 6 3:\n\nLoop: new=2, total=8. stubs=2.\n\nPrint 8.\n\nLooks correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has and the stubs from burned-out candles. The process involves burning candles, collecting their stubs, and using those stubs to make new candles until there are not enough stubs left to make another candle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`, which will burn for `a` hours.\n2. **Collect Stubs**: After burning all initial candles, collect the stubs. Each candle that burns for an hour leaves a stub.\n3. **Make New Candles**: Use the collected stubs to make new candles. The number of new candles is determined by how many groups of `b` stubs we have (since `b` stubs can be turned into one new candle).\n4. **Repeat Process**: Continue making new candles from the stubs, adding each new candle's burn time to the total hours, and updating the number of stubs accordingly until there are not enough stubs to make another candle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the integers `a` and `b` from the input.\n2. **Initial Burn**: The initial number of candles `a` is burned, contributing `a` hours to the total.\n3. **Stub Collection**: After burning the initial candles, we collect `a` stubs.\n4. **Candle Making Loop**: While there are enough stubs to make at least one new candle (`stubs >= b`), we:\n   - Calculate the number of new candles that can be made.\n   - Add the burn time of these new candles to the total hours.\n   - Update the number of stubs to reflect the remaining stubs after making new candles plus the stubs from the newly burned candles.\n5. **Output Result**: Once the loop ends, the total number of hours the room can be illuminated is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum hours by iteratively converting stubs into new candles until it's no longer possible, ensuring optimal use of resources.",
