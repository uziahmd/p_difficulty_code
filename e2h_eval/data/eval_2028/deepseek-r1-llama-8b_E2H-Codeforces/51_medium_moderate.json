Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Amusing Joke\" and from the description, it sounds like we need to determine if a pile of letters can be rearranged to form the guest's name and the host's name without any extra letters. Hmm.\n\nSo the input consists of three lines: the first is the guest's name, the second is the host's name, and the third is the pile of letters found. We need to check if combining the letters of the guest and host names gives exactly the pile, with no extras.\n\nRight, so the approach here is to compare the combined letters of the two names with the letters in the pile. If they match exactly in terms of frequency, then output YES; otherwise, NO.\n\nHow do I do that? Well, one way is to count the frequency of each character in the guest and host names, combine them, and then compare with the frequency of the pile.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Read the three input lines.\n2. Concatenate the first two strings (guest + host) into one string.\n3. Count the frequency of each character in this concatenated string.\n4. Do the same for the pile string.\n5. Compare the two frequency dictionaries. If they are identical, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but how to handle the case where the lengths don't match? Oh right, because if the total number of characters in guest and host is not equal to the pile, then it's immediately a NO. So maybe before even counting, we can check the length.\n\nYes, that's a good point. So step 0: check if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, return NO.\n\nOtherwise, proceed to count the letters.\n\nIn Python, how do I count the frequency? Well, the collections.Counter class is perfect for this. It creates a dictionary-like object where the keys are the characters and the values are their counts.\n\nSo, let's outline the code:\n\n- Read the three lines: guest = input().strip(), host = input().strip(), pile = input().strip()\n- combined = guest + host\n- if len(combined) != len(pile): print 'NO' and exit.\n- create counter_combined = Counter(combined)\n- create counter_pile = Counter(pile)\n- if counter_combined == counter_pile: print 'YES' else 'NO'\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, are there any edge cases? For example, when one of the names is empty? But the problem statement says all lines are not empty, so each name has at least one character. So no problem.\n\nWhat about uppercase letters? The problem says all letters are uppercase, so no issues with case sensitivity.\n\nAnother edge case: when the guest or host has repeated letters. But Counter handles that correctly by adding up the counts.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, no, the actual input is three lines, but the way the user presented it is as a list of three strings. But in the actual code, each line is read separately.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line the host's name, the third line the pile. So in code, we can read each line with input(), stripping any leading/trailing whitespace, including newlines.\n\nSo in code:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combined = guest + host.\n\nIf len(combined) != len(pile), print 'NO' and exit.\n\nElse, count the letters.\n\nSo for the first sample:\n\nGuest is 'SANTACLAUS' which is 10 letters.\n\nHost is 'DEDMOROZ' which is 8 letters. Combined is 18 letters.\n\nPile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' which is 18 letters.\n\nThe combined letters should have all the letters needed, and the pile's letters must match.\n\nIn the first sample, the pile can form both names without leftovers.\n\nIn the second sample, the pile is shorter than the combined length, but wait no: in the second sample, perhaps the combined length is 10+9=19, and the pile is 19 letters, but some letters are missing.\n\nWait, let me think. Let's compute:\n\nSample 2:\n\nGuest: PAPAINOEL → 10 letters.\n\nHost: JOULUPUKKI → 10 letters. Combined length is 20.\n\nPile: BABCHRI... something. Wait, the actual pile in sample 2 is 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER' → when concatenated, let's count:\n\n'BABBO...' Let's see, perhaps the pile is longer than 20 letters? Or maybe the combined guest+host is 10+10=20, but the pile is 21 letters. So the initial length check would fail, hence output 'NO'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the second sample, the combined length is equal, but the counts are different.\n\nSo in the code, the initial length check is crucial.\n\nSo the code logic seems solid.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, import Counter from collections.\n\nThen, read the three lines as described.\n\nThen, check if the sum of the lengths is equal to the pile's length.\n\nIf not, print NO.\n\nElse, count the letters.\n\nCompare the two counters.\n\nIf they are equal, print YES, else NO.\n\nYes.\n\nSo now, writing the code.\n\nI'll write:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in the sample input given, the output for the second test case is NO because there's a missing 'P' and an extra 'L'. Let's see.\n\nIn the second sample, guest is 'PAPAINOEL' and host is 'JOULUPUKKI'. So the combined letters include two 'P's: one in guest and none in host?\n\nWait, 'PAPAINOEL' has 'P' appearing twice: positions 0 and 3 (P A P A ...). So combined has 2 P's.\n\nHost is 'JOULUPUKKI': does it have any P's? No. So combined has 2 P's.\n\nIf the pile doesn't have 2 P's, then the count would differ.\n\nWait, the pile is 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER' → let's see:\n\nLooking for P's. Let me see:\n\nLine 1: BABBONATALE → no P's.\n\nLine 2: FATHERCHRISTMAS → no P's.\n\nLine 3: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER → no P's.\n\nSo pile has zero P's. So combined has 2 P's, which don't match. So the code would correctly output 'NO'.\n\nAnother sample: third input. The pile has an extra L. So in the combined guest and host, the count of L's is less than the pile. So the code would detect that.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters can be rearranged to form the names of a guest and a host without any extra letters. This involves checking if the combined letters of the guest's and host's names exactly match the letters in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the three lines of input representing the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's and host's names into a single string.\n3. **Check Lengths**: Verify if the combined length of the guest's and host's names matches the length of the pile. If not, print \"NO\".\n4. **Count Frequencies**: Use a frequency counter to count the occurrences of each character in both the combined names and the pile.\n5. **Compare Frequencies**: Check if the frequency counts of the combined names and the pile are identical. If they are, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine if the pile can be rearranged to form the required names by leveraging character frequency counting.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the input lines for guest, host, and pile\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Combine the guest and host names into one string\ncombined = guest + host\n\n# Check if the total number of characters is the same as the pile\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Use Counter to compare the frequency of each character\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The guest's, host's, and pile's names are read from standard input.\n- **Combining Names**: The guest's and host's names are concatenated to form a single string.\n- **Length Check**: The combined length is compared with the pile's length to quickly determine if it's impossible to form the names from the pile.\n- **Frequency Counting**: Using `collections.Counter`, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined names and the pile.\n- **Comparison**: The frequency dictionaries are compared to ensure every character appears the same number of times in both the combined names and the pile.\n\nThis method efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures correctness by verifying both the total number of characters and their exact distribution.",
