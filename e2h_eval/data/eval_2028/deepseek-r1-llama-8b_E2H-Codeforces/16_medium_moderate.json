Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Crazy Town,\" and from the description, it seems like it involves lines dividing a plane into regions, and moving between these regions with certain rules.\n\nHmm, the task is to find the minimum number of steps to get from the home block to the university block. Each step allows moving to an adjacent block that shares a border of non-zero length. So the key here is figuring out how the lines partition the plane and determining which side each point (home and university) is on for each line. Then, we can model this as a graph where each region is a node, and edges exist if two regions are adjacent via a shared border.\n\nWait, but considering all possible regions might be computationally intensive, especially since n can be up to 300. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nOh right! Each line divides the plane into two half-planes. For each line, the home and university will lie on one side or the other. The idea is that each line contributes to the 'dimension' in which the points are compared. So perhaps the minimal steps required is the number of times the orientation of the points relative to the lines differs. Because each time they differ, it indicates that the two points are on opposite sides of a line, meaning that you have to cross that line, which adds a step.\n\nWait, that makes sense because each such crossing would require moving through that line's boundary. But wait, how does this translate into the minimal steps?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose you have two points, A and B, and a line L. If both are on the same side of L, then there's no need to cross L when moving from A to B. But if they're on opposite sides, then you must cross L at least once. But how many times? Well, each time you cross a line, it's a step. So for all the lines where A and B are on different sides, each contributes exactly one step to the total.\n\nSo the minimal number of steps required is equal to the number of lines where the home and university lie on different sides. Because each such line contributes exactly one step—each time you cross that line, you move from one block to another.\n\nSo the solution is to count the number of lines where the home and university are on different sides. That's the answer.\n\nWait, let's test this against the example given.\n\nIn the example:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are 3 roads.\n\nFirst road: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0. Home is at y=1, which is above. University is y=-1, below. So different sides.\n\nSecond road: 1x + 0y + 0 = 0 → x=0. Home is x=1 (right), university is x=-1 (left). Different.\n\nThird road: 1x + 1y -3=0 → x + y =3. Let's evaluate for home: 1+1=2 <3 → below. University: -1+-1= -2 <3 → also below. So same side.\n\nSo total lines where they differ: 2. So the output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: if home and university are on the same side of all lines, then the answer is zero. Or if they are on opposite sides of k lines, the answer is k.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each line, determine whether home and university are on the same side or not.\n2. Count the number of lines where they are on different sides.\n3. Output this count.\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFor each line, given by a*x + b*y + c = 0, compute the value of a*x1 + b*y1 + c and a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n\nIf the signs of these two values are different, then the points are on opposite sides of the line. So increment the count.\n\nBut wait, what if the line equation evaluates to zero for either point? No, the problem states that neither home nor university lies on any road, so a*x + b*y +c ≠0 for both points.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read home coordinates (x1, y1)\n- Read university coordinates (x2, y2)\n- Read n\n- For each of the next n lines:\n   - Read a, b, c\n   - Compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n   - Compute val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n   - If val1 * val2 < 0 → different sides → increment count\n- Output the count\n\nYes, that's the plan.\n\nSo now, writing the code.\n\nWe'll read the inputs, process each line, compute the values, and count.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- All lines have the same sign for both points → output 0.\n- All lines have different signs → output n.\n\nAlso, considering that the numbers can be very large (up to 1e6 in magnitude), but in Python, integer size isn't an issue.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead the first two lines as home and university.\n\nThen read n.\n\nThen loop n times:\n\nEach line has a, b, c. Compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c, val2 similarly.\n\nIf val1 and val2 have different signs, count +=1.\n\nFinally, print the count.\n\nTesting with sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nCompute for first line: 0*1 + 1*1 +0 =1; 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1. So 1*-1= -1 → different, count +=1.\n\nSecond line:1*1 +0*1 +0 =1; 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0= -1. Different, count +=1.\n\nTotal 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSuppose home and university are same side for all lines.\n\nE.g., home is (2,2), university is (3,3).\n\nn=3 lines:\n\nLine 1: x + y >0 → for both points, sum is positive.\n\nLine 2: x - y >0 → 2-2=0, but that's invalid as per problem statement.\n\nWait, problem says they don't lie on any line.\n\nSo maybe:\n\nLine1: x + y + 1=0. At home: 2+2+1=5>0. University:3+3+1=7>0. Same.\n\nLine2: x - y + 1=0. At home: 2-2+1=1>0. University:3-3+1=1>0. Same.\n\nLine3: 2x +3y +4=0. Home: 4+6+4=14>0. University:6+9+4=19>0. Same.\n\nSo count is 0.\n\nOutput 0.\n\nAnother case:\n\nHome (1,1), university (2,2).\n\nLine: x + y -3=0.\n\nAt home:1+1-3= -1.\n\nAt university:2+2-3=1.\n\nDifferent. So count 1.\n\nThus, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nSo, code:\n\nRead x1, y1 from first line.\n\nRead x2, y2 from second line.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount =0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n    val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n    if (val1 * val2) < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but what if val1 or val2 is zero? Oh, the problem says that neither home nor university lie on any road, so val1 and val2 cannot be zero. So no division by zero or anything.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code is simple.\n\nTesting it with the sample input:\n\nInput:\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nProcessing:\n\nLine 1: a=0, b=1, c=0.\n\nval1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0=1.\n\nval2=0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0= -1.\n\n1 * (-1) = -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nLine2: a=1, b=0, c=0.\n\nval1=1*1+0*1 +0=1.\n\nval2=1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0= -1.\n\nAgain, product is negative. count becomes 2.\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. The town is divided by multiple lines, and each step allows moving between adjacent blocks that share a border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each line in Crazy Town divides the plane into two half-planes. The key insight is that if two points (home and university) lie on different sides of a line, they must cross that line to move between their respective blocks. Each such crossing contributes exactly one step to the total number of steps required.\n\n2. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each line, determine which side of the line the home and university lie on.\n   - If the home and university are on different sides of a line, increment the step count by 1.\n   - Sum the number of such lines where the points are on different sides to get the minimum number of steps required.\n\n3. **Complexity**: The algorithm processes each line once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads (lines).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The coordinates of home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads. Each road's coefficients (a, b, c) are then read.\n- **Line Check**: For each line, compute the values of the line equation at the home and university coordinates. If these values have opposite signs, it means the points lie on different sides of the line.\n- **Count Steps**: Each such line contributes one step to the total count.\n- **Output**: The total count of such lines is printed as the result, representing the minimum number of steps needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the geometric properties of lines dividing the plane and checking relative positions of points on either side of each line.",
