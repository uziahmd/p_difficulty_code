A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Soft Drinking,\" and from the description, I need to calculate how many toasts each friend can make given certain resources.\n\nHmm. Let me try to break down the problem step by step.\n\nThe input consists of several integers. Let's list them out:\n\nn: number of friends.\nk: number of bottles bought.\nl: milliliters per bottle.\nc: number of limes.\nd: slices per lime.\np: grams of salt.\nnl: milliliters needed per toast per friend.\nnp: grams of salt needed per toast per friend.\n\nEach toast requires each friend to have nl ml of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. So for each toast, all n friends must have their requirements met.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the total resources available and then determine how many toasts are possible based on each resource, then take the minimum.\n\nLet me think about each resource separately.\n\n1. Drink:\nEach bottle has l ml. So total drink is k * l. Each toast requires n * nl (because each of the n friends takes nl). So the maximum toasts possible from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\nWait, but wait—what if n * nl exceeds the total? Then that would be zero. So yes, integer division makes sense here.\n\n2. Lime Slices:\nThey cut c limes into d slices each. So total slices are c * d. Each toast needs n slices (one per friend). So maximum toasts from lime is (c*d) // n.\n\n3. Salt:\nTotal salt is p grams. Each toast needs n * np grams. So maximum toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nSo the overall maximum number of toasts is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the example given:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nCompute each:\n\nDrink: 4*5=20. Each toast needs 3*3=9. 20//9 is 2 (since 2*9=18 <=20, 3*9=27>20). So drink allows 2 toasts.\n\nLime: 10*8=80 slices. Each toast needs 3. 80//3 is 26. So 26 toasts allowed.\n\nSalt: 100 grams. Each toast needs 3*1=3. 100//3 is 33. So 33.\n\nThen the minimal is 2, which is the correct output.\n\nSo yes, the approach is correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute total_drink = k * l\n- Compute drink_toast = total_drink // (n * nl)\n- Compute total_limes = c * d\n- lime_toast = total_limes // n\n- Compute salt_toast = p // (n * np)\n- The answer is the minimum of drink_toast, lime_toast, salt_toast.\n\nSo the code will read the input, compute these three values, and output the minimum as an integer.\n\nNow, let's think about handling the inputs. The input is a single line with 8 integers.\n\nIn Python, I can read the input line, split it into a list of strings, convert each to int, and assign to variables accordingly.\n\nSo something like:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute each component:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ndrink_toast = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_limes = c * d\nlime_toast = total_limes // n\n\nsalt_toast = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_toast, lime_toast, salt_toast)\n\nPrint result as a string.\n\nWait, but wait: What if n * nl is zero? No, because all inputs are positive integers, as per the problem statement. So no division by zero issues.\n\nSo the code seems straightforward.\n\nTesting with sample input 1:\n\nInput: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → drink=20.\n\nnl=3 → per toast, 3 *3=9. 20//9=2.\n\nlime: 10*8=80, n=3 → 80//3=26.\n\nsalt: 100/(3*1)=33.\n\nmin(2,26,33) → 2 → correct.\n\nAnother sample: \n\nSecond sample input is 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3.\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → drink=1000.\n\nnl=4 → per toast, 5*4=20. 1000 /20=50.\n\nlime: 1*19=19 slices. 19//5=3.8 → 3.\n\nsalt: 90/(5*3)=90/15=6.\n\nSo min(50,3,6) is 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nThird sample:\n\n10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\nn=10, k=1000 → drink=1e6.\n\nnl=50 → per toast, 10*50=500. 1e6/500=2000.\n\nlime: 25*23=575. 575//10=57.\n\nsalt: 1/(10*1)=0.1 → floor to 0.\n\nSo min(2000,57,0) → 0. Which is the sample output.\n\nSo the code works for these samples.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where one of the resources is zero.\n\nFor example, suppose p=0, then salt_toast is zero, making the overall result zero.\n\nAnother case: when all resources are sufficient except one.\n\nI think the code handles all cases correctly.\n\nSo the plan is solid.\n\nNow, time to write the code.\n\nRead the 8 integers.\n\nCompute the three constraints.\n\nTake the minimum.\n\nPrint it as a string.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nAnother thing to note: in Python, using integer division with // is correct because it floors the result, which is exactly what we need.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime = (c * d) // n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(drink, lime, salt))\n\nThat's it. Simple and efficient.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, lime slices, and salt per friend. The solution involves calculating the maximum number of toasts possible based on each resource and then taking the minimum of these values to ensure all friends can toast equally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**:\n   - **Drink**: Each bottle has `l` milliliters, and there are `k` bottles. Thus, the total drink is `k * l`.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Each lime is cut into `d` slices, and there are `c` limes. Thus, the total number of lime slices is `c * d`.\n   - **Salt**: The total salt available is `p` grams.\n\n2. **Determine Toast Requirements**:\n   - Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink (since each of the `n` friends needs `nl` milliliters).\n   - Each toast requires `n` lime slices (one slice per friend).\n   - Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt (since each of the `n` friends needs `np` grams).\n\n3. **Compute Maximum Toasts for Each Resource**:\n   - **Drink**: The maximum number of toasts possible from the drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Slices**: The maximum number of toasts possible from lime slices is `(c * d) // n`.\n   - **Salt**: The maximum number of toasts possible from salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n\n4. **Determine the Result**: The number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum of the three computed values above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ndrink_toast = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime_toast = (c * d) // n\nsalt_toast = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(drink_toast, lime_toast, salt_toast))\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe code reads the input values and calculates the maximum number of toasts possible based on the available drink, lime slices, and salt. It then determines the minimum of these values to ensure that all friends can toast the same number of times without running out of any resource. This approach efficiently computes the result using integer division to handle the constraints correctly.",
