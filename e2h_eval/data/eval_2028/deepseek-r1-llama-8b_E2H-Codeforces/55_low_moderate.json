    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Minimum Ternary String. Hmm. So, the task is to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing certain swap operations. \n\nLet me read the problem statement again to make sure I understand it correctly. We're given a ternary string, which means it only consists of '0', '1', and '2'. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1' or '1' and '2'. So, for example, I can swap '0' and '1' next to each other, but not '0' and '2' or '1' and '0' if they aren't adjacent. Wait, no, wait: the allowed swaps are swapping any two adjacent characters if they are either '0' and '1' or '1' and '2'. So, '0' and '2' can't be swapped directly because that's not allowed.\n\nThe goal is to find the lex smallest string possible after doing any number of these swaps. Lex order is like dictionary order; so '001' is smaller than '010', and so on.\n\nHmm. So, the key here is to figure out how the allowed swaps affect the ordering of the characters. Since '0' can be swapped with '1's, as long as they are adjacent. But '0's cannot be directly swapped with '2's. Similarly, '1's can be swapped with '2's, but '0's can't be swapped with '2's in a single step.\n\nWait, but what does this imply about the possible rearrangements? For instance, can a '0' eventually move past a '2' through some intermediate steps?\n\nBecause, for example, suppose we have '0 1 2'. Can we somehow move the '0' before the '2' by swapping through the '1'?\n\nWell, let's see: initially, it's '012'. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1' (so swap them to get '102'), then between '1' and '2' (swap them to get '120'). Now, can we move the '0' further? The '0' is now at position 1, and the '2' is at position 3. They are not adjacent, so can't swap directly. So, in this case, the '0' can't move beyond the '1' and '2' positions because there's no way to bring it closer to the '2'.\n\nSo, this suggests that '0's can only be reordered among themselves and with '1's, but not with '2's. Similarly, '1's can be reordered among themselves and with '2's, but '0's can't get past '2's. Or wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think more carefully.\n\nWait, another example: suppose the string is '210'. What can we do?\n\nWe can swap the '2' and '1' to get '120', but then we can't swap '1' and '0' because that's allowed only if they are adjacent and consist of '0' and '1' or '1' and '2'. So yes, in '120', the '1' and '0' are adjacent, so we can swap them to get '021'. So, in this case, the '0' ends up before the '2' even though it's originally after it.\n\nWait, so that's interesting. So, in this case, the '0' could end up moving before the '2' because the '1' is in between. So, the presence of a '1' allows '0's to move past '2's indirectly.\n\nWait, but how? Because in the example above, '210' becomes '120' after swapping '2' and '1', then '120' becomes '021' after swapping '1' and '0'. So, the '0' moves from position 3 to position 1. So, the '0' can indeed cross over '2's if there's a '1' in between.\n\nThis suggests that the relative order of '0's and '2's can be changed as long as there's a '1' in between. Because the '0's can be moved forward by swapping with '1's, and the '1's can be moved backward by swapping with '2's. So, for example, a '0' can move past a '1' and then the '1' can move past a '2', allowing the '0' to effectively bypass the '2'.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the '0' ends up before the '2' because the '1' was in between. So, the key is that '0's can be reordered with '1's, and '1's can be reordered with '",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing a series of allowed swaps. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1' or '1' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that '0's can be reordered among themselves and with '1's, while '1's can be reordered among themselves and with '2's. This means that '0's can effectively move past '2's if there's a '1' in between, allowing the '0' to bypass the '2'. \n\nTo achieve the smallest lexicographical order, we can process the string in three passes:\n1. **Pass 1: Move all '0's as far left as possible** by swapping them with adjacent '1's.\n2. **Pass 2: Move all '1's as far left as possible** after the '0's, which also allows '1's to move past '2's.\n3. **Pass 3: Ensure the relative order of '1's and '2's** is correct, moving '1's before '2's wherever possible.\n\nThis approach ensures that each character type is moved as far left as possible without violating the constraints of the allowed swaps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    s = list(s)\n    # First pass: move all '0's to the left\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if s[i] == '0':\n            while i > 0 and s[i-1] == '1':\n                s[i], s[i-1] = s[i-1], s[i]\n                i -= 1\n    # Second pass: move all '1's to the left, considering '0's are already passed\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if s[i] == '1':\n            while i > 0 and (s[i-1] == '1' or s[i-1] == '0'):\n                # If previous is '0', it's already moved, so break\n                if s[i-1] == '0':\n                    break\n                s[i], s[i-1] = s[i-1], s[i]\n                i -= 1\n    # Third pass: move all '2's to the right, but wait, no, wait. Wait, what's needed here?\n    # Actually, after the first two passes, '1's are as left as possible, and '0's are before '1's.\n    # Now, any '1's should come before '2's. So, we need to ensure that '1's are moved before '2's.\n    # So, perhaps another pass where we move '1's past '2's.\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if s[i] == '1':\n            while i < len(s) - 1 and s[i+1] == '2':\n                s[i], s[i+1] = s[i+1], s[i]\n                i += 1\n    return ''.join(s)\n\n# Read input\ns = input().strip()\n# Process\nresult = min_ternary_string(s)\n# Output\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **First Pass**: We iterate through the string and move each '0' as far left as possible by swapping it with adjacent '1's.\n2. **Second Pass**: After the '0's are in place, we move the '1's to the left, ensuring they come after the '0's but before the '2's.\n3. **Third Pass**: Finally, we ensure that any remaining '1's are moved before '2's, ensuring the smallest lexicographical order.\n\nThis method efficiently rearranges the string in O(n) time complexity, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000 characters.",
