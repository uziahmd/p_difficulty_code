A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Soft Drinking,\" and from the description, I need to calculate how many toasts each friend can make given certain resources.\n\nHmm. Let me try to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe friends have bought k bottles of soft drink, each with l milliliters. So the total drink is k multiplied by l. Each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. Since each friend makes a toast, for one toast, all n friends together consume n * nl milliliters. Wait, no—wait, each toast is per friend. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for m toasts, each friend drinks m * nl ml. But since there are n friends, the total drink consumed is n * m * nl. Right.\n\nThen, they have c limes cut into d slices each. So the total number of lime slices is c * d. Each toast requires one slice per friend, so for m toasts, it's n * m slices needed. So the maximum number of toasts possible based on limes is (c*d) / n, but we'll have to take the floor because you can't have a fraction of a toast.\n\nLastly, they have p grams of salt. Each toast requires np grams per friend, so for m toasts, the total salt needed is n * m * np. So the maximum based on salt is p divided by (n * np), again taking the floor.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum of these three values: the maximum number of toasts allowed by drink, limes, and salt. Then, since each friend can make that number of toasts, the answer is that minimum value.\n\nWait, wait. No, wait. Because each toast is per friend. So for each toast, each friend uses one slice and some salt, and the drink. So when calculating the total required per toast, it's per friend.\n\nSo the drink limit is (total_drink) / (nl) / n. Because each toast for all friends is n * nl. So total_drink = k*l; per toast, all friends use n * nl. So the maximum number of toasts is (k*l) // (n*nl). Or wait, maybe (k*l) must be at least m * (n * nl), so m_max_drink = (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\nSimilarly, for limes: each toast uses n slices (one per friend). So the maximum m based on limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor salt: each toast uses n * np grams. So m_max_salt = p // (n * np).\n\nSo the overall maximum number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, no. Because each toast requires all three resources. So the total number of toasts is the minimum of the three individual maximums.\n\nYes, that's right. So the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate total_drink = k * l.\n   - per_toast_d = n * nl.\n   - max_toasts_drink = total_drink // per_toast_d.\n\n2. Calculate total_lime_slices = c * d.\n   - per_toast_l = n * 1 (since each toast per friend needs one slice).\n   - max_toasts_lime = total_lime_slices // per_toast_l.\n\n3. Calculate total_salt = p.\n   - per_toast_s = n * np.\n   - max_toasts_salt = total_salt // per_toast_s.\n\n4. The maximum number of toasts is the minimum of these three values.\n\nSo the answer is min(max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_lime, max_toasts_salt).\n\nBut wait, in the example provided:\n\nInput is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nLet's compute each part:\n\nTotal_drink = 4*5=20. per_toast_d = 3*3=9. 20//9 = 2 (since 9*2=18 <=20). So drink allows 2 toasts.\n\nLimes: 10*8=80 slices. per_toast_l =3*1=3. 80//3=26 (since 3*26=78<=80). So lime allows 26 toasts.\n\nSalt: p=100. per_toast_s=3*1=3. 100//3=33 (3*33=99<=100). So salt allows 33.\n\nSo the minimal is 2. Hence the output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3.\n\nCompute:\n\nDrink: 100*10=1000. per_toast_d",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a certain amount of each resource per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Determine the total amount of each resource available.\n   - Total drink in milliliters.\n   - Total lime slices.\n   - Total salt in grams.\n\n2. **Determine Resource Requirements per Toast**:\n   - Each toast requires `nl` milliliters of drink per friend, so for `n` friends, each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters.\n   - Each toast requires one lime slice per friend, so for `n` friends, each toast requires `n` slices.\n   - Each toast requires `np` grams of salt per friend, so for `n` friends, each toast requires `n * np` grams.\n\n3. **Compute Maximum Toasts from Each Resource**:\n   - From drink: The maximum number of toasts is the total drink divided by the drink required per toast.\n   - From lime slices: The maximum number of toasts is the total lime slices divided by the lime slices required per toast.\n   - From salt: The maximum number of toasts is the total salt divided by the salt required per toast.\n\n4. **Determine the Limiting Resource**: The actual maximum number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the smallest of the three computed values from the previous step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input as a single line, split into integers\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = data\n    \n    # Calculate total resources\n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime = c * d\n    total_salt = p\n    \n    # Compute per toast requirements\n    per_toast_d = n * nl\n    per_toast_l = n  # each toast uses n slices\n    per_toast_s = n * np\n    \n    # Calculate maximum possible toasts from each resource\n    max_drink = total_drink // per_toast_d\n    max_lime = total_lime // per_toast_l\n    max_salt = total_salt // per_toast_s\n    \n    # Find the minimum of the three\n    max_toasts = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n    \n    print(str(max_toasts))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into individual integers representing the given parameters.\n- **Total Resources Calculation**: The total amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt are calculated.\n- **Toast Requirements**: For each resource, compute how much is needed per toast for all friends.\n- **Max Toasts Calculation**: For each resource, determine how many full toasts can be made before running out of that resource.\n- **Limiting Resource**: The smallest value among the three resources determines the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring all friends can toast the same number of times without running out of any resource prematurely.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by breaking down the problem into manageable steps and considering each resource constraint individually.",
