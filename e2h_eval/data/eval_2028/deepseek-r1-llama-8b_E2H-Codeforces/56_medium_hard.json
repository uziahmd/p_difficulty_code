Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Guard Duty,\" and from the description, I understand that we need to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases in such a way that each base has exactly one guardian, each spaceship also has exactly one assigned base (so it's a perfect matching), and importantly, no two paths between a base and its spaceship intersect. \n\nHmm, right, the key here is that the paths shouldn't intersect. So each path is a straight line from the base to the spaceship, and these lines must not cross each other. So the challenge is to find if there's a way to pair the R spaceships with B bases so that all these conditions are satisfied.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Since R and B are both up to 10, which isn't too big, maybe a brute-force approach is feasible. But wait, the constraints also mention that no three points are colinear, so that's helpful because it avoids some edge cases where multiple points lie on the same line.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input: R and B, then R spaceship coordinates, followed by B base coordinates.\n2. Check if R equals B. Because each spaceship must be assigned to exactly one base and vice versa, the number of spaceships must equal the number of bases. If R != B, immediately output 'No'.\n3. Generate all possible perfect matchings between the spaceships and bases.\n4. For each perfect matching, check two things:\n   a) Each spaceship is assigned to a unique base.\n   b) The lines connecting the bases to their assigned spaceships do not intersect each other.\n5. If any such matching exists, output 'Yes'; otherwise, output 'No'.\n\nWait, but generating all possible perfect matchings could be computationally expensive if R is 10, but since 10! is 3,628,800, which is manageable for Python, especially considering the rest of the checks per matching are manageable.\n\nBut wait, R and B are up to 10, but the number of possible perfect matchings is R! / (R-B)! ), which for R=B=10 is 10! = 3.6 million. That's acceptable for a brute-force approach.\n\nNow, the main challenge is to represent each matching and then check whether the corresponding lines don't intersect.\n\nSo how to represent a matching? Maybe as a permutation where the index represents the spaceship, and the value represents the base it's assigned to. Wait, but the order matters—spaceships can be matched to any base, regardless of their indices. Alternatively, perhaps for each matching, we can have an array where the i-th element is the base index assigned to the i-th spaceship.\n\nWait, no, because each spaceship can be matched to any base, so perhaps a permutation of the bases' indices, but only for the R elements. Wait, but B might be less than R. Oh, no, wait. Wait, R and B are the same because for a perfect matching, they must be equal. Because each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base is guarded by exactly one spaceship. So R must equal B. So first, if R != B, return 'No'. That's the first check.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: It says R and B are given, and the assignment is a perfect matching, which implies that R must equal B. So yes, the first step is to check if R == B; else, output 'No'.\n\nSo, assuming R == B, the next step is to consider all possible bijections from the spaceships to the bases. For each such bijection, we need to check whether all the lines between the spaceships and their assigned bases form a non-intersecting set.\n\nBut wait, each line is from a base to a spaceship. So the lines are from the B bases to their assigned spaceships. So for each matching, we have to compute all those lines and ensure that none of them intersect except at their endpoints.\n\nSo how do we check if two line segments intersect?\n\nI remember that to determine if two line segments AB and CD intersect, you can use the cross product method or the Liang-Barsky algorithm. But since the points are in 2D, perhaps implementing the cross product approach is manageable.\n\nWait, but the problem states that no three points are colinear, so no line segments will share an endpoint, and no two line segments will share an endpoint either, except as per the matching.\n\nWait, no, because each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, so each line segment connects a base to a spaceship, and no two segments share a base or a spaceship. So each line is uniquely determined by a base and a spaceship, with no overlaps.\n\nSo for any two line segments, say s1 and s2, they are between different bases and different spaceships. So we need to check if these two line segments cross each other anywhere except their endpoints.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each possible permutation P of the bases (since R = B, each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship). Wait, no. Wait, the mapping is from spaceships to bases. So each spaceship is assigned to a base. So the permutation is of the bases, but the spaceship indices are fixed. Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe the permutation represents the assignment from spaceships to bases. For example, spaceship 0 is assigned to base P[0], spaceship 1 to base P[1], etc. So the permutation is of the bases in some order.\n\nWait, no, because the permutation would require that each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship. So for R = B, the permutation is a bijection between spaceships and bases.\n\nSo for each possible bijection (permutation) of the bases, we can check if the resulting lines are non-intersecting.\n\nWait, but when R is 10, the number of permutations is 10! = 3,628,800. For each permutation, we have to process all pairs of lines to see if any intersect.\n\nHow many pairs of lines do we have? For each permutation, we have B lines, so for B=10, that's 45 pairs. For each pair, we need to check if the two line segments intersect.\n\nSo for each permutation, the processing is O(B^2), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the total number of operations is 3,628,800 * 45 = around 163,680,000 operations. That's manageable in Python.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input: R and B. Then read R spaceships' coordinates, then B bases' coordinates.\n\n2. If R != B, output 'No' immediately.\n\n3. Else, generate all possible permutations of the B bases. Each permutation represents an assignment of spaceships to bases.\n\n4. For each permutation, create a list of line segments: for each spaceship i, connect it to the base at permutation[i].\n\n5. For all pairs of line segments in this list, check if they intersect. If any pair does, this permutation is invalid; else, it's valid.\n\n6. If any permutation is valid, output 'Yes'; else, 'No'.\n\nBut wait, the line segments are from the bases to the spaceships. So each line is from a base point to a spaceship point. So for each permutation P, the line segments are (base_i, spaceship_j) where j is the position in the permutation. Or wait, no: for each spaceship i (from 0 to R-1), it's assigned to base P[i]. So the line is from base P[i] to spaceship i.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the permutation is a mapping from spaceship indices to base indices. So for spaceship 0, it's assigned to base P[0]. So the line is from base P[0] to spaceship 0.\n\nWait, but the spaceship and base points are given as separate lists. So for each permutation, the line segments are made by connecting each spaceship i to the base P[i].\n\nSo for each spaceship, the line is from its position to the base's position.\n\nSo now, for each permutation, we need to generate all the line segments between the spaceships and their assigned bases, and then check for any two line segments if they intersect.\n\nSo, the core part is to implement a function that, given two line segments, returns True if they intersect, False otherwise.\n\nImplementing line segment intersection detection correctly is crucial. Let's think about how to do that.\n\nThe standard way is to represent each line segment as two endpoints and then check if the segments AB and CD intersect. To do this, we can use the cross product approach.\n\nFirst, represent each line segment as (x1, y1) to (x2, y2).\n\nWe can represent each segment as a tuple of two points. So for two segments, S1 = (A, B) and S2 = (C, D), we can compute the orientation of various points to determine if the segments intersect.\n\nThe approach involves checking the orientation of the four points. Orientation tells us the relative position of a point with respect to a line segment.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to compute the intersection of the lines AB and CD and then check if the intersection point lies within both segments.\n\nSo, for two segments AB and CD:\n\nCompute the intersection point of AB and CD using the formula for line intersection.\n\nIf the intersection point is within both segments, then the segments intersect.\n\nElse, they don't.\n\nBut since the lines are finite, we need to check that the computed intersection point lies on both segments.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps to compute whether two line segments AB and CD intersect.\n\n1. Compute the parametric equations for both lines.\n\nLine AB can be parameterized as A + t*(B - A), where t ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSimilarly, line CD can be parameterized as C + s*(D - C), where s ranges from 0 to 1.\n\n2. Find the values of t and s where the lines intersect.\n\nThis can be done by solving the system of equations:\n\nA.x + t*(B.x - A.x) = C.x + s*(D.x - C.x)\n\nA.y + t*(B.y - A.y) = C.y + s*(D.y - C.y)\n\nSolving for t and s.\n\nIf the denominator (the determinant of the system) is zero, the lines are parallel or coincident. But in our case, since no three points are colinear, the lines can't be coincident. So if the denominator is zero, the lines are parallel and don't intersect.\n\nElse, compute t and s.\n\nIf t is between 0 and 1 and s is between 0 and 1, then the lines intersect.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor two segments AB and CD:\n\nCompute the determinant:\n\ndet = (B.x - A.x) * (C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y) * (C.x - A.x)\n\nIf det is zero, the lines are parallel or coincident. Since no three points are colinear, they are parallel and don't intersect.\n\nElse, compute t and s:\n\nt = ((C.x - A.x) * (D.y - C.y) - (C.y - A.y) * (D.x - C.x)) / det\n\ns = ((C.x - A.x) * (D.y - C.y) - (C.x - A.x) * (C.y - A.y)) / det ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-derive the equations.\n\nWait, let's denote:\n\ndx1 = B.x - A.x\n\ndy1 = B.y - A.y\n\ndx2 = D.x - C.x\n\ndy2 = D.y - C.y\n\nThen the equations are:\n\nA.x + t*dx1 = C.x + s*dx2\n\nA.y + t*dy1 = C.y + s*dy2\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nt*dx1 - s*dx2 = C.x - A.x\n\nt*dy1 - s*dy2 = C.y - A.y\n\nSo, to solve for t and s, we can represent this as a linear system:\n\n| dx1   -dx2 | [t]   = [C.x - A.x]\n| dy1   -dy2 | [s]     [C.y - A.y]\n\nThe determinant is det = dx1 * (-dy2) - (-dx2) * dy1 = -dx1*dy2 + dx2*dy1 = (dx2 * dy1 - dx1 * dy2).\n\nIf det is zero, the lines are parallel or coincident. Since no three points are colinear, they are parallel.\n\nElse, t = [ (C.x - A.x)*(-dy2) - (-dx2)*(C.y - A.y) ] / det\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute using Cramer's rule.\n\nAlternatively, using matrix inversion.\n\nBut perhaps an easier way is to compute t as:\n\nt = ( (C.x - A.x)*dy2 - (C.y - A.y)*dx2 ) / det\n\nand s = ( (C.x - A.x)*dy1 - (C.y - A.y)*dx1 ) / det\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.\n\nThe system is:\n\ndx1 * t - dx2 * s = (C.x - A.x)\n\ndy1 * t - dy2 * s = (C.y - A.y)\n\nWe can write this as a matrix equation:\n\n| dx1  -dx2 | |t|   | C.x - A.x |\n| dy1   -dy2 | |s| = | C.y - A.y |\n\nThe determinant of the coefficient matrix is det = dx1*(-dy2) - (-dx2)*dy1 = -dx1*dy2 + dx2*dy1.\n\nSo if det is zero, no solution.\n\nElse, t = [ (C.x - A.x)*(-dy2) - (-dx2)*(C.y - A.y) ] / det\n\nSimilarly, s = [ dx1*(C.y - A.y) - dy1*(C.x - A.x) ] / det\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let's compute t and s properly.\n\nUsing Cramer's rule:\n\nt = | (C.x - A.x)   (-dx2) | / det\n        | (C.y - A.y)   (-dy2) |\n\nWhich is [(C.x - A.x)(-dy2) - (-dx2)(C.y - A.y)] / det\n\n= [ - (C.x - A.x) dy2 + dx2 (C.y - A.y) ] / det\n\nSimilarly, s = | dx1   (C.x - A.x) | \n             | dy1   (C.y - A.y) |\n\nWhich is [ dx1*(C.y - A.y) - dy1*(C.x - A.x) ] / det\n\nSo, once t and s are computed, if t is between 0 and 1, and s is between 0 and 1, then the segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nSo, in code, for two line segments, we can compute this.\n\nBut since floating point precision can cause issues, perhaps it's better to represent everything in fractions to avoid rounding errors. However, for the purposes of this problem, maybe it's sufficient to compute t and s as floating points and check if they are in [0, 1].\n\nWait, but sometimes due to floating-point inaccuracies, a value that should be exactly 0 or 1 might be represented as something like 0.999999999 or 1.000000001. So perhaps we can use a small epsilon to compare.\n\nBut since all the input coordinates are integers, and given that the line segments are between integer coordinates, perhaps the calculations won't have any issues. But to be safe, perhaps we should allow a tiny epsilon, like 1e-9.\n\nSo, putting this into code: for each pair of line segments, compute t and s, check if they're between 0 and 1 (inclusive), and if so, the segments intersect.\n\nSo, the function to check for intersection between two line segments would look something like this:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    # a and b are endpoints of the first segment\n    # c and d are endpoints of the second segment\n    # returns True if the segments intersect\n\n    # Compute the determinant to check if lines are not parallel\n    dx1 = b[0] - a[0]\n    dy1 = b[1] - a[1]\n    dx2 = d[0] - c[0]\n    dy2 = d[1] - c[1]\n    det = dx1 * dy2 - dx2 * dy1\n    if det == 0:\n        return False  # lines are parallel or coincident; but no three points are colinear, so no intersection\n\n    # Compute t and s\n    t_numerator = (c[0] - a[0]) * (-dy2) + (d[0] - c[0]) * (a[1] - c[1])\n    t = t_numerator / det\n\n    s_numerator = (c[1] - a[1]) * (-dx2) + (d[1] - c[1]) * (a[0] - c[0])\n    s = s_numerator / det\n\n    # Check if t and s are within [0, 1]\n    if t < -1e-9 or t > 1 + 1e-9:\n        return False\n    if s < -1e-9 or s > 1 + 1e-9:\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the segments actually intersect (since t and s are in [0,1], but we need to make sure that the point lies on both segments)\n    # Another way is to compute the dot product to check if the intersection is within the segments.\n\n    # Alternatively, perhaps using the cross product to ensure that the points are ordered correctly.\n\n    # Wait, perhaps a more accurate approach is to compute the orientation of the four points.\n\n    # Let's compute the orientation of (a, b, c) and (a, b, d), and similarly for (c, d, a) and (c, d, b).\n\n    def ccw(A, B, C):\n        return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\n    ccw1 = ccw(a, b, c)\n    ccw2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n    ccw3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n    ccw4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n\n    # General case: segments intersect if (ccw1 and ccw2 have opposite signs) AND (ccw3 and ccw4 have opposite signs)\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n\n    # Special cases: colinear points, but since no three are colinear, this can't happen\n    # So if any of the orientations is zero, then the points are colinear, but since no three points are on the same line, the segments can't overlap except possibly at endpoints.\n\n    # But since we're assigning each spaceship to a unique base, the lines can't share a common base or spaceship, so their endpoints are unique. So if the orientation is zero, the segments are either overlapping in a way that doesn't count as intersecting, or are the same line, which is impossible since the points are unique.\n\n    return False\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe the first approach is sufficient, but perhaps using the cross product to check if the segments intersect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Liang-Barsky algorithm for line clipping, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to check for each pair of line segments whether they intersect by testing whether the endpoints of one segment are on opposite sides of the other segment.\n\nWait, perhaps the following steps can work:\n\nFor each pair of segments S1 (A-B) and S2 (C-D):\n\n1. Compute the orientation of C and D relative to S1. If both are on the same side, the segments don't intersect. If they are on opposite sides, they might.\n\n2. Similarly, compute the orientation of A and B relative to S2.\n\n3. If the orientations are such that S1 and S2 cross each other, then the segments intersect.\n\nSo, let's formalize this.\n\nDefine a function that computes the orientation of point P with respect to the line segment QR:\n\ndef orientation(q, r, p):\n    # Returns:\n    #  0 if colinear,\n    #  1 if clockwise (right turn),\n    # 2 if counter-clockwise (left turn).\n    val = (r[0] - q[0])*(p[1] - q[1]) - (r[1] - q[1])*(p[0] - q[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\nSo, for S1 (A-B) and S2 (C-D):\n\nCompute o1 = orientation(A, B, C), o2 = orientation(A, B, D), o3 = orientation(C, D, A), o4 = orientation(C, D, B).\n\nThe general rule is:\n\nif o1 != o2 and o3 != o4: the segments intersect.\n\nelse: they don't.\n\nBut also, if any of the points are colinear, but since no three points are colinear, this is not possible.\n\nSo, the function can be written as:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n\n    # General case\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n\n    # Special cases (though in our problem, it's not needed)\n    # If any point is colinear, but in our case, no three points are colinear, so this can't happen\n    return False\n\nWait, but this may miss some cases. For example, if one segment is entirely contained within the other. But in our problem, since each line is from a base to a spaceship, and all points are unique, the lines can't overlap in a way that one is inside the other. So perhaps this approach works.\n\nWait, no. Consider two lines that are partially overlapping but not crossing. For example, imagine two lines that are parallel but overlapping. But in our problem, since no three points are colinear, the lines can't be coincident, so if they are parallel, they won't overlap. So, the only way two lines can intersect is if they cross each other.\n\nSo, perhaps the cross product approach is sufficient.\n\nThus, the function segments_intersect can be implemented using the cross product approach.\n\nSo, now, the plan is:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B, output 'No'.\n\nElse, read R spaceship coordinates and B base coordinates.\n\nGenerate all possible permutations of the B bases. Each permutation represents an assignment where spaceship i is assigned to base P[i].\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   Create a list of line segments, where each segment is from base P[i] to spaceship i.\n\n   For all pairs of segments in this list, check if they intersect.\n\n   If any pair intersects, this permutation is invalid.\n\n   Else, if all pairs are non-intersecting, this permutation is valid, so output 'Yes'.\n\nIf after checking all permutations none are valid, output 'No'.\n\nNow, the next thing is to efficiently generate all permutations.\n\nIn Python, itertools.permutations can be used. For example, for B=3, itertools.permutations(range(B)) gives all possible orderings.\n\nWait, but the bases are a list of points, and the permutation is over the indexes of these points. So for each permutation P, spaceship 0 is assigned to base P[0], spaceship 1 to P[1], etc.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nRead R spaceship points into a list called ships.\n\nRead B base points into a list called bases.\n\nCheck if R != B. If so, print 'No' and exit.\n\nElse, for each permutation in itertools.permutations(bases_indices):\n\n   create a list of line segments, each being (bases[i], ships[i]) for i in 0..R-1.\n\n   for each pair of segments in this list, check if they intersect.\n\n   if any pair does, break and try next permutation.\n\n   if no pair intersects, then return 'Yes'.\n\nIf all permutations are tried and none are good, return 'No'.\n\nBut wait, the permutation is of the base indices. So, for example, if B=3, the permutation (1,2,0) would assign spaceship 0 to base 1, spaceship 1 to base 2, and spaceship 2 to base 0.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nships = [...]  # list of ship coordinates\nbases = [...]   # list of base coordinates\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(range(B)):\n    # for each spaceship i, assign to base perm[i]\n    segments = []\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(R):\n        a = bases[perm[i]]\n        b = ships[i]\n        segments.append( (a, b) )\n        # Now, check all other segments against this new segment\n        for j in range(i+1, R):\n            c = bases[perm[j]]\n            d = ships[j]\n            if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n    if valid:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"No\")\n\nWait, but in the above code, for each permutation, we create all the segments and then check each pair. But for each pair, we have to check if they intersect.\n\nSo, the code is as follows:\n\nBut wait, in the code above, for each permutation, for each i from 0 to R-1, create the segment from base perm[i] to ship i. Then, for each j from i+1 to R-1, check segment i and j.\n\nWait, but that would miss some pairs. Because for each j < i, the code wouldn't check segment j and i. Because when i is 0, j starts at 1, and when i is 1, j starts at 2, etc. So for all i < j, the pair (i,j) is checked once.\n\nYes, that's correct because for all i < j, we check segment i and j.\n\nSo the code correctly checks all pairs.\n\nNow, the function segments_intersect needs to be correctly implemented.\n\nImplementing the cross product-based function.\n\nWait, earlier, I thought of using the orientation function. Let me implement that.\n\nSo, the function orientation is:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0])*(r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1])*(r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0  # colinear\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2  # clock or counter clock wise\n\nThen, the function segments_intersect:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n\n    # General case\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n\n    # Special Cases\n    # Check if a point lies on the other segment (but since no three points are colinear, this can't happen)\n    # So, if any of the orientations is 0, it means that the points are colinear, which isn't possible in our problem\n    # So, no need to handle special cases beyond the general case\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but in our problem, it's guaranteed that no three points are colinear, so any orientation returning 0 implies that the points are colinear, which is impossible. So in our problem, the function can safely assume that any orientation value is either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, the function can be simplified.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where two segments are colinear and overlapping? For example, segment AB and segment CD lie on the same line but don't cross. Since in our problem, no three points are colinear, AB and CD can't lie on the same line unless they are the same line. But since no three points are colinear, that's not possible. So two segments can't be colinear.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, any two segments either cross each other once or don't cross at all.\n\nWait, but what if two segments are AB and CD, and CD is a subset of AB? Like, AB is a longer line segment, and CD is entirely within AB. Since all points are unique, this is impossible because that would require three points to be colinear, which is not allowed.\n\nThus, in our problem, two line segments can either intersect at exactly one point, or not intersect at all.\n\nSo, the function can be implemented as above.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n0 0\n2 0\n3 1\n-2 1\n0 3\n2 2\n\nSample Output: Yes\n\nSo, the ships are at (0,0), (2,0), (3,1)\n\nBases are at (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)\n\nOne possible permutation is (2, 0, 1). Wait, no, wait, the permutation is for the bases. So perhaps the permutation is such that:\n\nShip 0 is assigned to base 2 (coordinates (2,2)), ship 1 to base 0 ( (-2,1)), ship 2 to base 1 (0,3).\n\nWait, but that's just a guess. Let me think.\n\nWait, in the sample explanation, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order. So perhaps the permutation is [1, 2, 0], meaning:\n\nShip 0 → base 1 (0,3)\n\nShip 1 → base 2 (2,2)\n\nShip 2 → base 0 (-2,1)\n\nWait, but the order may vary.\n\nIn any case, the code would generate all permutations and check each.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput:\n2 1\n... (two ships and one base)\n\nWait, no, in the sample, the second input is:\n\n2 2\n2 1\n1 0\n2 2\n3 1\n\nWait, no, the input format is:\n\nFirst line: R B.\n\nThen R lines for ships.\n\nThen B lines for bases.\n\nSo for the second sample:\n\nR=2, B=2.\n\nShips: (2,1), (1,0)\n\nBases: (2,2), (3,1)\n\nWait, but wait, the second line is '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1', but that's unclear. Perhaps the input is:\n\nAfter the initial R B line, there are R lines for the ships, then B lines for the bases.\n\nSo the second sample's input is:\n\n2 2\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nSo, ships are [(2,1), (1,0)]\n\nBases are [(2,2), (3,1)]\n\nSo, trying to find a perfect matching.\n\nPossible permutations of the bases:\n\nEach permutation is a 2-length tuple, so (0,1) and (1,0).\n\nFor the first permutation (0,1):\n\nship 0 → base 0 (2,2): line from (2,2) to (2,1). Wait, no: wait, the base is (2,2), the ship is (2,1). So the line is vertical.\n\nship 1 → base 1 (3,1): line from (1,0) to (3,1).\n\nDo these lines intersect?\n\nThe first line is from (2,2) to (2,1): vertical line x=2, from y=1 to y=2.\n\nThe second line is from (1,0) to (3,1): it's a diagonal line. Let's find if they intersect.\n\nAt x=2, y is 1 on the second line.\n\nSo the point (2,1) is on both lines. But since the first line goes from (2,2) to (2,1), and the second line goes from (1,0) to (3,1), the point (2,1) is an endpoint of the first line and a midpoint of the second line.\n\nSo the two lines meet at (2,1), but is this considered an intersection?\n\nWait, the problem says that any two paths from a base to its spaceship should not intersect in the galaxy plane. So if two paths cross at a point (like a base and a spaceship), that's allowed because it's an endpoint. Because the paths are from base to spaceship, and if two such paths meet at a point, it's only if one of them is the same point as another's endpoint.\n\nWait, but in this case, the first line is from base (2,2) to ship (2,1). The second line is from ship (1,0) to base (3,1). They meet at (2,1), which is the endpoint of the first line and the midpoint of the second line.\n\nSo, according to the problem statement, this is allowed, because the only points shared are the base and spaceship points. So the paths don't intersect except at their own endpoints.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the constraint is that any two paths from a base to its spaceship should not intersect in the galaxy plane. So, if two paths meet at a base, that's okay because one path ends there and the other starts there. Similarly, if two paths meet at a spaceship.\n\nBut in this case, the two lines meet at (2,1), which is the end of one path and the midpoint of another. So this is allowed.\n\nWait, but according to the problem's sample output for this case, the answer is 'No'. So why?\n\nWait, perhaps because the two lines intersect somewhere else.\n\nWait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, the first line is from (2,2) to (2,1): vertical line.\n\nThe second line is from (1,0) to (3,1): it's a line with slope (1-0)/(3-1)=0.5.\n\nThe equation of the second line is y = 0.5(x - 1).\n\nAt x=2, y=0.5*(2-1) = 0.5.\n\nSo the point (2,0.5) is on the second line. But the first line is from (2,2) to (2,1), which is at y=1 to y=2. So the lines cross at (2, 0.5), which is outside the first segment (since the first segment is from y=2 down to y=1). So the two segments do not intersect.\n\nWait, that's confusing. So in this case, the lines cross at (2, 0.5), but that point is not on the first segment. So the two segments do not intersect.\n\nSo in this permutation, the two lines do not intersect, so the assignment is valid. So why does the sample output say 'No' for this case?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the sample input.\n\nLooking back, the second sample's input is:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, perhaps the second line is for the first input, and the third line is for the second input. Or perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is:\n\nThe first line is R=3, B=3.\n\nThen 3 lines for ships:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nThen 3 lines for bases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n2 1\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nSo, R=2, B=1.\n\nWait, but that's impossible because R must equal B for a perfect matching. So in the second test case, R=2, B=1, which is impossible, so the output is 'No'.\n\nAh! That explains the sample output.\n\nSo the second test case has R=2, B=1, which is impossible, hence output 'No'.\n\nSo the code correctly handles that.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Floating point precision in the intersection check.\n\nBut since all coordinates are integers, and the function uses exact computations, perhaps using fractions instead of floats can help. But in practice, for the problem's constraints, using floating points with a small epsilon should suffice.\n\nAnother issue is the handling of the permutation. For each permutation, the code correctly creates the segments.\n\nAnother possible optimization is to precompute all possible segments for each permutation, then check pairwise.\n\nBut given that R and B are up to 10, the code should run quickly.\n\nTesting:\n\nTest case 1: R=3, B=3.\n\nShips: (0,0), (2,0), (3,1)\n\nBases: (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)\n\nThere exists a permutation where the segments don't intersect.\n\nTest case 2: R=2, B=1: output 'No'.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2.\n\nShips: (0,0), (2,0)\n\nBases: (0,1), (2,1)\n\nEach ship is assigned to a base.\n\nPossible permutation:\n\n",
