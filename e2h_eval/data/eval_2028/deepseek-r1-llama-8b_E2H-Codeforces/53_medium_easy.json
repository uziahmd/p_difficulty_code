    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nThe input is a single string consisting of lowercase letters. The output should be the maximum length of such a substring. Oh right, and the occurrences can overlap. So for example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears starting at index 0 and then again at index 2, which overlaps.\n\nFirst, I should consider all possible substrings and check if any occur more than once. But how do I efficiently find the longest one?\n\nWait, the maximum possible length of the string is 100, which isn't too big. So a brute-force approach might be feasible here.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible substring lengths, starting from the largest possible down to 1.\n2. For each length L, check all possible substrings of that length.\n3. For each substring, see if it appears again in the string (possibly overlapping).\n4. If such a substring exists, return L as the answer.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because checking from the largest possible length downwards will allow us to return the first valid L we find, which ensures it's the maximum possible.\n\nSo, how to implement this?\n\nI'll start by getting the input string. Let's call it s.\n\nThen, for L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n\nWait, but len(s) is the maximum possible substring length. For example, if the string is 'abcd', the entire string can't be present twice. So for L = len(s), there's only one occurrence, so we skip.\n\nBut for L = len(s)-1, we can check if any two substrings of that length are equal.\n\nWait, wait. Actually, for L, we're considering substrings of length L. So for each possible starting index i (from 0 to len(s) - L), we can take the substring s[i:i+L], and then check if this substring appears anywhere else in the string, possibly starting from i+1 or later.\n\nSo for each L, loop through all possible substrings of length L, store them in a set, and check if any subsequent substring is already in the set. If yes, then return L.\n\nAlternatively, for each L, iterate through the substrings, and for each substring, check if it appears again after the current position.\n\nBut maybe a more efficient way is to use a set to keep track of seen substrings. Once a substring is found again, we can return the current L.\n\nWait, no. Because the same substring could have been seen before, but perhaps the first occurrence was earlier. So when we find a substring that's already in the set, that means it has appeared before, hence it's a duplicate. So for each L, we can process substrings in order, add them to a set, and for each new substring, check if it's in the set. If it is, return L.\n\nWait, no, because for a substring at position i, if a previous substring at position j (j < i) is the same, then it's a duplicate. So adding to the set as we go would capture that.\n\nFor example, when processing substrings in order, say for 'ababa' and L=3:\n\nSubstrings are 'aba' (i=0), 'bab' (i=1), 'aba' (i=2). When we process i=2, the substring is 'aba' which is already in the set (added when i=0). So we can immediately return 3.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each L from len(s) down to 1:\n\n   create an empty set to track seen substrings.\n\n   for each i from 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr is in the set: return L\n\n       else: add substr to the set\n\nSo, for each L, we process all possible substrings of that length, and as soon as a duplicate is found, we know that L is the maximum possible and return it.\n\nIf no duplicates are found for any L, then the maximum is 0, but according to the examples, the output for 'zzz' is 2. Wait, because the entire string is 'zzz' which has length 3. Wait, but the sample input shows that 'zzz' outputs 2. Wait, let me check the sample:\n\nSample Input:\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output:\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nWait, for 'zzz', the substrings of length 3 is just 'zzz' once. So for L=3, there's only one substring. So no duplicates. Then for L=2, we look for substrings of length 2. So the substrings are 'zz' starting at 0 and 1. So when i=0, substr is 'zz' added to the set. When i=1, substr is 'zz' which is already in the set. So return 2.\n\nAh, right. So the code needs to handle that.\n\nSo the algorithm is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nIn Python, the code would read the input string, then loop L from len(s) down to 1.\n\nWait, no. Because len(s) is the maximum possible substring, but for L to have at least two occurrences, len(s) must be >= 2*L. Or wait, no. Because overlapping is allowed. For example, 'aaaa' has substrings of length 2: 'aa' occurs three times, so L=2 is possible.\n\nWait, but for L= len(s), there's only one substring, so no duplicates. So for the outer loop, L can start from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n\nWait, but what if len(s) is 1? Then the output is 0, since no substring can appear twice.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nif max_len == 0:\n    print(0)\n\nWait, but wait. What about when len(s) is 1? Then len(s) is 1, so the loop runs L from 1 down to 1.\n\nIn the inner loop, i ranges from 0 to len(s) - L + 1 - 1? Because len(s) - L + 1 is 1-1+1=1, so i runs from 0 to 0 inclusive. So substr is s[0:1], which is the only substring. It's added to the set. No duplicates, so loop continues. After all L's, returns 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'ababa'.\n\nFor L=5, only one substring. So no.\n\nFor L=4: check all possible substrings of length 4. Are any of them duplicated? No, since each substring is unique.\n\nFor L=3: substrings are 'aba' (i=0), 'bab' (i=1), 'aba' (i=2). When i=2, substr 'aba' is already in the set. So return 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa'. For L=5, only one substring. L=4: substrings 'aaaa' (i=0 and i=1). So when i=0, add to set. When i=1, substr 'aaaa' is in set, so return 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: 'abcab'. Let's see. The substrings of length 4 are 'abca' (i=0) and 'bcab' (i=1). No duplicates. For L=3: 'abc', 'cab', 'abc' (i=3). So when i=3, substr 'abc' is already in the set. So return 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nSo now, the code structure:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nLoop L from len(s) down to 1:\n\n   create a set.\n\n   for each i in 0 to len(s)-L inclusive:\n\n      substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n      if substr in seen: return L\n\n      add to seen\n\nIf no L found, return 0.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, len(s)-L +1 is the number of possible starting positions. Because for a substring of length L, the last possible starting index is len(s) - L.\n\nSo in the code, the inner loop should run for i in range(len(s) - L + 1).\n\nWait, no. Because the upper limit for i is len(s) - L. Because i+L must be <= len(s). So for example, if len(s) is 5, L is 3: i can be 0, 1, 2. So len(s) - L is 2, so the range is 0 to 2 inclusive.\n\nSo in code, the inner loop is for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n\nNo, wait, range is exclusive on the upper end. So for i in range(a, b) includes a up to b-1. So to get i from 0 to (len(s) - L), inclusive, we need to have range(len(s) - L + 1).\n\nWait, let me think: len(s) - L + 1 is the number of possible substrings. So for i in 0 to (number-1), the indices are 0,1,...,number-1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for example, len(s)=5, L=3: number of substrings is 5-3+1=3. So i runs 0,1,2.\n\nSo in code, the inner loop is for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n\nYes.\n\nSo in code, the loops are:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nfor L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but what about when the string is empty? Well, the problem says the string is non-empty, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: 'abcd'\n\nCheck L=4: substr 'abcd' only once. So no.\n\nL=3: substrings 'abc', 'bcd'. No duplicates.\n\nL=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'. No duplicates.\n\nL=1: 'a','b','c','d'. No duplicates. So output 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa'\n\nAs discussed, returns 3.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz'.\n\nL=3: only one substring.\n\nL=2: substrings are 'zz' (i=0), 'zz' (i=1). When i=1, substr 'zz' is in seen, so return 2.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nWhat about when the string is length 2, like 'aa'? Then L=2: only one substring, so proceed. L=1: substrings 'a' and 'a' are same. So returns 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'ababab'. The entire string is length 6. Check L=6: only one. L=5: substrings 'ababa' and 'babab'â€”no duplicates. L=4: 'abab', 'baba'â€”no. L=3: 'aba', 'bab', 'aba' (at i=3). So returns 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Substring Lengths**: We start by considering the longest possible substrings and work our way down to shorter ones. This ensures that the first valid length we find is the maximum possible.\n2. **Check for Duplicates**: For each length `L`, we generate all possible substrings of that length. Using a set, we track which substrings have been seen so far. If a substring is encountered again, it means we have found a duplicate, and we return the current length `L`.\n3. **Edge Cases**: If no duplicates are found for any length, the result is 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\nfor L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Loop Over Lengths**: We loop from the length of the string down to 1. This ensures we check the longest possible substrings first.\n3. **Track Substrings**: For each length `L`, we use a set to keep track of substrings we have seen. As we generate each substring, we check if it has been seen before.\n4. **Return Result**: If a duplicate substring is found, we immediately print the length `L` and exit. If no duplicates are found after checking all lengths, we print 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the longest repeated substring by leveraging the properties of sets for quick lookups, ensuring optimal performance even for the maximum input size.",
