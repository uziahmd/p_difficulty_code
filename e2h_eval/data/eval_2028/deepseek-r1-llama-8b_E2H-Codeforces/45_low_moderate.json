There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a tennis tournament where players are eliminated in each game, and the tournament grid isn't fixed yet. But there's a specific rule: two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. My task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in.\n\nHmm, right. So the winner needs to play as many games as possible, but each time he plays, the opponent must have a similar number of prior games. Let's think about how the tournament can be structured to maximize this.\n\nLet's start with small examples. For n=2, there's only one game. So the answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. Like, first he plays someone, then plays another. Because after the first game, he has 1 game, and the next opponent also has 0 or 1 games. Wait, no. Wait, the second opponent could have played a game that the winner didn't, but how?\n\nWait, maybe the key is to model how the winner's path looks. Each game the winner plays, he must have beaten someone, and each such opponent had a certain number of games themselves before facing the winner.\n\nI think the maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by building a binary-like structure where each step adds the possibility for another game.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a Fibonacci-like sequence. Because each time the winner plays, the opponent could come from a subtree where their own number of games is either equal or one less than the winner's current count.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think recursively. Suppose the winner has k games. How does that relate to the number of players required?\n\nWait, let's consider that in each game, the winner increases his count by 1. But for each new game, the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\nSo for example, the winner's first game is against someone who hasn't played any game before. Then, the second game is against someone who has played once (so the winner now has 1, the opponent has 0 or 1). Wait, but if the opponent has 0, then the winner's next game can't have an opponent with 0 because the difference would be more than 1. So maybe the opponent must have exactly one game before facing the winner.\n\nWait, maybe each time the winner plays, he must have opponents that have either the same number of games or one less.\n\nWait, let's think about the structure of the tournament. The winner must form a chain where each opponent has a certain number of wins leading up to their match with the winner.\n\nFor example, in the sample where n=10, the maximum is 4. So the winner plays 4 games. How does that happen?\n\nThe way it's structured is that the winner plays against someone who has 0 games, then against someone who has 1, then 2, then 3. Or maybe a different order.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest k such that the sum of the series 1 + 2 + ... + (k) is less than or equal to n. No, wait, that doesn't fit the sample. For n=10, 1+2+3+4=10, which matches the sample. But wait, in the sample, the output was 4, so that seems to fit.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nn=2: sum 1=1 <=2 → k=1.\n\nn=3: sum 1+2=3 → k=2.\n\nn=4: sum 1+2=3 ≤4. Can we go higher? What's the maximum k for n=4.\n\nWait, the sample says for n=4, the output is 2. So according to the sum approach, 1+2=3 ≤4, so k=2. But why can't the winner play 3 games?\n\nBecause to have 3 games, the opponents would need to have 0,1,2 games respectively. So let's see: the first game is 0 vs 1 (winner plays 0), then in the second, the winner plays someone who has 1, then third, someone with 2. So total games played by the winner is 3.\n\nBut wait, in that case, how many players do we need?\n\nEach opponent's number of games before facing the winner must be either equal or one less.\n\nWait, maybe the sum is not the right approach. Maybe the maximum k is the largest number where Fib(k+2) ≤n, because each step depends on the previous steps.\n\nWait, that rings a bell. Because the problem resembles the Fibonacci sequence, where each step depends on the two previous steps",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given that each game is a knockout and the rule that two players can only face each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the problem can be approached using a Fibonacci-like sequence. Each time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have either the same number of prior games or one fewer. This leads us to model the maximum number of games as the largest Fibonacci number that fits within the given number of players.\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The maximum number of games the winner can play, `k`, corresponds to the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` Fibonacci numbers is less than or equal to `n`.\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: We use an iterative approach to compute Fibonacci numbers until the sum exceeds `n`. The last valid Fibonacci number before exceeding `n` gives us the maximum number of games.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef max_games(n):\n    a, b = 1, 2\n    count = 1\n    total = a\n    while True:\n        next_val = a + b\n        if total + next_val > n:\n            return count\n        total += next_val\n        a, b = b, next_val\n        count += 1\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(max_games(n))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start with the first two Fibonacci numbers, `1` and `2`, representing the number of games the winner can play in the simplest cases.\n- **Loop Until Exceeding `n`**: We iteratively compute the next Fibonacci number and add it to the total sum of games. If adding the next Fibonacci number would exceed `n`, we return the count of games.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach efficiently computes the result in logarithmic time relative to `n`, ensuring it handles the upper constraint of `n` up to 1018 effectively.\n\nThis solution leverages the properties of the Fibonacci sequence to determine the maximum number of games the winner can play, adhering to the problem constraints and ensuring optimal performance.",
