String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vasily the Bear and Beautiful Strings.\" Hmm, sounds interesting.\n\nSo, the task is to count the number of beautiful strings based on certain criteria. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nA string is considered beautiful if it meets these conditions:\n1. It consists only of 0s and 1s.\n2. It has exactly n 0s and m 1s.\n3. We can obtain character g (either 0 or 1) from the string with some modifications. \n\nWhat's a modification? Oh right, it's an operation where you replace the last two characters with one. The new character depends on which two you're replacing: if both are 0, replace with 0; if both are 1, replace with 1; otherwise, it becomes 0. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh, no— the problem says that the replacement is one if it replaces two zeros, else zero. So when you modify, you look at the last two characters. If they are both 0, you replace them with a single 0. If they are both 1, replace with a 1. Otherwise, replace with 0. So for example, \"00\" becomes \"0\", \"11\" becomes \"1\", and \"01\" becomes \"0\".\n\nBut wait, how does this affect the ability to get g from the string? Because each modification reduces the length by one. So to get g, we must be able to perform a series of such operations until we have just one character left, which should be g.\n\nHmm, okay. So for a string to be beautiful, after applying some number of modifications (including zero), the resulting single character must be g. And the original string must satisfy the count of 0s and 1s as specified.\n\nThe question is to find the number of such beautiful strings modulo 1e9+7.\n\nLet me try to break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the initial counts are fixed: exactly n 0s and m 1s. So the total length of the string is k = n + m. But since each modification reduces the length by 1, the number of modifications possible is k-1. Because you can't modify a string of length less than 2.\n\nWait, but the number of modifications isn't fixed. You can do any number of modifications as long as the length is at least 2.\n\nSo the key is to model the process of modifying the string and see whether the final character is g.\n\nBut modeling all possible strings directly might be too computationally heavy because n and m can be up to 105, making the maximum string length 210. So the number of possible strings is C(210, 105) which is way too big to compute directly.\n\nWe need a dynamic programming approach or combinatorial math to calculate the number of valid strings.\n\nLet me think about the end result. After a series of modifications, the string reduces to a single character, which must be g. So the problem reduces to counting the number of binary strings with exactly n 0s and m 1s such that, through a series of allowed modifications, the final character is g.\n\nEach modification step affects the last two characters. So perhaps the order in which modifications are applied matters, but maybe there's a pattern or invariant that can help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the possible configurations of the string as it's being modified, keeping track of certain properties.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to determine whether the entire string can be reduced to g, regardless of the order of modifications. So, for a given string, is it possible to apply modifications such that the final character is g?\n\nIf yes, then that string contributes to the count.\n\nSo how do we model this? Maybe we can find a condition on the string that must be satisfied for it to be reducible to g.\n\nLet me think about the effect of each modification on the string. Each modification replaces the last two characters with a new one, which could change the overall structure of the string.\n\nBut perhaps the key lies in the parity of certain counts or the arrangement of 0s and 1s in the string.\n\nWait, another angle: consider that each modification reduces the string's length by 1. The process continues until only one character remains. So the number of modifications is (k-1), where k is the initial length.\n\nBut wait, no— because the order of modifications can vary, and different orders may lead to different outcomes. So the same string can be reduced to different results depending on the order of modifications. So the problem isn't just about whether the string can be reduced to g, but whether it's possible to choose an order of modifications that leads to g.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nWait, but maybe the outcome is determined by certain properties of the string, regardless of the order of modifications. For example, perhaps the final character is determined by the initial counts and the way 0s and 1s are arranged.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final character depends on the sum of something.\n\nWait, let's think about small examples.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nn=1, m=1, g=0.\n\nThe beautiful strings are \"01\" and \"10\". Let's see why.\n\nEach of these strings can be reduced to 0.\n\nFor \"01\": the last two are '0' and '1'. Since they are different, the modification replaces them with 0. So the string becomes \"0\".\n\nFor \"10\": the last two are '1' and '0', again different. So the modification replaces them with 0. So both can be reduced to 0.\n\nIn the second sample, n=2, m=2, g=0.\n\nThe four beautiful strings are \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".\n\nEach of these can be reduced to 0.\n\nFor example, take \"0011\":\n\nModifying the last two '1's gives '11' → '1', so the string becomes \"001\". Now, the last two are '0' and '1' → replace with 0, leading to \"00\". Then, replace those to '0'.\n\nAlternatively, other orders could lead to 0 as well.\n\nSo how do these strings differ in a way that allows them to be reduced to g, while others cannot.\n\nAnother sample is when n=1, m=1, g=1. The output is 0, meaning no such strings exist.\n\nSo in this case, the possible strings are \"01\" and \"10\", but neither can be reduced to 1.\n\nBecause when you modify the last two, which are different, you get 0, so the final character is 0, not 1.\n\nAh, so in this case, the final character is forced to be 0, regardless of the initial string.\n\nSo the third sample's output is 0 because no string with n=1, m=1 can be reduced to 1.\n\nSo what determines whether a string can be reduced to g?\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is the parity of the number of times certain patterns occur in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps the final character depends on the total number of 0s and 1s and their arrangement.\n\nWait, another thought: each modification effectively reduces the string by one character, but also changes the content based on the last two.\n\nBut perhaps the final character can be determined by considering the entire string's structure and the way the modifications are applied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final character is determined by the way the string ends. Because each modification affects the end.\n\nWait, here's an idea: the final character depends on the way the string is built. Suppose that during the modification steps, certain choices are made that influence the final character.\n\nBut perhaps the final character is determined by the initial string's properties in a way that can be expressed combinatorially.\n\nWait, perhaps the final character is equal to the result of some function of the initial string. For example, the final character could be determined by the number of times certain transitions between 0 and 1 occur in the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's determined by the count of certain runs or groups of 0s and 1s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using dynamic programming, where we track the current state of the string as it's being modified. The state would include information like the current length, the last character, and perhaps some counts of 0s and 1s remaining.\n\nBut considering the constraints, n and m can be up to 105, so the DP state needs to be manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the process of building the string and the possible ways to reduce it.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAnother approach: Think recursively. For a string s, the result of modifying the last two characters is either 0 or 1, depending on what they were. So, for a string s, its reduction can be determined by the result of reducing the string without the last character, or the result of reducing the last two characters, etc.\n\nWait, but this seems complicated.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's model the possible states of the string as it's being modified. The state can be represented by the counts of 0s and 1s remaining, and the last character. Because each modification reduces the counts of the last two characters and replaces them with one.\n\nWait, but that might not capture all necessary information.\n\nWait, perhaps the state is defined by:\n\n- The current length of the string (initially k = n + m).\n- The current last character (0 or 1).\n- The counts of 0s and 1s remaining.\n\nWait, but since each modification removes two characters (reducing the count by two) and adds one, the counts of 0s and 1s can be tracked as the process proceeds.\n\nBut even this might be too much, considering that n and m can be up to 105. So the state space would be (k) * 2 * (n+1) * (m+1). For k up to 210, that's 210*2*106*106 ≈ 44 million. That's a bit high, but perhaps manageable with memoization and optimizations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to model this.\n\nWait, let's think about what determines whether a string can be reduced to g.\n\nSuppose that during the process of reducing the string, certain decisions are made that influence the final character. But perhaps the final character is determined by the initial counts of 0s and 1s and the way the modifications are applied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final character is determined by the parity of some count.\n\nWait, let's think about the third sample: n=1, m=1. The possible strings are \"01\" and \"10\". Both have one 0 and one 1. When you modify the last two, which are different, you get a 0. So the final character is 0. Thus, no strings can be reduced to 1.\n\nSo for the third sample, the answer is zero.\n\nSo for a string to be reducible to g, perhaps certain conditions must be met based on n, m, and g.\n\nAnother example: suppose n=2, m=2, g=0. The four beautiful strings can all be reduced to 0.\n\nLooking at each string:\n\n\"0011\" → last two are '1's. Replace with '1', so the string becomes \"001\". Then, the last two are '0' and '1' → replaced with 0, leaving \"00\", which becomes 0.\n\nAlternatively, in another order, say modify \"0011\" by first changing the last two '1's to '1' → \"001\", then the last two are '0' and '1' → replaced by 0 → \"00\" → 0.\n\nSimilarly for other strings.\n\nSo what's special about the strings in the second sample?\n\nWell, n=2, m=2. The string can have any arrangement of two 0s and two 1s. But why can they be reduced to 0?\n\nWait, perhaps the condition is that the number of 0s and 1s must allow for the final character to be g.\n\nWait, in the first sample, n=1, m=1, g=0: the final character is 0, which is g.\n\nIn the second sample, n=2, m=2, g=0: the final character is 0.\n\nIn the third sample, n=1, m=1, g=1: the final character is 0, so it's not acceptable.\n\nSo perhaps the condition is that the sum (n - m) mod something must be congruent to g?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to look at the difference between the counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nWait, let's think about the third sample: n=1, m=1. So n-m=0. The desired g is 1. But the final character is 0, which is not 1. So that's why the count is zero.\n\nIn the first sample, n=1, m=1, desired g=0. The sum is 0, and g is 0.\n\nIn the second sample, n=2, m=2. Desired g=0. Sum is 0, same as before.\n\nHmm, but that doesn't directly explain why the third sample is 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the final character is determined by the sum of certain factors, such as the counts of 0s and 1s and the way they are arranged.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final character is determined by the initial counts of 0s and 1s and their arrangement, but it's not straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be rephrased: for a string with exactly n 0s and m 1s, can it be reduced to g via a series of modifications, and how many such strings are there.\n\nSo, the core of the problem is to find the number of binary strings with exactly n 0s and m 1s that can be reduced to g.\n\nSo the question is: How do we determine whether a given string can be reduced to g, and count all such possible strings.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as a graph, where each node represents a state, and edges represent the possible transitions via a modification.\n\nThe state can be represented by:\n\n- The current count of 0s (a)\n- The current count of 1s (b)\n- The last character (c) (0 or 1)\n\nEach modification takes the last two characters and replaces them with a new one.\n\nWait, but the modification affects the last two characters, which could be 0 and 0, 1 and 1, or 0 and 1 (in any order).\n\nWait, but the last character is c, so the previous to last is whatever was before that.\n\nHmm, perhaps the state needs to include the last two characters. But that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state can be the counts of 0s and 1s, along with the last two characters.\n\nBut that could lead to a lot of states.\n\nAnother idea: since the process of modifying is similar to building the string from the end, perhaps we can model the problem by starting from the end and working backwards.\n\nWait, but that's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding the number of binary strings with n 0s and m 1s such that, when you collapse pairs from the end, you end up with g.\n\nEach collapse step replaces the last two characters with a new one based on their values.\n\nSo the question is: how can we model this process.\n\nAn alternative approach: for a string to be reducible to g, the following must be true.\n\nConsider that each modification reduces the string by one character, and the last two determine the new character.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a kind of automaton, where each state represents the current end of the string.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final character is determined by the parity of certain counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the final character is determined by the count of 0s and 1s and their arrangement in a way that depends on the number of times a certain transition occurs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final character is equal to the sum of the initial 0s and 1s minus some function of the number of modifications.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's useful to model the problem using dynamic programming. Let's define dp[a][b][c], where a is the number of 0s left, b is the number of 1s left, and c is the last character (0 or 1). The value of dp[a][b][c] would be the number of ways to reach this state.\n\nBut since each modification reduces the string's length by one, the sum a + b decreases by one each time.\n\nWait, but initially, a = n, b = m, and the string's length is k = n + m.\n\nEach modification step reduces the length by one, so the number of steps is (k - 1).\n\nBut the order of steps matters, so the state must account for the current length, which is a + b.\n\nWait, but a + b can be tracked as k - t, where t is the number of steps taken so far.\n\nSo perhaps the state can be represented as (a, b, c), and the transitions correspond to possible modifications.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nInitially, the state is (n, m, last_char), where last_char is the last character of the string. But since the string could end with either 0 or 1, this complicates things.\n\nWait, but the string starts as a specific string, so the initial last character depends on the string. So perhaps this approach isn't suitable for counting all possible strings.\n\nHmm, maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's model the problem in terms of the entire string, considering that each modification can affect the string in a certain way, and see how the presence of 0s and 1s in the string affects the possibility of reaching g.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find the number of strings with n 0s and m 1s that can be reduced to g, regardless of the order of modifications.\n\nAnother thought: each modification replaces the last two characters with a new one. So, the process is somewhat similar to evaluating the string from right to left, combining pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps the final character is determined by the way the string is constructed from the end. So, the last pair of characters determines the next step, which in turn affects the preceding characters.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached using dynamic programming, where for each possible position and state, we track the number of ways to reach that state.\n\nLet me think about the DP approach.\n\nDefine a DP table where dp[i][j][k] represents the number of ways to have a substring of length i, ending with k (0 or 1), with j 0s and l 1s used so far.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, think of the DP state as the current counts of 0s and 1s, and the last two characters.\n\nBut that's getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the final character is determined by the sum of the number of 0s and 1s, and their arrangement.\n\nWait, another observation: Each modification reduces the length of the string by 1, and thus, the number of modifications is (k-1). The final character depends on the sequence of modifications.\n\nBut perhaps the final character is determined by the initial string in a way that can be computed with some formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the final character is equal to the XOR of the initial counts of 0s and 1s. Or something along those lines.\n\nWait, no. Let's test with the samples.\n\nSample 1: n=1, m=1. XOR is 0. Which matches the final character being 0.\n\nSample 2: n=2, m=2. XOR is 0. Final character is 0.\n\nSample 3: n=1, m=1. XOR is 0. Desired g is 1. So no.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So in cases where the XOR is equal to g, perhaps the string can be reduced to g.\n\nWait, let's test another case.\n\nSuppose n=3, m=1. Total length 4. What's the possible final character?\n\nIf the string is \"0001\": when you modify the last two, which are '0' and '1', you get '0'. Then the string becomes \"001\". Then, modify the last two '0's to '0', resulting in \"0\". So final character is 0.\n\nBut the XOR is 3^1=2, which is not 0. So that's conflicting with the earlier hypothesis.\n\nWait, that suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe the XOR isn't the right approach. Let's think differently.\n\nPerhaps the final character depends on the parity of the number of times certain transitions happen in the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final character is determined by the parity of the number of 0s and 1s.\n\nWait, in the first sample, n=1, m=1. Both are odd numbers. Final character is 0.\n\nIn the second sample, n=2, m=2. Both even. Final is 0.\n\nIn the third sample, n=1, m=1. Final is 0.\n\nWait, but in another example, n=2, m=1. Let's see.\n\nPossible string: \"001\". Length is 3. Modifications can be done twice.\n\nFirst, modify the last two '0's → '0', resulting in \"0\". So final character is 0.\n\nAnother string: \"010\". Modify the last two '1' and '0' → replace with 0, string becomes \"00\" → replace to 0.\n\nAnother string: \"100\". Modify last two '0's → '0', string becomes \"10\" → modify to 0.\n\nSo all possible strings with n=2, m=1 can be reduced to 0.\n\nSo the final character is 0, which is g=0.\n\nIn this case, n=2, m=1. So n + m is 3, which is odd.\n\nSo the final character is 0, which is g=0.\n\nSo perhaps the final character is determined by the parity of (n - m).\n\nWait, in the first sample, n=1, m=1. n - m = 0, which is even. Final character is 0.\n\nIn the second sample, n=2, m=2. n - m = 0, even. Final character is 0.\n\nIn the third sample, n=1, m=1. Same as above.\n\nIn the case of n=2, m=1: n - m = 1, which is odd. Final character is 0.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nWait, another example: n=3, m=2.\n\nSo the string has 5 characters. Let's see what the final character could be.\n\nIf the string is \"00011\":\n\nModify the last two '1's → '1', string becomes \"0001\". Then, modify last two '0's → '0', string becomes \"001\". Then, modify last two '0's → '0', final character is 0.\n\nAnother string: \"00101\".\n\nModify last two '1' and '0' → replace with 0. String becomes \"0010\". Modify last two '0's → '0', string becomes \"00\". Replace to 0.\n\nFinal character is 0.\n\nWait, what if the string ends with '01'?\n\nLike \"01000\": let's see.\n\nModify last two '0's → '0', string becomes \"0100\". Then, modify last two '0's → '0', string becomes \"010\". Then, modify last two '1' and '0' → '0', string becomes \"0\". Final character is 0.\n\nHmm, so all these examples end up as 0.\n\nWait, but what if n=3, m=1. Let's see.\n\nString: \"0001\".\n\nModify last two '0's → '0', string becomes \"001\". Modify last two '0's → '0', final character 0.\n\nAnother string: \"0010\" → same as above.\n\nAnother string: \"0100\" → same as above.\n\nAnother string: \"1000\" → same as above.\n\nSo, all these strings can be reduced to 0.\n\nSo, what's the condition when a string can be reduced to g?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the sum (n - m) must be congruent to g modulo something.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, n=1, m=1, g=0. 1-1=0, which is 0 mod 2, which equals g.\n\nIn the second sample, n=2, m=2: 0 mod 2 equals g.\n\nIn the third sample, n=1, m=1: 0 mod 2 equals g=1? No, because 0 != 1.\n\nWait, but that's not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's more about the total number of 0s and 1s and how they can be combined.\n\nWait, perhaps the final character is determined by the sum of the initial 0s and 1s, but that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final character is determined by the initial counts and the way the string is structured.\n\nWait, perhaps the final character is determined by the following rule:\n\nIf the number of 0s and 1s are both even, then the final character is 0.\n\nWait, but in the third sample, n=1, m=1: both are odd, but the final character is 0.\n\nNo, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the final character is determined by the parity of the number of 0s and 1s.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's model the process as a series of merges. Each merge operation combines two characters into one. The way this merging happens affects the final character.\n\nBut perhaps the order of merges doesn't matter for the final character.\n\nWait, perhaps the final character is determined by the initial counts and the rules of merging, regardless of the order in which the merges are performed.\n\nIf that's the case, then the problem reduces to finding whether the initial counts allow for the final character to be g, regardless of the order.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to compute for given n and m, what is the possible final character(s) that can result from any sequence of merges.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each test case, we can precompute all possible possible final characters, and then check whether g is among them.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the final character is determined by the initial number of 0s and 1s and their arrangement in a way that can be computed combinatorially.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final character is determined by the difference between the counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nWait, let's think about the process of merging.\n\nEach merge reduces the string's length by one. The way the merge affects the string is as follows:\n\n- If the two last characters are both 0, they become 0.\n- If both are 1, they become 1.\n- Else, they become 0.\n\nSo, the final character is influenced by the way the string is merged.\n\nBut perhaps the final character is determined by the initial counts and the way the string is structured.\n\nWait, let's think about the case where the string is all 0s. Then, any merge will result in 0, so the final character is 0.\n\nSimilarly, if the string is all 1s, the final character is 1.\n\nWhat if the string is a mix?\n\nWait, another idea: the final character is determined by the majority of some kind.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the final character is determined by the parity of the number of transitions between 0 and 1 in the string.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's model the problem in terms of the possible outcomes for the final character based on n and m.\n\nSuppose that for a string with n 0s and m 1s, the final character can be g if and only if (n - m) is congruent to g modulo 2.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nIn the first sample, n=1, m=1: n-m=0, which is 0 mod 2. g=0. So condition holds.\n\nIn the second sample, n=2, m=2: 0 mod 2, g=0. Condition holds.\n\nThird sample, n=1, m=1: 0 mod 2, g=1. Condition not holds.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1: n-m=1, which is 1 mod 2. Suppose g=1. Then condition holds.

So final character is 0.\n\nAnother string: \"0010\" → same.\n\nAnother string: \"0100\" → same.\n\nAnother string: \"1000\" → same.\n\nSo, final character is 0.\n\nSo, in all these cases, the final character is 0.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the final character is always 0 unless the number of 1s is strictly greater than the number of 0s.\n\nWait, in the sample where n=1, m=1: m is not strictly greater than n.\n\nSample 2: n=2, m=2: equal.\n\nAnother test case: n=0, m=1: the string is \"1\". Cannot modify. So the final character is 1.\n\nSo, in this case, the final character is 1.\n\nHmm, but what if n=0, m=2.\n\nThe string is \"11\". Modify to \"1\". So final character is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=0, m=3.\n\nString \"111\". Modify to \"11\", then to \"1\". Final character is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=0, m=0: impossible, since n+m >=1.\n\nSo, in cases where n=0, the final character is 1.\n\nSimilarly, when m=0, the final character is 0.\n\nWait, but what about when n=0 and m=1.\n\nYes, as above, the final character is 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is:\n\nIf the string has all 0s (n>0, m=0), then the final character is 0.\n\nIf the string has all 1s (n=0, m>0), then the final character is 1.\n\nOtherwise, the final character depends on some other condition.\n\nWait, but in cases where the string has a mix of 0s and 1s, the final character seems to be 0.\n\nBut wait, in the earlier example where n=3, m=1, all strings can be reduced to 0.\n\nBut what if the string ends with '1'?\n\nLike \"0011\".\n\nWait, no, in that case, the final character would be 0.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nString \"0011\": length 4.\n\nModify last two '1's → '1', string becomes \"001\".\n\nModify last two '0's → '0', string becomes \"00\". Modify to '0'.\n\nFinal character is 0.\n\nAnother string: \"0101\".\n\nModify last two '1's → '1', string becomes \"010\".\n\nModify last two '0's → '0', string becomes \"00\" → 0.\n\nAnother string: \"1110\".\n\nModify last two '1's → '1', string becomes \"110\".\n\nModify last two '1's → '1', string becomes \"10\".\n\nModify last two '1' and '0' → 0. So final character is 0.\n\nHmm, so in all these cases, the final character is 0.\n\nBut wait, is there a scenario where the final character is 1?\n\nYes, perhaps when the string is \"101\".\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nString \"101\".\n\nModify last two '0' and '1' → 0, string becomes \"10\".\n\nModify last two '1' and '0' → 0. So final character is 0.\n\nAnother string: \"1001\".\n\nModify last two '0's → 0, string becomes \"100\".\n\nModify last two '0's → 0, string becomes \"10\".\n\nModify last two → 0.\n\nFinal character is 0.\n\nAnother example: \"1101\".\n\nModify last two '0's → 0, string becomes \"110\".\n\nModify last two '1's → 1, string becomes \"11\".\n\nModify to 1. Final character is 1.\n\nWait, that's a case where the final character is 1.\n\nSo, in this string, the final character is 1.\n\nSo, in this case, the initial n=2, m=2.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, when n=2, m=2, the final character is 0. But this example shows a string that can be reduced to 1.\n\nWait, but wait: the initial string is \"1101\", which has two 1s and two 0s. So in the sample, the answer is 4, but each string can be reduced to 0.\n\nBut in this case, \"1101\" can be reduced to 1.\n\nSo perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's walk through the example \"1101\".\n\nInitial string: \"1101\".\n\nStep 1: modify last two '0's → '0', string becomes \"110\".\n\nNow, the string is \"110\".\n\nStep 2: modify last two '1's → '1', string becomes \"11\".\n\nStep 3: modify last two '1's → '1'.\n\nFinal character is 1.\n\nSo, for this string, the final character is 1.\n\nBut according to the sample, when n=2, m=2, g=0, the count is 4.\n\nWhich suggests that there are four strings that can be reduced to 0.\n\nSo why is \"1101\" not among them?\n\nBecause it can be reduced to 1.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the string can be reduced to g. So for the sample where g=0, this string cannot be counted.\n\nBut in that case, why is the count 4?\n\nBecause four of the possible strings can be reduced to 0.\n\nSo the other four must be the ones that can be reduced to 0.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that for a given n, m, and g, we need to count all strings that can be reduced to g.\n\nSo, the problem is not about all possible strings, but only those that can be reduced to g.\n\nThus, the core of the problem is to find for each possible string whether it can be reduced to g, and count it.\n\nBut the challenge is to model this efficiently.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be broken down into determining for given n, m, and g whether it's possible to have a string with n 0s and m 1s that can be reduced to g, and then compute the number of such strings.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother Idea: Let's model the problem as a function that, given n, m, and g, returns the number of such strings. We can find this function by considering the possible ways the string can be reduced to g.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find the number of ways to arrange the 0s and 1s such that, when you perform a series of merges, you end up with g.\n\nEach merge affects the last two characters, so the arrangement of the string is crucial.\n\nBut how can we model this in a way that's computationally feasible?\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's model the problem with dynamic programming, tracking the current state of the string as we build it.\n\nThe state can be:\n\n- The number of 0s remaining (a)\n- The number of 1s remaining (b)\n- The last character (c)\n- The current length (l)\n\nBut this may be too memory-intensive.\n\nWait, but perhaps the last character is sufficient to determine the next state, as each merge depends only on the last two.\n\nWait, but the merge is determined by the last two characters, so knowing the last character and the previous to last character would be necessary.\n\nBut that complicates the state further.\n\nAnother Idea: Instead of thinking about the entire string, perhaps model the problem by considering the possible transitions of the last two characters.\n\nWait, for example, the state can be the last two characters.\n\nBut since the string is built from left to right, and merges are done from the end, perhaps this isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process can be thought of as building the string from the end, with each step adding a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be reduced to a specific character (0 or 1) after a series of modifications. Each modification replaces two last characters with a new character based on their values.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to determine whether a string with `n` zeros and `m` ones can be reduced to the target character `g` after a series of modifications. The approach involves dynamic programming where we track the state of the string as it's being modified.\n\n1. **State Representation**: Use a dynamic programming table `dp[a][b][c]` where:\n   - `a` is the number of zeros remaining.\n   - `b` is the number of ones remaining.\n   - `c` is the last character (0 or 1).\n\n2. **Transitions**: For each state `(a, b, c)`, consider the possible next states by modifying the last two characters. The new character is determined based on the values of the last two characters:\n   - If both are 0, replace with 0.\n   - If both are 1, replace with 1.\n   - Otherwise, replace with 0.\n\n3. **Base Case**: Initialize the DP table with the base cases where the string ends with either 0 or 1.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, use modulo `1000000007` to keep the numbers manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\nif (n == 0 and m == 0):\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\nmax_len = n + m\nif max_len < 2:\n    print(0 if g != (n + m == 0) else 1)\n    exit()\n\n# We'll compute dp[a][b][c], representing the number of ways to have a substring ending with c,\n# using a 0s and b 1s.\n\n# We need to process all possible a and b, starting from higher to lower.\n# But since the order of modifications matters, we'll process in reverse.\n\n# Initialize DP table\ndp = [[[0]*2 for _ in range(m+1)] for __ in range(n+1)]\n\n# Base case: empty string\ndp[0][0][0] = 1 if 0 == g else 0\ndp[0][0][1] = 1 if 1 == g else 0\n\n# Now, fill the DP table\nfor a in range(max_len, -1, -1):\n    for b in range(max_len, -1, -1):\n        if a + b == 0:\n            continue  # empty string\n        # The current string has a 0s and b 1s\n        # The last character could be 0 or 1\n        for c in [0, 1]:\n            if a >= 0 and b >= 0 and c in [0, 1]:\n                ways = dp[a][b][c]\n                if ways == 0:\n                    continue\n                # Consider modifying the last two characters\n                # The previous to last character is something, but we don't track it\n                # So instead, consider all possibilities for the last two\n                # Since we don't track the previous, it's tricky.
