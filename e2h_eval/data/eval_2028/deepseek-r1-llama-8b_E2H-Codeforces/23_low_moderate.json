            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about determining the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu in her hand. Mentsu can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). \n\nHmm. So the input is three strings representing the current tiles she has. Each string has a digit followed by 'm', 'p', or 's'. I need to compute for each possible scenario how many more tiles she needs to add to form a mentsu.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the output isn't per scenario but per tile? Or wait, looking back at the example, the output is a list of three numbers, each corresponding to one of the three initial tiles. Oh right, because each tile could be part of a different way to form a mentsu. So for each of the three tiles, we need to calculate the minimal number of draws required if that tile is part of a mentsu.\n\nWait, maybe not exactly. Because each of the three tiles is part of a group, and we need to consider all possibilities. But perhaps the approach is to generate all possible mentsu options from the given tiles plus any added tiles, and find the minimal additions required across all possible mentsu options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the idea is to evaluate all possible mentsu that can be formed considering the current tiles and determine the minimal number of tiles needed to complete each possible mentsu. Then, among all these, find the smallest number.\n\nBut since the problem allows adding any tiles, including duplicates, the approach might involve checking all possible ways to form a mentsu using the current tiles, and then seeing what's missing. For each possible mentsu, compute how many tiles are already present, subtract from 3, and that gives the required draws. Then take the minimum across all possible mentsus.\n\nSo first, I need to generate all possible mentsu possibilities, then for each, count how many of those tiles are already in the current set. The minimal number of draws would be 3 minus that count.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the steps are:\n\n1. Generate all possible koutsu and shuntsu.\n2. For each possible mentsu, calculate how many tiles from it are already present in the current hand.\n3. The required draws for that mentsu is max(0, 3 - current_count).\n4. Find the minimal such value across all possible mentsus.\n5. Output the minimal value.\n\nWait, but some mentsus might require the same or overlapping tiles as others. But since we're considering all possibilities, that's okay.\n\nSo let's think about how to generate all possible mentsu.\n\nFor koutsu: each is three identical tiles. So for each suit, and each number from 1-9, there are two types of mentsu. Wait no, each koutsu is three copies of the same tile. So for each tile (like 1m), there's exactly one koutsu possible.\n\nWait, no. For example, the tile is 1m, so the koutsu is [1m, 1m, 1m]. So for each tile, there's a koutsu consisting of three of them.\n\nWait, no. Each koutsu is exactly three identical tiles. So the possible koutsus are all combinations where all three tiles are the same. So for each tile in the universe of 9*3=27 possible, there's exactly one koutsu.\n\nSo that's manageable.\n\nShuntsus are sequences of three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So for each suit, the possible shuntsus are:\n\n- 1-2-3\n- 2-3-4\n- 3-4-5\n- 4-5-6\n- 5-6-7\n- 6-7-8\n- 7-8-9\n\nSo per suit, seven possible shuntsus.\n\nSo total mentsus are 27 (koutsu) + 7*3 (shuntsus) = 27 +21=48.\n\nSo now, for each of these 48 mentsus, we need to check how many of their tiles are present in the current hand. The minimal required draws would be 3 minus the count for each mentsu.\n\nWait, but for a shuntsu, the three tiles are 1m,2m,3m, etc. So for each shuntsu, the three tiles are consecutive in the same suit.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Enumerate all possible mentsu (48 in total).\n- For each mentsu, create a set containing its three tiles.\n- Check how many tiles from this mentsu are present in the current hand.\n- The required draws",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) using her current hand of three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Generate All Possible Mentsu**: We first generate all possible mentsu that can be formed. A mentsu can be either a koutsu (triplet) or a shuntsu (sequence).\n   - **Koutsu**: For each suit (m, p, s) and each number from 1 to 9, there is exactly one koutsu consisting of three identical tiles.\n   - **Shuntsu**: For each suit, there are seven possible sequences (1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9).\n\n2. **Check Each Mentsu Against Current Tiles**: For each generated mentsu, check how many of its tiles are already present in Tokitsukaze's current hand. The number of additional tiles needed to complete the mentsu is calculated as `3 - count_of_current_tiles`.\n\n3. **Find Minimum Draws**: Among all the mentsu checked, find the one that requires the minimum number of additional tiles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_extra_tiles(tiles):\n    # Generate all possible mentsu\n    mentsus = []\n    \n    # Koutsu: for each tile, the triplet\n    for num in range(1, 10):\n        for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n            mentsus.append({f\"{num}{suit}\" * 3})\n    \n    # Shuntsu: for each suit, the 7 sequences\n    suits = ['m', 'p', 's']\n    for suit in suits:\n        for start in range(1, 8):\n            mentsus.append({f\"{start}{suit}\", f\"{start+1}{suit}\", f\"{start+2}{suit}\"})\n    \n    # Convert input to a set of tiles\n    current = set()\n    for tile in tiles:\n        current.add(tile)\n    \n    min_draws = float('inf')\n    \n    for mentsu in mentsus:\n        count = sum(1 for t in mentsu if t in current)\n        needed = 3 - count\n        if needed < min_draws:\n            min_draws = needed\n            if min_draws == 0:\n                break  # Can't get better than 0\n    \n    return [min_draws] * 3\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ntiles = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()\nprint(' '.join(min_extra_tiles(tiles)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Generating Mentsu**: The code generates all possible koutsu and shuntsu by iterating through each suit and number combination for koutsu and each starting number for shuntsu.\n2. **Checking Current Tiles**: The current tiles are converted into a set for efficient lookup. For each mentsu, the code counts how many of its tiles are already present.\n3. **Calculating Minimum Draws**: For each mentsu, it calculates the number of additional tiles needed to complete the mentsu and keeps track of the minimum number across all mentsu.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible ways to form a mentsu and find the optimal solution with minimal computational effort.",
