Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about finding two vouchers that don't overlap, their durations add up exactly to x, and the total cost is as minimal as possible. If no such pair exists, we return -1.\n\nLet me break down the problem. We have n vouchers. Each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost costi. The duration of each voucher is ri - li + 1. We need to choose two different vouchers i and j. These two must not intersect, meaning either the end of i is before the start of j or vice versa. Also, the sum of their durations should be exactly x. And among all such possible pairs, we need the one with the smallest total cost.\n\nHmm, okay. So the approach is to find all possible pairs of vouchers where their durations add up to x and they don't overlap. Then, among those pairs, find the one with the minimum cost.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2e5. So a naive O(n^2) approach would be way too slow. We need a more efficient method.\n\nSo how do we do this efficiently?\n\nLet's think about the constraints for two vouchers. Let's say voucher A has duration d1, voucher B has duration d2. So d1 + d2 = x. And their time intervals don't overlap.\n\nWait, but the sum of durations must be exactly x. So for each voucher, maybe we can look for another voucher whose duration is x minus the current one's duration.\n\nSo first, for each voucher, compute its duration. Then, for each voucher, we can look for another voucher with duration x - d, and check if they can be non-overlapping.\n\nBut even then, considering all vouchers, this might still be O(n^2), which is not feasible for n=2e5.\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: group the vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, we'll keep track of the vouchers with that duration and their end times and costs.\n\nThen, for each voucher i with duration d, we look for vouchers j with duration (x - d). But we also need to ensure that their intervals don't overlap.\n\nWait, but how? Because checking all vouchers j for each i is O(n), which would again lead to O(n^2) time.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can pre-process the vouchers in a way that allows us to quickly find suitable vouchers.\n\nAnother thought: for each voucher i, we can consider two cases:\n\n1. Voucher j comes after voucher i. So j's start is >= i's end + 1.\n   In this case, the duration of j must be (x - d_i), and the end of j must be <= (i's end + (x - d_i)) ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose we have two vouchers A and B. Let's say A is before B. So A ends before B starts. The duration of A is d_a, B is d_b. So d_a + d_b = x.\n\nWe need to find pairs where either A is before B or B is before A.\n\nSo for each voucher A, we can look for vouchers B that have duration x - d_a and are either entirely before A or entirely after A.\n\nWait, but how to efficiently find such B's.\n\nAn alternative approach is to sort the vouchers based on their end times. Then, for each voucher, we can use binary search to find vouchers that end before the current voucher's start.\n\nSimilarly, for vouchers that start after the current voucher's end.\n\nWait, but how to structure this.\n\nLet me outline a possible plan:\n\n1. Precompute all vouchers' durations and group them by duration. So for each d, we have a list of vouchers with duration d.\n\n2. Sort the vouchers based on their end time. This will allow us to quickly find vouchers that end before a certain time.\n\n3. For each voucher i, with duration d_i, we calculate needed_d = x - d_i. If needed_d is negative, skip, since durations are positive.\n\n4. Then, for the needed_d, if there are any vouchers in the group with duration needed_d, we need to find those vouchers that either end before i starts, or start after i ends.\n\nWait, but how to efficiently find these.\n\nFor the case where B comes after A:\n\nWe need B's start >= A's end + 1. So for each voucher A, we can look for all vouchers B with duration needed_d, and B's start >= A_end + 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the case where B comes before A: B's end <= A_start - 1.\n\nBut how to find these efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: for each duration d, keep a sorted list of the end times of vouchers with that duration.\n\nWait, let's say we have a",
