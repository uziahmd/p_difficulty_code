Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Amusing Joke\" and from the description, it sounds like we need to determine if a pile of letters can be rearranged to form the guest's name and the host's name without any extra letters. Hmm.\n\nSo the input consists of three lines: the first line is the guest's name, the second is the host's name, and the third is the pile of letters found. Our task is to check whether combining the guest and host names' letters exactly matches the pile. That means every letter in the pile must be used, and there shouldn't be any letters left over.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Oh right, this seems like a problem where we can count the frequency of each character in all the required names and compare it with the frequency in the pile. If they match exactly for all characters, then it's possible; otherwise, it's not.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the three lines as inputs.\n2. Concatenate the first two strings (guest + host) into one string.\n3. Count the frequency of each character in this concatenated string.\n4. Do the same for the pile string.\n5. Compare the two frequency dictionaries. If they are identical, output \"YES\"; else, \"NO\".\n\nBut wait, in Python, how do I efficiently count the frequencies? Oh right, the collections module has a Counter class that can help with that. So importing Counter from collections should work.\n\nSo let me outline the code structure:\n\n- Read guest = input().strip()\n- Read host = input().strip()\n- Read pile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combined = guest + host\nIf the length of combined doesn't equal the length of pile, then we can immediately return \"NO\". Because if the total letters don't match, there's no way.\n\nWait, that's an important point. Checking the lengths first can save some computation. For example, if the combined length is 10 and the pile's length is 11, it's impossible. So adding a condition: if len(combined) != len(pile), print NO.\n\nOtherwise, proceed to count the letters.\n\nSo:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # count the letters\n    count_combined = Counter(combined)\n    count_pile = Counter(pile)\n    if count_combined == count_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but wait. What about cases where the sum of letters in guest and host is correct, but the counts differ? Like if guest has two 'A's and host has one, but the pile has three 'A's—then the counters will catch that because the counts won't match.\n\nYes, that should handle it.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\nHost: DEDMOROZ\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined length is len(guest) + len(host) = let's see: SANTACLAUS is 10 letters, DEDMOROZ is 8, so combined is 18. Pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS—wait, how long is that? Let me see: S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S. Hmm, maybe 16? Or perhaps the sample's pile is the concatenation of the two names, so 10+8=18. So the lengths match.\n\nThe counts should match as well.\n\nIn the second sample:\n\nGuest: PAPAINOEL\nHost: JOULUPUKKI\nPile: BABBONATALE FATHERCHRISTMAS BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nWait, the combined length of guest and host is len(PAPAINOEL) which is 9 + len(JOULUPUKKI) which is 10, total 19. The pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER—let me count letters.\n\nWait, but according to the note, in the second sample, the pile is missing a 'P' and has an extra 'L'. So the combined would have a certain count, and the pile would differ.\n\nSo the code should correctly identify that.\n\nThird sample: the pile has an extra 'L', so the counts would differ.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where one name is empty? But the problem says all lines are not empty, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nWhat if the guest or host is longer than the allowed 100 characters? Well, the problem says that each line doesn't exceed 100, so our",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters can be rearranged to form the names of a guest and a host exactly, without any extra letters. This involves checking if the combined letters of the guest and host names match the letters in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Inputs**: Read the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Check Lengths**: If the combined length of the guest's and host's names does not match the length of the pile, print \"NO\".\n3. **Count Frequencies**: Use a frequency counter to count the occurrences of each character in both the combined guest and host names and the pile.\n4. **Compare Frequencies**: If the frequency counts of both the combined names and the pile are identical, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact match of characters by leveraging the properties of frequency counters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the input lines\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Concatenate the guest and host names\ncombined = guest + host\n\n# Check if the total length matches\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Count the frequency of each character\n    count_combined = Counter(combined)\n    count_pile = Counter(pile)\n    \n    # Compare the two frequency dictionaries\n    if count_combined == count_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The code reads three lines from the standard input, representing the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Length Check**: It first checks if the combined length of the guest and host names matches the length of the pile. This is a quick check to avoid unnecessary computations.\n3. **Frequency Counting**: Using `collections.Counter`, the code counts the frequency of each character in both the combined names and the pile.\n4. **Comparison**: Finally, it compares the two frequency dictionaries. If they match exactly, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the names without any extra letters, so it prints \"YES\". Otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem constraints and ensures correctness by comparing character frequencies directly.",
