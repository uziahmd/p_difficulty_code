For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says that a major triad is when the notes can be ordered such that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones and Y to Z is 3. For a minor triad, it's the opposite: X-Y is 3 and Y-Z is 4. The distance is measured as the number of semitones moving upwards along the scale. So for example, C to E is 4 semitones because each step is a semitone.\n\nHmm, so the first thing I need is a way to represent the order of the notes and calculate the distances between them. Oh right, the notes are in a cyclic order, so after H comes C again. So I should probably map each note to its position in the list to make calculations easier.\n\nLet me create a list that represents the order of the notes. Wait, what's the correct order? The problem statement lists the notes as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, no, wait—wait, the user wrote 'H' as the last note, but wait, isn't that a typo? Because in music, the notes go up to B, then the next is C. Oh wait, maybe the problem uses H as a note instead of B? Or perhaps it's a typo. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Oh, okay, so H is the 12th note. That's a bit unusual because normally we have 12 semitones in an octave, with C being the first. So H is the last note before C repeats.\n\nSo the order is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then after H comes C again. So the positions are from 0 to 11.\n\nI think the first step is to create a dictionary that maps each note name to its index in this list. That way, for any two notes, I can compute the distance by taking the difference modulo 12, but I have to be careful since the distance is always positive (from lower to higher).\n\nWait, but when you compute the distance from X to Y, it's the number of semitones going up. So if X is at position x and Y is at position y, the distance is (y - x) mod 12. Because if x > y, like if X is H (position 11) and Y is C (position 0), the distance is 1 (since H to C is one semitone). But wait, let me see: H is followed by C, so the distance from H to C is 1 semitone. So yes, (0 -11) mod 12 is 1, which is correct.\n\nSo for any two notes, their distance is (y -x) mod 12. But since the triad is unordered, I need to consider all possible orderings of the three notes and check if any of them satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read the three input notes.\n2. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes.\n3. For each permutation (X, Y, Z), compute the distances between X and Y, Y and Z, and X and Z.\n   - Wait, but in the problem statement, for a major triad, the distance from X to Y is 4, Y to Z is 3. So the total X to Z is 7 semitones.\n   - Similarly, minor has X-Y as 3, Y-Z as 4, so X-Z is 7 as well.\n4. For each permutation, check if the distances match either major or minor condition.\n5. If any permutation satisfies major, output 'major'; else, if any permutation satisfies minor, output 'minor'; else, 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. Since the triad is unordered, the same set of notes might satisfy multiple permutations, but according to the problem, the answer will always be unique. So if a set can form both a major and minor triad, it's not possible according to the problem statement. So we don't have to worry about that.\n\nSo now, let's outline the steps more clearly.\n\nFirst, create a list of the notes in the correct order:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nCreate a dictionary to map each note to its index:\n\nnote_to_index = {'C': 0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n\nNow, for the three input notes, let's say they are n1, n2, n3.\n\nWe need to generate all possible permutations of these three. There are 6 permutations (3! =6).\n\nFor each permutation, we'll calculate the distances:\n\ndistance_xy = (y - x) mod 12\ndistance_yz = (z - y) mod 12\n\nIf distance_xy ==4 and distance_yz ==3, then it's a major triad.\n\nIf distance_xy ==3 and distance_yz ==4, then it's a minor triad.\n\nIf any of the permutations meets the major condition, then the chord is major.\n\nIf any permutation meets the minor condition, it's minor.\n\nIf none do, then it's strange.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- For each permutation of the three notes:\n   - Compute d1 = (y - x) mod 12\n   - Compute d2 = (z - y) mod 12\n   - Check if d1 is 4 and d2 is 3 → major\n   - Else, check if d1 is 3 and d2 is 4 → minor\n   - If either is true, return accordingly.\n\nOnce any permutation satisfies, we can stop and output the result.\n\nNow, considering that the problem states that the answer is unambiguous, once a permutation satisfies major, we can immediately decide.\n\nSo let's proceed.\n\nIn code:\n\nRead the input line as a list of three strings.\n\nGenerate all possible permutations of these three.\n\nFor each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nCalculate the indexes: ix, iy, iz.\n\nd_xy = (iy - ix) % 12\n\nd_yz = (iz - iy) % 12\n\nif d_xy ==4 and d_yz ==3 → major found.\n\nelif d_xy ==3 and d_yz ==4 → minor found.\n\nIf any permutation leads to major, output 'major' and exit.\n\nElse, if any permutation leads to minor, output 'minor' and exit.\n\nElse, output 'strange'.\n\nSo in Python, I can use itertools.permutations to generate all possible orderings.\n\nWait, but what about the same note appearing more than once? Like if two notes are the same, but I don't think that's possible because the input is three distinct notes. Wait, the problem says \"no less than three\", so exactly three. So no duplicates.\n\nSo, now, let's think about some examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: C E G\n\nPermutations:\n\nC, E, G → distances: E-C is 4, G-E is 3. So major.\n\nSo output is 'major'.\n\nAnother example: C# B F.\n\nLooking for minor.\n\nWait, let's see. One permutation is B, C#, F.\n\nB is index 10, C# is 1, F is 5.\n\nd_xy: 1 -10 = -9 mod 12 is 3. So d_xy=3.\n\nd_yz:5-1=4 mod 12 is4.\n\nSo yes, 3 and 4 → minor.\n\nAnother example: A B H.\n\nCheck all permutations.\n\nA is 9, B is 10, H is 11.\n\nLooking for any permutation where the distances fit.\n\nLet's try A, B, H:\n\nd_xy =1, d_yz=1 → doesn't fit.\n\nAnother permutation: B, H, A.\n\nd_xy = (11-10)=1 mod12=1.\n\nd_yz=(9-11) mod12= ( -2 ) mod12=10.\n\nNope.\n\nAnother permutation: A, H, B.\n\nd_xy: 11-9=2.\n\nd_yz: 10-11 mod12= 11.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, maybe other permutations. Hmm, perhaps another order.\n\nWait, maybe H, A, B?\n\nd_xy = (9-11) mod12= 10.\n\nd_yz= (10-9) mod12=1.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, H, B, A:\n\nd_xy= (10-11) mod12=11.\n\nd_yz= (9-10) mod12=11.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps another order: B, A, H.\n\nd_xy= (9-10) mod12=11.\n\nd_yz= (11-9) mod12=2.\n\nNo.\n\nWhat about A, H, B? No, already checked.\n\nHmm, so none of the permutations meet the criteria for major or minor. So output is 'strange'.\n\nSo the code needs to correctly process this.\n\nAnother test case: Let's think of a minor triad.\n\nLike, C Eb G.\n\nC is 0, Eb is 3, G is 7.\n\nWait, C to Eb is 3 semitones. Eb to G is 4 semitones. So it's a minor triad.\n\nWait, wait, no: because for minor, the first distance should be 3, then 4.\n\nSo the permutation would be C, Eb, G.\n\nd_xy=3, d_yz=4 → minor.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: E G C.\n\nWhich is a C major in first inversion. But in our problem, the triad is considered as the set, so any ordering is allowed.\n\nSo, the code must find that in some permutation, the distances fit.\n\nSo the code needs to check all 6 permutations.\n\nSo, the approach is solid.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read the input: a single line with three space-separated notes.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\nnotes = input_notes  # List of 3 strings.\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    ix = note_to_index[x]\n    iy = note_to_index[y]\n    iz = note_to_index[z]\n\n    d_xy = (iy - ix) % 12\n    d_yz = (iz - iy) % 12\n\n    if d_xy ==4 and d_yz ==3:\n        found_major = True\n        break\n    elif d_xy ==3 and d_yz ==4:\n        found_minor = True\n        break\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the sample input is:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nSo the code is reading the three as a list of three elements, which are the note triplets.\n\nWait, no, the input is a single line with three space-separated notes. So the input would be something like 'C E G', which the code reads as a list of three strings: ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code above, the input is read via input().split(), which gives us a list of three strings, each representing a note.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code on the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: C E G → in code, notes becomes ['C', 'E', 'G']\n\nLoop through permutations:\n\nOne of the permutations is ('C', 'E', 'G').\n\nCompute ix=0, iy=4, iz=7.\n\nd_xy =4-0=4 mod12=4.\n\nd_yz=7-4=3 mod12=3.\n\nSo condition met → found_major is True. Break loop.\n\nSo output is 'major'.\n\nSample Input 2: C# B F → notes = ['C#', 'B', 'F']\n\nWe need to check if any permutation fits.\n\nLet's take permutation ('B', 'C#', 'F').\n\nB is index 10, C# is 1, F is 5.\n\nd_xy =1-10 =-9 mod12=3.\n\nd_yz=5-1=4.\n\nSo condition for minor is met → found_minor=True.\n\nSo output 'minor'.\n\nThird sample: A B H → ['A', 'B', 'H']\n\nCheck all permutations:\n\nNone of the permutations will have d_xy=4 and d_yz=3, nor d_xy=3 and d_yz=4.\n\nSo output 'strange'.\n\nThus, the code works for the sample.\n\nAnother test case: let's think about a minor triad.\n\nNotes: C, Eb, G.\n\nAs discussed earlier.\n\nC is 0, Eb is 3, G is7.\n\nIn permutation (C, Eb, G):\n\nd_xy=3, d_yz=4 → minor.\n\nSo code should output 'minor'.\n\nAnother test case: a major triad.\n\nNotes: C, E, G.\n\nAs above.\n\nNow, what about a triad that is neither? Like A, C, E.\n\nWait, A is 9, C is 0, E is4.\n\nPermutation (A, C, E): d_xy is (0-9) mod12=3, d_yz is (4-0)=4. So 3 and 4 → minor.\n\nWait, no, the condition for minor is 3 and 4. So this is minor.\n\nWait, but what about E, A, C?\n\nE is4, A is9, C is0.\n\nd_xy=5, d_yz= (0-9) mod12=3. So 5 and 3 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: E, C, A.\n\nE is4, C is0, A is9.\n\nd_xy= (0-4) mod12=8, d_yz= (9-0)=9 → no.\n\nHmm, another permutation: C, E, A.\n\nd_xy=4, d_yz= (9-4)=5 → 4 and 5 → no.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Because the triad is A, C, E.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct order is C, E, A: but that's not a major or minor triad.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let's see: C to E is 4, E to A is 5 (since E is4, A is9 → 9-4=5). So 4 and5 → not major or minor.\n\nHmm, perhaps this triad is not classified as either.\n\nWait, but wait: the triad consists of A, C, E. Let's see all permutations:\n\n1. A, C, E: A(9) to C(0) is 3, C to E(4) is4 → 3 and4 → minor.\n\nSo this triad is minor.\n\nThus, the code correctly identifies it as minor.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase where all notes are the same: but the problem says no, because it's exactly three notes.\n\nAnother case: the three notes are consecutive, like C, D, E.\n\nWhich permutation would fit?\n\nLet's see: C, D, E → d_xy=2, d_yz=3 → no.\n\nD, C, E: d_xy= (0-2) mod12=10, d_yz= (4-0)=4 → no.\n\nC, E, D: d_xy=4, d_yz= (2-4 mod12)= 10 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: E, C, D: d_xy= (0-4 mod12)=8, d_yz= (2-0)=2 → no.\n\nHmm, no permutation satisfies the conditions.\n\nSo output is 'strange'.\n\nAnother case: notes are H, C, D.\n\nH is 11, C is0, D is2.\n\nPermutation H, C, D: d_xy= (0-11 mod12)=1, d_yz=2.\n\nNot matching.\n\nPermutation C, H, D: d_xy= (11-0 mod12)=11, d_yz= (2-11 mod12)= (2-11+12)=3.\n\nSo d_xy=11, d_yz=3 → 11 and 3 → not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: H, D, C: d_xy= (2-11 mod12)= (2-11)= -9 mod12=3. d_yz= (0-2 mod12)=10 → no.\n\nHmm, perhaps another permutation: D, C, H.\n\nd_xy= (0-2 mod12)=10, d_yz= (11-0 mod12)=11 → no.\n\nOr D, H, C: d_xy= (11-2 mod12)=9, d_yz= (0-11 mod12)=1 → no.\n\nSo none of the permutations satisfy the conditions. So output is 'strange'.\n\nSo the code handles all these cases.\n\nNow, let's think about another scenario: the triad could have notes that wrap around. For example, H, B, E.\n\nH is 11, B is10, E is4.\n\nSo permutation H, B, E.\n\nd_xy= (10-11 mod12)=11, d_yz= (4-10 mod12)= (4-10)= -6 mod12=6 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: B, H, E.\n\nd_xy= (11-10)=1, d_yz= (4-11 mod12)= (4-11 +12)=5 → 1 and5 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: E, H, B.\n\nd_xy= (11-4 mod12)=7, d_yz= (10-11 mod12)=11 → 7 and11 → no.\n\nHmm, perhaps another permutation: H, E, B.\n\nd_xy= (4-11 mod12)= (4-11+12)=5, d_yz= (10-4 mod12)=6 → 5 and6 → no.\n\nSo this triad is 'strange'.\n\nSo the code correctly returns 'strange'.\n\nI think the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the code reads the three notes as a list of strings, and then processes each permutation.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nImport necessary modules:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nCreate the notes_order and note_to_index.\n\nRead the input.\n\nThen, for each permutation, check the conditions.\n\nFinally, output the result.\n\nThus, the code is as follows.\n",
