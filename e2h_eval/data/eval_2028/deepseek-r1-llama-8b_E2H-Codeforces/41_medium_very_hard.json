There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about maximizing profit by building houses on a street with certain restrictions. \n\nAlright, let me read the problem statement carefully again. So, there are n spots on the street where each house can be built with a height between 0 and h. Each spot contributes a squared value equal to the height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in the range from l_i to r_i (inclusive), the tallest house must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit.\n\nHmm. So, the constraints are that for each of the m ranges, the maximum height in that range doesn't exceed x_i. And I want to assign heights to each spot such that all these constraints are satisfied, and the sum of squares is as large as possible.\n\nThe input gives n, h, m, followed by m lines each with l_i, r_i, x_i. The output should be the maximum possible sum of squares.\n\nSo, how do I model this? It feels like a dynamic programming problem or maybe using some kind of constraints satisfaction approach. Since n and m are up to 50, which is manageable, perhaps a DP approach is feasible.\n\nLet me think about the possible approaches.\n\nOne way is to model the problem by considering each spot and the constraints that affect it. But the constraints can overlap, making it tricky. For example, a single spot might be covered by multiple restrictions.\n\nWait, but each restriction applies to a range, and the maximum in that range must be <= x_i. So, for a particular spot, say position k, all restrictions that include k in their [l_i, r_i] range impose that the height at k can't exceed the minimum of all x_i for those restrictions. Because if any of those restrictions requires that the max in their range is <= x_i, then the height at k can't be higher than x_i for that particular restriction. So, the effective maximum height for position k is the minimum x_i across all restrictions that cover k, and also cannot exceed h.\n\nOh right! Because each restriction that covers position k reduces the maximum possible height at k. So, for each position k, the maximum allowed height is min(h, the minimum of x_i for all restrictions that include k).\n\nWait, but wait. No, because a restriction that includes k may have x_i, but other restrictions covering k may have lower x_i. So the maximum allowed at k is the minimum of all x_i from the restrictions covering k, and also not exceeding h.\n\nYes. So, for each spot k, the maximum allowed height is min( h, min_{all restrictions i where l_i <=k <=r_i} x_i ). If a spot is not covered by any restriction, then its maximum is h. Or wait, no: the spot is only subject to the city's general maximum, which is h. So, for each spot k, the initial maximum is h, and then any restriction that covers k reduces this maximum by possibly lowering it further.\n\nSo, for each spot k, compute the effective maximum height as the minimum between h and all x_i for restrictions that include k. Then, the optimal choice for each spot is to choose the highest possible height under this constraint, which would be the effective maximum.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because sometimes choosing a lower height in one spot might allow others to be higher, but perhaps that's not necessary here. Wait, because each spot's contribution is the square of its height, which is maximized when the height is as high as possible. So, for each spot, the optimal is to set it to the maximum allowed by the constraints.\n\nTherefore, the maximum profit is simply the sum of squares of the effective maximums for each spot.\n\nWait, but that's only true if the constraints are such that the effective maximum for each spot is correctly computed. Because, for example, imagine two spots where a single restriction affects both. If the restriction is that their maximum in the range [1,2] is 3, then each spot's maximum is 3. So, setting both to 3 is fine and gives the maximum.\n\nBut what if a restriction covers a range, say 1-3, with x=5. Another restriction covers 2-4, x=4. Then, for spot 2, the maximum is min(5,4) =4. But for spot 3, it's 5, but another restriction (if any) may lower it.\n\nWait, no. For each spot, the maximum allowed is the minimum of all x_i for the restrictions that include it, and h. So, for spot 2, the maximum is min(5,4)=4, spot3 is min(5, ...) assuming no other restrictions apply. So, the overall maximum for each spot is indeed determined by the minimum x_i across all applicable restrictions.\n\nWait, but why is that correct? Because each restriction that includes a spot k requires that the maximum in that restriction's range is <=x_i. So, if a spot k is included in multiple restrictions, each of which has x_i, then the maximum height for k can't be higher than any of those x_i's, otherwise, one of the restrictions would be violated.\n\nSo, for each spot, the maximum allowed is the minimum of all x_i for restrictions that include it, and also h.\n\nSo, the optimal solution is to set each spot's height to this value, and calculate the sum of squares.\n\nWait, but that's only if the constraints are independent. What if a spot is part of multiple overlapping restrictions, and the minimal x_i is the limiting factor.\n\nFor example, suppose spot k is covered by two restrictions: one with x=3 and another with x=5. Then, the maximum for k is 3, because 3 is smaller than 5. So, the spot is set to 3.\n\nSo, in that case, yes, the optimal is to set each spot to the minimum x_i across all applicable restrictions, and h.\n\nSo, this seems to reduce the problem to, for each spot, compute the minimum x_i over all applicable restrictions, and then take the minimum with h. Then, sum the squares.\n\nBut wait, what if the restrictions have overlapping ranges, and some x_i's are lower than others, but their ranges don't fully cover the spots. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose we have 3 spots. Restrictions are:\n\nRestriction 1: l=1, r=2, x=2\n\nRestriction 2: l=2, r=3, x=1\n\nSo, for spot 1: the only restriction is 1, x=2 → min is 2.\n\nSpot 2: two restrictions, x=2 and x=1 → min is 1.\n\nSpot3: only restriction 2, x=1 → min is 1.\n\nSo, the maximum heights are 2,1,1. Sum is 2²+1²+1²=4+1+1=6.\n\nIs that correct? Yes, because all the constraints are satisfied. The first restriction requires that the maximum in 1-2 is 2, which is achieved. The second restriction requires that the maximum in 2-3 is 1, which is achieved.\n\nAnother example: suppose two spots, 1 and 2. Restriction 1: l=1, r=2, x=3. Restriction 2: l=1, r=2, x=2. So, the maximum for spot 1 is min(3,2)=2, same for spot2. So, both spots are 2. Sum is 8.\n\nWhich is correct because the maximum in 1-2 is 2, which satisfies both restrictions.\n\nBut what if the constraints require that the maximum in a range is less than the individual spot's x_i? Wait, no. Because for a spot, the maximum is the minimum of all x_i for the restrictions covering it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Because when a spot is covered by multiple restrictions, each of which imposes a maximum for their own range, the maximum for that spot can't be higher than any of the x_i's of those restrictions.\n\nSo, the initial idea is correct.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. For each spot k (from 1 to n):\n\n   a. Find all restrictions that include k in their l_i <=k <=r_i.\n\n   b. Collect the x_i values of these restrictions.\n\n   c. Compute the minimum x_i among them, call it min_x.\n\n   d. The maximum allowed height for spot k is min(min_x, h).\n\n2. Sum the squares of these maximum heights.\n\nThat's the solution.\n\nWait, but does this always work? Let's test against the examples given.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1: 1-1, x=1 → affects spot1.\n\n2:2-2, x=3 → affects spot2.\n\n3:3-3, x=2 → affects spot3.\n\nFor spot1: min x is 1, so height 1.\n\nSpot2: min x is 3, height 3.\n\nSpot3: min x is 2, height 2.\n\nSum: 1 +9 +4=14. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestriction1: 2-3, x=8.\n\nRestriction2:3-4, x=7.\n\nSpot1: no restrictions, so min_x is none, so max is 10.\n\nSpot2: min x is min(8) → 8.\n\nSpot3: min x is min(8,7) →7.\n\nSpot4: min x is 7.\n\nSo, heights are 10,8,7,7.\n\nSum: 100 +64 +49 +49 = 262. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the approach works for the samples.\n\nBut wait, what about overlapping constraints?\n\nAnother test case: suppose n=2, m=2.\n\nRestriction1: l=1, r=1, x=3.\n\nRestriction2: l=1, r=2, x=2.\n\nFor spot1: min x is min(3,2) →2.\n\nSpot2: min x is 2.\n\nHeights: 2² + 2²= 8.\n\nBut the maximum in 1-2 is 2, which satisfies both restrictions.\n\nWhat if the constraints are conflicting? Like, for spot1, two restrictions: x=2 and x=3, but they both apply to it. Then the min is 2.\n\nBut what if another spot is covered by two restrictions, one x=5 and x=3. Then, the min is 3.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- For each spot, collect all x_i where l_i <=k <= r_i.\n\n- Compute the minimum x_i among these.\n\n- The spot's height is min(h, this min x_i).\n\n- Sum squares.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for each spot, find the minimum x_i of all applicable restrictions.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nFor each of the m restrictions, store l, r, x.\n\nThen, for each spot k from 1 to n:\n\n   collect all x where l <=k <=r.\n\n   if any x is present, min_x is min(x_list). else, min_x is infinity (so that min(h, inf) is h).\n\n   height_k = min(h, min_x)\n\nsum += height_k^2\n\nSo, this is straightforward.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nIn code:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nCreate a list of restrictions. For each, store l, r, x.\n\nFor each spot from 1 to n:\n\n   min_val = h  # initial value is h.\n\n   for each restriction in restrictions:\n\n       if l <= k <= r:\n\n           current_x = x\n\n           if current_x < min_val:\n\n               min_val = current_x\n\n   height = min(min_val, h)\n\n   sum += height ** 2\n\nWait, but wait. Because for each spot, the min_val starts as h, and for each restriction that includes it, we check if the x is less than the current min_val. So, if the spot is not covered by any restriction, min_val remains h, and height is h.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, that's the code.\n\nNow, let's test with the first sample.\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nRestrictions:\n\nEach spot is covered by exactly one restriction.\n\nSpot1: x=1. So min_val is min(3, 1) →1.\n\nSpot2: x=3. min(3,3) →3.\n\nSpot3: x=2. min(3,2) →2.\n\nSum: 1+9+4=14.\n\nSecond sample:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nSpot1: no restrictions. min_val is 10.\n\nSpot2: covered by first restriction. x=8. min_val is 8.\n\nSpot3: covered by both restrictions. x=8 and x=7. min is7.\n\nSpot4: covered by second restriction, x=7. min is7.\n\nSo, heights: 10,8,7,7. Sum is 262.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2.\n\nRestriction1: l=1, r=1, x=3.\n\nRestriction2: l=1, r=2, x=2.\n\nSpot1: min(3,2) →2.\n\nSpot2: min(2) →2.\n\nSum 8.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=3.\n\nRestriction1: l=1, r=3, x=5.\n\nRestriction2: l=3, r=4, x=4.\n\nRestriction3: l=4, r=5, x=3.\n\nSpot1: x=5.\n\nSpot2: x=5.\n\nSpot3: min(5,4) →4.\n\nSpot4: min(4,3) →3.\n\nSpot5: x=3.\n\nHeights: 5,5,4,3,3. Sum is 25+25+16+9+9= 84.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, this approach seems solid.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nWe need to read n, h, m.\n\nThen read m lines, each with l, r, x.\n\nThen for each k from 1 to n:\n\n   initialize min_val as h.\n\n   for each restriction in the list:\n\n       if l <=k <=r:\n\n           if x < min_val:\n\n               min_val =x\n\n   height = min(min_val, h)\n\n   add height squared to sum.\n\nFinally, print sum.\n\nWait, but wait. Because for each restriction, if k is in l..r, then x is considered. So, for a spot k, we need to iterate through all restrictions and check whether k is in their range.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append( (l, r, x) )\n\ntotal =0\nfor k in range(1, n+1):\n    min_x = h\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        if l <=k <= r:\n            if x < min_x:\n                min_x =x\n    height = min( min_x, h )\n    total += height **2\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but wait. What if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions? The code takes the minimum x across all of them, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nAfter reading, restrictions are [(1,1,1), (2,2,3), (3,3,2)].\n\nFor k=1:\n\nCheck each restriction. Only the first applies. x=1 < h=3 → min_x becomes 1. So height is 1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1, l=1, r=1, x=0.\n\nHeight is min(0, h). So if h is 5, height is 0.\n\nSum is 0.\n\nSo code handles that.\n\nWhat about a spot not covered by any restriction? It uses h.\n\nYes.\n\nI think this should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to given zoning restrictions. Each house contributes to the profit based on its height squared, and each restriction limits the maximum height within a specific range.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to determine the optimal heights for each spot such that all restrictions are satisfied and the total profit is maximized.\n2. **Constraints Handling**: Each restriction specifies a range and a maximum height. For each spot, the height must be at most the minimum of all applicable restrictions' maximum heights and the global maximum height `h`.\n3. **Effective Maximum Height Calculation**: For each spot, compute the effective maximum height as the minimum value of all relevant restrictions' maximum heights and the global height limit `h`.\n4. **Sum of Squares**: Calculate the profit by summing the squares of the effective maximum heights for each spot.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n\ntotal = 0\nfor k in range(1, n + 1):\n    min_x = h\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        if l <= k <= r:\n            if x < min_x:\n                min_x = x\n    height = min(min_x, h)\n    total += height ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of spots `n`, the maximum height `h`, and the number of restrictions `m`. Each restriction is read and stored.\n2. **Iterating Over Spots**: For each spot from 1 to `n`, we determine the effective maximum height by considering all applicable restrictions.\n3. **Applying Restrictions**: For each restriction, check if the current spot falls within its range. Update the effective maximum height to be the minimum of the current value and the restriction's maximum height.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: The profit contribution from each spot is the square of its effective maximum height. Sum these values to get the total profit.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are respected while maximizing the profit efficiently.",
