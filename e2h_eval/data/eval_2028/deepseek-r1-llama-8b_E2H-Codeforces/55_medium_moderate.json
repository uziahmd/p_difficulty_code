    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Minimum Ternary String. Hmm. So, the task is to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing certain swap operations. \n\nLet me read the problem statement again to make sure I understand it correctly. We're given a ternary string, which means it only consists of '0', '1', and '2'. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1' or '1' and '2'. So, for example, I can swap '0' and '1' next to each other, but not '0' and '2' or '1' and '0' if they aren't adjacent. Wait, no, wait: the allowed swaps are swapping any two adjacent characters if they are either '0' and '1' or '1' and '2'. So, for example, you can't swap a '0' with a '2' unless they are adjacent, but even then, you can't do that because the allowed swaps don't include '0' and '2'.\n\nSo the key point is that in the string, '0's can be swapped with '1's, but '0's cannot be directly swapped with '2's, and vice versa. Therefore, the relative order of '0's and '2's cannot be changed through swaps. Because you can't directly swap them, and there's no way to move a '0' past a '2' since you can't swap them.\n\nWait, that's an important observation. So, for instance, if the string has a '0' before a '2', you can't swap them. Because the allowed swaps are only between 0 and 1, and 1 and 2. So, any '0's must remain in their original order relative to each other and relative to '2's. Similarly, '2's must remain in their original order relative to each other and relative to '0's. But within the 0s and 1s, and within the 1s and 2s, we can reorder them as much as possible.\n\nWait, no. Wait, think about the allowed swaps. You can swap 0 and 1 if they are adjacent, which allows you to reorder the 0s and 1s in any order among themselves. Similarly, you can swap 1 and 2 if they are adjacent, allowing the 1s and 2s to be reordered among themselves. But 0s and 2s can't be directly swapped, so their relative order is fixed. So the overall conclusion is that the 0s must appear in the same relative order as in the original string, and the 2s must also appear in the same relative order as in the original string. Only the 1s can be reordered among themselves, but their positions relative to 0s and 2s are fixed.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. For example, suppose I have the string \"012\". Can I rearrange it into something else? Well, looking at the allowed swaps: I can swap '1' and '2' if they are adjacent. So in \"012\", the '1' is between '0' and '2'. But I can't swap '0' and '1' because they are allowed to be swapped only when adjacent. Wait, in \"012\", the first two characters are '0' and '1', which are adjacent. So I can swap them, turning it into \"102\". Then, I can swap '0' and '2'? No, because that's not allowed. So after that, the string is \"102\". Now, in this string, can I do anything else? The '0' and '1' are next to each other again, so I can swap them back, getting \"012\" again. Or maybe other possibilities?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. Since '0's can be swapped with '1's, but '1's can be swapped with '2's, the overall effect is that '0's can be moved past '1's, and '1's can be moved past '2's. However, '0's cannot be moved past '2's because you can't swap '0' and '2' directly, and there's no way to do it indirectly since you can't move a '1' through a '0' to reach a '2'. \n\nSo, the relative order of '0's and '2's must remain the same as in the original string. The '1's can be reordered among themselves and around the '0's and '2's, but their order relative to '0's and '2's is determined by the initial arrangement.\n\nWait, no. Let's say I have \"021\". The '0' comes before '2'. Can I swap '0' and '2'? No, because that's not allowed. So the '0' must stay before the '2'. But what about the '1's? Suppose I have \"201\". How can I arrange this? Let's see. The string is '2','0','1'. The '0' is after '2', so it's stuck. The '1' is after '0'; can I move it before '0'? Let me see: '2','0','1' → can I swap '0' and '1'? Yes, because they are adjacent. So after swapping, it becomes '2','1','0'. Now, can I swap '1' and '2'? They are adjacent, so yes. So now the string is '1','2','0'. Then, can I swap '2' and '0'? No, because that's not allowed. So the '0' is stuck after '2', and the '1's can be moved around.\n\nWait, but in this case, the '1's can be moved to the front, but the '0's and '2's can't be reordered. So in this case, the '0' remains after the '2' because their order can't be changed.\n\nHmm, so the conclusion is that the order of '0's and '2's is fixed. That is, all the '0's must appear in the same order as they did in the original string, and the '2's must also appear in their original order. But '1's can be placed anywhere else, subject to being able to swap with their adjacent '0's and '2's.\n\nSo the approach is to find the lex smallest string where:\n\n- The '0's appear in the original order, but possibly interleaved with '1's and '2's.\n- The '2's appear in the original order, possibly interleaved with '1's and '0's.\n- The '1's can be reordered among themselves, but their positions relative to '0's and '2's are constrained by the allowed swaps.\n\nWait, no. Because '1's can be swapped with '0's and '2's, which allows them to move around, but the '0's and '2's cannot change their order. So the '1's can be inserted into positions relative to the '0's and '2's, but the '0's and '2's can't be reordered.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct model is that the '0's and '2's form fixed sequences, and the '1's can be placed in any position between or around these sequences, but their own order can be rearranged as needed.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for the '0's, their order is fixed, and similarly for the '2's. The '1's can be placed anywhere else, but their order among themselves can be rearranged. So the '1's can be reordered, but must appear in their original order relative to each other? Or can they be completely reordered?\n\nWait, no. Because '1's can be swapped with each other via '0's and '2's. For example, if you have '010', you can swap the '1' and '0' to get '100'. Then, you can swap the '1' and '0' again to get '010'. Or, perhaps if you have multiple '1's, you can arrange their order. Wait, perhaps the '1's can be reordered among themselves, independent of the '0's and '2's. Because, for example, if you have '1012', you can swap the '0' and '1' to get '1102'. Then, you can swap the two '1's to get '1012' again. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps '1's can be arranged in any order among themselves, regardless of their original positions, as long as their relative order to '0's and '2's is maintained.\n\nWait, but '1's can be swapped with each other via '0's. For example, if you have a string like '121', you can swap the '2' and '1' to get '211'. Then, you can swap the first two '2's (but wait, '2's can't be swapped with each other, right? Because the allowed swaps are only between '0' and '1' or '1' and '2'. So '2's can't be directly swapped. So in '211', the '2's are next to each other but can't be swapped. So their order is fixed.\n\nWait, so '1's can be swapped with '0's and '2's, but '2's can't be swapped among themselves. So the '1's can move around '0's and '2's, but the '0's and '2's can't change their order.\n\nSo, to model this, perhaps the '0's and '2's form fixed sequences, and the '1's can be placed anywhere else, but the '1's can be arranged in any order among themselves, provided that their placement doesn't disrupt the order of '0's and '2's.\n\nBut how do we represent this? Maybe the approach is to collect the '0's and '2's in their original order, and then find the positions where the '1's can be placed, interleaving them in a way that the '0's and '2's remain in their original order.\n\nWait, but the '1's can be reordered among themselves. So, for example, in the string '2101', the '1's can be moved to the front, resulting in '1120', but considering that '0's and '2's can't change order. Or perhaps not—let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the '0's and '2's must appear in their original order, but the '1's can be reordered anywhere else.\n\nWait, let's think about the problem differently. Since '0's and '2's can't be swapped, their relative order in the string is fixed. So, for each '0' in the string, all '0's that come after it in the original string must come after it in any transformed string. Similarly for '2's. But '1's can be placed anywhere else, including between '0's and '2's, as long as their own order can be adjusted via the allowed swaps.\n\nBut how? Because '1's can be swapped with '0's and '2's, which allows them to move around.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to separate the string into three parts: the '0's, the '1's, and the '2's, but that's not correct because the '0's and '2's can't be reordered.\n\nNo, that's not right. For example, the sample input includes '100210' which becomes '001120'. Looking at that, the '0's and '2's are in different orders than the original.\n\nWait, the original string is '100210'. Let's break it down:\n\nOriginal: 1,0,0,2,1,0\n\nAfter transformation: 0,0,1,1,2,0.\n\nSo, the '0's in the original are at positions 2,3,6. In the output, they are at positions 1,2,6. So some '0's have moved left, but others have moved right. Wait, no, the '0's at positions 2 and 3 in the original are now at 1 and 2. The '0' at position 6 remains at 6.\n\nSo, the '0's have been moved to the left, but the '2' was moved to the right. So the '2's are in the same order as before.\n\nWait, in the original, the '2' is at position 4. In the output, it's at position 5. So the '2' has moved one position to the right. But that's allowed because it was adjacent to a '1' which could be swapped.\n\nAh, so the '2's can be moved to the right if there's a '1' after them. Because you can swap '1's and '2's. So the '2's can move to the right, but their order relative to each other remains fixed.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the '2' is the only '2' in the string. So in the output, it's moved one position to the right. So how does that affect the '1's?\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to realize that '0's and '2's can be reordered among themselves, but their relative order can't change. So the '0's must appear in the same order as in the original string, and the same for the '2's. The '1's can be reordered among themselves and can be placed between '0's and '2's, but the '0's and '2's' order is fixed.\n\nSo the approach is to collect the '0's and '2's in their original order, and then place the '1's in such a way that the overall string is lex smallest possible.\n\nSo, the steps to solve the problem could be:\n\n1. Separate the string into three lists:\n   - zeros: list of indices where '0's occur, in the order they appear.\n   - ones: list of indices where '1's occur, in the order they appear.\n   - twos: list of indices where '2's occur, in the order they appear.\n\n2. Then, the '0's and '2's must appear in their original order. The '1's can be placed in any order among the available slots, but subject to the constraints that their positions can't cause the '0's or '2's to change order.\n\nWait, but the '1's can be placed anywhere else, but how do they interleave with the '0's and '2's?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to model this is to consider that the '0's and '2's form fixed points, and the '1's can be placed in any order, but their relative order among themselves can be rearranged as needed.\n\nWait, perhaps the '1's can be placed anywhere, but their order among themselves can be rearranged because they can be swapped among each other via '0's and '2's.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, the '1's are at positions 0, 3, 5 in the original string. After rearrangement, the '1's are at positions 2,3,4. So their order among themselves is preserved.\n\nWait, in the original string '100210', the '1's are at positions 0, 3, 5. In the output, they are at positions 2,3,4. So their order among themselves is 1, 3, 5 → 2,3,4. So their relative order is preserved. So perhaps the '1's must appear in the same relative order as in the original string.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the '1's can only be swapped with adjacent '0's or '2's, but their own order can be altered only if they are adjacent. So, for example, if two '1's are separated by a '0' or '2', you can't swap them unless there's a way to move the '0' or '2' out of the way. But that might not always be possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the '1's can be reordered among themselves freely because you can swap them via '0's and '2's. For example, if you have '101', you can swap the '0' and '1' to get '110'. Then, you can swap the first two '1's to get '101' again. Or wait, can you? Because the first two are '1's; can you swap them? Oh, wait, the allowed swaps are only between '0' and '1' or '1' and '2'. So '1's can't be swapped among themselves directly. So the relative order of '1's is fixed. So in the original string, the order of '1's must be preserved in the final string.\n\nSo, that's a crucial point. So, the '1's must appear in the same relative order as in the original string. Similarly, '0's and '2's must appear in their original order. So, the '0's form a fixed sequence, '1's form a fixed sequence, and '2's form another fixed sequence. The problem is to interleave these three sequences into a single string such that the overall string is lex smallest possible.\n\nSo the approach is to collect the '0's, '1's, and '2's in their original order and then find a way to interleave them to get the lex smallest string.\n\nBut how exactly?\n\nLet me think about this. We need to generate a new string by taking the '0's, '1's, and '2's in their original order, but interleaving the '1's as much as possible to get the lex smallest string.\n\nSo, the strategy is similar to merging three sorted sequences, but the sequences here are not necessarily sorted. Each sequence is in the order they appeared in the original string.\n\nWait, but how do we interleave them optimally? For lex smallest, we want the earliest possible smaller character in the string.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be to iterate through the string, and at each step, choose the smallest possible available character from the heads of the '0's, '1's, or '2's queues.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. Because choosing a '0' might require that all subsequent '0's are in order, but the '1's could be placed in between.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal approach is to greedily choose the smallest possible character that can be placed at the current position, considering the constraints of their relative orders.\n\nSo, for example, at each step, we look at the current position and decide whether to take a '0', '1', or '2' from their respective queues, but ensuring that the order of '0's, '1's, and '2's is preserved.\n\nBut how do we model this in code efficiently?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Split the input string into three separate lists, maintaining the order of '0's, '1's, and '2's. So, for example, for '100210', the '0's are at positions 1, 2, 5 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), the '1's are at 0,3,5, and the '2's at 4.\n\nWait, in '100210', the indices (0-based) are 0: '1', 1:'0', 2:'0', 3:'2', 4:'1', 5:'0'. So the '0's are at 1,2,5; '1's at 0,3,4; '2's at 3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the '2' is at position 3, and the next character is '1' at 4. So the '2' is followed by a '1'.\n\nSo the '0's list is [1,2,5], '1's is [0,3,4], and '2's is [3].\n\nNow, to build the output string, we need to choose at each step the smallest possible character that can be placed next, considering that the order of '0's, '1's, and '2's must be preserved.\n\nSo, initially, the available characters are the first elements of each list: '1', '0', and '2'.\n\nWhich is the smallest? '0' is the smallest. So, we take the '0' from the '0's list and add it to the result. Now, the '0's list is [2,5].\n\nNext, the available are '1' (from '1's), '0' (from '0's), and '2' (from '2's). The smallest is '0' again. Take it, add to result.\n\nNow, '0's list is [5].\n\nAvailable are '1' (from '1's), '0' (from '0's), and '2' (from '2's). The smallest is '0', but wait, the '0's list is now empty. So next available are '1' and '2'.\n\nThe smallest is '1'. So take '1' from '1's list. Now, '1's list is [3,4].\n\nThen, available are '1' (from '1's), '2' (from '2's). The smallest is '1'. Take it. Now, '1's list is [3,4] → wait, no, wait: after taking 0,3,4, etc., the '1's list becomes [3,4] after taking the first '1' (position 0), then [3,4], then [4]. So after taking the second '1', the '1's list is [4].\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the current pointers for each list.\n\nSo, for each list, we have a pointer indicating the current position in the list. We compare the current elements (if any) from each list and pick the smallest.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Initialize pointers for each list (zeros_ptr, ones_ptr, twos_ptr) to 0.\n\n- While any of the pointers hasn't reached the end:\n\n   - For each list, if the current character is available (i.e., pointer hasn't exceeded the list length):\n\n      - Record the current character and its list.\n\n   - Among the available options, choose the smallest character.\n\n   - If multiple options have the same smallest character, choose the one that allows the lex smallest string.\n\nWait, but how to handle cases where multiple options are the same. For example, if '0' and '1' are both available, and '0' is smaller than '1', choose '0'. But if '0' is the same as '1' (but that's impossible here since '0'<'1'< '2').\n\nWait, no, the characters are '0', '1', '2', so the order is clear. So for each step, we just select the smallest possible character among the available options.\n\nBut wait, sometimes, choosing a '0' now may prevent us from placing a '1' that is smaller in the future. But since we're trying to make the lex smallest string, the greedy approach should work.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n1. Split the string into three separate lists: zeros, ones, twos.\n\n2. Initialize three pointers i, j, k to 0 for each list.\n\n3. While i < len(zeros), or j < len(ones), or k < len(twos):\n\n   a. Collect all available characters from the current pointers.\n\n   b. Find the smallest character among them.\n\n   c. If multiple characters are the same, pick the one that allows the lex smallest string.\n\n   d. Add this character to the result.\n\n   e. Increment the corresponding pointer.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that in some cases, adding a '1' now might allow for more '0's to be added later, leading to a smaller string. But I think the greedy approach will still work because choosing the smallest possible character at each step leads to the lex smallest string.\n\nFor example, if '0' is available, adding it now is better than adding a '1' or '2' later.\n\nSo, the steps in code would be:\n\n- Create three lists, zeros, ones, twos, by iterating through the input string.\n\n- Iterate through the string once, appending each character to the appropriate list.\n\nOnce these lists are created, the next step is to merge them, selecting the smallest possible character at each step, considering that we can choose from the current head of any of the lists, but each list's order must be preserved.\n\nSo, the code would look something like:\n\nresult = []\ni = j = k = 0\nwhile i < len(zeros) or j < len(ones) or k < len(twos):\n    candidates = []\n    if i < len(zeros):\n        candidates.append( (zeros[i], 'zeros') )\n    if j < len(ones):\n        candidates.append( (ones[j], 'ones') )\n    if k < len(twos):\n        candidates.append( (twos[k], 'twos') )\n    \n    # Find the smallest candidate\n    min_char = None\n    selected = None\n    for char, lst_type in candidates:\n        if min_char is None or char < min_char:\n            min_char = char\n            selected = lst_type\n        elif char == min_char:\n            # Choose the one that allows the smallest possible string\n            # For example, if selecting '1' from ones allows more '0's to be added later, which is better than selecting '1' from twos.\n            # Not sure, but perhaps the selection is arbitrary in this case.\n            # But perhaps, the way to determine which to choose is to see which list's current character allows for the smallest possible next characters.\n            # This seems complicated, but perhaps for the purposes of this problem, we can just choose the first occurrence of the minimum character.\n            # Because any choice would lead to the same minimal string.\n\n            # So, in code, perhaps just choose the first occurrence.\n            pass  # So, in code, just leave as is.\n\n    # Now, append the selected character to the result\n    if selected == 'zeros':\n        result.append('0')\n        i += 1\n    elif selected == 'ones':\n        result.append('1')\n        j += 1\n    elif selected == 'twos':\n        result.append('2')\n        k += 1\n\nThis seems correct. Let's test it against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: '100210'\n\nZeros: ['0', '0', '0'] (positions 1,2,5)\nOnes: ['1', '1', '1'] (positions 0,3,4)\nTwos: ['2'] (position 3)\n\nMerging:\n\nStep 1: candidates are '0' (zeros), '1' (ones), '2' (twos). Min is '0' from zeros. Append '0', i=1.\n\nStep 2: candidates are '0' (zeros), '1' (ones), '2' (twos). Min is '0' from zeros. Append '0', i=2.\n\nStep 3: candidates are '0' (zeros), '1' (ones), '2' (twos). Min is '0' from zeros. Append '0', i=3. Now, zeros list is exhausted.\n\nStep 4: candidates are '1' (ones), '2' (twos). Min is '1'. Append '1', j=1.\n\nStep 5: candidates are '1' (ones), '2' (twos). Min is '1'. Append '1', j=2.\n\nStep 6: candidates are '2' (twos). Append '2', k=1.\n\nWait, but the output should be '001120', which is 6 characters. So let's see:\n\nAfter step 3, zeros list is exhausted. So in step 4, candidates are '1' and '2'. '1' is chosen. Step 5: candidates are '1' and '2' again. '1' is chosen. Step 6: only '2' is left. So the result is '0','0','0','1','1','2' → '000112' → which is not the expected output.\n\nWait, the sample output for '100210' is '001120'.\n\nHmm, so my approach is wrong. So why is that?\n\nBecause the '2' in the original string is at position 3. After processing, it's moved to position 5. So the algorithm above isn't handling that correctly.\n\nSo what's wrong with the approach? Because the '2's can be moved to the right, but their order relative to each other is fixed. So in the sample, the '2' is the only '2' and can be moved right past '1's.\n\nSo perhaps the '2's can be placed anywhere, as long as their relative order is preserved. So the '2's can be interleaved with '1's, but the '1's can't be reordered among themselves.\n\nWait, no. Because '1's can't be reordered among themselves. So their order is fixed. So in the sample, the '2' is moved to the right, which requires that the '1's after it are moved.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect. Because the '2's can be moved to the right, but the '0's and '2's can't change their order. So the '2's must appear in their original order, but can be moved to the right.\n\nSo the algorithm needs to account for the fact that '2's can be placed to the right of '1's, but '1's can be placed to the left of '2's as well.\n\nWait, but according to the allowed swaps, '1's can be swapped with '2's, so a '2' can move to the right past '1's, and a '1' can move to the left past '2's. So the '2's can be placed anywhere, but their order relative to each other is fixed.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to treat '0's, '1's, and '2's as separate sequences, each maintaining their original order, and then interleave them in a way that the overall string is lex smallest.\n\nBut how? Because '0's can't be reordered, '2's can't be reordered, and '1's can't be reordered among themselves.\n\nWait, but the '1's can be reordered among themselves because they can be swapped via '0's and '2's. Or can they?\n\nWait, earlier analysis suggests that the '1's can't be reordered among themselves because you can't swap '1's directly. So their relative order is fixed.\n\nSo, the '1's must appear in the same order as they did in the original string.\n\nSo, the algorithm needs to interleave the '0's, '1's, and '2's, while preserving their internal orders.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of interleaving three sequences while preserving their individual orders, which is a known problem.\n\nIn that case, the approach is to use a priority queue to select the next character from the heads of the sequences, choosing the smallest possible.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, let's think of each sequence as a stream. At each step, we can choose the next character from any of the streams, but we can't reorder the characters within a stream.\n\nSo, for example, the '0's stream must be processed in the order they appear. Same for '1's and '2's.\n\nIn this scenario, the algorithm would be to keep track of the current position in each stream and, at each step, choose the smallest possible character from the current positions of the streams.\n\nIf the smallest character is present in multiple streams, we choose the one that allows for the smallest possible string. But that's tricky because choosing one may block others.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct approach is to greedily choose the smallest possible character available from the current heads of the streams. Because this would lead to the lex smallest string.\n\nSo, in the sample input, the '0's are at positions 1,2,5. The '1's are at 0,3,4. The '2's are at 3.\n\nInitially, the heads are '0' (from zeros), '1' (from ones), '2' (from twos). The smallest is '0', so we choose it.\n\nNext, the heads are '0' again, '1', '2'. Choose '0' again.\n\nThen, the heads are '0' again, '1', '2'. Choose '0' again.\n\nNow, the zeros list is exhausted. So the heads are '1' (from ones), '2' (from twos). Choose '1' (as it's smaller than '2').\n\nThen, the heads are '1' and '2'. Choose '1' again.\n\nFinally, choose '2'.\n\nSo the resulting string is '000112', but the sample expects '001120'.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. So my approach must be wrong.\n\nBut according to the sample, the correct output is '001120', which is '0','0','1','1','2','0'. Wait, but the '0' at position 5 in the original is now at position 5 in the output. But in my approach, all zeros are taken first.\n\nSo why is that? Because in the sample output, the '2' is moved to the right, which implies that the '0's can be interleaved with '2's.\n\nAh, I see. Because '2's can be moved to the right, but '0's can't. So, perhaps '2's can be placed after '0's, but '0's can't be moved past '2's.\n\nWait, but the allowed swaps don't permit moving a '0' past a '2'. So the '0's must remain before the '2's, but '2's can move to the right past '1's.\n\nSo, the '0's are fixed in their order and can't be moved past '2's. So, any '0's that are after a '2' in the original string can't be moved before the '2's.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So the '0's must appear before any '2's in the final string if they were in the original string.\n\nWait, no. Because '0's can't be swapped with '2's, their relative order is fixed. So, if in the original string, a '0' comes before a '2', then in the final string, that '0' must come before the '2'. Similarly, if a '2' comes before a '0' in the original, the '2' must come before the '0' in the final string.\n\nSo, the '0's and '2's form fixed sequences in their original order. So, during the merging process, whenever a '0' is chosen, all remaining '0's must be considered, but the '2's can only be chosen after all '0's that are before them in the original string.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because '0's can't be moved past '2's, so in the merged string, any '0' that appears before a '2' in the original must also appear before it in the final string. Similarly, any '2' that appears before a '0' in the original must also appear before it in the final string.\n\nSo, the '0's and '2's must form a subsequence in the final string that matches their relative order in the original string.\n\nThus, the approach is to model the merging of the three sequences, keeping track of the relative positions of '0's and '2's.\n\nThis complicates the merging process because the '0's and '2's can't be reordered, but '1's can be placed anywhere else, subject to their own order.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as merging three sequences with the following constraints:\n\n- The '0's must appear in their original order.\n\n- The '2's must appear in their original order.\n\n- The '1's must appear in their original order.\n\nAdditionally, any '0' that appears before a '2' in the original string must also appear before it in the merged string, and vice versa.\n\nSo, the merged string must contain all '0's and '2's in their original order, but '1's can be placed in between, but their own order is fixed.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of interleaving three sequences while preserving their relative order, which is a classic problem.\n\nThe standard approach to this problem is to use a priority queue that tracks the next possible character from each sequence, and at each step, chooses the smallest possible character.\n\nHowever, in our case, the '0's and '2's can't be reordered, so their relative order must be preserved. Additionally, the '1's must be placed in a way that their order is preserved.\n\nSo, the algorithm would proceed as follows:\n\n1. For each character type ('0', '1', '2'), maintain a deque (or a queue) containing the characters in their original order.\n\n2. Use a priority queue (min-heap) to track the next possible character from each deque.\n\n3. At each step, extract the smallest possible character from the heap, add it to the result string, and enqueue the next character from the corresponding deque if it exists.\n\nThis approach ensures that the relative order of each deque is preserved, and that the smallest possible character is chosen at each step, leading to the lex smallest string.\n\nLet's test this approach on the sample input.\n\nSample Input: '100210'\n\nOriginal string: '1','0','0','2','1','0'\n\nZeros deque: ['0','0','0'] → indices 1,2,5.\n\nOnes deque: ['1','1','1'] → indices 0,3,4.\n\nTwos deque: ['2'] → index 3.\n\nHeap initially contains '0' (from zeros), '1' (from ones), '2' (from twos).\n\nStep 1: Extract '0' from zeros. Result is '0'. Enqueue next '0' from zeros.\n\nHeap now contains '0' (zeros), '1' (ones), '2' (twos).\n\nStep 2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing allowed swaps on a given ternary string. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', or '1' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the relative order of '0's and '2's must remain fixed because they cannot be swapped directly. However, '1's can be reordered among themselves and can be placed between '0's and '2's as needed to form the smallest lexicographical string.\n\nThe approach involves:\n1.
