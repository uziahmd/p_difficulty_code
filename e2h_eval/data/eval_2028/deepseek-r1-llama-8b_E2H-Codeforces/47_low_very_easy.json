If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem says that Neko has two integers a and b, and he wants to find a non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple (LCM) of a + k and b + k is as small as possible. If there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, we need to choose the smallest k.\n\nHmm, interesting. So the goal is to minimize the LCM of (a+k) and (b+k). Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's note that adding the same k to both a and b might have some properties. For example, the difference between a and b remains the same because (a + k) - (b +k) = a - b. Wait, no, wait. Let me calculate that: (a +k) minus (b +k) is a - b. Oh right, so the difference between the two numbers doesn't change when we add k.\n\nSo, the LCM of two numbers x and y is given by (x * y) / GCD(x, y). So, to minimize the LCM, perhaps we can find x and y such that their GCD is as large as possible, or something along those lines.\n\nWait, but since x and y are a +k and b +k, their difference is fixed as d = |a - b|. Because (a +k) - (b +k) = a - b. So, if d is zero, meaning a == b, then the LCM is just a +k, which is minimized when k is zero. So in that case, the answer is 0.\n\nBut when d is not zero, the problem becomes more interesting. Let's say d is positive, so a > b, but it could be either way.\n\nSo, for the general case where d is not zero, we need to find x and y such that x = a +k, y = b +k, and x - y = d. And we want to minimize LCM(x, y).\n\nHmm. So, what's the relation between x and y? Since x = y + d, because x is larger than y by d. So, the LCM of x and y is (x * y)/GCD(x, y) = (y + d) * y / GCD(y + d, y).\n\nLet me denote G = GCD(y + d, y). But wait, GCD(y +d, y) is the same as GCD(d, y), because:\n\nGCD(y +d, y) = GCD(y, d)\n\nYes, because GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a mod b). So if we compute GCD(y, d), that's the same as GCD(d, y).\n\nSo, the LCM becomes (y*(y +d)) / G, where G is GCD(y, d).\n\nHmm, so our goal is to choose y such that this expression is minimized. But y is equal to b +k. Wait, no: since y is (b +k) and x is (a +k), which is y +d, where d is a - b (assuming a >= b). So, for the case where a < b, d would be negative, but perhaps taking absolute value makes sense.\n\nWait, maybe we should consider d as the absolute difference. Like d = |a - b|. Because whether a is bigger or smaller than b, the difference is the same, and the problem is symmetric.\n\nSo, let's assume d = |a - b|. So, if a == b, we return 0.\n\nOtherwise, d is positive, and x = y + d, where y is b +k if a >= b, or a +k if b > a. Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, regardless of which is larger, d is the absolute difference, and y is one of the terms, and x is the other.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to always set y as the smaller of the two initial values. Because then, x is the larger one. Or maybe it's better to consider that after adding k, y is the smaller, x is the larger, and their difference is d.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that.\n\nSo, for any k, the two numbers are y and y + d, where y = min(a, b) +k. Wait, no: because adding k to both a and b, their order depends on the initial a and b. For example, if a is less than b, then a +k could be less than or greater than b +k, depending on k. Wait, no: adding k to both, their difference remains d. So, if a was less than b, a +k is still less than b +k, because",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find a non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - The key observation is that adding the same \\( k \\) to both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) does not change their difference. Let \\( d \\) be the absolute difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), i.e., \\( d = |a - b| \\).\n   - For any \\( k \\), the two numbers become \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\). Let \\( y \\) be the smaller of these two numbers, then the larger number will be \\( y + d \\).\n\n2. **Mathematical Insight**:\n   - The LCM of two numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) can be expressed as \\( \\text{LCM}(x, y) = \\frac{x \\cdot y}{\\text{GCD}(x, y)} \\).\n   - Since the two numbers are \\( y \\) and \\( y + d \\), their GCD is the same as the GCD of \\( y \\) and \\( d \\), i.e., \\( \\text{GCD}(y, d) \\).\n\n3. **Optimization Strategy**:\n   - We need to find \\( y \\) such that \\( \\text{LCM}(y, y + d) \\) is minimized. This translates to minimizing \\( \\frac{y \\cdot (y + d)}{\\text{GCD}(y, d)} \\).\n   - To minimize this expression, \\( y \\) should be chosen such that \\( \\text{GCD}(y, d) \\) is as large as possible.\n\n4. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute \\( d \\) as the absolute difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n   - If \\( d \\) is zero, return \\( k = 0 \\) since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are already equal.\n   - Otherwise, iterate over all divisors of \\( d \\) to find the optimal \\( y \\) that minimizes the LCM.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_min_k(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return 0\n    d = abs(a - b)\n    # We need to find the best y such that y = b + k (assuming a > b for now)\n    # So, k = y - b\n    # We want to find y >=0 such that y*(y +d)/gcd(y, d) is minimized\n    # Since y can be any positive integer, but considering that y must be >=0\n    # We can consider y to be a divisor of d, or at least a divisor in some way\n    # Let's look for y where y divides d or near a divisor\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n    # We can try all possible y that are factors of d\n    for divisor in get_divisors(d):\n        y = divisor\n        lcm_val = (y * (y + d)) // math.gcd(y, d)\n        if lcm_val < min_lcm:\n            min_lcm = lcm_val\n            best_k = y - b\n        elif lcm_val == min_lcm:\n            # Check if current k is smaller\n            current_k = y - b\n            if current_k < best_k:\n                best_k = current_k\n    # Also check cases where y is not a divisor but close to one\n    # Maybe the minimal is achieved when y is just below or above a divisor\n    # Alternatively, try y in a small range around potential divisors\n    # But to limit computation, perhaps just checking up to sqrt(d) is enough\n    # Alternatively, to cover all possible y, we can try all possible y that could potentially give minimal LCM\n    # However, this may not be feasible for large d.
