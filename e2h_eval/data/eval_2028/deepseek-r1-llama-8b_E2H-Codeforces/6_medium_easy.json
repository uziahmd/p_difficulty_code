Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about finding two vouchers that don't overlap, their durations add up exactly to x, and the total cost is as minimal as possible. If no such pair exists, we return -1.\n\nLet me break down the problem. We have n vouchers. Each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost costi. The duration of each voucher is ri - li + 1. We need to choose two different vouchers i and j. These two must not intersect, meaning either the end of i is before the start of j or vice versa. Also, the sum of their durations should be exactly x. And among all such possible pairs, we need the one with the smallest total cost.\n\nHmm, okay. So the approach is to find all possible pairs of vouchers where their durations add up to x and they don't overlap. Then, among those pairs, find the one with the minimum cost.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2e5. So a naive O(n^2) approach would be way too slow. We need a more efficient method.\n\nSo how do we do this efficiently?\n\nLet's think about the constraints for two vouchers. Let's say voucher A has duration d1, voucher B has duration d2. So d1 + d2 = x. And their time intervals don't overlap.\n\nWait, but the sum of durations must be exactly x. So for each voucher, maybe we can look for another voucher whose duration is x minus the current one's duration.\n\nSo first, for each voucher, compute its duration. Then, for each voucher, we can look for another voucher with duration x - d, and check if they can be non-overlapping.\n\nBut even then, considering all vouchers, this might still be O(n^2), which is not feasible for n=2e5.\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: group the vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, we'll keep track of the vouchers with that duration and their end times and costs.\n\nThen, for each voucher i with duration d, we look for vouchers j with duration (x - d). But we also need to ensure that their intervals don't overlap.\n\nWait, but how? Because checking all vouchers j for each i is O(n), which would again lead to O(n^2) time.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can pre-process the vouchers in a way that allows us to quickly find suitable j's for each i.\n\nAnother thought: for each voucher, we can determine the earliest and latest possible end times for a voucher j of duration x-d, such that j doesn't overlap with i.\n\nWait, let's model the non-overlapping condition. Two vouchers i and j don't overlap if either:\n\n- ri < lj, or\n- rj < li\n\nSo for a given voucher i, any voucher j must satisfy ri < lj OR rj < li.\n\nBut j must have a duration of x - d_i.\n\nSo for each voucher i, we can split our search into two parts:\n\n1. Find all j's where rj < li, and duration is x - d_i.\n2. Find all j's where ri < lj, and duration is x - d_i.\n\nAnd among these j's, find the one with the minimal cost, then add to i's cost to get a candidate for the minimal total.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find such j's?\n\nPerhaps we can sort the vouchers based on their end times and start times.\n\nFor part 1: rj < li. So j must end before i starts. So for j's, we can look for those whose end times are less than li, and have duration x - d_i.\n\nSimilarly, for part 2: j must start after i ends. So lj > ri. So for j's, we can look for those whose start times are greater than ri, and have duration x - d_i.\n\nWait, but how do we structure this data to make queries efficient.\n\nMaybe, for each possible duration d, we can create two sorted lists:\n\n- One sorted list of end times, so that for a given li, we can find all j's with rj < li and duration x - d_i.\n\n- Another sorted list of start times, so that for a given ri, we can find all j's with lj > ri and duration x - d_i.\n\nIf we have these sorted, we can perform binary searches to find the relevant j's quickly.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers into a dictionary where the key is the duration d, and the value is two lists:\n\n   a. A list of tuples (r_j, cost_j), sorted by r_j. This will allow us to find all j's with r_j < some value quickly.\n\n   b. A list of tuples (l_j, cost_j), sorted by l_j. This will allow us to find all j's with l_j > some value quickly.\n\n2. For each voucher i:\n\n   a. Compute its duration d_i and cost c_i.\n\n   b. Compute the required duration for j: req_d = x - d_i.\n\n   c. If req_d is less than 0 or greater than x, skip (since durations can't be negative and sum can't exceed x).\n\n   d. Check if req_d exists in our dictionary. If not, continue.\n\n   e. Now, for this i, look for j's in two categories:\n\n      i. j's with r_j < l_i. So, among all vouchers j with duration req_d, find those where r_j < l_i. The minimal cost among these is the best for this category.\n\n      ii. j's with l_j > r_i. Similarly, find those j's and take the minimal cost.\n\n   f. For each of these categories, if there are any j's, compute the total cost (c_i + min_cost_j) and keep track of the minimal total cost found.\n\n3. After processing all vouchers, if we found at least one valid pair, output the minimal cost. Otherwise, output -1.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, group the vouchers by their duration. For each d, collect all vouchers with that duration.\n\nThen, for each d, sort the vouchers by their end time and start time.\n\nSo, for each d, we have:\n\n- sorted_r: a list of (r_j, cost_j), sorted by r_j.\n\n- sorted_l: a list of (l_j, cost_j), sorted by l_j.\n\nThis way, when we need to find j's with r_j < l_i, we can perform a binary search on sorted_r to find all entries where r_j < l_i, and among them, find the one with minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for j's with l_j > r_i, we can search in sorted_l for l_j > r_i and find the minimal cost.\n\nBut wait, how do we handle the case where multiple j's meet the criteria? We need the j with the minimal cost, not just any j.\n\nSo, for each d, we can precompute the prefix minima for the sorted_r and sorted_l lists.\n\nWait, no. Because for a particular d, the vouchers are sorted by r_j, but we need the minimal cost for all j's with r_j <= certain value.\n\nWait, if we have the list sorted_r sorted by r_j, then for a given l_i, we can find all j's with r_j < l_i. Among these, we want the one with the minimal cost.\n\nTo do this efficiently, perhaps for each d, we can create a list of sorted_r, and for each position in this list, keep track of the minimal cost up to that point. So, for any query, after finding the last index where r_j < l_i, we can get the minimal cost up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_l list, for each position, keep track of the minimal cost from that position onwards. Because for l_j > r_i, we need the minimal cost among those j's.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each d in the duration groups:\n\n   - Sort the vouchers by r_j in ascending order. For each index in this sorted list, compute the minimal cost up to that index. Store this as a list min_cost_upto_r.\n\n   - Sort the vouchers by l_j in ascending order. For each index in this sorted list, compute the minimal cost from that index onwards. Or, more precisely, for each position, the minimal cost in the suffix starting at that position.\n\nWait, because for l_j > r_i, we need all j's where l_j > r_i. So in the sorted_l list, we can find the first index where l_j > r_i, and then among all j's from that index onwards, find the one with minimal cost.\n\nSo, for each d, we can precompute for the sorted_l list, a suffix_min array, where suffix_min[i] is the minimal cost from i to end.\n\nSo for example, for the sorted_l list, which is sorted in increasing order of l_j, for each i, we look at j's from i onwards and keep the minimal cost.\n\nThis way, when we have a query r_i, we can find the first index in sorted_l where l_j > r_i, and then use the suffix_min array to get the minimal cost in that suffix.\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_r list, we can for each i, keep a prefix_min array, where prefix_min[i] is the minimal cost from 0 to i.\n\nSo, when we have a query l_i, we find the last index in sorted_r where r_j < l_i, and then the minimal cost up to that index is prefix_min[last_index].\n\nWait, but wait. In the sorted_r list, r_j is in increasing order. So, for a given l_i, we can binary search to find the largest r_j that is less than l_i. All j's before that index in the sorted_r list have r_j <= r_j_at_index. So, the minimal cost for j's with r_j < l_i is the minimal cost in the prefix up to that index.\n\nThus, for each d, we can precompute two arrays:\n\n- prefix_min: for each index i in sorted_r, prefix_min[i] is the minimal cost among the first i+1 elements.\n\n- suffix_min: for each index i in sorted_l, suffix_min[i] is the minimal cost among elements from i to end.\n\nOnce these are precomputed, for each voucher i, we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. Compute d_i and req_d = x - d_i.\n\n2. Check if req_d is present in the duration groups. If not, continue.\n\n3. For req_d, get the sorted_r and sorted_l lists.\n\n4. For category 1 (r_j < l_i):\n\n   a. Binary search in sorted_r to find the largest index where r_j < l_i.\n\n   b. If such an index exists, get the minimal cost from prefix_min up to that index.\n\n5. For category 2 (l_j > r_i):\n\n   a. Binary search in sorted_l to find the first index where l_j > r_i.\n\n   b. If such an index exists, get the minimal cost from suffix_min starting at that index.\n\n6. For both categories, if any j exists, add the minimal cost (if any) to c_i and update the global minimal cost.\n\nSo, the overall approach is manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nFirst, read all the vouchers, compute their durations, and group them by duration.\n\nFor each duration d, collect all vouchers with that duration. Then, for each d, sort the vouchers in two ways: sorted by r_j, and sorted by l_j.\n\nThen, for each of these sorted lists, precompute the prefix_min and suffix_min arrays.\n\nWait, but for each d, the sorted_r is the list of vouchers with duration d, sorted by r_j. For each voucher in this list, we have r_j and cost. So for each d, we can process this list as follows:\n\nCompute the prefix_min array for sorted_r:\n\nprefix_min[0] = cost of first element.\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], current cost).\n\nSimilarly, for sorted_l:\n\nsuffix_min is computed from the end to the beginning.\n\nsuffix_min[n-1] = cost of last element.\n\nsuffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], current cost).\n\nWait, no. Wait, sorted_l is sorted by l_j, so for a given r_i, any j with l_j > r_i is acceptable. So, in the sorted_l list, we can find the first index where l_j > r_i, and then among all j's from that index onward, the minimal cost is needed.\n\nSo for the suffix_min array, for each index i in sorted_l, suffix_min[i] is the minimal cost from i to the end.\n\nSo, how to compute that:\n\nInitialize suffix_min as a list of same length as sorted_l.\n\nStart from the end:\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_l[-1].cost\n\nfor i in range(len(sorted_l)-2, -1, -1):\n    suffix_min[i] = min(sorted_l[i].cost, suffix_min[i+1])\n\nSimilarly, for the prefix_min in sorted_r:\n\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_r[0].cost\n\nfor i in 1 to len(sorted_r)-1:\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_r[i].cost)\n\nOnce all these are precomputed, for each voucher i, we can proceed as follows:\n\nCompute d_i = ri - li + 1.\n\nCompute req_d = x - d_i.\n\nIf req_d is not in the duration map, skip.\n\nElse, get the sorted_r and sorted_l for req_d.\n\nFor category 1: r_j < l_i.\n\nWe need to find all j's with duration req_d and r_j < l_i.\n\nIn the sorted_r list for req_d, perform a binary search for l_i. Find the largest index where r_j < l_i.\n\nIf such an index exists (>=0), then the minimal cost is prefix_min[index].\n\nFor category 2: l_j > r_i.\n\nIn the sorted_l list for req_d, perform a binary search for r_i. Find the first index where l_j > r_i.\n\nIf such an index exists (<= len(sorted_l)-1), then the minimal cost is suffix_min[index].\n\nIf either category gives a minimal cost, then the total cost is c_i plus that minimal cost.\n\nWe need to track the minimal such total across all vouchers.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nvouchers = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    l, r, c = map(int, input().split())\n    duration = r - l + 1\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, c, duration) )\n\nThen, group by duration.\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_groups = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor v in vouchers:\n    d = v[3]\n    duration_groups[d].append( (v[1], v[2]) )  # (r_j, cost_j)\n\nThen, for each d in duration_groups, process the groups.\n\npreprocess:\n\nprocessed_duration_groups = {}\n\nfor d in duration_groups:\n    # sorted_r: list of (r_j, cost_j), sorted by r_j\n    sorted_r = sorted(duration_groups[d], key=lambda x: x[0])\n    # sorted_l: list of (l_j, cost_j), sorted by l_j\n    sorted_l = sorted(duration_groups[d], key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    # compute prefix_min for sorted_r\n    prefix_min = []\n    if sorted_r:\n        prefix_min = [sorted_r[0][1]]\n        for i in range(1, len(sorted_r)):\n            prefix_min.append( min(prefix_min[-1], sorted_r[i][1]) )\n    \n    # compute suffix_min for sorted_l\n    suffix_min = []\n    if sorted_l:\n        suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_l)\n        suffix_min[-1] = sorted_l[-1][1]\n        for i in range(len(sorted_l)-2, -1, -1):\n            suffix_min[i] = min(sorted_l[i][1], suffix_min[i+1])\n    \n    processed_duration_groups[d] = {\n        'sorted_r': sorted_r,\n        'sorted_l': sorted_l,\n        'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n        'suffix_min': suffix_min\n    }\n\nWait, no. Because for sorted_l, the l_j is in increasing order. So when looking for l_j > r_i, we can find the first index where l_j exceeds r_i, and then take the minimal cost from that index onwards.\n\nYes.\n\nSo now, for each voucher i, we can process.\n\nInitialize the answer as infinity.\n\nans = infinity\n\nfor voucher in vouchers:\n    l_i, r_i, c_i, d_i = voucher\n\n    req_d = x - d_i\n    if req_d not in processed_duration_groups:\n        continue\n\n    group_info = processed_duration_groups[req_d]\n    sorted_r_list = group_info['sorted_r']\n    sorted_l_list = group_info['sorted_l']\n\n    # category 1: r_j < l_i\n    # find in sorted_r_list, the largest r_j < l_i\n\n    # binary search for l_i in sorted_r_list's r_j's\n    left = 0\n    right = len(sorted_r_list) - 1\n    res = -1\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if sorted_r_list[mid][0] < l_i:\n            res = mid\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid -1\n\n    if res != -1:\n        min_cost_r = group_info['prefix_min'][res]\n        total = c_i + min_cost_r\n        if total < ans:\n            ans = total\n\n    # category 2: l_j > r_i\n    # find in sorted_l_list the first l_j > r_i\n    left_cat2 = 0\n    right_cat2 = len(sorted_l_list) - 1\n    res_cat2 = -1\n    while left_cat2 <= right_cat2:\n        mid = (left_cat2 + right_cat2) // 2\n        if sorted_l_list[mid][1] > r_i:\n            res_cat2 = mid\n            right_cat2 = mid - 1\n        else:\n            left_cat2 = mid + 1\n\n    if res_cat2 != -1:\n        min_cost_l = group_info['suffix_min'][res_cat2]\n        total = c_i + min_cost_l\n        if total < ans:\n            ans = total\n\nAfter processing all vouchers, if ans is still infinity, output -1. Else, output ans.\n\nWait, but wait. Are we considering all possible j's that could form a pair with i? Because for each i, we're considering j's with duration req_d, but we have to ensure that j's are from different vouchers than i. Oh right! Because i and j must be different vouchers.\n\nWait, so in the preprocessing step, when we group the vouchers by duration, we may include i itself if its duration is req_d. So when i and j are the same voucher, but that's not allowed.\n\nSo, how to handle that?\n\nBecause if i's duration is d_i, and req_d = x - d_i, then i's duration is d_i, and req_d is x - d_i. So if x is 2d_i, then i could have j as itself. But since i and j must be different, we need to exclude the case where j is the same as i.\n\nBut wait, in the grouping, each voucher is added to the group of its own duration. So for each i, when processing, the j's in the group for req_d may include i itself if req_d is equal to d_i.\n\nSo in that case, during the processing of voucher i, when looking for j's, j can't be i.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.\n\nSo, for each voucher i, when we look for j's in the req_d group, we have to exclude j = i.\n\nBut how?\n\nBecause for each voucher i, when we process, the group for req_d may contain i itself, especially when d_i == req_d.\n\nSo, when processing i, when we find a j in the group, we have to ensure that j is not i.\n\nBut how?\n\nOne approach is, when we process each voucher, to note that j cannot be the same as i. So during the binary search, when we find j's, we need to make sure that j is a different voucher.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when building the group, we can split vouchers by their index or something. But that might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to store the vouchers along with their index, and when processing, for each i, we can exclude j = i.\n\nBut in the initial approach, the vouchers are stored without their indices. So, perhaps during the grouping, we should include the original index of each voucher.\n\nYes, that's a better approach. So, during the initial reading of vouchers, we can store more information, like the index, so that when we process each voucher i, we can know whether j is the same as i.\n\nSo, let's adjust the initial data structure.\n\nRewriting the initial processing:\n\nvouchers = []\nfor idx in range(n):\n    l, r, c = map(int, input().split())\n    duration = r - l + 1\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, c, duration, idx) )\n\nThen, group by duration:\n\nduration_groups = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor v in vouchers:\n    d = v[3]\n    duration_groups[d].append(v)\n\nThen, for each d in duration_groups, process the group.\n\nWhen processing a group, we can extract the vouchers and sort them as before.\n\nBut when searching for j's, we have to make sure that j's index is different from i's.\n\nHmm, but this adds complexity to the code.\n\nWait, perhaps for each voucher i, when we look for j's in the req_d group, we can note that j must have index != i's index.\n\nBut how do we handle this during the binary search?\n\nIt's tricky because the j's are stored in a list sorted by r_j or l_j, but the index is not part of the sorting.\n\nSo, perhaps during the binary search, we can find j's that meet the r_j or l_j conditions, and then among those j's, find the one with the minimal cost, excluding the case where j is i.\n\nBut that complicates the process, as for each j found in the binary search, we'd have to check if it's the same as i.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the grouping phase, for each d, we can also store the indices of the vouchers, so that when processing i, we can filter out j's with the same index as i.\n\nBut this seems a bit involved.\n\nAnother approach: for each voucher i, when we are looking for j's in the req_d group, after finding the minimal cost, we can check if that j is the same as i. If yes, we skip it.\n\nBut how do we track which j's are i?\n\nWell, in the group, the vouchers are stored as (r_j, cost_j, ...). But we can't directly tell if j is i unless we have access to the index.\n\nWait, perhaps for each group, when we sort, we can include the index as part of the tuple. So, for each d, the sorted_r list contains tuples (r_j, cost_j, index_j), and similarly for sorted_l.\n\nThen, when we find a j in the group, we can check if its index is different from i's index.\n\nBut this requires storing more information.\n\nSo, let's adjust the data structures:\n\nWhen grouping, for each voucher, include the index:\n\nduration_groups = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor idx in range(n):\n    l, r, c = map(int, input().split())\n    duration = r - l + 1\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, c, duration, idx) )\n\nfor v in vouchers:\n    d = v[3]\n    duration_groups[d].append( (v[1], v[2], v[4]) )\n\nThen, for each d, when processing, the sorted_r and sorted_l lists will contain tuples of (r_j, cost_j, index_j), etc.\n\nThen, during the processing of each voucher i, when we find a j in the req_d group, we can check if j's index is different from i's index.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nfor voucher in vouchers:\n    l_i, r_i, c_i, d_i, idx_i = voucher\n\n    req_d = x - d_i\n    if req_d not in processed_duration_groups:\n        continue\n\n    group_info = processed_duration_groups[req_d]\n    sorted_r_list = group_info['sorted_r']\n    sorted_l_list = group_info['sorted_l']\n\n    # category 1: r_j < l_i\n    # binary search in sorted_r_list for r_j < l_i\n    left = 0\n    right = len(sorted_r_list) - 1\n    res = -1\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if sorted_r_list[mid][0] < l_i:\n            res = mid\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n\n    if res != -1:\n        # get all j's up to res\n        min_cost = group_info['prefix_min'][res]\n        # find the j in sorted_r_list[res] which has minimal cost\n        # but wait, the prefix_min already holds the minimal up to res\n        # but how do we know that there exists a j in that subset?\n        # because res >=0, the prefix_min has at least one element\n        # but is there a j in that subset? Yes, because res was found.\n\n        # now, among all j's up to res, find the one with minimal cost, but not i\n        # iterate through all j's up to res, find the one with minimal cost, but exclude j == i\n        # but that's O(k), which is not feasible for large k.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because for each res, the prefix_min gives the minimal cost up to res, but that j could be i itself.\n\nSo, if the minimal cost is from j=i, then we can't take it.\n\nThus, the approach above is incorrect because it doesn't account for j being i.\n\nSo, this complicates things.\n\nSo, the initial approach may have a flaw in not considering that j could be the same as i.\n\nHmm, this adds a layer of complexity. How can we handle this?\n\nAlternative Idea: For each j in the req_d group, when j is the same as i, we can ignore it. But when the minimal cost comes from j=i, we need to find the next minimal cost.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, for each group, for each d, we can precompute the minimal cost for each possible r_j and l_j, but also track the indices.\n\nBut that seems complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea: When processing each voucher i, after finding the minimal cost j in the req_d group for category 1, we can check if j is i. If yes, we need to find the next minimal cost j that is not i.\n\nBut that requires storing the j's in a way that allows us to find the minimal cost, excluding i.\n\nBut how to do that quickly.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can pre-sort the j's for each d in a way that for each j, we can quickly find the minimal cost j that is not i.\n\nWait, but that's not straightforward.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each group, when we process each voucher i, after finding the minimal cost j in the req_d group for category 1, we can:\n\n- Check if j is i. If yes, then we need to find the next minimal cost j in the req_d group for category 1 that is not i.\n\nBut how to find that without scanning all j's.\n\nThis seems challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial approach may include j=i in the minimal cost, which is invalid. So, perhaps we need to modify the way we compute the minimal cost, ensuring that j is not i.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each group, we can precompute the minimal cost, but also track the indices of those j's that achieve the minimal cost.\n\nFor example, for each d, for the sorted_r list, we can keep a list of the minimal cost(s) and the corresponding indices.\n\nWait, but in the case where multiple j's have the same minimal cost, any of them can be chosen except i.\n\nSo, for each d, in the sorted_r list, we can precompute a list of tuples (r_j, cost_j, index_j), sorted by r_j. Then, for each i, when we find the minimal cost j with r_j < l_i, we can scan through all j's in the prefix up to res, and find the one with minimal cost where index_j != i's index.\n\nBut this is O(k), where k is the number of j's in the prefix up to res. That could be O(n) per voucher, which is not feasible.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea: Maybe during the initial grouping, for each d, we can pre-sort the j's by r_j and also keep a separate list of the minimal cost j's, excluding j=i.\n\nWait, but that's not feasible as i varies.\n\nWait, perhaps the only way to handle this correctly is to, for each voucher i, when looking for j's in the req_d group, to exclude j=i.\n\nSo, for each j in the req_d group, if j is i, we ignore it.\n\nBut how to do that quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps when we find the minimal cost j in the group, we can just check if j is i. If it is, we can find the next minimal cost j in the group.\n\nBut this requires knowing the minimal cost j, which may or may not be i.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each group, we can precompute a list of all j's sorted by r_j, and for each j, also keep track of their indices.\n\nThen, during the processing of i, after finding the minimal cost j via binary search, if j's index is i's index, we can find the next minimal cost j in the same category.\n\nBut this is computationally expensive.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to precompute for each group, two additional arrays:\n\nFor sorted_r:\n\n- list of tuples (r_j, cost_j, index_j), sorted by r_j.\n\nThen, for each i, after finding the minimal cost j in the prefix up to res, check if j's index is i's index. If yes, then among the j's up to res, find the next minimal cost j with index != i.\n\nBut again, this may require O(k) time, which is not feasible.\n\nHmm, this seems like a problem that might require some optimization.\n\nWait, perhaps for each group, when we have the prefix_min array, we can also track the indices of the j's that contribute to the minimal cost.\n\nBut that would complicate things.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the number of j's in the req_d group that can form a valid pair with i is small, so in practice, even if we have to scan through a few j's, it's manageable.\n\nBut for n=2e5, that's not acceptable.\n\nSo, perhaps this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Maybe the initial approach is incorrect, and the problem can be rephrased in a different way.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that for each i, we are including j=i in the group, but j cannot be i.\n\nSo, perhaps, for each group, we can precompute for each j in the group, the minimal cost for a given query, excluding j=i.\n\nBut how?\n\nHmm, perhaps for each group, we can precompute for the sorted_r list, the prefix_min but also keep track of the earliest index that achieves that min.\n\nSimilarly for the sorted_l list.\n\nWait, but that won't help because i can vary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the binary search for j's in the req_d group, we can exclude j=i.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps in the binary search step, after finding the minimal cost j, we can check if j is i.\n\nIf yes, then we need to find the next minimal cost j in the same category.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the binary search, we can track the minimal cost j with index != i.\n\nBut that would require modifying the binary search logic, which is complicated.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that for the given constraints, it's impossible to find a pair (i, j) where j is i.\n\nWait, no. Because in the problem statement, i and j must be different vouchers.\n\nSo, in the code, when we process i, any j that is i must be excluded.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis is a significant issue because the initial approach doesn't consider this, leading to the possibility of including j=i in the minimal cost, which is invalid.\n\nSo, how can we fix this?\n\nPerhaps, during the preprocessing, for each d, we can separate the j's into two groups: those that are i and those that are not. But this is not possible because i varies per processing.\n\nWait, but perhaps during the grouping, each group contains all j's, including i if applicable.\n\nSo, perhaps during the processing of i, when looking for j's in the req_d group, we can subtract j=i from consideration.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to precompute for each group, the minimal cost j for each possible query, but that's impractical.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is more manageable if we realize that in most cases, j is not i. So, perhaps in the initial approach, the chance that j=i is minimal, and thus the error is negligible.\n\nBut no, in the worst case, it's possible, and we have to handle it.\n\nWait, perhaps we can modify the binary search step to find j's that are not i.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose, during the processing of i, the req_d group is D.\n\nWe need to find j's in D where r_j < l_i, and j is not i.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- In the sorted_r list of D, find all j's where r_j < l_i.\n\n- Among these j's, find the one with minimal cost, excluding j=i.\n\nSimilarly for the other category.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, perhaps for each j in the sorted_r list, we can have a way to quickly find the minimal cost j with r_j < l_i and j != i.\n\nThis seems challenging.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since j can't be i, perhaps during the preprocessing, for each group, we can split the j's into two: those that are i and those that are not.\n\nBut that's not feasible as i varies.\n\nWait, perhaps for each group, we can precompute the minimal cost j for each possible r_j, but that's again not feasible.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached differently.\n\nInstead of trying to find j's for each i, perhaps for each possible duration d, we can precompute all possible pairs (i, j) where d_i + d_j = x, and i and j are non-overlapping.\n\nBut even that is O(n^2), which is not feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because for each d, the required d_j is x - d_i.\n\nSo, for each voucher i, we can compute the required d_j = x - d_i, which is the sum.\n\nBut again, this leads us back to the initial problem.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is correct, but we have to manage the case where j is the same as i.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to modify the way we select j's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's constraints are such that the number of test cases where j is i is zero, but the code can proceed.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first voucher and third voucher have cost 4 and 1. So, perhaps the initial approach works.\n\nWait, perhaps in the code, for each voucher, we can try both possibilities: whether the other voucher is before or after.\n\nWait, no. The problem is that we have to pick two vouchers, so i and j can't be the same.\n\nSo, the minimal cost is achieved when i and j are non-overlapping.\n\nBut in the code, when we process each voucher, the j must not be the same as i.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach includes the case when i and j are the same voucher, but the problem says that the two vouchers must be different.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the two vouchers are selected, and in that case, the two vouchers are distinct.\n\nSo, perhaps in the code, when j is selected, we have to ensure that i and j are different.\n\nBut according to the initial approach, the code is including vouchers that are overlapping in the same voucher.\n\nBut wait, no, because the problem states that i and j are different.\n\nThus, the initial approach is correct, but the code must ensure that i and j are different.\n\nSo, perhaps the code needs to ensure that i and j are different.\n\nBut in the initial approach, when selecting j's, i and j must be different.\n\nSo, perhaps in the code, for each voucher, the j can't be the same as i.\n\nThus, the code needs to make sure that i and j are different.\n\nBut in the initial approach, the code may select the same voucher as i and j.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says that i and j are different vouchers.\n\nThus, the code needs to avoid selecting j = i.\n\nThus, the problem is that in the initial approach, j could be i.\n\nSo, to fix this, for each i, when processing, the code must not select j = i.\n\nThus, the code must ensure that j is a different voucher.\n\nBut how?\n\nHmm, perhaps the code can, for each i, when it is processed, exclude j's that have the same index as i.\n\nThus, during the binary search, when the code finds a j that is i, it can skip it.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nThus, the code can be modified as follows:\n\nDuring the processing of i, for each category, after finding the minimal",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers such that their combined duration equals the total vacation duration and their total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently searching for valid pairs of vouchers using sorting and binary search techniques.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Preprocessing Vouchers**: Group vouchers by their duration and sort them based on their end and start times. This allows us to quickly find vouchers that can potentially form valid pairs with a given voucher.\n2. **Prefix and Suffix Minimum Costs**: For each group of vouchers with the same duration, compute prefix minimum costs for vouchers sorted by their end times and suffix minimum costs for vouchers sorted by their start times. This helps in efficiently finding the minimal cost for valid pairs.\n3. **Binary Search for Non-Overlapping Vouchers**: For each voucher, use binary search to find potential pairs that do not overlap. Check both cases where one voucher ends before the other starts and where one starts after the other ends.\n4. **Exclude Same Voucher Pairs**: Ensure that the two vouchers in a pair are different to avoid considering the same voucher twice.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    x = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[idx])\n        r = int(input[idx+1])\n        c = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n        duration = r -
