And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Average Sleep Time.\" Hmm.\n\nThe task says that Polycarp has been keeping track of his sleep times for n days. But a week in Berland is k days long. So the doctor wants to find the average sleep time per week over all possible consecutive weeks. Oh right, like sliding windows of size k.\n\nSo the input gives me two integers, n and k, followed by a list of n integers representing each day's sleep time. My goal is to compute the average of these k-day windows.\n\nWait, how many windows are there? Well, if n is the number of days and each window is k days, then the number of windows is (n - k + 1). For example, if n=3 and k=2, there are 2 windows: days 1-2 and 2-3.\n\nTo calculate the average, I need to sum all the k-day blocks and divide by the number of windows.\n\nBut wait, the issue is that n can be up to 2*10^5, which is 200,000. So if I do a naive approach where I compute each window by iterating through the array each time, that would be O(n*k) time complexity. For n=2e5 and k=2e5, that's 4e10 operations—way too slow. That won't work; I need a more efficient method.\n\nHmm, what's a better approach here? Oh right, prefix sums! Because adding up a range each time can be optimized using prefix sums to reduce the time complexity.\n\nLet me think about how prefix sums can help. Suppose I precompute a prefix sum array where prefix[i] is the sum of the first i elements. Then the sum of elements from index l to r (inclusive) is prefix[r] - prefix[l-1]. But in our case, each window is a consecutive k elements. So for the first window, it's from index 0 to k-1, the next from 1 to k, and so on.\n\nSo the sum for each window can be calculated using the prefix sum array as follows:\n\nsum = prefix[i + k - 1] - prefix[i-1], where i starts at 0 and goes up to (n -k).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial window is a1 to ak, then a2 to ak+1, etc. So for the ith window (starting at i), the end is i + k -1. So the sum is prefix[i + k -1] - prefix[i-1].\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array.\n2. For each window i (from 0 to (n-k)), compute the sum as prefix[i + k] - prefix[i].\n   Wait, because the prefix array is 0-based, perhaps. Or maybe 1-based. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, let's define the prefix sum array as prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a1, prefix[2] = a1+a2, ..., prefix[n] = sum(a1..an). Then the sum from a_i to a_j (j >=i) is prefix[j] - prefix[i-1]. So for a window starting at index i (0-based in the original array), it spans from a_i to a_{i+k-1}, so the sum is prefix[i + k] - prefix[i].\n\nWait, yes. Because i + k is the index after the last element of the window. So for example, the first window is a1 to a_k, which is indices 0 to k-1 in 0-based. So the sum is prefix[k] - prefix[0].\n\nSo for each window starting at position i (0-based in the array, from 0 to (n-k)), the sum is prefix[i + k] - prefix[i].\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n- Read n, k.\n- Read the array a of size n.\n- Compute the prefix sum array of size n+1, where prefix[0]=0, and prefix[i] = a[0] + ... + a[i-1].\n- Iterate through each possible window (there are (n -k +1) of them), compute the sum using the prefix array.\n- Sum all these window sums.\n- Divide by the number of windows to get the average.\n- Output the result with enough decimal precision.\n\nThis approach should have O(n) time complexity, which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nNow, let's think about the data types. Since each ai can be up to 1e5, and n is up to 2e5, the total sum per window can be up to (2e5 * 1e5) = 2e10. And the number of windows is up to 2e5. So the total sum across all windows could be up to (2e5)^2 * 1e5 = 4e15, which fits into a 64-bit integer. So using Python's integers is fine.\n\nBut when we compute the average, it's a floating-point division. So we need to handle that correctly.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n and k from input. Then read the list a.\n\nCompute prefix sum.\n\nThen for each i in 0 to (n -k), compute the sum for window starting at i.\n\nSum all these, then divide by (n -k +1), and output with 10 decimal digits.\n\nWait, but how do I read the input correctly? The input lines may have spaces, but sometimes multiple spaces or other separators. In Python, using split() should handle that.\n\nLet me test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSo the windows are [3,4], sum 7; [4,7], sum 11. Total sum 18, divided by 2 is 9. So output is 9.0000000000.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nOnly one window, sum is 10. So output 10.0000000000.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nNumber of windows is 8-2+1 =7.\n\nCompute each window sum:\n\n1+2=3\n\n2+4=6\n\n4+100000=100004\n\n100000+123=101123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789+1=790.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait the windows are:\n\nDays 1-2: 1+2=3\n\nDays 2-3:2+4=6\n\nDays3-4:4+100000=100004\n\nDays4-5:100000+123=101123\n\nDays5-6:123+456=579\n\nDays6-7:456+789=1245\n\nDays7-8:789+1=790.\n\nWait, but the sample output is 28964.2857142857.\n\nWait, let's compute the total sum:\n\n3 +6 =9; +100004=100013; +101123=201136; +579=201715; +1245=203, 203, 203, 201715+1245 is 203, 201715+1245=201715+1245= 203,960? Wait, let me add all the window sums:\n\n3 +6 =9\n\n+100004 =100013\n\n+101123 =201136\n\n+579 =201715\n\n+1245 =203, 201715 + 1245 = 203, 960? Wait 201715 + 1245 is 202,960?\n\nWait maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me compute all the window sums:\n\nWait the array is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n\nWindows:\n\nwindow 0: 1+2=3\n\nwindow 1: 2+4=6\n\nwindow 2:4+100000=100004\n\nwindow3:100000+123=101123\n\nwindow4:123+456=579\n\nwindow5:456+789=1245\n\nwindow6:789+1=790.\n\nSo adding all these: 3+6=9, +100004=100013, +101123=201136, +579=201715, +1245=203, 201715+1245=201715+1245=203, 201715+1245=201715+1245= 201715+1245 is 203, 201715+1245= 203, 960?\n\nWait 201715 + 1245 = 202,960.\n\nThen +790 = 202,960 +790 = 203,750.\n\nSo total sum is 203,750.\n\nNumber of windows is 7.\n\nSo average is 203750 /7 = 29,064.2857142857...\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nNow, the plan is solid.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nIn Python, the steps are:\n\nRead n and k from input. Then read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the prefix sum.\n\nThen iterate through each window, accumulate the sum, then compute the average.\n\nImplementing the prefix sum is straightforward.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nWhat if k =n? Then only one window, sum is the total, average is sum/(1).\n\nWhat if n=1, k=1? Same as above.\n\nAnother edge case: n=k=2.\n\nNow, coding.\n\nBut wait, in Python, for big numbers, it's okay because of arbitrary precision integers.\n\nSo:\n\nRead n, k.\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nCompute prefix:\n\nprefix = [0]*(n+1)\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\nThen, compute the sum of all window sums.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nnumber_of_windows = n -k +1\n\nfor i in range(number_of_windows):\n\n    start = i\n\n    end = i +k\n\n    window_sum = prefix[end] - prefix[start]\n\n    total += window_sum\n\naverage = total / number_of_windows\n\nThen, print the average with 10 decimal places.\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you print floating points, sometimes it can have issues with precision. To ensure that we have enough digits, perhaps we can format the output to have exactly 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo, in the print statement, use something like \"{:.10f}\".format(average).\n\nWait, but looking at the sample outputs, sometimes the average is an integer, like 9.0000000000. So formatting ensures that even if the average is an integer, it's printed with .10f.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says that the answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 1e-6. So, printing with 10 decimal digits is more than sufficient.\n\nSo in code:\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but the sample outputs have varying decimal digits. Like in the third sample, it's 28964.2857142857, which is 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo, yes, we need to print 10 decimal digits always.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nTesting on sample input 3:\n\nn=8, k=2, a=[1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\nprefix is built as:\n\nprefix[0] = 0\n\nprefix[1] =1\n\nprefix[2] =3\n\nprefix[3]=7\n\nprefix[4]=100007\n\nprefix[5]=100130\n\nprefix[6]=100587\n\nprefix[7]=101376\n\nprefix[8]=102165\n\nSo for window i=0, sum is prefix[2]-prefix[0]=3-0=3.\n\ni=1: prefix[3]-prefix[1]=7-1=6.\n\ni=2: prefix[4]-prefix[2] =100007-3=100004.\n\ni=3: prefix[5]-prefix[3] =100130-7=100123.\n\nWait, wait, 100130 -7 is 100123.\n\nWait, 100130 -7 is 100123.\n\nYes.\n\ni=4: prefix[6]-prefix[4] =100587 -100007 =580.\n\nWait, 100587-100007 is 580.\n\ni=5: prefix[7]-prefix[5] =101376 -100130 =1246.\n\nWait, 101376 -100130 is 1246.\n\ni=6: prefix[8]-prefix[6] =102165-100587=1578.\n\nWait, 102165-100587 is 1578.\n\nSo adding all these:\n\n3 +6 =9\n\n+100004=100013\n\n+100123=200136\n\n+580=200716\n\n+1246=202, 202, 716+1246=203,962?\n\nWait 200716 +1246 is 201,962.\n\nWait, no. 200716 + 1246 is 201, 716 + 1,246.\n\nWait 716+246 is 962, so 200,000 + 962 = 200,962.\n\nHmm, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's add all the window sums step by step.\n\nwindow0:3 → total=3\n\nwindow1:6 → total=9\n\nwindow2:100004 → total=100013\n\nwindow3:100123 → total=200136\n\nwindow4:580 → total=200716\n\nwindow5:1246 → total=202, 200716 +1246 = 201,962.\n\nwindow6:1578 → total=203,540.\n\nWait, 201,962 +1578 = 203,540.\n\nSo sum is 203,540.\n\nNumber of windows is 7.\n\n203540 /7 = 29,064.2857142857....\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: when k equals n. Then number of windows is 1. So average is the total sum.\n\nNow, about the code.\n\nPotential Issues:\n\n- Handling the prefix sum correctly. Make sure that the indexes are correct.\n\nWait, in the code, a is zero-based, and prefix is 1-based.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for i in 0..n-k:\n\nwindow_sum = prefix[i +k] - prefix[i]\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing: for very large n, say 2e5, the code must run efficiently. Python can handle that.\n\nSo, now, the code should look like this.\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead a.\n\nCompute prefix.\n\nCompute total by iterating through each window.\n\nCompute average.\n\nPrint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo, now writing the code.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the input is given as a list of strings, but in the actual code, I'll read via stdin.\n\nWait, the problem shows the input as:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nBut in reality, the input is read via standard input. So in code, the first line is n and k, second line is the a's.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nCheck len(a) ==n.\n\nCompute prefix.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nYes.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nThe code:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprefix = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\ntotal = 0\nnum_windows = n - k + 1\nfor i in range(num_windows):\n    current_sum = prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]\n    total += current_sum\naverage = total / num_windows\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but in the sample input 3, the output is 28964.2857142857, which is 10 decimal digits. Let me check if the code will print that.\n\nBecause in code, the format is to 10 decimal digits, including trailing zeros if necessary.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: when n=1, k=1.\n\nInput: 1 1\\n5 → sum is 5, average 5.0 → output is 5.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, k=2 → one window, sum is a[0]+a[1], average same.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nI think that's the correct approach.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of size k from a given list of sleep times for n days. The solution should efficiently handle large input sizes up to 200,000 days.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given a list of sleep times for n days and need to find the average sleep time over each possible window of k consecutive days. The number of such windows is (n - k + 1).\n\n2. **Intuition**: Calculating the sum of each window directly would be inefficient for large n and k. Instead, we use a prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of any subarray.\n\n3. **Prefix Sum Array**: This array helps in calculating the sum of any subarray in constant time. The prefix sum at index i represents the sum of the first i elements. Using this, the sum of elements from index l to r can be computed as `prefix[r] - prefix[l]`.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Using the prefix sum array, we iterate through each possible window of k days, compute the sum using the prefix sums, and accumulate the total sum of all windows. Finally, we compute the average by dividing the total sum by the number of windows.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprefix = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\ntotal = 0\nnum_windows = n - k + 1\nfor i in range(num_windows):\n    current_sum = prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]\n    total += current_sum\n\naverage = total / num_windows\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers n and k, followed by a list of n integers representing the sleep times for each day.\n\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: We construct a prefix sum array where each element at index i is the sum of the first i elements of the sleep times list. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n\n3. **Summing Windows**: For each possible starting index of a window of size k, we compute the sum using the prefix sum array and accumulate the total sum of all windows.\n\n4. **Computing Average**: The average is calculated by dividing the total sum of all windows by the number of windows, which is (n - k + 1). The result is printed with 10 decimal places to ensure precision.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the maximum constraints effectively.",
