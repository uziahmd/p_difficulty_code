In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles, and I have to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form at least one mentsu. Mentsu can be either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nHmm, let's think about how to approach this. The input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s' is one tile. My goal is to determine for each of these three inputs what's the minimal number of additional tiles needed.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the output is three lines, right? Like in the example, the input is three strings, and the output is three integers, each indicating the minimal for each possible scenario. Wait, no, wait. Oh no, maybe I misunderstood. Let me look at the example again.\n\nIn the sample input, it's three lines, but the output is three lines, each being 0, 0, 1. So perhaps each line corresponds to each of the three initial hands? Or maybe not. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: the input is three strings, and the output is a single integer. Oh wait, no, the output is to print a single integer, but in the sample, they show ['0', '0', '1']—wait, maybe the sample is illustrative, but actually, the output is just one integer. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, the problem says to print a single integer—the minimal number of tiles needed. So why in the sample the output is a list of three numbers? Oh, wait, that's probably a typo in the example description. Because the actual output is a single integer.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Print a single integer—the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\" So the sample shows something else, but the actual output should be a single integer. So in the sample, the answer is 0, which is printed as '0'.\n\nWait, no, looking again, the sample shows three outputs: ['0', '0', '1'], but that's probably because the user mistakenly wrote it that way. But according to the problem statement, the output is a single integer.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the input is three strings. Each string is a tile. So perhaps the output is three lines, each corresponding to the minimal tiles needed if you consider adding to each of the three initial tiles as separate cases. Or perhaps not. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is three strings, each representing a tile. So the initial hand consists of exactly three tiles. Then, Tokitsukaze can draw any number of tiles, including duplicates. She wants to have at least one mentsu in her entire hand after drawing. So the question is: what's the minimal number of tiles she needs to add so that among all her tiles (the initial three plus the added ones), there exists a mentsu.\n\nSo for the given initial three tiles, we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu. The output is that minimal number.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows three lines as output. So maybe that's a mistake, perhaps the output is a single integer.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"Print a single integer...\" So in the sample, the output is 0, but the sample shows three lines. Hmm, perhaps that's a typo in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the output is three integers, each representing the minimal for each of the three possible cases: for each of the three tiles, considering it as a starting point. But that seems unlikely.\n\nNo, I think the correct understanding is that the input is three tiles, and the output is the minimal number of tiles needed to add so that the total collection has at least one mentsu.\n\nSo for the sample input, the initial three tiles are:\n\n['1s', '2s', '3s'] → already a shuntsu (sequence), so 0 needed.\n\n['9m', '9m', '9m'] → already a koutsu, so 0 needed.\n\n['3p', '9m', '2p'] → current tiles: 3p, 9m, 2p. To form a shuntsu, he needs either 1p, 4p, or 5p? Wait, let's see. Wait, 2p and 3p are consecutive, but then what's next? 4p. So to form 2p,3p,4p, he needs to add 4p. So that's one tile.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nThus, the output is 1. So the sample output would be 1, but the problem's sample shows three outputs. Maybe that's a formatting error.\n\nSo, moving on. How to model this.\n\nFirst, I need to process the three initial tiles, and find the minimal number of tiles to add so that the total includes at least one mentsu.\n\nSo, for each possible way of forming a mentsu, I can compute how many tiles are missing from the initial set, and choose the minimal across all possible mentsus.\n\nBut since there are multiple possibilities, perhaps I need to check all possible possible mentsus that can be formed, considering that adding tiles may create one.\n\nAn alternative approach is to generate all possible mentsus, and for each, calculate how many tiles are already present in the initial hand, then compute how many more are needed to complete that mentsu. The minimal such number across all possible mentsus is the answer.\n\nBut wait, mentsu can be a triplet or a sequence. So, for each possible triplet and each possible sequence, check how many tiles are present in the initial hand, and then the required tiles are 3 minus the count, unless it's a koutsu or shuntsu.\n\nWait, but also, the initial hand can contribute to multiple mentsus. So for example, if the initial hand is [1m,1m,1m], then 0 tiles are needed. Similarly, if it's [1m,2m,3m], then 0.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Collect all possible mentsus that could be formed by adding tiles to the initial hand.\n\n2. For each possible mentsu, compute how many tiles are already present in the initial hand.\n\n3. The minimal number of tiles needed is the minimal (3 - count) across all possible mentsus.\n\nBut wait, the initial hand may already contain some tiles of a mentsu, but not all. For example, initial hand is [1m,2m,4m]. Then, the mentsu 1m,2m,3m requires adding 3m, which is one tile.\n\nSo, how do I generate all possible mentsus?\n\nWell, let's think about all possible triplets (for koutsu) and sequences (for shuntsu).\n\nFor koutsu: for each suit, and each number from 1 to 9, there's a triplet {x, x, x}.\n\nFor shuntsu: for each suit, and each starting number from 1 to 7, the sequence is x, x+1, x+2.\n\nSo, total possible mentsus is 3 * 9 (for koutsu) + 3 * 7 (for shuntsu) = 27 + 21 = 48 possible mentsus.\n\nWait, no. Because for shuntsu, the starting number can be up to 7, because x+2 must be <=9. So yes, 7 possibilities per suit.\n\nSo for each of these 48 possible mentsus, I can check how many tiles of that mentsu are present in the initial hand.\n\nThe minimal number of tiles needed is the minimal (3 - count) across all mentsus, where count is the number of tiles in the initial hand that belong to the mentsu.\n\nWait, but when the initial hand has 3 tiles, perhaps it's possible that adding zero tiles can form a mentsu.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Generate all possible mentsus (48 in total).\n\n- For each mentsu, count how many of its three tiles are present in the initial hand.\n\n- Compute 3 - count: the number of tiles needed to complete this mentsu.\n\n- Find the minimal value of (3 - count) across all mentsus.\n\nThat minimal value is the answer.\n\nBecause, for example, if any mentsu has all three tiles present, then 0 is the minimal.\n\nIf none have all three, but some have two, then the minimal is 1.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three initial tiles.\n\n2. For each mentsu (48 in total):\n\n   a. Check how many of the three tiles in the mentsu are present in the initial hand.\n\n   b. Calculate needed = 3 - count.\n\n   c. Keep track of the minimal needed.\n\n3. Output the minimal needed.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where a mentsu is already formed by the initial hand? For example, if the initial hand is [1m,1m,1m], then for the triplet mentsu, needed is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, how to represent the initial hand? As a set of tiles.\n\nEach tile can be represented as a string, like '1m', '2s', etc.\n\nSo, the initial_hand = {'1m', '2m', '3m'}, for example.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input is three strings, which can be read into a list. So, for example, the input is read as three strings, each stripped of any whitespace.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\ntiles = []\nfor _ in range(3):\n    s = input().strip()\n    tiles.append(s)\n\nThen, initial_hand = set(tiles)\n\nNow, for each possible mentsu, we need to check how many tiles of that mentsu are present in the initial_hand.\n\nSo, for each mentsu, collect its three tiles. For each of those three, check if they are in the initial_hand.\n\nCount the number, and compute 3 - count.\n\nWe can then find the minimal such value.\n\nSo, how to generate all possible mentsus.\n\nLet's think:\n\nFor koutsu:\n\nLoop through each suit in ['m', 'p', 's'].\n\nLoop through each number from 1 to 9.\n\nSo, for each, the triplet is [str(num)+suit, str(num)+suit, str(num)+suit].\n\nFor shuntsu:\n\nLoop through each suit in ['m', 'p', 's'].\n\nLoop through each starting number from 1 to 7.\n\nThen, the three tiles are:\n\nstart_num, start_num+1, start_num+2.\n\nEach converted to string with the suit.\n\nSo, for example, starting number 3, suit 'm' gives '3m', '4m', '5m'.\n\nSo, for each of these, create the triplet.\n\nOnce all possible mentsus are generated, for each, compute the needed tiles.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nGenerate all possible mentsus:\n\nmentsus = []\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    # add all koutsu for this suit\n    for num in range(1,10):\n        m = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n        mentsus.append([m, m, m])\n    # add all shuntsu for this suit\n    for start in range(1,8):\n        mentsus.append([f\"{start}{suit}\", f\"{start+1}{suit}\", f\"{start+2}{suit\"]))\n\nWait, but wait: in the shuntsu, the order doesn't matter, right? Because when checking, it's just a set. So for each shuntsu, the three tiles are {a, b, c}, regardless of order.\n\nBut in the code above, when adding to mentsus, we're appending lists with the three tiles in order. But for counting, the order doesn't matter; it's just whether each tile is present.\n\nSo, when checking, for a given mentsu, the count is the number of tiles in initial_hand that are in the mentsu.\n\nSo, the code is okay.\n\nOnce all mentsus are generated, loop through each, compute the count, then needed.\n\nNow, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nBut wait, the initial_hand is a set of three tiles. So, for each mentsus in mentsus:\n\ncount = sum(1 for tile in mentsu if tile in initial_hand)\n\nneeded = 3 - count\n\nif needed < current_min, update current_min.\n\nSo, the minimal needed is the answer.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead the three tiles into a set.\n\nGenerate all possible mentsus.\n\nFor each mentsu, count how many tiles are present in the initial set.\n\nCompute needed, track the minimal.\n\nNow, edge cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: All three tiles form a mentsu.\n\nE.g., '1m','2m','3m' → needed is 0.\n\nCase 2: Two tiles form part of a mentsu.\n\nE.g., '1m','2m','4m' → to form 1m,2m,3m, need one tile.\n\nCase 3: No tiles form part of any mentsu.\n\nE.g., '1m', '2p', '3s' → for any mentsu, only one tile is present (like 1m in some triplet, but others have 2p and 3s which don't fit any triplet or sequence). So, the minimal needed is 2, because for any triplet, you need two more, and for any shuntsu, you need two more.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each mentsu, the needed is 3 - count.\n\nFor a mentsu that has zero tiles in the initial hand, needed is 3.\n\nBut the minimal across all mentsus is the minimal needed.\n\nSo, for the case where no mentsu has any tiles in the initial hand, the minimal is 3.\n\nBut wait, suppose the initial hand has three tiles that are all unique and not part of any mentsu. For example, 1m, 4m, 7m.\n\nEach of them can be part of a triplet.\n\nBut none of the shuntsus can be formed.\n\nSo, for the triplet mentsus of 1m,1m,1m: initial count is 1, needed is 2.\n\nSimilarly, for 4m: count is 1, needed is 2.\n\nSame for 7m.\n\nFor shuntsus: none of them are present.\n\nSo the minimal needed is 2.\n\nWait, but wait. Are there any shuntsu that can be formed by adding two tiles?\n\nLike, for the 1m,4m,7m, perhaps no shuntsu is possible. So, the minimal needed is 2, because you can add two tiles to form a triplet.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: initial hand has three tiles that form a partial mentsu, but adding one tile completes it.\n\nE.g., initial tiles: 1m, 1m, 2m.\n\nSo, for the triplet 1m, needed is 1 (since two are present). For the shuntsu 1m,2m,3m, needed is 1.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the three tiles.\n\ntiles = [input().strip() for _ in range(3)]\ninitial_hand = set(tiles)\n\nThen, generate all possible mentsus.\n\nmentsus = []\nsuits = ['m', 'p', 's']\n\nfor suit in suits:\n    # add koutsu\n    for num in range(1, 10):\n        mentsus.append([f\"{num}{suit}\", f\"{num}{suit}\", f\"{num}{suit}\"])\n    # add shuntsu\n    for start in range(1, 8):\n        mentsus.append([f\"{start}{suit}\", f\"{start+1}{suit}\", f\"{start+2}{suit}\"])\n\nNow, for each mentsu in mentsus, compute the count.\n\nmin_tiles = 3  # worst case, need all three\n\nfor mentsu in mentsus:\n    count = 0\n    for tile in mentsu:\n        if tile in initial_hand:\n            count += 1\n    needed = 3 - count\n    if needed < min_tiles:\n        min_tiles = needed\n\nprint(min_tiles)\n\nWait, but wait. What about when the initial hand has more than three tiles after adding? Because the problem allows drawing any tiles, including duplicates.\n\nNo, because when calculating needed, it's based on the initial hand. Adding tiles beyond the initial three is allowed, but the minimal is found based on the best possible scenario.\n\nWait, but in our approach, we're considering each possible mentsu and seeing how many tiles are needed from the initial hand. So, even if the initial hand has more than three tiles, but the mentsu is not formed, but adding more tiles can form a mentsu, that's handled correctly.\n\nWait, no, because the initial_hand is fixed as the three given tiles. When considering adding tiles, the code doesn't account for any other tiles beyond the initial three.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Because the code as written assumes that the initial hand is fixed as three tiles, but in reality, the initial hand is three, and we can add any number of tiles (including any, including possibly multiple copies of existing tiles) to reach a state where at least one mentsu exists.\n\nWait, but in our approach, the code counts how many tiles are in the initial_hand that belong to the mentsu. So, for example, if the mentsu is a triplet, and the initial_hand has two of the three tiles, then adding one more will complete it. So the code correctly computes needed as 1.\n\nSimilarly, for a shuntsu, if the initial_hand has two of the three tiles, then needed is 1.\n\nBut wait, what if the initial_hand has more than three tiles, but not enough to form a mentsu? No, because in the problem statement, the initial hand is exactly three tiles.\n\nWait, the initial_hand is exactly three tiles. So, the code is correct.\n\nSo, for example, if the initial_hand is ['1m', '2m', '3m'], then the code will find a mentsu (the shuntsu) with count=3, needed=0.\n\nAnother example: initial_hand is ['1m', '1m', '2m'].\n\nFor the triplet '1m', count is 2, needed 1.\n\nFor the shuntsu 1m,2m,3m, count is 2, needed 1.\n\nThus, minimal is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the output is 1. Let me test with that.\n\nSample input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\ntiles = ['1s', '2s', '3s', '9m', '9m', '9m', '3p', '9m', '2p'] → wait, no, the code reads three lines, each as a single string, stripping whitespace. So the initial_hand is {'1s', '2s', '3s'}.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the code reads three lines, each as a single string. So for the first line, '1s 2s 3s' is read as '1s 2s 3s'? No, no, wait. No, the code is:\n\ntiles = []\nfor _ in range(3):\n    s = input().strip()\n    tiles.append(s)\n\nSo, each line is read as a single string, but if the line contains spaces, like '1s 2s 3s', then s will be '1s 2s 3s'. That's wrong.\n\nWait, no. Because in the problem statement, the input is three strings, each representing a single tile. So each line is a single tile, no spaces. So the sample input is:\n\n['1s', '2s', '3s'], etc.\n\nBut in the sample, the input is written as:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nWhich suggests that each line has three tiles, but the problem says that each line is a single string. So perhaps the sample is incorrect, and in reality, each line is a single tile.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem statement. Let me check.\n\nProblem statement says: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\"\n\nWait, no, the problem says that the input is three strings, each string represents a tile. So each line is a single tile.\n\nBut in the sample, the input is written as three lines, each with three tiles separated by space. So, perhaps the code should read each line as a single tile, but in the sample, each line is a single tile.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the input.\n\nWait, the problem says: the input is three strings. So the input is three lines, each containing a single string (tile). So each line is a single tile, e.g., '1m', '2m', etc.\n\nSo in the sample input, the first line is '1s 2s 3s'—but that would be a single tile, but it's actually three tiles. So perhaps the sample is written incorrectly.\n\nBut perhaps the initial code I wrote is incorrect because it's reading each line as a single tile, but in reality, each line is a single tile.\n\nWait, no, the problem statement says that each line is a string. So each line is a single tile.\n\nSo in the sample input, each line is a single tile. So the code should read three lines, each as a single string.\n\nSo for the first line, it's '1s 2s 3s'? No, that's impossible because that's a single tile with spaces. So perhaps the sample is misrepresented.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample's input is a typo, and each line is a single tile.\n\nIn any case, the code must read three lines, each as a single string, which is a tile.\n\nSo the initial code is correct.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first line is '1s 2s 3s' which is three tiles, but the code is expecting each line to be a single tile. So perhaps the code should split each line into individual tiles.\n\nAh! That's probably the issue.\n\nSo, for each line, split into individual tiles.\n\nSo, for example, the input is three lines, each line is a space-separated list of three tiles.\n\nSo, the code should read the three lines, each split into three tiles.\n\nSo, for the sample input:\n\nLine 1: '1s 2s 3s' → three tiles: '1s', '2s', '3s'\n\nLine 2: '9m 9m 9m' → three tiles: '9m', '9m', '9m'\n\nLine 3: '3p 9m 2p' → three tiles: '3p', '9m', '2p'\n\nSo the initial_hand is {'1s', '2s', '3s', '9m', '9m', '9m', '3p', '9m', '2p'}.\n\nWait, no, the initial_hand is three tiles, but according to the problem statement, the initial hand is three tiles. So perhaps each line represents a single tile, but the sample is written as three lines, each with three tiles.\n\nThis is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should read three lines, each of which is a single tile.\n\nBut the sample input is given as:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nWhich seems to have each line as three tiles, which would imply that the initial hand is nine tiles, but the problem says three.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the sample is a typo, and the correct input is each line as a single tile.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should read three lines, each as a single tile.\n\nIn that case, the sample input is:\n\nThree lines:\n\n'1s'\n\n'2s'\n\n'3s'\n\nBut the sample output is 0, 0, 1.\n\nWait, no, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample is correct, and the code should read three lines, each line being three tiles, which are the initial hand.\n\nSo, initial_hand is the union of all three tiles from the three lines.\n\nBut that would make the initial hand have 9 tiles, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: she has three tiles in her hand.\n\nSo the initial_hand is three tiles.\n\nSo, the code must read three lines, each line is a single tile.\n\nThus, the sample input is probably written incorrectly.\n\nBut for the purpose of solving the problem, I'll proceed under the assumption that each line is a single tile.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ntiles = []\nfor _ in range(3):\n    s = input().strip()\n    tiles.append(s)\ninitial_hand = set(tiles)\n\nSo, the sample input would be:\n\n1s\n\n2s\n\n3s\n\nThen, initial_hand is {'1s', '2s', '3s'}, which forms a shuntsu, so output is 0.\n\nAnother example:\n\n9m\n\n9m\n\n9m → initial_hand has three 9m, which is a koutsu, output 0.\n\nThird line:\n\n3p 9m 2p → initial_hand is {'3p', '9m', '2p'}\n\nSo, for shuntsu, possible options:\n\nLooking for 2p,3p,4p → current count is 2 (2p and 3p), needed 1.\n\nOr 3p,4p,5p: current count is 1 (3p), needed 2.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nThus, the output is 1.\n\nSo, the code correctly handles this.\n\nBut now, the code as written earlier would treat the initial_hand as the union of all three tiles, but that's not correct.\n\nWait, no. Because in the sample input, each line is a single tile, so the initial_hand is three tiles.\n\nWait, no. If the code reads three lines, each line as a single tile, then initial_hand is three tiles.\n\nBut in the sample input, the initial hand is three tiles, but the sample shows that the output is three numbers. Which is not the case.\n\nSo, perhaps the code is correct, and the sample is a typo.\n\nSo, in any case, the code as written should handle all cases.\n\nTesting another example.\n\nSuppose the initial tiles are ['1m', '2m', '4m'].\n\nFor the triplet 1m, count is 1 → needed 2.\n\nFor the triplet 2m, count is 1 → needed 2.\n\nFor the shuntsu 1m,2m,3m → count is 2 → needed 1.\n\nThus, the minimal is 1.\n\nSo the code would output 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: initial tiles are ['1m', '3m', '5m'].\n\nFor each triplet, count is 1, needed 2.\n\nFor shuntsu 1m,2m,3m: count is 1 (1m), needed 2.\n\nShuntsu 3m,4m,5m: count is 1 (3m,5m), needed 2.\n\nSo minimal needed is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nNow, what about the case where the initial_hand is empty. Well, in the problem, the initial hand is always three tiles.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo, the final code is:\n\nRead three lines, each line as a single tile.\n\nCreate initial_hand as a set of these three tiles.\n\nGenerate all possible mentsus.\n\nFor each mentsu, count how many tiles are present in initial_hand.\n\nCompute needed as 3 - count.\n\nTrack the minimal needed.\n\nOutput that minimal needed.\n\nThus, the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) from her hand.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Tokitsukaze has three tiles in her hand, and she can draw any number of additional tiles. A mentsu can be either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit). The goal is to find the minimum number of additional tiles needed to form at least one mentsu.\n\n2. **Generate All Possible Mentsus**: We generate all possible mentsus. For each suit ('m', 'p', 's'), we consider both triplets and sequences:\n   - **Triplets**: For each number from 1 to 9, create a triplet with the same number and suit.\n   - **Sequences**: For each starting number from 1 to 7, create a sequence of three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n3. **Check Initial Hand**: For each generated mentsu, check how many of its tiles are present in the initial hand. Calculate the number of additional tiles needed to complete the mentsu.\n\n4. **Determine Minimum Tiles**: Track the minimum number of tiles needed across all possible mentsus.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read the three input lines, each representing a single tile\ntiles = [input().strip() for _ in range(3)]\ninitial_hand = set(tiles)\n\n# Generate all possible mentsus\nmentsus = []\nsuits = ['m', 'p', 's']\n\nfor suit in suits:\n    # Add all possible koutsu (triplets)\n    for num in range(1, 10):\n        mentsus.append([f\"{num}{suit}\", f\"{num}{suit}\", f\"{num}{suit}\"])\n    # Add all possible shuntsu (sequences)\n    for start in range(1, 8):\n        mentsus.append([f\"{start}{suit}\", f\"{start+1}{suit}\", f\"{start+2}{suit}\"])\n\nmin_tiles = 3  # Initialize with the maximum possible\n\nfor mentsu in mentsus:\n    count = 0\n    for tile in mentsu:\n        if tile in initial_hand:\n            count += 1\n    needed = 3 - count\n    if needed < min_tiles:\n        min_tiles = needed\n\nprint(min_tiles)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads three lines of input, each representing a single tile.\n2. **Generating Mentsus**: It generates all possible triplets and sequences for each suit.\n3. **Checking Each Mentsu**: For each mentsu, it counts how many tiles from the initial hand are part of the mentsu and calculates how many more tiles are needed.\n4. **Finding Minimum**: The minimum number of tiles needed across all mentsus is determined and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways to form a mentsu and ensures that the solution is optimal by considering every possible combination.",
