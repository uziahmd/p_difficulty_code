Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Colored Boots.\" Hmm.\n\nSo, the setup is that there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color represented by a lowercase letter or a question mark. We need to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of one left and one right boot, and their colors are compatible.\n\nWhat counts as compatible? Two specific colors are compatible if they're the same. An indefinite (question mark) is compatible with any color. So, for example, a left boot of color 'a' can pair with a right boot of 'a' or '?'. But a left 'a' can't pair with a right 'b'.\n\nThe output should be the maximum number of such pairs, along with the actual pairs listed. Also, each boot can only be part of one pair.\n\nAlright, so how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I think I need to model the problem in a way that allows me to efficiently find these maximum pairs. Since the constraints are up to 150,000, we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution, anything higher like O(n^2) is out of the question.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases for each pair:\n\nFor each i-th left boot and j-th right boot, l[i] and r[j], check if they are compatible. But checking all possible pairs is O(n^2), which is impossible for n=150,000.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can group the left and right boots based on their color (or more precisely, the type of their color). For each left boot, determine how many right boots it can pair with, considering both specific and question mark cases.\n\nWait, but even that might not directly help because each left can pair with multiple rights, but each can be used at most once.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a bipartite graph where left nodes are connected to right nodes they can pair with, and then find a maximum matching. But for n=150,000, building such a graph isn't feasible because it would have 150,000^2 edges, which is way too much.\n\nSo that approach is out.\n\nAnother thought: since the question marks are universal, perhaps we can precompute for each left boot the set of possible right boots it can pair with, and then find a way to match as many as possible.\n\nBut again, without a smart way to count and manage overlaps, it's tricky.\n\nLet me consider the problem differently. What if I create two frequency tables: one for left boots and one for right boots. Then, for each possible color or question mark, I can compute how many lefts and rights have those specific colors and then find the maximum possible pairs.\n\nWait, but question marks can pair with any color, including themselves. So perhaps the approach is to first handle the specific color pairs, and then use the question marks to cover any remaining possible pairs.\n\nWait, but the question marks can also be used as their own specific color. So maybe I should process all specific color pairs first, and then assign the question marks to the remaining needed pairs.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that. Maybe another approach is to model the problem as a bipartite graph where the edges represent compatible pairs, and then find the maximum matching. But again, with n=150,000, that's not feasible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum matching is just the sum of the minimum of certain counts across the possible color groups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to pair as many same-color pairs as possible, and then use the question marks to fill in the gaps.\n\nWait, let's think about the structure.\n\nEach left boot can be paired with any right boot that either has the same color or a question mark.\n\nSimilarly, each right boot can be paired with a left that has the same color or a question mark.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum over all color c of min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) plus the number of question marks in either left or right that can't be covered by same-color pairs.\n\nWait, no, that might not capture all possibilities. Because some question marks can be used to pair with specific colors, and vice versa.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. For each specific color c, calculate how many left boots have c and how many right boots have c. The number of pairs from this color is the minimum of the two counts.\n\n2. Then, for the question marks, calculate how many are left and how many are right. But the question is, how to optimally use them after using the same-color pairs.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question marks can be used to pair with any remaining left or right boots that haven't been paired yet.\n\nSo perhaps the process is:\n\n- Compute the maximum same-color pairs, which is the sum for each c of min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c]).\n\n- Then, subtract these pairs from the total available left and right boots.\n\n- The remaining left and right boots (including question marks) can form additional pairs. The number of such pairs is the minimum between the remaining left and right counts.\n\nWait, but wait: the question marks can pair with any left or right. So perhaps after handling same-color pairs, the remaining left and right counts (including any question marks) can be used as follows: the maximum possible is the minimum of the total remaining left and right.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let's formalize this.\n\nLet L be the list of left boots, R the list of right boots.\n\nCompute for each color c:\n\nsame_pairs += min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c])\n\nThen, for the same c, the remaining left and right are l_counts[c] - same_pairs and r_counts[c] - same_pairs, respectively.\n\nBut for the question marks, perhaps we can consider the remaining left and right as follows:\n\nCompute the total number of question marks in left and right, but also, the question marks can be considered as a special color that can pair with any other.\n\nWait, maybe after handling the same-color pairs, the question marks can be used to pair with any remaining left or right.\n\nSo, the total number of possible pairs after same-color pairs is:\n\ntotal_pairs = same_pairs + q_pairs,\n\nwhere q_pairs is the minimum of the remaining left (sum of all lefts not in same_color, including ?) and the remaining right (sum of all rights not in same_color, including ?).\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nAfter same_pairs, the remaining left is sum_l = sum of (l_i not in same_color) or l_i is '?'.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not exactly. Because the same-color pairs have already been taken, so the remaining lefts are those that couldn't find a matching right of the same color.\n\nSo for each color c, after taking min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c]), the remaining lefts for c are l_counts[c] - same_pairs, and similarly for rights.\n\nBut for the question marks, it's more complex. Because a '?' in left can pair with any right, regardless of color, as long as the right is either '?' or matches.\n\nWait, perhaps after processing same-color pairs, we can calculate the total number of lefts that are either '?', or their color c had some same-pairs but not all.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as:\n\nWe have:\n\n- For each color c, the number of lefts is Lc, the number of rights is Rc.\n\n- For each c, we can take up to min(Lc, Rc) pairs of (left, right) where both are c.\n\n- Additionally, the question marks can be used to pair with any left or right, including other question marks.\n\nWait, but the question marks can pair with any color, so perhaps the total number of possible pairs is the sum of same-color pairs plus the sum of the minimal between the remaining lefts (including question marks) and the remaining rights (including question marks).\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of it in terms of variables.\n\nLet total_left = n, total_right = n.\n\nCompute same_pairs as sum for each c of min(Lc, Rc).\n\nThen, the remaining left is (total_left - same_pairs) + Ql, where Ql is the number of question marks in left.\n\nWait, no. Because for each c, the same_pairs take min(Lc, Rc). So for lefts, the remaining is Lc - same_pairs for color c, but only if Lc > Rc. If Lc <= Rc, then all Lc are used in same_pairs, so no remaining for that color.\n\nSimilarly for rights.\n\nWait, perhaps the remaining lefts after same_pairs are sum over c (max(0, Lc - Rc)).\n\nSimilarly, the remaining rights are sum over c (max(0, Rc - Lc)).\n\nAdditionally, the question marks in left and right are separate. Wait, no. The question marks can be used in any way.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nAfter same_pairs, the remaining lefts and rights can be:\n\nremaining_left = (n - same_pairs) - sum_c (Lc - Rc if Lc > Rc else 0)\n\nWait, no, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of remaining lefts is:\n\nsum over all lefts that are not matched in same_pairs.\n\nWhich includes:\n\n- Lefts that are of color c where Lc < Rc: all Lc are used.\n\n- Lefts that are of color c where Lc >= Rc: Lc - Rc are left.\n\nPlus, the number of question marks in left that are not used in same_pairs.\n\nWait, but the question marks can pair with any color, so perhaps the same_pairs don't use any question marks.\n\nWait, yes! Because same_pairs are for specific colors. So when we process same_pairs, we ignore the question marks.\n\nSo, after same_pairs, the question marks are still available to pair with any left or right, including those not used in same_pairs.\n\nSo perhaps the next step is to compute:\n\n- The number of lefts available after same_pairs: these are lefts that are either of a color c where Lc was not fully used, or are question marks.\n\nSimilarly for rights.\n\nWait, but that's not accurate. Because the question marks are part of the left and right lists.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial same_pairs processing doesn't affect the question marks.\n\nTherefore, after same_pairs, the number of lefts that can be used is:\n\nsum over all c (max(0, Lc - same_pairs[c])) + Ql, where Ql is the number of question marks in left.\n\nSimilarly, the number of rights is sum over c (max(0, Rc - same_pairs[c])) + Qr, where Qr is the number of question marks in right.\n\nWait, no. Because the same_pairs[c] is min(Lc, Rc). So for each c, after same_pairs, the remaining lefts are Lc - same_pairs[c] (if Lc > Rc), else zero. Similarly for rights.\n\nSo the remaining lefts are sum over c (max(0, Lc - same_pairs[c])) + Ql.\n\nSimilarly for rights.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because Lc is already the count of color c in left, and same_pairs[c] is min(Lc, Rc). So for c where Lc >= Rc, after same_pairs, Lc - Rc are left in left. Otherwise, none.\n\nSo the remaining left is sum (for c in colors) max(0, Lc - same_pairs[c]) + Ql.\n\nSimilarly, remaining right is sum (for c in colors) max(0, Rc - same_pairs[c]) + Qr.\n\nWait, but wait: Ql is the number of question marks in left, which are separate from the color counts. Because the question marks are treated as a separate color.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\n- For left, the total available is the sum of all lefts not used in same_pairs plus the question marks.\n\nSo:\n\navailable_left = sum( Lc - same_pairs[c] for c in colors ) + Ql\n\navailable_right = sum( Rc - same_pairs[c] for c in colors ) + Qr\n\nThen, the maximum possible additional pairs is min(available_left, available_right).\n\nBecause each pair must consist of one left and one right, and the question marks can pair with any.\n\nSo the total_pairs = same_pairs + min(available_left, available_right).\n\nBut wait, is this correct? Let me test it with an example.\n\nTake the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\nn=10\n\nLeft: codeforces --> 'c','o','d','e','f','o','r','c','e','s'\n\nRight: dodivthree --> 'd','o','d','i','v','t','h','r','e','e'\n\nWait, but the exact strings may vary, but let's say:\n\nIn the sample, the maximum pairs are 5.\n\nLet me see how this approach works.\n\nCompute same_pairs:\n\nFor each color c, same_pairs[c] = min(left_count[c], right_count[c]).\n\nAssuming that for 'c', left has 2, right has 1: same_pairs['c'] = 1.\n\nSimilarly for other colors.\n\nThen, the available_left is sum over (left_count[c] - same_pairs[c]) + Ql.\n\nAvailable_right is sum over (right_count[c] - same_pairs[c]) + Qr.\n\nThen, the min of available_left and available_right is the additional pairs.\n\nBut in the sample, after same_pairs, the available_left and available_right are such that the additional is 0, leading to total_pairs being 5.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternative idea: model the problem as a bipartite graph where edges connect left i to right j if they are compatible. The maximum matching in this graph is the answer. But for n=150,000, building such a graph is impossible due to memory and time constraints.\n\nSo that approach is out.\n\nAnother approach: for each left boot, determine the best possible right boot it can pair with, considering that each right can only be used once.\n\nThis sounds like a greedy approach. However, greedily assigning the best possible right for each left might not yield the maximum overall pairs.\n\nBut perhaps, with some clever counting, we can find a way to maximize the pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be broken down into two parts:\n\n1. Same-color pairs: for each color c, match as many left and right c as possible.\n\n2. Cross-color pairs: using question marks to pair with leftovers.\n\nBut how to compute cross-color pairs.\n\nWait, maybe after same-color pairs, we have some left and right that are not used. The question marks can be used to fill in the missing pairs.\n\nSo, the total is same_pairs + x, where x is the minimum of the number of leftover lefts and leftover rights.\n\nBut what defines leftover lefts and rights?\n\nLeftover lefts: the number of lefts that couldn't find a same-color pair, plus the number of question marks in left.\n\nWait, no. Because the same-color pairs only use lefts that are of the same color as a right.\n\nQuestion marks in left can pair with any right, including those that are not of their color.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nAfter same-color pairs, the number of available lefts is the number of lefts that are either:\n\n- Of a color c where same_pairs[c] < left_count[c], i.e., left_count[c] - same_pairs[c] > 0.\n\nOR\n\n- Are question marks.\n\nSimilarly for rights.\n\nSo available_left = sum (left_count[c] - same_pairs[c] for all c) + Ql.\n\nSimilarly, available_right = sum (right_count[c] - same_pairs[c] for all c) + Qr.\n\nThen, the maximum possible cross-color pairs is min(available_left, available_right).\n\nBecause each pair requires one left and one right.\n\nSo the total_pairs = same_pairs + min(available_left, available_right).\n\nIs this correct?\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSuppose in the sample, same_pairs is 4, and available_left and available_right are both 1, so cross is 1, making total_pairs 5.\n\nYes, that matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: if all lefts are '?', and all rights are 'a', then same_pairs is 0, because no lefts are 'a' except the question marks, which are not considered in same_pairs.\n\nWait, no: same_pairs are computed only for the same color, not for question marks.\n\nWait, same_pairs is the sum of min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) for all c.\n\nQuestion marks are not included in c, so same_pairs won't include any pairs from '?'.\n\nSo, in this case, same_pairs is 0.\n\nAvailable_left is (sum over c (left_count[c] - same_pairs[c]) ) + Ql.\n\nBut since all lefts are '?', left_count for all c is 0 except for '?', which is 10.\n\nWait, no: left_count is a dictionary where for each color c, left_count[c] is the number of times c appears in left.\n\nSo for left string \"??????????\", left_count is {'?': 10}, others 0.\n\nSo same_pairs would be 0, since for c='?', same_pairs[c] = min(10, right_count['?']).\n\nIf right is all 'a's, then right_count['?'] is 0, so same_pairs['?'] is 0.\n\nThus, same_pairs is 0.\n\nAvailable_left is sum (left_count[c] - same_pairs[c]) for all c, which is 10-0 = 10, plus Ql=0.\n\nAvailable_right is sum (right_count[c] - same_pairs[c]) for all c, which is 10 (since right_count['a'] is 10, others 0; same_pairs['a'] is min(0,10)=0) + Qr=0.\n\nWait, no: right_count is 'a' has 10, others 0.\n\nSo sum (right_count[c] - same_pairs[c]) for all c is 10 (since same_pairs['a']=min(0,10)=0, others same_pairs are 0).\n\nThus, available_right is 10 + 0 (Qr=0) =10.\n\nSo cross_pairs = min(10,10) =10. Total_pairs = 0 +10=10.\n\nWhich makes sense, because each left '?' can pair with each right 'a'.\n\nAnother test case: left is all '?', right is all '?'.\n\nsame_pairs for each c is 0.\n\navailable_left is 10 (left_count['?'] - same_pairs['?'] =10) +0=10.\n\navailable_right is 10+0=10.\n\ncross_pairs =10. total_pairs=10.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: left has 5 'a's and 5 '?', right has 3 'a's and 7 '?'. \n\nSame_pairs for 'a' is 3, because min(5,3)=3.\n\nAvailable_left for 'a' is 5-3=2. So sum for 'a' is 2, plus 5 '?' left. So available_left=2+5=7.\n\nRight: same_pairs for 'a' is 3, so right_count['a'] - same_pairs['a']=0. Right has 7 '?', so available_right=0+7=7.\n\ncross_pairs is min(7,7)=7.\n\nTotal_pairs=3+7=10.\n\nWhich seems correct.\n\nSo, this approach seems to work.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the frequency count for each color in left and right.\n\n2. Compute same_pairs: for each color c, add min(left_count[c], right_count[c]).\n\n3. Compute available_left: sum over c (left_count[c] - same_pairs[c]) + Ql, where Ql is the number of '?' in left.\n\n4. Compute available_right: sum over c (right_count[c] - same_pairs[c]) + Qr, where Qr is the number of '?' in right.\n\n5. cross_pairs = min(available_left, available_right).\n\n6. total_pairs = same_pairs + cross_pairs.\n\nThen, we need to collect all the pairs.\n\nBut how to collect them? Because the cross_pairs involve pairing left and right that may not be of the same color.\n\nWe need to find which specific left and right pairs to choose.\n\nBut the question says, you can output any optimal solution.\n\nSo, for collecting the pairs:\n\nWe need to first assign the same_pairs, then assign the cross_pairs.\n\nBut how to model the selection of which left and right to pair.\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\n- For same_pairs, for each color c, select min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) pairs, perhaps taking the earliest left and earliest right for that color.\n\nBut that might not be the optimal way, but for the problem, any valid solution is acceptable.\n\nBut for the cross_pairs, we need to pair the remaining left and right.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps:\n\n- After same_pairs, collect all the remaining lefts and rights.\n\n- The cross_pairs will be min(available_left, available_right).\n\nBut to collect which specific lefts and rights are paired, perhaps we can proceed as follows:\n\nWe can first process the same_pairs, selecting for each c, the earliest left and right to pair.\n\nThen, for the cross_pairs, we can collect the earliest possible left and right that are not yet used.\n\nBut this may not be efficient for large n.\n\nBut given the problem's constraints, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut wait, for n=150,000, the same_pairs could be up to 150,000, which would require O(n) time.\n\nSo, perhaps the way is:\n\n- For same_pairs:\n\n   For each color c in left and right:\n\n      take k = min(left_count[c], right_count[c]).\n\n      For each i from 0 to k-1:\n\n          select the i-th left and i-th right of color c.\n\nBut how to track which left and right have been used.\n\nAlternatively, for same_pairs, for each color c, the same_pairs[c] is known.\n\nThen, for the cross_pairs, we need to find the maximum possible.\n\nBut to collect the actual pairs, perhaps the following steps are needed:\n\n1. For same_pairs:\n\n   For each color c in left and right:\n\n      k = same_pairs[c]\n\n      Take the first k lefts of color c, and the first k rights of color c.\n\n      Mark them as used.\n\n2. For cross_pairs:\n\n   We need to pair as many as possible lefts (including ?) and rights (including ?).\n\n   But how?\n\n   One approach is:\n\n   Collect all the lefts that are not used in same_pairs (including ?) and sort them in order.\n\n   Collect all the rights that are not used in same_pairs (including ?) and sort them in order.\n\n   Then, for the cross_pairs, take the first min(available_left, available_right) pairs by matching the earliest left to the earliest right.\n\nBut this may not be the optimal way, but it's a way to collect the pairs.\n\nWait, but what about when the cross_pairs involve matching non-'?' with '?'. It's arbitrary, but as per the problem statement, any valid maximum solution is acceptable.\n\nSo, the steps for collecting the pairs are:\n\n- First, process same_pairs, marking which left and right indices are used.\n\n- Then, collect all unused left and right indices, including the question marks.\n\n- Sort these unused lefts and unused rights.\n\n- Pair the first available left with the first available right, and so on.\n\nBut this is O(n) time, assuming we can efficiently track used/unused.\n\nBut how to track used?\n\nImplementation-wise, for each left index, we can mark whether it's used in same_pairs or not.\n\nBut for large n, this needs to be efficient.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- Create two arrays, used_left and used_right, initialized to False.\n\n- For same_pairs:\n\n   For each color c:\n\n      k = same_pairs[c]\n\n      for i in range(k):\n\n          idx_left = first occurrence of c in left, in order.\n\n          idx_right = first occurrence of c in right, in order.\n\n          mark used_left[idx_left] = True\n\n          mark used_right[idx_right] = True\n\n          remove these from the possible candidates.\n\nBut wait, that's not efficient because for each color, we need to iterate through the left and right lists, which can be O(n) per color, leading to O(n * 26) time, which is acceptable for n=150,000.\n\nAlternatively, for each color c:\n\n   get the list of indices in left where color is c.\n\n   get the list of indices in right where color is c.\n\n   take the min of the two lengths as k.\n\n   for i in 0..k-1:\n\n       left_idx = left_indices[c][i]\n\n       right_idx = right_indices[c][i]\n\n       mark used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n       mark used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nThis would be O(26 * n) in the worst case.\n\nOnce same_pairs are marked as used, the remaining lefts and rights are those not marked.\n\nFor cross_pairs:\n\nCollect all left indices not used, sorted in increasing order.\n\nCollect all right indices not used, sorted in increasing order.\n\nPair the first min(a, b) lefts with the first min(a, b) rights.\n\nThus, the cross_pairs are these.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Preprocess left and right into lists of indices, grouped by color.\n\n- Compute same_pairs and mark used_left and used_right.\n\n- For cross_pairs, collect the unused lefts and rights, sort them, and pair the first min(available_left, available_right) of them.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nCompute left_counts: a dictionary mapping color to list of indices (0-based?) where that color occurs in l.\n\nSimilarly, right_counts: same for r.\n\nWait, but in code, perhaps using a list for each color is better.\n\nBut for each color c, we can have a list of indices where it appears.\n\nBut in Python, for each character in l, we can build a dictionary where the key is the character, and the value is a list of indices.\n\nSimilarly for r.\n\nBut for n=150,000, this is manageable.\n\nOnce we have left_counts and right_counts, for each color c, same_pairs[c] is min(len(left_counts[c]), len(right_counts[c])).\n\nWe can then process each c, and for the same_pairs, mark the first k lefts and rights as used.\n\nBut how to mark them.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nInitialize used_left as a list of False of size n.\n\nused_right as a list of False of size n.\n\nThen, for each color c in left_counts:\n\n   lc = left_counts[c]\n\n   rc = right_counts[c]\n\n   k = min(lc, rc)\n\n   for i in range(k):\n\n       l_idx = lc[i]\n\n       r_idx = rc[i]\n\n       used_left[l_idx] = True\n\n       used_right[r_idx] = True\n\nWait, but wait: lc and rc are the lists of indices for c in left and right.\n\nBut when we process them, for i in 0 to k-1, we pick the i-th element in each list.\n\nBut this assumes that the lists are sorted.\n\nYes, because the left_counts and right_counts should store the indices in the order they appear in l and r.\n\nSo, for example, for l = \"abcab\", left_counts['a'] = [0,3], left_counts['b'] = [1,4], etc.\n\nSo, for each c, the same_pairs are formed by taking the first k elements in each list.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nfor c in left_counts:\n    if c not in right_counts:\n        continue\n    lc = left_counts[c]\n    rc = right_counts[c]\n    k = min(len(lc), len(rc))\n    for i in range(k):\n        l_idx = lc[i]\n        r_idx = rc[i]\n        used_left[l_idx] = True\n        used_right[r_idx] = True\n\nOnce this is done, the used_left and used_right arrays mark which indices are used in same_pairs.\n\nThen, collect the unused lefts and unused rights.\n\nunused_left = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i]]\nunused_right = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i]]\n\nThen, the cross_pairs can be formed by taking the minimum of len(unused_left), len(unused_right), and then pairing the first m lefts with the first m rights.\n\nBut wait, no: the cross_pairs can include any unused left and right, regardless of color.\n\nSo, to collect cross_pairs, we can take the first m elements from unused_left and the first m elements from unused_right.\n\nBut in code, since the unused lists are sorted, pairing the first m lefts with the first m rights gives us m pairs.\n\nThus, the cross_pairs are made by zipping the first m of unused_left and unused_right.\n\nNow, the next step is to collect all the same_pairs and cross_pairs, and output them.\n\nBut wait: the same_pairs may not be in the correct order.\n\nNo, because for each color c, the same_pairs are processed in the order of their occurrence, so the same_pairs are added to the result list in the order they were found.\n\nBut the problem requires that the output list of pairs is any valid maximum solution.\n\nBut to get the maximum, the same_pairs are correctly captured.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- For each same_pairs, collect the (l_idx, r_idx) pairs.\n\n- For cross_pairs, collect the (l_idx, r_idx) pairs from the first m of unused_left and unused_right.\n\nThus, the final list of pairs is the same_pairs followed by cross_pairs.\n\nBut in the sample input, the cross_pairs are part of the same output as same_pairs.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, the first line is 5, followed by 5 lines of pairs. So the same_pairs are 5, and cross_pairs are 0.\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nIn the sample input, the output shows 5 pairs, but according to our earlier calculation, same_pairs + cross_pairs may be 5.\n\nBut perhaps in the sample, same_pairs is 5 and cross_pairs is 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is more complex.\n\nBut regardless, the approach should work.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut let's think about the data structures.\n\nIn Python, for n=150,000, using lists for used_left and used_right is manageable.\n\nBut for the left_counts and right_counts, using dictionaries where the keys are the colors, and the values are lists of indices.\n\nBut for each color, the list is built by iterating through the string.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nl = input().strip()\nr = input().strip()\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nleft_counts = defaultdict(list)\nfor idx, c in enumerate(l):\n    left_counts[c].append(idx)\n\nright_counts = defaultdict(list)\nfor idx, c in enumerate(r):\n    right_counts[c].append(idx)\n\nused_left = [False] * n\nused_right = [False] * n\n\nsame_pairs = 0\nresult = []\n\n# Process same_pairs\nfor c in left_counts:\n    if c not in right_counts:\n        continue\n    lc = left_counts[c]\n    rc = right_counts[c]\n    k = min(len(lc), len(rc))\n    same_pairs += k\n    for i in range(k):\n        l_idx = lc[i]\n        r_idx = rc[i]\n        used_left[l_idx] = True\n        used_right[r_idx] = True\n        # Add to result\n        result.append( (l_idx+1, r_idx+1) )\n\n# Now collect unused lefts and rights\nunused_left = []\nunused_right = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    if not used_left[i]:\n        unused_left.append(i+1)\n    if not used_right[i]:\n        unused_right.append(i+1)\n\n# Compute cross_pairs\nm = min(len(unused_left), len(unused_right))\ncross_pairs = []\nfor i in range(m):\n    cross_pairs.append( (unused_left[i], unused_right[i]) )\n\n# Combine same_pairs and cross_pairs\nall_pairs = result + cross_pairs\n\n# Output\nprint(len(all_pairs))\nfor pair in all_pairs:\n    print(pair[0], pair[1])\n\nWait, but this may not be correct because in the same_pairs processing, the order in which the pairs are added may not be the earliest possible.\n\nWait, for example, in the same_pairs, for color 'a', the pairs are taken as the first k in left and right.\n\nBut suppose another color 'b' has more same_pairs.\n\nThe order in which the same_pairs are added may affect the cross_pairs, but since the problem allows any maximum solution, it's acceptable.\n\nBut when the cross_pairs are added, the earliest unused left and right are paired.\n\nBut perhaps the cross_pairs are not the maximum possible.\n\nWait, no: the cross_pairs are determined by the minimum of available_left and available_right, which is the maximum possible.\n\nBut the way we collect cross_pairs may not be the optimal, but it's a valid way.\n\nBut what about the possibility that some lefts and rights could have formed more pairs if paired differently.\n\nBut the problem says any maximum solution is acceptable, so this approach is fine.\n\nTesting the code on the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nn=10\n\nl = codeforces --> 'c','o','d','e','f','o','r','c','e','s'\n\nr = dodivthree --> 'd','o','d','i','v','t','h','r','e','e'\n\nSo, left_counts:\n\nc: [0,7]\no: [1,5]\nd: [2]\ne: [3,8]\nf: [4]\nr: [6]\ns: [9]\n\nright_counts:\n\nd: [0,2]\no: [1]\ni: [3]\nv: [4]\nt: [5]\nh: [6]\nr: [7]\ne: [8,9]\nothers: ?\n\nSo, same_pairs:\n\nFor each color c:\n\nc: min(2, 0) = 0.\n\no: min(2, 1) =1.\n\nd: min(1,2)=1.\n\ne: min(2,2)=2.\n\nf: min(1,0)=0.\n\nr: min(1,1)=1.\n\nothers: 0.\n\nSo same_pairs is 0+1+1+2+0+1=5.\n\nThus, same_pairs is 5.\n\nThus, used_left and used_right are marked accordingly.\n\nThen, unused_left and unused_right are collected.\n\nIn the sample, after same_pairs, are there any unused lefts or rights?\n\nBecause same_pairs is 5, and n=10, so 5 are used, 5 remain.\n\nBut the sample output shows 5 pairs, meaning that cross_pairs is 0.\n\nWait, perhaps in the sample, all pairs are same_pairs, and cross_pairs is zero.\n\nBut according to the code, the cross_pairs would be min(5,5)=5, thus total_pairs is 5+5=10.\n\nBut that contradicts the sample output.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is incorrect.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the output is 5, not 10.\n\nAh, so my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, why is that?\n\nBecause in the sample, after same_pairs, the available_left and available_right are such that cross_pairs is zero.\n\nSo, perhaps the code overcounts.\n\nWait, perhaps the same_pairs is 5, but the cross_pairs is zero.\n\nSo, what's the issue here.\n\nWait, perhaps the code computes the cross_pairs as min(available_left, available_right), but in reality, the cross_pairs cannot be formed because the available_left and available_right are not compatible.\n\nWait, no, the cross_pairs can be formed because the question marks can pair with any.\n\nSo why does the sample output have 5 pairs?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample.\n\nWait, in the sample output, the first option is 5 pairs, but the second option is 0, and the third is 10.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input has multiple possible outputs, and the code is generating one of them.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the output can be any of them.\n\nSo, perhaps the code is correct, but the sample is trying to show different outputs.\n\nBut why in the sample input, the same_pairs is 5, but cross_pairs is zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the available_left and available_right are zero.\n\nBut according to the code, after same_pairs, the available_left and available_right are:\n\navailable_left = sum (left_count[c] - same_pairs[c]) + Ql.\n\nSimilarly for available_right.\n\nIn the sample, same_pairs is 5.\n\nHow many lefts and rights are used in same_pairs.\n\nFor same_pairs, 5 pairs are formed.\n\nEach pair uses one left and one right.\n\nThus, 5 lefts and 5 rights are used.\n\nLeaving 5 lefts and 5 rights.\n\nBut in the sample, perhaps the remaining lefts and rights cannot form cross_pairs because they are not compatible.\n\nWait, no: the cross_pairs can be formed if there are any question marks.\n\nWait, but in the sample, perhaps the remaining lefts and rights are all specific colors that are not compatible.\n\nBut that's not possible because the question marks can be used.\n\nWait, perhaps in the sample, the same_pairs is 5, and the remaining lefts and rights are all specific colors that don't match each other, but the question marks are zero.\n\nThus, cross_pairs is zero.\n\nBut in that case, the code would compute cross_pairs as zero, leading to total_pairs=5.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nBut according to the code, the cross_pairs is min(5,5)=5.\n\nSo, the code is computing 10 pairs, but the sample expects 5.\n\nThus, the code is incorrect.\n\nWhat's wrong with the approach.\n\nAh, I see.\n\nThe mistake is that the same_pairs are processed first, but the cross_pairs can only be formed from the remaining lefts and rights, including the question marks.\n\nBut in the sample, after same_pairs, the remaining lefts and rights are specific colors that are not compatible.\n\nThus, the cross_pairs cannot be formed.\n\nBut according to the code, the cross_pairs is the minimum",
