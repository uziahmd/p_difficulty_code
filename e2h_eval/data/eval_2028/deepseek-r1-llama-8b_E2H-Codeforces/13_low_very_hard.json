For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. Hmm, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem statement again. The notes are arranged in a cycle: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Each consecutive note is a semitone apart. So the distance between two notes is the number of semitones between them when moving upwards. For example, C to E is 4 semitones because C -> C# (1), then D (2), D# (3), E (4). \n\nA major triad is formed when the three notes can be ordered such that the first to second is 4 semitones, and second to third is 3. So total of 7 semitones from first to third. Similarly, a minor triad requires the first to second to be 3 semitones and second to third 4 semitones. Also, the order doesn't matter since the chord is unordered; we can rearrange the notes as needed.\n\nSo my task is to take three notes, check all possible orderings, and see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria. If none fit either, it's strange.\n\nWait, but how do I represent the notes numerically? Maybe assign each note a position in the list. Like, create a list of the notes in order, and then each note can be converted into its index. Then, the distance between two notes X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12, because after H comes C again. Wait, no—since each step is one semitone, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) if Y > X, else (Y + 12 - X) mod 12. Or maybe not, because for example, H to C is one semitone. So perhaps, for any two notes x and y, the distance from x to y is (y_pos - x_pos) % 12, but considering that the distance is always measured as the shorter path. Wait, no, the problem says the distance is taken from the lower tone to the upper. So if x is higher than y, then the distance would wrap around, adding 12.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The distance is from the lower note to the higher one. So for example, C to H is 11 semitones. H to C is 1 semitone. Because C is before H, so when you go from H to C, it's a lower note to a higher note, but that's not correct. Wait, wait, the problem says: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone.\" So C comes before C#, which comes before D, etc., up to H, then back to C.\n\nWait, the initial description says: the notes are repeated cyclically. So after H comes C again. So the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, and then C again.\n\nSo the distance between two notes is the number of steps forward, i.e., the minimal steps when moving upward. But since the scale is cyclic, the distance from X to Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. Because if Y is after X, the distance is positive. If Y is before X, the distance wraps around. So for example, the distance from H to C is (0 - 11) mod 12 = 1. That makes sense because from H to C is one semitone.\n\nWait, wait. Let me re-express the notes as indices. Let's say the notes are ordered as:\n\n0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nSo for each note, I can find its index in this list. Then, the distance from note A to note B is (B_index - A_index) % 12. Because for example, from C (0) to E (4) is 4 semitones. From E (4) to G (7) is 3. So the distance is computed correctly as 4 and 3.\n\nSo, for any three notes, I need to consider all permutations of their order and check whether any permutation satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\nWait, but the chord is an unordered set, so the order in which the notes are given doesn't matter. We can arrange them in any order to see if they form a major or minor triad.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read the three notes as a list.\n\n2. For each possible permutation of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The notes are cyclically ordered, and each consecutive note is a semitone apart.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Representation**: Each note is assigned an index in the order they appear in the musical scale: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. This allows us to convert each note into a numerical value for easier calculations.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated as the difference in their indices modulo 12, which handles the cyclic nature of the scale.\n3. **Triad Check**: For a set of three notes, we need to check all permutations of these notes to see if they can form a major or minor triad:\n   - A major triad requires the distances between consecutive notes (in some order) to be 4 and 3 semitones.\n   - A minor triad requires the distances to be 3 and 4 semitones.\n4. **Check All Permutations**: Since the order of notes does not matter, we generate all permutations of the three notes and check each permutation against the criteria for major and minor triads.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Assign each note its index\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_indices = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\ndef get_distance(a, b):\n    return (b - a) % 12\n\ndef is_major(triad):\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(triad):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        d1 = get_distance(a, b)\n        d2 = get_distance(b, c)\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef is_minor(triad):\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(triad):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        d1 = get_distance(a, b)\n        d2 = get_distance(b, c)\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            return True\n    return False\n\n# Read input\nnotes = input().split()\n\n# Check each possible case\nif len(notes) != 3:\n    print(\"strange\")\nelse:\n    # Get the indices of the notes\n    try:\n        idxs = [note_indices[note] for note in notes]\n    except KeyError:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        exit()\n    \n    # Check for major, minor, or strange\n    if is_major(notes):\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif is_minor(notes):\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Representation**: Each note is converted into an index based on its position in the musical scale. This helps in calculating the distance between notes easily.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is computed using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n3. **Permutation Check**: By generating all permutations of the three notes, we ensure that every possible ordering is checked to determine if it fits the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n4. **Efficiency**: The approach efficiently checks all possible orderings using permutations, ensuring that we correctly identify the type of triad or determine if it is neither.\n\nThis solution ensures that we accurately classify the given triad by considering all possible orderings and leveraging modular arithmetic for distance calculations.",
