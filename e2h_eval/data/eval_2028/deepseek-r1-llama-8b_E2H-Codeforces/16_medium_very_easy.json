Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Crazy Town,\" and from the description, it seems like it involves lines dividing a plane into regions, and moving between these regions with certain rules.\n\nHmm, the task is to find the minimum number of steps to get from the home block to the university block. Each step allows moving to an adjacent block that shares a border of non-zero length. So, the key here is understanding how the lines partition the plane and how the points lie in relation to these lines.\n\nWait, but how do the lines affect the regions? Each line divides the plane into two parts. So, for each line, the home and university points will be on either side or the same side. If they are on the same side for all lines, then they are in the same region, right? But if they are on opposite sides for some lines, those lines contribute to the separation.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the arrangement could be more complex than that. Like, multiple lines can create a chessboard-like pattern where each line alternates the regions. So, perhaps the minimal steps required to move from one region to another is determined by the number of lines that separate the two points.\n\nWait, maybe that's the case. Because each such separating line would require crossing once, but perhaps not—maybe it's the count of lines that separate the two points, because each such line contributes to a boundary you have to cross.\n\nLet me think: For each line, determine whether the home and university are on different sides. Each such line would mean that you need to cross it to get from one region to another. But since the regions are divided by all the lines together, the minimal number of steps required would be equal to the number of such separating lines.\n\nBecause each time you cross a line, you move from one region to another. And the minimal path would involve crossing each separating line exactly once.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, the home is (1,1) and the university is (-1,-1). There are two roads:\n\nThe first road is 0x +1y +0 =0, which is the x-axis. Home is at (1,1), which is above the line. University is (-1,-1), which is also above the line? Wait, no, because substituting y=0: for home, y is 1>0, so it's above. For the university, y is -1 <0, so it's below. Oh wait, no, wait: the equation is y=0. So home is (1,1): when plugged into the line equation, 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1>0. So the line 0x +1y+0=0 is the x-axis, and the home is above it, the university is below it.\n\nWait, but wait, wait: the home is (1,1), which is above the x-axis, and the university is (-1,-1), which is below the x-axis. So for this line, they are on opposite sides. So that's one separating line.\n\nThen the second line is 1x +0y -3=0. So x=3. Home is at x=1, which is less than 3, so plugging into the equation: 1*1 +0*1 -3 = -2 <0. So home is on one side. The university is at x=-1, so 1*(-1) +0*(-1) -3 =-4 <0. So both are on the same side. So this line doesn't separate them.\n\nSo the total number of separating lines is 1. But according to the sample output, the answer is 2 steps. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, wait the sample input has two test cases? Or perhaps I'm misreading the input structure.\n\nWait, looking back at the input given:\n\nIt says the following is a competitive programming problem, and the sample input is presented as:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Oh, perhaps the input is structured as follows: the first part is the home and university, then n roads, then for some reason, another pair of home and university. Or perhaps that's a mistake. Or maybe it's a typo in the way the user presented the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the actual input is three lines:\n\nFirst line: home coordinates.\n\nSecond line: university coordinates.\n\nThird line: n.\n\nThen n lines of roads.\n\nSo, perhaps the sample input is:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nAnd the output is 2 steps for both home to university and university to home? Or perhaps it's a mistake in the way the sample is presented.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is that there are two test cases? Like, the first case is home at (1,1), university at (-1,-1), and two roads; the second case is same home and university, but three roads. Hmm, but the output is two 2s. So in both cases, the answer is 2 steps.\n\nBut why? Because in the first case, with two roads, the two points are separated by one line, but the answer is 2 steps. So that suggests that my initial thought was wrong.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal steps are not just the number of separating lines but something else. Maybe each line contributes a step, regardless of whether it's separating the points.\n\nWait, let's think again. Suppose we have multiple lines. Each line creates a boundary between regions. So, the number of lines that separate the two points might not directly give the steps. Because each step can cross multiple lines if they are arranged in a way that allows it.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of lines that separate the two points. Because each such line must be crossed once.\n\nIn the sample input, there are two roads. The home and university are separated by one line (the x-axis). So why is the answer 2 steps?\n\nWait, perhaps the home and university are on the same side for some lines, but on different sides for others. So the number of lines that separate them is the number of times their positions differ across all lines.\n\nIn the sample, the two lines: the first separates them, the second doesn't. So total 1 line. But the answer is 2 steps. So that can't be the case.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal steps are equal to the number of lines that separate the points plus 1? No, because in that case, 1+1=2, which matches the sample.\n\nBut wait, what about another example. Suppose we have three lines that all separate the points. Then the steps would be 3. So, the minimal steps would be equal to the number of separating lines.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit the sample. So I must be missing something.\n\nAlternative approach: model the problem as a graph where each region is a node, and edges connect regions that are adjacent. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home's region to the university's region. But considering that the number of regions can be up to 2^n, which for n=300 is way too big, this approach is computationally impossible.\n\nSo, this approach won't work. Need a smarter way.\n\nAnother idea: Since the lines are infinite, each new line can divide existing regions into two. So the arrangement of the lines forms a planar graph where each face is a region.\n\nBut again, for n=300, it's impossible to represent all regions.\n\nWait, but perhaps the regions can be represented by the signs of the expressions for each line. For example, each region can be characterized by a vector indicating whether, for each line, the point is on the positive side or negative side.\n\nBut wait, for each line, a point is either on the positive side, zero (on the line), or negative. But since the home and university are not on any line, for each line, the home and university have a definite sign.\n\nThus, the minimal steps required is equal to the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides. Because each such line must be crossed once.\n\nWait, but in the sample, that's only one line. So why the answer is 2 steps.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement. Let me re-read it.\n\nProblem statement says: In one step, you can move from one block to another if the length of their common border is nonzero. So, a single line's intersection may not allow movement unless there's a shared border.\n\nWait, perhaps each step can cross multiple lines. So, the minimal number of steps is not necessarily equal to the number of separating lines, but perhaps the number of times the direction changes.\n\nWait, maybe it's the number of lines that separate the points, but each step can cross multiple lines, but each line can only be crossed once.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps are determined by the number of lines that separate the two points, because each such line must be crossed once, and the order can be arranged so that each step crosses one line.\n\nWait, but in the sample, that would imply 1 step, but the answer is 2. So perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal steps are equal to the number of separating lines plus one, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps are the number of separating lines, but each step can cross multiple lines if the lines are concurrent. But in reality, each step can only cross one line, because each step moves through a border between two regions. So, each step can only cross one line.\n\nWait, but the problem says that in one step, you can move to an adjacent block if their border has non-zero length. So, each step can cross one line.\n\nSo, the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of lines that separate the two points.\n\nBut in the sample, that would be 1, but the output is 2.\n\nSo, I'm confused. Maybe I'm miscalculating the sample.\n\nLet me re-examine the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0 → line is y=0.\n\n1 0 0 → line is x=3.\n\nSo, for the home (1,1): substituting into the first line, 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1>0 → positive side.\n\nUniversity (-1,-1): substituting, 0*(-1) +1*(-1)+0 = -1 <0 → negative side.\n\nSo, for the first line, they are on opposite sides.\n\nFor the second line: 1*x +0*y +0=0 → x=0. Home is (1,1), so 1*1 +0 +0 =1>0. University is (-1,-1): 1*(-1) +0 +0 =-1<0. So both are on opposite sides.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, for both lines, the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nAh! That's the key. So, in the sample, both lines separate the two points.\n\nSo, the number of separating lines is 2, hence the minimal steps are 2.\n\nThat makes sense now.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each line, check whether the home and university are on opposite sides. The count of such lines is the minimal number of steps needed.\n\nBecause each such line must be crossed exactly once to move from one region to another.\n\nThus, the algorithm is straightforward:\n\n1. For each of the n lines, compute the value of a*x + b*y + c for the home and university.\n\n2. For each line, check if the signs of these two values are different.\n\n3. Count the number of lines where the signs differ.\n\n4. Output that count as the minimal steps.\n\nBecause each such line must be crossed once, and each step can cross one line.\n\nSo, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nFor each of the next n lines:\n\n   Read a, b, c.\n\n   Compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n\n   Compute s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n\n   If s1 * s2 < 0, increment the count.\n\nFinally, output the count.\n\nYes, that should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: All lines separate the points.\n\nE.g., n=300, and for each line, home and university are on opposite sides. Then, the answer is 300.\n\nEdge Case 2: None of the lines separate the points.\n\nE.g., home and university are on the same side for all lines. Then, answer is 0.\n\nEdge Case 3: One line separates them, others don't.\n\nAnswer is 1.\n\nAnother Edge Case: Zero lines separate them. Answer is 0.\n\nSo, the code needs to correctly handle these.\n\nImplementation-wise, the code needs to read the lines correctly.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the input is read as strings, so for each line, after reading, split into a, b, c.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead home_x, home_y.\n\nRead uni_x, uni_y.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    s1 = a * home_x + b * home_y + c\n\n    s2 = a * uni_x + b * uni_y + c\n\n    if (s1 > 0 and s2 < 0) or (s1 < 0 and s2 > 0):\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that's the code.\n\nTesting it against the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0 → line y=0.\n\nCompute s1: 0*1 +1*1 +0=1>0.\n\ns2:0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0= -1<0 → different signs. count +=1.\n\nNext line:1 0 0 → x=0.\n\ns1:1*1 +0 +0=1>0.\n\ns2:1*(-1)+0 +0= -1<0 → different signs. count +=1.\n\nTotal count is 2. Output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code works for the sample.\n\nAnother test case: when home and uni are on same side for all lines.\n\nSuppose home is (1,1), uni is (2,2), and lines are such that for each line, both are on same side. Then count is 0.\n\nAnother case: home is (1,1), uni is (2,3), and for one line, they are on opposite sides. Then count is 1.\n\nSo, the code should handle all these.\n\nI think this approach is correct.\n",
