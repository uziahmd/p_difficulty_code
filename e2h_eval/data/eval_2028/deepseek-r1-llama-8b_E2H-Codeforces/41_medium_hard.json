There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about maximizing profit by building houses on a street with certain restrictions. \n\nAlright, let me read the problem statement carefully again. So, there are n spots on the street where each house can be built with a height between 0 and h. Each spot contributes a squared value equal to the height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in the range from l_i to r_i (inclusive), the tallest house must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit.\n\nHmm. So, the constraints are that for each of the m ranges, the maximum height in that range doesn't exceed x_i. And I want to assign heights to each spot such that all these constraints are satisfied, and the sum of squares is as large as possible.\n\nThe input gives n, h, m, followed by m lines each with l_i, r_i, x_i. The output should be the maximum possible sum of squares.\n\nSo, how do I model this? It feels like a dynamic programming problem or maybe using some kind of constraints satisfaction approach. Since n and m are up to 50, which is manageable, perhaps a DP approach is feasible.\n\nLet me think about the possible approaches.\n\nOne way is to model the problem by considering each spot and the constraints that affect it. But the constraints can overlap, making it tricky. For example, a single spot might be covered by multiple restrictions.\n\nWait, but each restriction applies to a range, and the maximum in that range must be <= x_i. So, for a particular spot, say position k, all restrictions that include k in their [l_i, r_i] range impose that the height at k cannot exceed the minimum of all x_i's for those restrictions. Because if any of those restrictions requires that the max in the range is <= x_i, then the height at k can't be higher than x_i for that particular restriction. So, the effective maximum height for position k is the minimum x_j across all restrictions that include k in their range. Additionally, the height can't exceed h.\n\nSo, for each spot, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of all x_i's for the restrictions that cover it, or h if none. Wait, no: because the restrictions are about the maximum in the range, not individual spots. So, for a spot k, the maximum height allowed is determined by the minimum x_i among all restrictions that include k in their [l_i, r_i]. Because if any restriction includes k and has x_i less than others, then the max allowed at k must be <= x_i, hence the min over all x_i's.\n\nAh, right. So for each spot, the maximum possible height is the minimum of x_i for all restrictions that include it, and h. But wait, some spots may not be covered by any restriction, so their maximum is h.\n\nSo, for each spot i, the maximum height allowed is min{ x_j | j is a restriction covering i } ∪ h. If there are no such x_j's, then it's h.\n\nBut wait, that's only part of the story. Because the problem is not just about each spot individually, but about ranges. Because the constraints are on the maximum within a range. So, for example, even if a spot is allowed up to x_j, but in a larger range, the maximum could be lower than x_j.\n\nSo, it's more complex than just setting each spot's maximum; the constraints can interact. So, this suggests that it's not sufficient to just consider each spot's maximum based on overlapping restrictions. Because when you have overlapping ranges, the maximum in a larger range depends on the maxima of smaller ranges within it.\n\nHmm. So, for instance, imagine two overlapping restrictions. One is [1-3], x=5, and another is [2-4], x=3. Then, in the first spot (1), the max is 5, but in spot 2, the max is min(5,3) = 3. Similarly for spot 3, it's 3. But for spot 4, since it's included in the second restriction, its max is 3. However, the overall max in [2-4] is 3, but the first spot is 5, which doesn't affect the second spot.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the first scenario, the first restriction allows the entire [1-3] to have max 5. But the second restriction limits [2-4] to have max 3. So, spot 2's height is at most 3, which also affects the max in the first restriction, because the first restriction's max is the maximum of spots 1-3. So, spot 2's height being 3 would mean that the first restriction's max is 5 (if spot 1 is 5) or 3 (if spot 1 is 3). So, the constraints can't be handled independently because they affect each other.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach of considering each spot's maximum based on the min x_i of its restrictions is insufficient because the constraints are interdependent.\n\nThis makes the problem more challenging.\n\nSo, what's the correct way to model this?\n\nI think we need to model the problem as a set of constraints where for each interval [l_i, r_i], the maximum of the heights in that interval is <= x_i.\n\nOur task is to assign a height a_j to each spot j, such that for every restriction i, max(a_l ... a_r) <= x_i. Also, each a_j <= h, and a_j >= 0.\n\nWe need to maximize the sum of a_j^2.\n\nHmm. Now, given that n and m are small (up to 50), perhaps a dynamic programming approach is feasible.\n\nBut how to model the state? Because the constraints are on ranges, the state needs to track enough information to ensure that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem using a graph where each node represents the current spot and the maximum allowed height for the previous spots. But I'm not sure how that would work.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model the problem as an integer linear programming problem, but that's probably not feasible for code.\n\nAlternatively, since the constraints are on ranges, perhaps we can model the problem as a series of intervals, each with their own maximum, and find a way to satisfy all of them.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to represent the problem as a set of intervals, each of which must have their maximum <= x_i. So, the problem is to find a set of heights a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that for each interval [l_i, r_i], the maximum of a_l_i ... a_r_i is <= x_i, and each a_j <= h. Then, maximize the sum of squares.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of scheduling with interval constraints, but here the constraints are on the maximum in a range.\n\nI recall that this type of problem can be approached using dynamic programming, but the state needs to capture enough information about the current position and the maximums of the relevant intervals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this using the concept of \"maximum allowed up to each point\". But I'm not exactly sure.\n\nAnother idea: for each spot i, determine the earliest restriction that affects it. Or, perhaps, for each spot, the maximum height allowed is determined by the minimum x_i of all restrictions that include it, but also considering that in the case of overlapping restrictions, the maxima of the ranges must be considered.\n\nWait, perhaps the constraints can be represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where each node represents a spot and the maximum allowed height up to that point. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using a priority queue of constraints, but again, I'm not seeing it clearly.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. What if we model the problem by processing each spot and keeping track of the maximum allowed height in the current segment. Then, for each spot, we can choose a height, and update the maximum for the segments that include this spot.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the problem as follows:\n\nEach restriction is a constraint on a range [l_i, r_i], which requires that the maximum in that range is <= x_i. So, for all j in [l_i, r_i], a_j <= x_i. Because the maximum can't exceed any of the a_j's. So, for each restriction, all a_j's in its range must be <= x_i.\n\nWait, is that correct? No. Because the maximum of the range is the maximum of all a_j's in that range. So, for a restriction [l, r, x], the maximum a_j for j in [l, r] must be <= x. Which implies that each a_j in [l, r] can be at most x, but it's possible that some are less than x as long as the maximum is <= x.\n\nWait, no. For example, if a_j is 5 and x is 6, then the maximum is 5 which is <= 6, so it's okay. So, each a_j in [l, r] can be up to x_i, but the maximum must be <= x_i.\n\nSo, each a_j in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i, because otherwise the maximum would exceed x_i. So, yes, for each restriction, all a_j in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i.\n\nAh! So, this is a crucial insight. For each restriction i, all a_j in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. Because if any a_j in that range is >x_i, then the maximum is >x_i, violating the restriction.\n\nTherefore, each a_j must be <= the minimum x_i among all restrictions that include j in their range, as well as <=h. Because each a_j is constrained by all the restrictions that cover it.\n\nSo, for each j, the maximum possible a_j is the minimum of h and all x_i where restriction i covers j. If j is not covered by any restriction, then a_j can be up to h.\n\nThis simplifies the problem because now, each a_j is bounded by certain values, and the constraints are that for each restriction, all a_j in its range are <= x_i. But wait, is that all?\n\nWait, no. Because a_j can be up to the min of all x_i's for the restrictions that cover j, but in a way that for any restriction i, all a_j in [l_i, r_i] are <=x_i. So, the earlier conclusion holds: each a_j is bounded by the minimum x_i among all restrictions that include j, and also by h.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to assigning a_j to be as large as possible, subject to a_j <= min{x_i | i covers j} and a_j <=h.\n\nBut wait, does that ensure that all restrictions are satisfied? Because each restriction i requires that all a_j in [l_i, r_i] are <=x_i, and the a_j's are already bounded by the min x_i's of their own covering restrictions. So, if a_j is <= the min x_i for all i covering j, then for any i, the a_j in [l_i, r_i] are <=x_i.\n\nWait, yes. Because for any restriction i, any j in [l_i, r_i] is covered by i, so a_j <=x_i. So, the maximum in [l_i, r_i] will be <=x_i.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to determining, for each spot j, the maximum allowed a_j, which is the minimum of all x_i for restrictions that cover j, and h. Then, the sum of squares is maximized when each a_j is as high as possible.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because if two restrictions overlap, the maximum allowed a_j could be determined by both, but the earlier conclusion suggests that the constraints are automatically satisfied as long as each a_j is <= the minimum x_i for its covering restrictions.\n\nSo, for example, suppose we have two overlapping restrictions: [1-3, x=5] and [2-4, x=3]. For spot 2, the maximum a_j is min(5,3) =3. For spot 3, it's also 3. For spot 1, it's min(5) =5 (since it's only covered by the first restriction). But the second restriction requires that in [2-4], all a_j's are <=3, which they are. So, the first restriction's [1-3] has a maximum of 5, which is allowed because the restriction was x=5. So, all constraints are satisfied.\n\nYes, that seems to work. So, the initial approach is correct: each a_j is bounded by the minimum x_i of all restrictions that cover j, and by h. So, the maximum a_j is min(h, min_{i: j in [l_i, r_i]} x_i).\n\nThus, the problem becomes: assign a_j to be as high as possible, given that for each j, a_j is min(h, min x_i of covering restrictions), and then compute the sum of squares.\n\nWait, but wait! What if two restrictions partially overlap? Like, [1-3, x=5] and [2-2, x=3]. For spot 2, the min x_i is 3, so a_2 is 3. But the first restriction's x_i is 5, so spot 2 is allowed to be 3. The second restriction requires that a_2 <=3, which it is. So, the first restriction's maximum is 5, which is allowed because x_i is 5.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the maximum of [1-3] is 5, which is allowed because the first restriction's x_i is 5. So, everything is fine.\n\nSo, in this case, the approach works.\n\nBut wait, another example: Suppose we have two overlapping restrictions [1-3, x=4] and [2-4, x=3]. Then, for spot 2, the min x_i is 3. So, a_2 can be 3. For spot 3, min x_i is 3. So, a_3 is 3. For spot 1, min x_i is 4, so a_1 can be 4. But then, the second restriction's [2-4] has a maximum of 3, which is allowed. So, all constraints are satisfied.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for each spot j, a_j can be as high as the minimum of h and all x_i for the restrictions that cover j. Because that ensures that all restrictions are satisfied.\n\nWait, but is that sufficient? Are there cases where this isn't sufficient?\n\nWait, suppose we have two overlapping restrictions where one is entirely contained within another. For example, [1-4, x=5] and [2-3, x=3]. Then, for spot 2, the min x_i is 3, so a_2 is 3. Spot 3 is min(3,5) =3. Spot 4 is only covered by the first restriction, so a_4 can be 5. But the second restriction [2-3] has a maximum of 3, which is allowed. The first restriction has a maximum of 5, which is allowed. So, everything is fine.\n\nAnother example: [1-2, x=5], [2-2, x=3], [3-3, x=4]. Then, a_1 is 5, a_2 is 3, a_3 is 4. All constraints are satisfied.\n\nSo, in all these cases, the approach works.\n\nWait, but what about a case where a spot is covered by multiple overlapping restrictions, and their x_i's are varying. For example:\n\nRestriction 1: [1-4, x=10]\n\nRestriction 2: [2-3, x=5]\n\nRestriction 3: [3-4, x=8]\n\nThen, for spot 2, the min x_i is 5.\n\nSpot 3: min(5,8) =5.\n\nSpot 4: min(10,8) =8.\n\nSo, a_1 is 10, a_2 is 5, a_3 is5, a_4 is8.\n\nNow, let's check the constraints:\n\nRestriction 1: [1-4] has max a_1=10, which is <=10. Okay.\n\nRestriction 2: [2-3] has a_2=5 and a_3=5, max 5 <=5. Okay.\n\nRestriction 3: [3-4] has a_3=5, a_4=8. Max is8 <=8. Okay.\n\nAll constraints are satisfied.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in all these examples, the approach of setting a_j to min(h, min x_i for all restrictions covering j) works.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to compute for each spot j, the maximum allowed a_j, which is the minimum between h and the minimum x_i of all restrictions that cover j. Then, the sum of squares is the sum of (a_j)^2.\n\nWait, but is that always the case? Are there any cases where the constraints aren't satisfied even after setting a_j to min x_i for their covering restrictions?\n\nWait, suppose we have two restrictions:\n\nRestriction 1: [1-2, x=3]\n\nRestriction 2: [2-3, x=4]\n\nFor spot 2: min x_i is min(3,4) =3.\n\nSpot 1: x=3.\n\nSpot 3: x=4.\n\nSo, a_1=3, a_2=3, a_3=4.\n\nCheck constraints:\n\nRestriction 1: max(3,3) =3 <=3. Okay.\n\nRestriction 2: max(3,4) =4 <=4. Okay.\n\nYes, all constraints are satisfied.\n\nAnother test case: the example given in the problem.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n3 3 3\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1 1 1 --> covers spot 1.\n\n2 2 3 --> covers spot 2.\n\n3 3 2 --> covers spot 3.\n\nSo, for each spot:\n\nspot1: min(1, 3, 2) ? Wait, no. Because each restriction is processed for their x_i.\n\nWait, for spot 1, it's covered only by the first restriction, x=1. So a_1 can be 1.\n\nSpot 2: covered by second restriction, x=3. So a_2=3.\n\nSpot3: covered by third restriction, x=2. So a_3=2.\n\nSum is 1+9+4=14, which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example:\n\n4 10 2\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 --> covers spots 2 and 3.\n\n3 4 7 --> covers spots 3 and 4.\n\nSo, for each spot:\n\nspot1: no restrictions, so a_1=10.\n\nspot2: min(8) =8.\n\nspot3: min(8,7) =7.\n\nspot4: min(7) =7.\n\nSum is 100 +64 +49 +49= 262, which matches the sample.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: what if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions with varying x_i's.\n\nSuppose:\n\nn=2, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestriction 1: 1-2, x=5.\n\nRestriction 2: 1-2, x=8.\n\nSo, for spot1: min(5,8)=5.\n\nspot2: same.\n\nSo, a_1=5, a_2=5.\n\nSum is 25+25=50.\n\nBut what if the restrictions were:\n\nRestriction1: 1-1, x=3.\n\nRestriction2: 2-2, x=5.\n\nThen, spot1: 3, spot2:5.\n\nSum is 9+25=34.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, this approach seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nWait, but what about overlapping ranges where some x_i's are lower than others, but the overall maximum in the range is still allowed.\n\nLike, suppose:\n\nRestriction1: 1-3, x=5.\n\nRestriction2: 2-3, x=3.\n\nSo, for spots 2 and 3, their a_j is 3.\n\nSpot1: a_j=5.\n\nSo, the max in 1-3 is 5, which is allowed.\n\nIn 2-3, max is 3, which is allowed.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nFor each spot j, compute the minimum x_i among all restrictions that include j in their [l_i, r_i] range. Then, a_j is the minimum between this value and h.\n\nThe sum of squares of a_j's is the maximum possible profit.\n\nWait, but wait! Is that all? Because the constraints are on the maximum of a range, but the approach described is based on individual a_j's. But in reality, the maximum of a range is the maximum a_j in that range. So, by ensuring that each a_j is <= x_i for all restrictions i that include j, the maximum of any such range will be <=x_i.\n\nYes.\n\nBecause, for any restriction i, any j in [l_i, r_i], a_j <=x_i. Therefore, the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is <=x_i, which satisfies the restriction.\n\nThus, the approach is correct.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each spot j (from 1 to n), collect all the x_i from restrictions that include j.\n\n2. For each j, compute the minimum x_i in this collection. Let's call this min_x[j].\n\n3. a_j is min(min_x[j], h). Because h is the maximum possible height.\n\n4. Sum a_j squared for all j.\n\nWait, but why is step 3 necessary? Because min_x[j] could be greater than h. For example, if a restriction has x_i=20, but h is 10. So, a_j can't be more than 10. So, step 3 takes the minimum between min_x[j] and h.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the algorithm is straightforward.\n\nBut wait, how to efficiently compute min_x[j] for each j?\n\nWe can represent the restrictions as a list. For each j from 1 to n, iterate through all m restrictions, and collect x_i if l_i <=j <=r_i. Then, take the min of those x_i's.\n\nThat's O(n*m) time, which is acceptable for n and m up to 50.\n\nOnce we have min_x for each j, compute a_j as min(min_x[j], h).\n\nSum the squares.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nFor each j from 1 to n, compute min_x[j] as the minimum x_i among all restrictions that cover j.\n\nCompute a_j = min(min_x[j], h).\n\nSum a_j^2.\n\nPrint the sum.\n\nWait, but wait, in the sample input, the second line is '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7', which is two restrictions.\n\nFor j=1: no restrictions. So min_x[1] is infinity or something, but since no restrictions, min_x[1] is undefined. So, a_1 is h=10.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, for j=2: covered by first restriction (x=8). So a_2=8.\n\nj=3: covered by both restrictions (x=8 and x=7). So min is7.\n\nj=4: covered by second restriction, x=7.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nSo, the code is simple.\n\nNow, in Python, let's think about implementing this.\n\nWe can represent the restrictions as a list of tuples. For each j from 1 to n, initialize min_val as h, then for each restriction, check if j is in [l_i, r_i]. If so, compare min_val with x_i, and take the minimum.\n\nWait, no. For each j, for all restrictions that include j, collect the x_i, and find the min among them.\n\nSo, for each j in 1..n:\n\nmin_xj = min( x_i for i in 0..m-1 if l_i <=j <= r_i )\n\nIf no such i exists, min_xj is h.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append( (l, r, x) )\n\nmin_x = [h+1]*(n+1)  # assuming 1-based indexing\n\nfor j in range(1, n+1):\n    min_val = h\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        if l <= j <= r:\n            if x < min_val:\n                min_val = x\n    min_x[j] = min_val\n\nsum_sq = 0\nfor j in range(1, n+1):\n    sum_sq += (min_x[j]) **2\n\nprint(sum_sq)\n\nWait, but wait: in the code above, min_val is initialized as h, and for each restriction that covers j, it's compared with x. So, the min_val is the minimum between the current min_val and x. So, for j not covered by any restrictions, min_val remains h, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nFor j=1:\n\nonly restriction 1 applies, x=1. min_val is 1.\n\nj=2: restriction 2, x=3. min_val is3.\n\nj=3: restriction3, x=2.\n\nSo, a_j's are 1,3,2. Sum is 1+9+4=14.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nFor j=1: no restrictions. min_val remains 10.\n\nj=2: restriction1, x=8.\n\nj=3: min(8,7)=7.\n\nj=4: restriction2, x=7.\n\nSo, a_j's are 10,8,7,7. Sum is 100+64+49+49= 262.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, h=5, m=2.\n\nRestriction1: 1-2, x=3.\n\nRestriction2: 1-2, x=8.\n\nFor j=1: min(3,8) is 3.\n\nj=2: same.\n\na_j's are 3,3. Sum is 18.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, h=5, m=1.\n\nRestriction: 1-2, x=4.\n\nSo, j=1: x=4, j=2: x=4.\n\na_j's are 4,4.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street with given constraints. Each house can be built at a certain height, and each height contributes to the profit as the square of its height. The challenge is to respect all zoning restrictions which limit the maximum height in specific ranges.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Constraints**: Each restriction specifies a range [l_i, r_i] and a maximum height x_i. For any house built within this range, its height must not exceed x_i.\n2. **Determine Maximum Height for Each Spot**: For each spot, the maximum allowed height is determined by the minimum x_i value among all restrictions that include this spot. If a spot is not covered by any restriction, it can be as high as h.\n3. **Calculate Profit**: Once the maximum height for each spot is determined, compute the total profit by summing the squares of these heights.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n\nmin_x = [h] * (n + 1)  # Using 1-based indexing\n\nfor j in range(1, n + 1):\n    current_min = h\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        if l <= j <= r:\n            if x < current_min:\n                current_min = x\n    min_x[j] = current_min\n\ntotal = 0\nfor j in range(1, n + 1):\n    total += min_x[j] ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of spots, maximum height, and number of restrictions. Each restriction is stored as a tuple.\n2. **Compute Minimum x for Each Spot**: For each spot, iterate over all restrictions to find the minimum x_i value that applies to that spot. This ensures that the height does not violate any restriction.\n3. **Calculate Total Profit**: Sum the squares of the maximum allowed heights for each spot to get the total profit.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that each spot's height is maximized while respecting all zoning restrictions. The solution is optimal and runs in O(n*m) time, which is efficient given the problem constraints.",
