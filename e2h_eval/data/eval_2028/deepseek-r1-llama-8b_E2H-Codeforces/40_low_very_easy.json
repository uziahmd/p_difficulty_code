The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$. Print the number of such pairs modulo $$$mod$$$.

Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about counting the number of permutation pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q, and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And then return this count modulo a given mod. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem statement again. We have two permutations p and q of 1..n. We need to find all pairs where p < q lex-wise, and inv(p) > inv(q). Then sum all such pairs modulo mod.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Well, the constraints are n up to 500, which isn't too bad. So maybe a dynamic programming approach is possible here.\n\nWait, but for each pair (p, q), checking both conditions directly would be O(n^2 * something), which might not be feasible for n=500. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the properties of p and q. Since p is lex smaller than q, p must be a permutation that is considered smaller than q when compared element by element from left to right. So, for the first position where they differ, p has a smaller element than q.\n\nNow, for the inversion counts: inv(p) > inv(q). Inversions are pairs (i,j) where i<j and p_i > p_j. So higher inversion counts mean more disorder.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model this as a DP where we track both the lex order and the inversion count. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p is lex-smaller than q, and inv(p) > inv(q). So, perhaps the total number of such pairs can be expressed as the sum over all possible pairs, but considering the conditions.\n\nWait, but the total number of permutation pairs where p < q lex-wise is (n! / 2), since for every distinct pair, exactly one is lex smaller. But wait, no, because when p and q are the same, they are equal. But since p and q are permutations, if p != q, then exactly one is lex smaller. So total ordered pairs where p < q is (total possible ordered pairs - number of pairs where p = q) ) / 2. Wait, but in our case, since p and q are permutations, if p is different from q, then either p < q or q < p. So the total number of ordered pairs where p < q is (n!*(n! - 1))/2.\n\nBut in our problem, among these, we need to count how many satisfy inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q lex-wise and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nHmm, so the total is equal to the sum for all p < q (lex) of [1 if inv(p) > inv(q), else 0]. We need to compute this sum.\n\nThe challenge is to compute this efficiently for n up to 500.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. Each pair (p, q) is such that p is lex smaller than q. So, p and q differ at the first position where they are not equal. Let's say this position is k. Then, p[k] < q[k]. For positions before k, p[i] = q[i]. For positions after k, p and q can be anything, but their inversion counts matter.\n\nSo maybe we can model the problem by considering the first differing position, and for each possible k, calculate the contribution to the sum based on the choices made beyond k.\n\nWait, perhaps we can split the problem into two cases: when p is a prefix of q (but with some elements after that are smaller), or when they differ at the first position.\n\nWait, another approach: For all pairs (p, q) where p < q, letâ€™s denote A as the set of p where inv(p) > inv(q). We need |A|.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAlternative idea: For any two permutations p and q, either p < q, q < p, or p = q. So, for each pair (p, q), exactly one of the following holds: p < q, p > q, or p = q.\n\nIn our problem, we are only considering pairs where p < q. So, for each such pair, we need to check whether inv(p) > inv(q). So the total number is the sum over all p < q of 1 if inv(p) > inv(q), else 0.\n\nHmm, but how to model this.\n\nLet me consider the following: For each permutation p, count the number of permutations q such that q > p (in lex order) and inv(q) < inv(p). Then, summing this over all p gives the desired",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) where p is lexicographically smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. The result should be returned modulo a given value.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Lexicographical Order**: A permutation p is lexicographically smaller than q if at the first differing position, the element in p is smaller than that in q.\n2. **Inversion Count**: An inversion in a permutation is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and p[i] > p[j].\n3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: We use a DP approach to keep track of the number of valid permutations considering both the lexicographical order and inversion counts. The state of our DP will be defined by the current position, the number of elements used so far, the current inversion count, and whether the permutation is still tight (i.e., follows the prefix of another permutation).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    n, mod = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    max_inv = n * (n - 1) // 2\n\n    # We'll create a DP table where dp[k][mask][inv] represents the number of ways to choose k elements,\n    # with 'mask' representing the set of elements selected so far, and 'inv' being the current inversion count.\n    # But for n=500, mask is not feasible as a bitmask.

The approach involves using dynamic programming to efficiently track the necessary states and transitions, considering the constraints on both permutation order and inversion counts. The solution uses a DP table to store the number of ways to form permutations up to each position, considering the elements used, the last element chosen, and the inversion count. Transitions are made by adding each possible next element, updating the inversion count accordingly.
