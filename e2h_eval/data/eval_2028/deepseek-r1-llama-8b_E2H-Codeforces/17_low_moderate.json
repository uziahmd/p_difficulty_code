He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Prefixes and Suffixes.\" Hmm, Ivan has a string s of length n, and I don't know it. He tells me all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so lengths from 1 to n-1). But he doesn't say which are which—whether they're prefixes or suffixes. My task is to determine for each of the 2n-2 given strings whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the actual string s.\n\nWait, the output is a string of 'P's and 'S's where each character corresponds to one of the input strings. So for each input string, I need to decide if it's a prefix (mark as P) or a suffix (mark as S).\n\nThe first thing I need to figure out is how to determine, for each possible string in the input, whether it's a prefix, a suffix, or both. Because some strings could be both a prefix and a suffix of the original string s.\n\nBut since the input is given as a list of 2n-2 strings, each of length from 1 to n-1, and exactly two of each length, but without knowing which are prefixes and which are suffixes, I need to find a way to assign P or S to each string based on the constraints that the entire string s must have those as its proper prefixes and suffixes.\n\nSo, how can I model this? Let's think about the structure of s. For example, let's say s is 'ababa' with n=5. Then the proper prefixes are 'a', 'ab', 'aba', 'abab', and the proper suffixes are 'b', 'ba', 'bab', 'baba'. Wait, but in the example given, the output was 'SPPSPSPS'—but wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh right, the sample input had multiple cases, so perhaps the approach should work for any such string.\n\nHmm, the key here is to find the correct string s that satisfies all the given prefix and suffix conditions. Once I have that, for each input string, I can check whether it's a prefix of s (and thus mark 'P') or a suffix (mark 'S').\n\nBut how do I reconstruct s? Because s is built from the prefixes and suffixes, perhaps by overlapping them. For example, the longest prefix might also be the longest suffix except for the last character.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is guaranteed to form some string of length n. So, the given 2n-2 strings are exactly the set of all prefixes and suffixes of length 1 to n-1. So, for each string in the input, it's either a prefix or a suffix, but not necessarily both.\n\nWait, no: a string could be both a prefix and a suffix. Like, for s = 'aaa', the prefix 'a' is also a suffix. So, in that case, the same string serves as both a prefix and a suffix.\n\nSo, the approach I think is:\n\n1. Find the correct string s. Because once s is known, for each input string, it's easy to check whether it's a prefix or a suffix.\n\nBut the problem is that there might be multiple possible s strings that satisfy the input. However, the output only needs to assign P or S correctly for the given input, as long as there exists at least one s that fits.\n\nWait, but how do I find s? Because s is determined by the prefixes and suffixes provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the possible s by considering the overlaps between the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nLet me think: the string s must start with some prefix and end with some suffix. The prefixes are the given strings of various lengths, and the suffixes are the others.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to find the minimal possible s that can be formed by combining the longest common suffix of some prefix and suffix.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nFirst, group the input strings by their lengths. For each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two strings: one is a prefix candidate, and the other is a suffix candidate.\n\nBut wait, no. Because for each l, the two strings could be either both prefixes, both suffixes, or one a prefix and the other a suffix.\n\nNo, because the problem statement says that the input contains all the improper prefixes and suffixes. So for each l, exactly two strings are present: one is a prefix, another is a suffix. Or perhaps, one is a prefix, another is a suffix, but they could be the same string.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, in the second sample input, n=3. The input is '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na'. So, grouping by length 1: two 'a's.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether each of the given strings is a prefix or a suffix of the original string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves reconstructing the original string `s` and then checking each input string against `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Strings by Length**: First, group all the input strings by their lengths. This helps in identifying which strings could be prefixes and which could be suffixes.\n2. **Determine the Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest prefix will also be the longest suffix except for the last character. This gives us a way to construct the original string `s`.\n3. **Reconstruct the String `s`**: Using the information from the longest prefix and suffix, we can build the original string `s`. This is done by checking the overlap between the longest prefix and suffix.\n4. **Classify Each Input String**: Once `s` is reconstructed, classify each input string as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') based on whether it matches the start or end of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nstrings = [input().strip() for _ in range(2 * n - 2)]\n\n# Group strings by their lengths\nlength_to_strings = {}\nfor s in strings:\n    l = len(s)\n    if l not in length_to_strings:\n        length_to_strings[l] = []\n    length_to_strings[l].append(s)\n\n# Find the maximum possible prefix and suffix\nmax_len = max(length_to_strings.keys())\n\n# The longest possible prefix is the one with max_len\nprefix_candidates = length_to_strings[max_len]\n# The longest possible suffix is the one that starts with the last character of the prefix\nsuffix_candidates = []\nfor s in length_to_strings[max_len]:\n    for suf in length_to_strings[n - len(s)]:\n        if s.endswith(suf[-1]):\n            suffix_candidates.append(suf)\n            break\n\n# Now, find the correct s\n# The correct prefix is the one that is the longest and is the same as the suffix's first part\ncorrect_prefix = None\nfor pre in prefix_candidates:\n    for suf in suffix_candidates:\n        if pre == suf[:len(pre)]:\n            correct_prefix = pre\n            correct_suffix = suf\n            break\n    if correct_prefix is not None:\n        break\n\n# Now, correct_prefix is the correct prefix, and correct_suffix is the correct suffix\n# s is correct_prefix + correct_suffix[1:]\ns = correct_prefix + correct_suffix[1:]\n\n# Now, for each string, determine if it's a prefix (P) or suffix (S)\nresult = []\nfor string in strings:\n    if string == s[:len(string)]:\n        result.append('P')\n    else:\n        result.append('S')\n\nprint(''.join(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Grouping by Length**: We group the input strings by their lengths to efficiently identify potential prefixes and suffixes.\n2. **Finding the Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest prefix will help us determine the start of the string `s`, while the longest suffix will help us determine the end. By checking the overlap between these, we can reconstruct `s`.\n3. **Reconstructing `s`**: Using the overlap between the longest prefix and suffix, we construct the original string `s`.\n4. **Classifying Strings**: Finally, we check each input string against `s` to determine if it is a prefix or suffix and build the result string accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly identify each string's role (prefix or suffix) based on the reconstructed original string `s`, providing an efficient and accurate solution to the problem.",
