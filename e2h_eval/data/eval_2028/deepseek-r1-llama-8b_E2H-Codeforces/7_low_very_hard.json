The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Rudolf and Snowflakes, hard version. Hmm. From the description, it's about determining whether a certain number of vertices can form a snowflake graph as defined.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step. \n\nThe snowflake is an undirected graph constructed in a specific way. Initially, there's one vertex. Then, each time, we add new vertices in a certain pattern. Each step involves taking a vertex that has only one edge (so degree 1) and connecting it to k new vertices. And this step must be done at least once. So the process goes like this:\n\n- Start with 1 node.\n- Add k children to it (so now total is 1 + k).\n- Then, for each of those k nodes, since each has degree 1, we add k children to each. So each of them becomes a parent to k new nodes. So the next step adds k*k nodes, making the total 1 + k + k^2.\n- This process can continue multiple times. So each iteration multiplies the number of nodes by k for each existing \"leaf\" node.\n\nWait, but the way it's described, each leaf (degree 1 node) gets expanded into k new nodes. So each expansion step increases the total nodes by k^m, where m is the number of leaves in the previous step.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The initial step after the first addition gives us 1 + k nodes. Then, each of the k nodes is expanded, adding k each, so total becomes 1 + k + k^2. Then, each of the k^2 nodes is expanded, adding k each, leading to 1 +k +k² +k³. And so on. But wait, the process can stop at any point, right? Because the definition says that the step should be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake has been built by expanding the root once. So the minimal n is 1 + k + k², but wait no— the minimal is when you do the expansion once. Wait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: The initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the initial step is adding k nodes, so 1 +k. Then, each of those k nodes is expanded once, each adding k, leading to 1 +k +k^2. So the minimal possible n is 1 +k +k². But wait, maybe the process stops after the first expansion. No, because the step is done at least once. So for example, if k=2, the minimal n is 1+2+4=7. Because after the initial step (adding 2), you have 3 nodes. Then you do the expansion step once, adding 4, making it 7.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial step is to add k new vertices to the single node. So the initial graph has 1 node. After first expansion, 1 +k nodes. Then, each of those k nodes is connected to k new ones. So each such node contributes k new nodes, so the next step adds k*k nodes. So the total after two steps is 1 +k +k². So the minimal n is 1 +k +k². Because the expansion step must be done at least once.\n\nWait, the problem says: each vertex connected by one edge (i.e., each leaf) is connected to k new nodes. And this step is done at least once. So the initial expansion (adding k) is the first step, then the expansion step is done once. So the minimal case is when the expansion step is done exactly once.\n\nWait, no. The initial step is adding k, which is the first expansion. Then, each of those k nodes undergoes expansion. So the minimal n is 1 +k +k².\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is part of the expansion process. So the entire process is: start with 1 node. Then perform some number of expansion steps, each of which adds layers. Each expansion step adds a layer where each current leaf is replaced by k new nodes.\n\nSo for example, if you do m expansion steps after the initial step, then the total nodes would be 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m. Because each expansion adds k^step nodes.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial step is adding k nodes (total 1 +k). Then each expansion step adds k^(step) nodes. So after m expansion steps, the total is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m}.\n\nBut according to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined. The snowflake graph is constructed by repeatedly expanding each leaf node (a node with only one edge) into \\( k \\) new nodes, starting from a single root node.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph grows in layers. The initial root node is expanded into \\( k \\) nodes, forming the first layer. Each subsequent layer expands each leaf node from the previous layer into \\( k \\) new nodes.\n2. **Mathematical Formulation**: The total number of nodes after \\( m \\) expansion steps (including the initial expansion) is given by the sum of a geometric series: \\( 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m \\). This can be expressed as \\( (k^{m+1} - 1) / (k - 1) \\) for \\( k > 1 \\).\n3. **Check Validity**: For a given \\( n \\), check if it can be expressed as \\( (k^{m+1} - 1) / (k - 1) \\) for some \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( m \\geq 1 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 3:\n        return False\n    # Check for possible k values up to cube root of n\n    max_k = int(n ** (1/3)) + 1\n    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        s = 0\n        current = 1\n        for m in range(1, 1000):  # m can't be too large since k^m would exceed n quickly\n            s += current\n            if s > n:\n                break\n            current *= k\n        if s == n:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    for i in range(1, t+1):\n        n = int(input[i])\n        if is_snowflake(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Checking Each Test Case**: For each test case, we check if the given \\( n \\) can form a valid snowflake graph.\n3. **Loop Through Possible k Values**: For each \\( k \\) from 2 up to the cube root of \\( n \\), we compute the sum of the geometric series to see if it matches \\( n \\).\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: The loop for \\( m \\) is limited to avoid excessive computation, leveraging the fact that \\( k^m \\) grows rapidly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible configurations of the snowflake graph for the given constraints.",
