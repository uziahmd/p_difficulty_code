    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The task is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about the examples they gave. For 'abcd', the output is 0. That makes sense because all substrings are unique since each character is different and the string isn't repeated anywhere. But for 'ababa', the output is 3. Oh right, because the substring 'aba' appears starting at index 0 and again at index 2. And they overlap by one character.\n\nSo how do I approach this? Well, the brute-force way would be to check all possible substrings, keep track of those we've seen, and then find the maximum length where a substring appears more than once.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum possible substring length? It's the length of the string minus one. Because the smallest possible substring is two identical characters. So for a string of length n, we can have substrings of lengths from 1 up to n-1.\n\nHmm, but checking all possible substrings might be computationally expensive, but given the constraints (string length up to 100), it's manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible substring lengths, starting from the largest possible down to 1.\n2. For each length l, generate all possible substrings of that length.\n3. Check if any substring appears more than once.\n4. As soon as we find such an l, return it as the answer.\n\nThis way, we can optimize by checking longer substrings first, so the first l we find that satisfies the condition is the maximum possible, and we can stop early.\n\nSo how do I implement this?\n\nI'll loop l from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n   for l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n       collect all substrings of length l\n       check if any substring occurs more than once.\n\nIf for a particular l, any substring appears more than once, return l as the answer.\n\nOtherwise, after checking all l's down to 1, return 0.\n\nBut wait, what about when the entire string is the same character, like 'zzz'? Then the substrings of length 2 are 'zz' appearing twice (indices 0-1 and 1-2). So the maximum is 2.\n\nSo the plan is solid.\n\nNow, how to generate all substrings of a certain length l. For each i from 0 to len(s) - l, take s[i:i+l]. Then store these in a set or something to quickly check for duplicates.\n\nWait, but using a set, if any substring is added that's already in the set, then we know there's a duplicate. Wait, no—because for a given l, we process all substrings, adding them to a set, and if during this process, a substring is found that's already in the set, then we can immediately return l.\n\nAlternatively, for each l, create a set. For each substring of length l, check if it's already in the set. If yes, return l. If not, add it to the set. After processing all substrings for this l, if no duplicates, proceed to l-1.\n\nYes, that sounds efficient.\n\nSo let's structure the code.\n\nFirst, read the input string.\n\nThen, for l in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n   create a set.\n   for i in 0 to len(s) - l:\n       current_sub = s[i:i+l]\n       if current_sub in set:\n           return l\n       else:\n           add current_sub to set.\n   continue.\n\nIf after all l's, nothing is found, return 0.\n\nWait, but len(s) is the total length. So for l starting from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n\nWait, no. For example, for a string of length 3, the maximum possible substring is 2 characters long, so l should go down to 1.\n\nSo initial l is len(s) - 1.\n\nWait, for a string like 'aaaaa', the maximum substring is 4, because 'aaaa' appears starting at 0 and 1.\n\nWait, no: for 'aaaaa', the substrings of length 4 are 'aaaa' (positions 0-3), 'aaaa' (positions 1-4). So yes, for l=4, it will detect a duplicate.\n\nSo the initial l should be len(s) - 1.\n\nSo in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\nmax_len = 0\nn = len(s)\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\n# If none found, return 0\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but wait. What about when l is 1? For example, if the string has all same characters, like 'aaa'. Then for l=2, the substrings are 'aa' and 'aa', which are duplicates. So the code would catch that and return 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'ababa' as in the sample. For l=3, substrings are 'aba' (i=0), 'bab' (i=1), 'aba' (i=2). So when i=2, substr 'aba' is added to the set. When i=0: added, i=1: added, i=2: already present, so return 3.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nWhat about the first sample input 'abcd'? For l=3, the substrings are 'abc', 'bcd'—no duplicates. l=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'—all unique. l=1: 'a','b','c','d'—unique. So returns 0.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaabb'. The longest possible substring is 'aabb', which appears at positions 0-3 and 4-7. So l=4.\n\nWait, but the code starts with l=7 (since n=8). Substrings of length 7: 'aabbaa' and 'bbaabb'—no duplicates. l=6: 'aabbaa', 'bbaabb'—no. l=5: 'aabba', 'bbaab', 'aabb'—no. l=4: 'aabb' (i=0), 'bbaa' (i=1), 'aabb' (i=4)—so when i=4, 'aabb' is already in the set, so returns 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nTest case: string of length 1. According to the problem statement, the string is non-empty. So for a single character, the output is 0.\n\nWait, the code will loop l from 0 (n-1=0) down to 1. So for n=1, the loop won't execute, and it will print 0. Correct.\n\nAnother edge case: all characters same. Like 'aaaaa'. The code returns 4, as expected.\n\nAnother case: 'abab'. The code for l=3: substrings 'aba' and 'bab'—no duplicates. l=2: 'ab', 'ba', 'ab'—so when i=0, add 'ab'; i=2, substr 'ab' is in the set, so returns 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nI think this approach is efficient enough for the constraints given (n=100), as the worst case is O(n^2) time, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the Python code would look like this.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Iterate Over Substring Lengths**: We start by checking the longest possible substrings first and work our way down to shorter ones. This ensures that we find the maximum length as quickly as possible.\n2. **Check for Duplicates**: For each substring length, generate all possible substrings of that length and check if any of them appear more than once using a set for efficient lookup.\n3. **Early Termination**: As soon as we find a substring that appears more than once, we return the current length as the result. If no such substring is found for any length, we return 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check each possible substring length and terminate early once the longest valid substring is found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n2. **Loop Through Lengths**: We loop from the longest possible substring length (n-1) down to 1.\n3. **Generate Substrings**: For each length, generate all substrings of that length and check if they have been seen before using a set.\n4. **Check for Duplicates**: If a substring is found in the set, print the current length and exit. If no duplicates are found for any length, print 0 after the loop completes.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that we find the longest repeating substring in optimal time.",
