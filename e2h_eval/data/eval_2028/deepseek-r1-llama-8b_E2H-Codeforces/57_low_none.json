His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem statement is a bit long, but let me try to break it down.\n\nThe problem is about Vasya's Olympiad results. We need to find the best and worst possible places he could have gotten based on his total points. Hmm.\n\nSo, the input gives us the number of participants (n) and the minimum points Vasya earned (x). Then two lines of n integers each: these are the points from the first and second tours for each participant, but not in any particular order. Oh right, because the lists are in arbitrary order.\n\nOur task is to determine the best possible rank Vasya could have and the worst possible rank. The ranks are determined by the sum of the two tours' points. If two participants have the same sum, the jury can arrange them in any order, so their ranks might be swapped, which affects Vasya's position.\n\nWait, no. Because when sums are equal, the participants can be ordered any way, meaning that in terms of ranking, they can be placed anywhere relative to each other. So for the best case, we can imagine that all participants with higher or equal sum than Vasya are ranked above him as much as possible, but for the worst case, we arrange things so that more participants are above or equal to Vasya, thus pushing him down.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the teacher knows that Vasya has at least x points in total. So his actual sum could be anything >=x. So to find the best possible place, we can assume that his sum is exactly x, and as high as possible in the rankings. For the worst possible, perhaps we can consider that his sum is exactly x, but arrange others in such a way that as many people as possible have sum >= x and are arranged before him, thus making his rank as bad as possible.\n\nWait, no. Wait, because Vasya's actual sum must be >=x. So to find the best possible rank, we can choose his sum to be as low as possible (exactly x), and then arrange others in such a way that as few as possible have a sum >=x, thus making him as high as possible.\n\nFor the worst case, we can arrange the other participants' sums such that as many as possible have a sum >=x, thus Vasya's rank would be as low as possible.\n\nHmm, okay. So how do we approach this?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. We need to compute for each participant their possible sum of a_i + b_j, but since the a's and b's are given in arbitrary order, we need to pair them optimally.\n\nWait, no. Because the a and b arrays are the first and second tour points for each participant, but the order is mixed. So for participant i, a_i is their first tour score, and b_i is their second tour score. But the lists are given in arbitrary order. So for example, a list [1,2] and b list [3,4] would mean that the first participant has 1+4=5, second has 2+3=5. Or maybe another way? Wait, no. Because the a's and b's are for the same set of participants. So the i-th element in a corresponds to the i-th participant's first tour score, and the j-th element in b corresponds to the j-th participant's second tour score. But the lists a and b are given in arbitrary orders. So for example, a = [a1, a2, a3], and b = [b1, b2, b3]. But the a's correspond to the first tour scores of each participant, and the b's correspond to the second tour scores of the same participants, but the order may be different. So for example, participant 1 has a1 points in the first tour and b3 in the second. Participant 2 has a2 and b2, etc.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem statement says: the second line contains n space-separated integers a1...an, which are the participants' points in the first tour. The third line contains b1...bn, which are the points in the second tour. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present, so there exists i,j where a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nSo the a array is the first tour points for all participants, but the order is arbitrary. Similarly for b. So the ith element in a is the first tour score of the ith participant, and the jth element in b is the second tour score of the jth participant. But the a and b arrays are not necessarily in the same order as each other.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because if a is the first tour scores and b is the second tour scores, but the a and b arrays are both lists of n elements",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The participants are ranked by their total points, and if two participants have the same total points, their order can be arbitrary.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We are given the points of each participant from two tours. The goal is to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya, knowing that his total points are at least `x`.\n\n2. **Optimal Pairing**: For each participant, their total points are the sum of their first tour points and second tour points. Since the lists of points from the two tours are given in arbitrary orders, we need to consider all possible pairings to determine the best and worst ranks.\n\n3. **Best Rank Calculation**: To get the best rank, we assume Vasya's total points are exactly `x`. We then calculate how many participants have a higher total than `x` and count how many participants could have the same total as `x` but might be placed above or below Vasya.\n\n4. **Worst Rank Calculation**: To get the worst rank, we also consider that Vasya's total points are exactly `x`, but we arrange the other participants' points such that as many as possible have a higher total than `x`, thus minimizing Vasya's rank.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Create all possible sums\nsums = []\nfor ai in a:\n    for bi in b:\n        sums.append(ai + bi)\n\n# Find all possible pairs (ai, bi) for each participant\npossible_pairs = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    possible_pairs.append((a[i], b[i]))\n\n# Best case: choose sums as low as possible for Vasya, others as high as possible\ndef best_rank():\n    # Assume Vasya has sum x\n    # How many participants have sum > x?\n    count_higher = 0\n    for s in sums:\n        if s > x:\n            count_higher += 1\n    # How many participants have sum == x?\n    count_equal = sums.count(x)\n    # The best rank is 1 + number of participants with sum > x\n    return 1 + count_higher\n\ndef worst_rank():\n    # Again, assume Vasya has sum x\n    # We want as many participants as possible to have sum >= x\n    # So, we arrange the sums in a way that maximizes the number of participants with sum > x\n    # Wait, but how? Because the participants' sums are determined by their a_i and b_j.\n    # Alternatively, we can compute for each participant if a_i + b_j >= x, but that's not directly applicable.\n    # Maybe the worst rank is determined by how many participants can have a sum greater than or equal to x.\n    # But since the participants' a and b are fixed, perhaps the worst rank is the position when all participants with sum > x are placed before Vasya, and those with sum == x are arranged after him.\n    # So, the worst rank would be the number of participants with sum > x + 1 (if Vasya is among those with sum == x).\n    # Alternatively, the worst rank is the maximum possible number of participants who can have a sum >= x and be placed before Vasya.\n    # Since the sums are fixed, the worst rank is the position where Vasya is placed last among those with sum >=x, and others are placed before him.\n    # So, count how many participants have sum >=x, and subtract 1 (since Vasya is one of them). Then add 1 because ranks start at 1.\n    count_ge = 0\n    for s in sums:\n        if s >= x:\n            count_ge +=1\n    # The worst rank is count_ge\n    return count_ge if x in sums else n+1  # Wait, no. Because Vasya is present, so x must be achievable.\n\nbest = best_rank()\nworst = worst_rank()\n\nprint(best, worst)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Best Rank Calculation**: We calculate how many participants have a total higher than `x`. The best rank is 1 plus this count because these participants will be ranked above Vasya.\n- **Worst Rank Calculation**: We count how many participants have a total greater than or equal to `x`. The worst rank is this count because Vasya can be placed last among those with totals >= `x`.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the best and worst possible ranks by leveraging the properties of sums and the constraints given.",
