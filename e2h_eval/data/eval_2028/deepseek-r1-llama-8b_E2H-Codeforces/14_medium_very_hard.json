    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about finding the number of positive integers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeros. And then I have to output all those n's in increasing order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n, because there are usually more 2s than 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is sum of n divided by 5, plus n divided by 25, and so on until n divided by 5^k is zero.\n\nSo, for example, for n=5: 5//5 =1, 5//25=0. So total 1 zero. For n=6, same as 5, since 6//5 is 1, 6//25 is 0. So 1 zero. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 5! is 120, which has one zero. 6! is 720, which also has one zero. Oh right, because 6 divided by 5 is 1, but 7,8,9 also divide by 5 once. So when m is 1, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9— five numbers. That's why the sample input '1' gives 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nSo the approach here is to find all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. Now, how do I find these n's efficiently?\n\nI think the way to do this is to find the smallest n such that the trailing zeros are >=m, and then check if that's exactly m. Because for each m, there's either a single n or a range of n's that give exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nWait, but for some m, there might be multiple n's. Like in the example, m=1 corresponds to n=5,6,7,8,9. Each of these n's will have exactly 1 trailing zero. So the number of solutions is 5.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For a given m, find the minimal n where trailing_zeros(n) == m.\n2. Then find the maximum n where trailing_zeros(n) == m.\n3. The count is (max_n - min_n + 1), and the numbers from min_n to max_n inclusive.\n\nBut wait, sometimes there might not be any n. Like if m is 0, which isn't allowed here since m is at least 1. Or perhaps for higher m's, but according to the problem statement, m is at least 1.\n\nWait, no. The input constraints say m is between 1 and 100000. So I don't have to handle m=0.\n\nSo, first, I need a function that, given a number n, calculates the number of trailing zeros.\n\nLet me write a helper function for that. It would take an integer n and return the count of trailing zeros.\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, for a given m, I need to find the minimal n where count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m, but also ensure that count is exactly m.\n\nWait, but sometimes when you increment n beyond a certain point, the count increases by more than one. For example, when n is a multiple of 25, adding it to the factorial adds two zeros. So, for m=2, let's see:\n\nn=24: 24//5=4, 24//25=0 → total 4.\nn=25: 25//5=5, 25//25=1 → total 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So for m=5, the minimal n is 25? Wait no, wait.\n\nWait, wait. Let's calculate count for n=25: 25//5=5, 25//25=1 → 5+1=6. So for m=5, the numbers n that give exactly 5 trailing zeros must be before 25, since at 25, it's 6.\n\nWait, no. Let's see for n=20: 20//5=4, 20//25=0 → 4 zeros. n=21: same as 20. Up to n=24, same as 20. At n=25, it's 6. So for m=5, there is no n where trailing zeros equal 5. So the output would be 0.\n\nWait, but wait—what about n=25, which has 6 trailing zeros. So for m=5, there's no solution. So in that case, the output is 0.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Because in the sample, m=1 gives n from 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers. So for m=5, perhaps n=25 is 6, so m=5 isn't possible. So the output would be 0.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nFor each m, find the lower bound where trailing zeros is exactly m, and the upper bound where it remains m. But how do I find these bounds?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the minimal n is the smallest n where count_trailing_zeros(n) == m. Similarly, the maximal n is the largest n where count_trailing_zeros(n) == m.\n\nSo, how can I find the minimal and maximal n?\n\nAn initial idea is to perform a binary search on n. Because the count of trailing zeros is a non-decreasing function.\n\nSo, for a given m, the minimal n is the smallest n where count >= m, and then we check if count is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the minimal n could be found by binary search, and then we can check if that n's count is exactly m.\n\nSimilarly, the maximal n is the largest n where count is exactly m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the minimal n where count >= m, and then see if the count is exactly m. If it is, then the minimal n is that value, else there's no solution.\n\nWait, but what about when there are multiple n's that have the same count.\n\nWait, for example, when m is 5, the minimal n is 25, which has 6 zeros. So that's over. So for m=5, there are zero solutions.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the smallest n where count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m.\n\n   a. Compute this using binary search.\n\n2. Check if count_trailing_zeros(n) is exactly m.\n\n   a. If not, output 0.\n\n   b. Else, find the next n where count increases beyond m.\n\n   c. The maximal n is the minimal n where count exceeds m minus 1.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is better. Let's think: the count increases as n increases, but sometimes it can jump by more than one. So for each m, the possible n's form a consecutive range.\n\nSo, for a given m, the minimal n is the smallest n where count is m. The maximal n is the largest n where count is m. The count between minimal and maximal n should be m.\n\nSo, how to find the minimal n.\n\nWe can perform a binary search for the minimal n where count >= m.\n\nOnce we find such an n, we can check if count is m. If yes, then that's the minimal n. Otherwise, there's no solution.\n\nBut wait, for example, if m is 6, n=25 has count 6. So minimal n is 25. Then, what is the next n where count becomes 7?\n\nn=26: 26//5=5, 26//25=1 → 6.\n\nn=30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1 → 7.\n\nSo n=25,26,27,28,29,30?\n\nWait, wait. Let's compute for n=25: 25//5=5, 25//25=1 → 5+1=6.\n\nn=26: same as 25, 26//5=5, 26//25=1 → 6.\n\nn=30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1 → 7.\n\nSo the numbers from 25 to 29 have count 6. So for m=6, the minimal n is 25, and the maximal is 29.\n\nSo the count is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Find the minimal n where count >= m.\n\n   - If the count at this n is not equal to m, then no solution.\n\n- Else, find the minimal n where count >= m+1, subtract 1 to get the maximal n.\n\nSo, for example, for m=6, the minimal n is 25.\n\nThe minimal n where count >=7 is 30.\n\nMaximal n is 30-1=29.\n\nSo the range is 25 to 29, inclusive.\n\nThus, the count is 29-25 +1 =5.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Use binary search to find the minimal n where count >= m.\n\n2. If count(n) != m → output 0.\n\n3. Else, find the minimal n where count >= m+1 → call it n_high.\n\n4. Maximal n is n_high -1.\n\n5. So the numbers are from min_n to max_n.\n\nSo, now the question is how to implement this.\n\nFirst, the helper function count_trailing_zeros(n) is straightforward.\n\nNext, for the binary search.\n\nWhat's the possible range for n?\n\nWell, for m=1e5, the minimal n is going to be somewhere around 5e5, perhaps, but binary search can handle that.\n\nWait, let's think about it. The count of trailing zeros increases roughly as n/4, since each 5 contributes, then 25, etc. So for m=1e5, n would be around 5e5.\n\nBut to be safe, for the binary search, we can set low to 0 and high to 5e5 *5 = 2.5e6, just to cover all possibilities.\n\nWait, maybe even higher. Let me see. For m=1e5, the minimal n is approximately 5e5, but perhaps more. So setting high to something like 5e5 + m*5 could be enough.\n\nBut perhaps to make it general, the binary search can start with low=0, high=5*(10^18) or something, but that's probably overkill.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, the minimal n is less than 5*m, but not sure.\n\nWell, perhaps the binary search can use a sufficiently large high, like 5*(10^5)*5=5e6, or 5e18. Wait, for m=1e5, the minimal n is around 5e5, but maybe higher.\n\nWait, let's compute for m=1e5.\n\nCompute count_trailing_zeros(5e5):\n\n5e5 /5 = 1e5.\n\n5e5 /25= 2e4.\n\n5e5 /125=4e3.\n\n5e5 /625= 800.\n\n5e5 /3125= 160.\n\n5e5 /15625=32.\n\n5e5 /78125=6.\n\n5e5 /390625=1.\n\nTotal: 1e5+2e4+4e3+800+160+32+6+1= 124999+... Hmm, let me compute step by step.\n\nWait, 5e5 is 500,000.\n\n500000 /5 = 100,000.\n\n100,000 /5=20,000.\n\n20,000 /5=4000.\n\n4000/5=800.\n\n800/5=160.\n\n160/5=32.\n\n32/5=6.\n\n6/5=1.\n\nSo adding all these: 100,000 + 20,000 = 120,000; +4000=124,000; +800=124800; +160=124960; +32=124992; +6=124998; +1=124999.\n\nSo count is 124,999 for n=5e5.\n\nBut m is 1e5. So to get count=1e5, n needs to be smaller.\n\nWait, perhaps n=250,000.\n\nCompute count for 250,000:\n\n250000 /5=50,000.\n\n50,000 /5=10,000.\n\n10,000 /5=2000.\n\n2000/5=400.\n\n400/5=80.\n\n80/5=16.\n\n16/5=3.\n\n3/5=0.\n\nAdding: 50,000 +10,000=60,000; +2000=62,000; +400=62,400; +80=62,480; +16=62,496; +3=62,499.\n\nSo count is 62,499 <1e5. So n=250,000 is too small.\n\nSo perhaps for m=1e5, the minimal n is higher.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to proceed with the binary search approach.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nFor the given m, perform a binary search to find the minimal n where count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nIf the count is not equal to m, output 0.\n\nElse, find the minimal n where count >= m+1, which is the first occurrence where count is m+1. Then the maximal n is that n minus 1.\n\nThen, the numbers from min_n to max_n (inclusive) are the solutions.\n\nSo, for each m, the steps are:\n\n1. Binary search for the minimal n where count >=m.\n\n2. Check if count(n) == m. If not, output 0.\n\n3. Else, binary search for the minimal n where count >= m+1 → call it next_min.\n\n4. Maximal n is next_min -1.\n\n5. So the count is (max_n - min_n +1), and the numbers are min_n, min_n+1, ..., max_n.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute min_n via binary search.\n\nif count(min_n) != m → print 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   compute next_min via binary search for m+1.\n\n   max_n = next_min -1.\n\n   collect all numbers from min_n to max_n.\n\n   print len(numbers) followed by the numbers.\n\nNow, implementing the binary search.\n\nImplementing the binary search for min_n:\n\nlow = 0, high = some upper limit.\n\nwhile low < high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n   cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n\n   if cnt < m:\n\n      low = mid +1\n\n   else:\n\n      high = mid\n\nAt the end, low is the minimal n where count >=m.\n\nThen, check if count(low) ==m.\n\nIf not, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   Now, find the minimal n where count >= m+1.\n\n   Set low=0, high= ... again, perhaps 5e18.\n\n   While low < high:\n\n       mid = (low + high) //2\n\n       cnt = count(mid)\n\n       if cnt < m+1:\n\n           low = mid +1\n\n       else:\n\n           high = mid\n\n   next_min = low\n\n   max_n = next_min -1.\n\n   Then, the numbers are from min_n to max_n, inclusive.\n\nSo, the code in Python.\n\nBut wait, the helper function count_trailing_zeros is O(log n) time, because each division by 5 reduces n by a factor of 5.\n\nSo for binary search steps, each step is O(log n), but log n is manageable because binary search runs in log(upper_bound) steps.\n\nSo, the code structure:\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low =0\n    high =5 * (10**18) # A very high upper bound\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt < m:\n            low = mid +1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef find_max_n(m):\n    # Find the minimal n where count >= m+1\n    low =0\n    high =5 * (10**18)\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt < m+1:\n            low = mid +1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\nThen, in the main code:\n\nread m.\n\nmin_n = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_trailing_zeros(min_n) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    next_min = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    max_n = next_min -1\n\n    k = max_n - min_n +1\n\n    print(k)\n\n    print(' '.join(str(i) for i in range(min_n, max_n+1)))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, m=1.\n\nfind_min_n(1) returns 5.\n\ncount is 1, which matches.\n\nfind_min_n(2) returns 8.\n\nBecause for m=2, the minimal n is 8.\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\nn=5: 1\n\nn=6:1\n\nn=7:1\n\nn=8:1\n\nn=9:1\n\nn=10: 10//5=2, 10//25=0 → 2.\n\nSo for m=2, the minimal n is 10.\n\nSo find_min_n(2) returns 10.\n\nWhich means that for m=1, find_min_n(2) is 10.\n\nSo max_n for m=1 is 10-1=9.\n\nSo the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9 → 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nfind_min_n(5) → ?\n\nCompute count for n=25: 25//5=5, 25//25=1 → 6. So 6>5. So the minimal n where count>=5 is 20.\n\nWait, 20//5=4, 20//25=0 → 4 <5.\n\nn=21: same as 20.\n\nn=22: same.\n\nn=23: same.\n\nn=24: same.\n\nn=25:6>5.\n\nSo the minimal n where count >=5 is 25.\n\nBut count(25)=6 !=5. So the condition fails. So output is 0.\n\nSo for m=5, the code correctly outputs 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nfind_min_n(6) is 25.\n\ncount(25)=6 ==6 → proceed.\n\nfind_min_n(7): what's the minimal n where count >=7.\n\nn=25:6 <7.\n\nn=26:6.\n\nn=30:30//5=6, 30//25=1 → 7.\n\nSo find_min_n(7) returns 30.\n\nmax_n is 30-1=29.\n\nSo the numbers are 25-29: 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code will output 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nfind_min_n(2) is 10.\n\ncount(10)=2.\n\nfind_min_n(3) is 15.\n\nmax_n is 14.\n\nNumbers: 10,11,12,13,14 → 5 numbers.\n\nWhich makes sense because 10! has 2 zeros, 11,12,13,14 have 2, and 15 has 3.\n\nSo code works.\n\nSo, now, the code seems solid.\n\nBut wait, what about when m is 0? According to the problem statement, m starts from 1, so no need to handle that.\n\nNow, what about when m is 100000?\n\nThe code will find the min_n and next_min correctly, even though it's a big number.\n\nSo, the code is efficient enough.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The binary search may have an incorrect upper bound. But choosing a very high upper bound like 5e18 is acceptable.\n\n- Edge cases where m is 1, as in the sample.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, reading the input as a string, but the input is given as a list of strings, or as a single line? Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput is a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000).\n\nIn the sample input, it's given as ['1', '5'], but perhaps the actual input is a single line containing m.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"The only line of input contains an integer m...\" So the input is one line, which is read as a string, then converted into an integer.\n\nSo in Python, the code should read from stdin:\n\nimport sys\n\nm = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nThen, compute as per above.\n\nWait, but sometimes, when the code is run in a competition, the input may come as a single line, which may include leading or trailing spaces. But in this case, m is an integer, so converting to int is okay.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe complete code is:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute min_n = find_min_n(m).\n\nIf count_trailing_zeros(min_n) != m → print 0.\n\nElse, compute next_min = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nmax_n = next_min -1.\n\nCompute the list of numbers from min_n to max_n inclusive.\n\nPrint the length, followed by the numbers separated by spaces.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nImplement the helper functions, then the main logic.\n\nBut in Python, functions can be defined inside the main code.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nHere's the code:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute min_n via binary search.\n\nCheck if count is m.\n\nIf not, output 0.\n\nElse, compute next_min via binary search for m+1.\n\nmax_n is next_min -1.\n\nGenerate the list and print.\n\nSo, the code:\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (10 ** 18)\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    min_n = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_trailing_zeros(min_n) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        next_min = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        max_n = next_min - 1\n        nums = list(range(min_n, max_n + 1))\n        print(len(nums))\n        print(' '.join(map(str, nums)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but for the sample input, the code should output '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nWait, the code prints len(nums), then the list as a space-separated string.\n\nYes, because in the sample, nums is [5,6,7,8,9], so len is 5, and the second line is '5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut in the sample, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nTesting the code with m=1:\n\nmin_n is 5.\n\ncount(5)=1.\n\nnext_min is find_min_n(2) → 10.\n\nmax_n is 9.\n\nSo numbers 5-9, 5 numbers.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nfind_min_n(5) returns 25, count is 6 !=5 → output 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nmin_n is 25, count is 6.\n\nnext_min is find_min_n(7) → 30.\n\nmax_n is 29.\n\nNumbers 25-29, 5 numbers.\n\nCorrect.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nPotential optimizations:\n\nThe binary search can be optimized by choosing a better upper bound.\n\nBut for the given constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nSo, this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list all such integers \\( n \\) in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence. Since 10 = 2 * 5 and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{count} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until \\( n \\) divided by 5^k is zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\), we use binary search. Once we find this \\( n \\), we check if the count of trailing zeros is exactly \\( m \\). If not, there are no solutions for \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Finding the Range**: If the smallest \\( n \\) has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros, we then find the smallest \\( n \\) where the count exceeds \\( m \\). The maximum \\( n \\) with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros is one less than this value. The range of valid \\( n \\) values is from the smallest \\( n \\) to this maximum \\( n \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (10 ** 18)\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    min_n = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_trailing_zeros(min_n) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        next_min = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        max_n = next_min - 1\n        nums = list(range(min_n, max_n + 1))\n        print(len(nums))\n        print(' '.join(map(str, nums)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads an integer \\( m \\) from standard input.\n2. **Finding Minimum \\( n \\)**: Using binary search, it finds the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\).\n3. **Validation Check**: It checks if the count of trailing zeros at this minimum \\( n \\) is exactly \\( m \\). If not, it outputs 0.\n4. **Finding Maximum \\( n \\)**: If valid, it finds the smallest \\( n \\) where the count exceeds \\( m \\) and calculates the maximum \\( n \\) as one less than this value.\n5. **Output**: It prints the count of valid \\( n \\) values and the values themselves in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring the solution is both optimal and handles large values of \\( m \\) effectively.",
