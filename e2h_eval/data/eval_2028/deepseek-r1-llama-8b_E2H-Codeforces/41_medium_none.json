There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about maximizing profit by building houses on a street with certain restrictions. \n\nAlright, let me read the problem statement carefully again. So, there are n spots, each can have a house height between 0 and h. Each spot contributes a squared value equal to its height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in a specific range of spots (l_i to r_i), the tallest house must be at most x_i. My goal is to choose the heights for each spot such that all restrictions are satisfied and the total profit is maximized.\n\nHmm. So, the challenge is to assign heights to each spot under these constraints.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Since n, h, m are all up to 50, which isn't too big, maybe a brute-force approach is feasible. Wait, but 50 spots each with up to 50 possible heights... 50^50 is way too big. So that's not going to work.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model this as a dynamic programming problem. Or maybe represent the constraints in a way that allows us to find the maximum possible heights efficiently.\n\nAnother thought: for each spot, the maximum allowed height is determined by the restrictions that include it. For example, if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions, the height is limited by the minimum of all the x_i values from the restrictions covering it, as well as h.\n\nSo first, for each spot i, I need to find the maximum possible height it can have without violating any restriction. Then, the optimal choice is to set each spot's height as high as possible, subject to all applicable restrictions.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily correct because some restrictions might affect overlapping regions. For example, setting a spot i to a higher value could violate a restriction that covers a larger region that includes i. So it's a matter of ensuring that for every restriction [l_i, r_i], the maximum height in that range is <= x_i.\n\nThis sounds like an interval problem where each interval has a maximum constraint. The problem then reduces to selecting for each spot a value a_i such that:\n\n- 0 ≤ a_i ≤ min(h, ... ) for each spot.\n- For each interval [L, R], the maximum a_j in L ≤ j ≤ R is ≤ x.\n\nThe objective is to maximize the sum of a_i².\n\nHmm. How do I model this?\n\nI remember that this kind of problem can be modeled using constraint programming or perhaps using a graph where edges represent the constraints between intervals. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the constraints are on intervals, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding for each position the maximum possible a_i it can take, considering all the overlapping constraints.\n\nWait, but the constraints are on the maximum within an interval. So, for any interval [L, R], the a_i's in that interval can't all exceed x. So, for each i in [L, R], a_i can be at most x. But wait, no—because if you have a_i > x, then the max is greater than x, which violates the restriction. So for each i in [L, R], a_i cannot exceed x. So, the maximum allowed for each i is the minimum of h and all x_j where j's interval includes i.\n\nWait, yes! Because if a spot i is part of several restrictions, each of those restrictions imposes a maximum x on the a_i. So the maximum a_i can be is the minimum of all x_j's for all restrictions that cover i, plus h. Because the maximum possible is h, unless some restriction limits it further.\n\nSo, for each spot i, compute the maximum allowed height as min( h, min{ x_j | restriction j covers i } ). If a spot is not covered by any restriction, then its maximum is h.\n\nBut wait, that's not sufficient. Because even if each individual spot's maximum is within x, the maximum of any interval might still exceed x. For example, suppose two spots are in the same interval. If both are set to their maximums, but the maximum in the interval would exceed x, which is not allowed.\n\nOh right! So just setting each spot to its maximum allowed based on individual constraints might not satisfy all the interval constraints. So that approach won't work.\n\nSo, the problem is more complex than that. We have to ensure that for each interval, the maximum a_i in that interval is <= x_i.\n\nSo, it's similar to a problem where each interval has a maximum constraint on the a_i's in it. This is a classic problem that can be modeled using a constraint satisfaction problem, but solving it exactly for small n and m might require some smart DP approach.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to model the DP.\n\nEach spot can have a certain height, and for each interval, the maximum in that interval must be <= x_i.\n\nWait, but the intervals are given, and the number of them is up to 50. So, perhaps for each spot, we can track the maximum height allowed by the overlapping constraints.\n\nWait, but the constraints are interdependent because overlapping intervals can impose conflicting maximums on the same spot.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model for each spot the maximum possible a_i, considering all the constraints that apply to it. But that's not enough because even if each spot's a_i is within their individual constraints, their combination could cause an interval's maximum to exceed x_i.\n\nSo, perhaps another approach is needed. Maybe we can model the problem by determining for each position the maximum possible a_i, but ensuring that for all intervals that include this position, the maximum in that interval doesn't exceed x.\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nAnother idea: For each interval [L, R], the maximum a_i in this interval must be <= x. So, the maximum a_i across L to R is bounded by x.\n\nTherefore, for each spot, the maximum a_i is the minimum of h and all x's of the intervals that include it. However, if any spot in the interval is set to that minimum, it's okay, but if all are set to lower values, it's also okay.\n\nWait, no. Because the maximum in the interval could be higher than x. For example, suppose an interval [1,3] with x=2. If the maximum in the entire interval is 2, then it's okay. But if one spot is 3 and others are 2, the max is 3, which violates.\n\nSo, the problem is that when you set a_i to their maximum possible, it's possible that some interval's maximum is exceeded.\n\nSo, the solution must ensure that for each interval, the maximum a_i in that interval is <= x_i.\n\nHmm. So, the problem is to choose a_i's such that:\n\nFor each i, a_i <= h.\n\nFor each restriction [L, R], max(a_L ... a_R) <= x.\n\nAnd maximize the sum of a_i^2.\n\nThis looks like a problem that can be approached with dynamic programming, but I'm not sure how to structure the state.\n\nWait, another thought: the maximum of a_i's in any interval can't exceed x. So, for any interval [L, R], the maximum a_i in that interval is <= x.\n\nWhich means, for each spot i, the a_i can be at most min( h, x_j for all j where i is in [L_j, R_j] ). Wait, no. Because if a spot i is in multiple intervals, each of those intervals' x's may be different. So the maximum a_i can be is the minimum of all x_j's for which i is in [L_j, R_j], but also h. So, a_i can't exceed h, and for each interval that includes i, a_i can't exceed that interval's x.\n\nSo, for each spot i, a_i_max = min( h, min{ x_j | i is in [L_j, R_j] } )\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient because even if each a_i is within their own a_i_max, it's possible that some interval's maximum is higher than x_j.\n\nNo, wait: if each a_i is at most a_i_max, which is the minimum of x_j's for the intervals covering i, then for any interval [L, R], the maximum a_i in that interval is the maximum of a_i's, each of which is <= x_j's for their own intervals. But the maximum in [L, R] could be higher than x of that interval, because x is only the x of the intervals that include the spot.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me rephrase:\n\nEach restriction is [L, R], x. So, for any spot i in [L, R], a_i must be <= x.\n\nThus, the maximum a_i in [L, R] is the maximum of a_L, a_{L+1}, ..., a_R. To ensure that this maximum is <= x, each a_i in [L, R] must be <= x. Because if any a_i in [L, R] is >x, then the max is >x, which is invalid.\n\nAh, right! So, for each interval [L, R], each a_i in L<=i<=R must be <= x.\n\nSo, this is a much stronger condition. So, for each spot i, the maximum allowed a_i is the minimum of h and all x_j where j is a restriction that includes i.\n\nSo, for each spot i, a_i can be at most the minimum of h and all x's from the restrictions that include i.\n\nBecause, if a_i exceeds any of those x's, that particular restriction is violated.\n\nWait, yes! Because if a_i is greater than x_j for some j, then the interval [L_j, R_j] includes i, and thus a_i must be <= x_j, which it's not. So that's not allowed.\n\nSo, for each spot i, the maximum a_i can be is the minimum of h and all x's of the restrictions that include i.\n\nSo, the initial step is to compute for each spot i, the maximum possible a_i as min( h, min{ x_j | i is in [L_j, R_j] } ). \n\nIf we set each a_i to this maximum, then all restrictions are satisfied, because for each restriction [L, R], all a_i in L..R are <= x, and the maximum is <= x.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let's see.\n\nSuppose a restriction [1,3], x=2. Then, spots 1,2,3 can be at most 2.\n\nAnother restriction [2,4], x=3. So, spots 2,3,4 can be at most 3.\n\nBut for spot 2: the maximum a_2 is min( h, 2, 3 )=2.\n\nSimilarly for spot 3: min( h, 2, 3 )=2.\n\nSpot 4: min( h, 3 ).\n\nSo, when all a_i are set to their computed maximum, all restrictions are satisfied.\n\nYes. Because for each interval [L, R], the maximum a_i in that interval is the maximum of the a_i's, which are all <= x for that interval. Because for any i in [L, R], a_i <= x.\n\nBecause for each i in [L, R], a_i is <= x of the interval [L, R], because a_i is the minimum of h and all x's, including x of [L, R].\n\nSo, if each a_i is set to this value, all constraints are satisfied.\n\nSo, that's the approach. For each spot i, compute the maximum possible a_i as the minimum of h and all x's of the restrictions that include i.\n\nThen, the total profit is the sum of squares of a_i's.\n\nWait, but does that always yield the maximum possible profit?\n\nNo, because sometimes it's better to reduce some a_i's in certain intervals to allow other a_i's in other intervals to be higher, leading to a higher overall sum.\n\nWait, for example, imagine two spots in the same interval. If the maximum allowed by the interval is x, but each spot's maximum is x, then setting both to x is best. But if the sum of squares is higher when one is x and the other is less, that's not possible because their sum would be less.\n\nWait, but wait: for the same interval, the sum of squares is maximized when all are as large as possible. Because for a fixed sum, the sum of squares is minimized when all are equal, but here it's the opposite. Wait, no, actually, for a fixed sum, the sum of squares is maximized when one variable is as large as possible and the others as small as possible. But in our case, the variables are constrained by a maximum, so to maximize the sum, each should be as large as possible.\n\nWait, but for a single interval, the maximum sum of squares is achieved when all a_i's are as high as possible within the interval's constraints. So, in that case, setting each a_i to the maximum possible within their individual constraints (as per the method above) is optimal.\n\nWait, perhaps yes. Because for each spot, the maximum a_i is determined by the tightest constraints it's subject to. So, by setting each a_i to their maximum possible, we're ensuring that all constraints are met, and also that each a_i is as high as possible, which contributes to the sum.\n\nSo, in that case, the approach is: for each spot i, compute the maximum allowed a_i as the minimum of h and all x's of the restrictions that include i. Then, the sum of a_i squared is the maximum possible.\n\nBut wait, let's test this against the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 3 3\n\nRestrictions:\n1 1 1\n2 2 3\n3 3 2\n\nSo for spot 1: included in first restriction. So a_1 can be min(3, 1) =1.\n\nSpot 2: included in second restriction. So min(3,3)=3.\n\nSpot3: included in third restriction. min(3,2)=2.\n\nSum is 1 +9 +4=14, which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample:\n\n4 10 2\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nSo for spot 1: no restrictions, so a_1 is 10.\n\nSpot 2: in first restriction, so min(10,8)=8.\n\nSpot3: in both restrictions, so min(10,8,7) =7.\n\nSpot4: in second restriction, min(10,7)=7.\n\nSo heights are 10,8,7,7. Sum is 100 +64 +49 +49= 262. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo, this approach works for the samples.\n\nAnother test case: what if a spot is covered by multiple overlapping intervals, some of which have lower x's?\n\nSay, spot 2 is covered by two intervals: [1,3] x=5 and [2,4] x=3. So a_2's maximum is min( h, 5,3 )=3.\n\nWhich is correct because in the first interval, a_2 can't be more than 5, but in the second, it can't be more than 3. So the stricter is 3.\n\nSo, the approach seems to hold.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each spot i, collect all the x's from the restrictions that include i.\n\n2. For each spot i, compute a_i as the minimum of h and all x's collected in step 1.\n\n3. Sum the squares of a_i's.\n\nThat's it. Because this ensures that all restrictions are satisfied, and each a_i is as high as possible, leading to the maximum sum.\n\nWait, but is there any scenario where this approach doesn't give the maximum sum? For instance, maybe allowing a_i to be lower in some areas could allow higher a_i's elsewhere, leading to a higher overall sum.\n\nHmm, let's think of an example.\n\nSuppose n=2, h=10.\n\nRestriction 1: l=1, r=1, x=5.\n\nRestriction 2: l=2, r=2, x=10.\n\nAccording to the approach, a_1 is min(10,5)=5. a_2 is min(10,10)=10. Sum is 25 +100=125.\n\nBut what if we set a_1 to 5 and a_2 to 10, which is the same as before.\n\nWhat if we tried setting a_1 to 4 and a_2 to 10. Sum is 16+100=116 <125.\n\nSo, that's worse.\n\nAnother example: suppose n=2, h=10.\n\nRestriction 1: [1,2], x=5.\n\nIn this case, a_1 and a_2 must be <=5.\n\nSo, a_1=5, a_2=5. Sum is 50.\n\nBut what if we set a_1=5 and a_2=5, which is the same.\n\nWhat if we have another restriction: [1,2], x=6. Then a_i's are min(10,6) for both, so 6 each. Sum is 72.\n\nWait, but in that case, the initial approach works.\n\nAnother case: Suppose n=2, h=10.\n\nRestriction 1: [1,2], x=3.\n\nSo, a_1 and a_2 must be <=3. So sum is 18.\n\nBut what if we could somehow set a_1=3, a_2=3, but perhaps some other arrangement.\n\nNo, that's the only option.\n\nSo, in all cases I can think of, the approach of setting a_i to the minimum of h and the x's of all applicable restrictions gives the maximum sum.\n\nIs this always true?\n\nWait, let's think of a case where a spot is covered by multiple overlapping intervals with varying x's.\n\nSuppose:\n\nSpot 1 is covered by [1,2] x=2 and [1,3] x=3. So, a_1 is min(10,2,3)=2.\n\nSpot 2 is covered by [1,2] x=2 and [2,3] x=1. So, a_2 is min(10,2,1)=1.\n\nSpot 3 is covered by [1,3] x=3 and [2,3] x=1. So, a_3 is min(10,3,1)=1.\n\nSum is 4 +1 +1=6.\n\nBut what if we could set a_1=2, a_2=1, a_3=1, which is the same.\n\nAlternatively, could we have a_2=1 and a_3= something else?\n\nWait, no, because the restriction [2,3] x=1 requires a_2 and a_3 to be <=1.\n\nSo, a_3 can't exceed 1.\n\nThus, the approach is correct.\n\nAnother test: what if a spot is covered by a single interval with x=5, but h is 10. So a_i=5. That's correct.\n\nSo, in all cases, the approach seems valid.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to compute for each spot the minimal x among all restrictions that cover it, along with h.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n, h, m.\n\n2. Read m restrictions: l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\n3. For each spot i from 1 to n:\n\n   a. Collect all x's where i is in [l_j, r_j] for some j.\n\n   b. Compute a_i as the minimum of h and all x's in the collection.\n\n   c. If the collection is empty (no restrictions cover i), then a_i =h.\n\n4. Compute the sum of a_i squared.\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\n- For each spot, find all x's from the restrictions that include it.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nWe can represent the restrictions as a list, and for each spot, iterate through all restrictions and check if l_i <= spot <= r_i.\n\nBut since n is small (up to 50), this is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan for the code:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nCreate a list of restrictions, each being (l, r, x).\n\nFor each spot from 1 to n:\n\n   min_x = h\n\n   for each restriction in restrictions:\n\n       if l <= spot <= r:\n\n           if x < min_x:\n\n               min_x = x\n\n   a_i = min(min_x, h)\n\nWait, but min_x starts as h, and for each restriction that includes the spot, we take the minimum x. So, for a spot with no restrictions, a_i remains h.\n\nYes.\n\nOnce a_i's are computed, sum their squares.\n\nSo, the code is straightforward.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1 1 1 → affects spot 1.\n\n2 2 3 → affects spot2.\n\n3 3 2 → affects spot3.\n\nFor spot 1: min_x is 1. So a1=1.\n\nSpot2: x=3. a2=3.\n\nSpot3: x=2. a3=2.\n\nSum is 1+9+4=14.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → affects spots 2,3.\n\n3 4 7 → affects spots3,4.\n\nSpot1: no restrictions. a1=10.\n\nSpot2: x=8. a2=8.\n\nSpot3: x=8 and 7 → min is7. a3=7.\n\nSpot4: x=7. a4=7.\n\nSum: 100 +64 +49 +49 = 262.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nAnother test case: spot1 is in two overlapping intervals.\n\nn=2, h=10.\n\nRestriction 1: 1 2 5.\n\nRestriction2: 1 1 3.\n\nSo, for spot1: min_x is min(5,3) =3. So a1=3.\n\nFor spot2: only restriction1 applies, x=5. a2=5.\n\nSum is 9+25=34.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nRead m lines, each line is l, r, x.\n\nFor each spot in 1..n:\n\n   min_x = h\n\n   for each restriction in the list:\n\n       if l <= spot <= r:\n\n           if x < min_x:\n\n               min_x =x\n\n   a_i = min( min_x, h )\n\nWait, but min_x is already <=h, since for any x in a restriction, x can be up to h. So, min_x is at most h.\n\nThus, a_i = min_x.\n\nWait, no, because h is the initial value, and for each restriction, x could be smaller than h. So, for each spot, a_i is the minimum of h and all x's for the restrictions that cover it. But if a spot is not covered by any restriction, then a_i is h.\n\nSo, in code:\n\na_i = min( h, min of x's for restrictions covering spot )\n\nBut since the initial min_x is h, and for each x in the restrictions, we take the minimum between current min_x and x. So, for a spot not covered by any restrictions, min_x remains h.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append( (l, r, x) )\n\ntotal = 0\nfor spot in range(1, n+1):\n    min_x = h\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        if l <= spot <= r:\n            if x < min_x:\n                min_x = x\n    a = min(min_x, h)\n    total += a ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but wait: in the code, for each restriction, if spot is in [l, r], then x is considered, and min_x is updated to the minimum between current min_x and x.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nInput is 3 3 3.\n\nRestrictions are (1,1,1), (2,2,3), (3,3,2).\n\nFor spot 1:\n\nCheck each restriction:\n\nFirst: 1<=1<=1 → x=1. min_x becomes 1.\n\nOther restrictions don't include spot 1.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit from building houses on a street with specific height constraints. Each house can be built at a certain height, and each height contributes to the total profit as the square of its height. The challenge is to maximize the profit while adhering to given zoning restrictions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We need to assign heights to each spot such that all restrictions are satisfied. Each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a certain range must not exceed a given height.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each spot, the maximum allowed height is determined by the minimum of all the restriction heights that apply to it, as well as the global maximum height `h`.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the input values and restrictions.\n   - For each spot, compute the maximum possible height considering all applicable restrictions.\n   - Sum the squares of these heights to get the total profit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n\ntotal = 0\nfor spot in range(1, n + 1):\n    min_x = h\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        if l <= spot <= r:\n            if x < min_x:\n                min_x = x\n    a = min(min_x, h)\n    total += a ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of spots `n`, the maximum height `h`, and the number of restrictions `m`. It then reads each restriction which includes the range `[l, r]` and the maximum height `x` for that range.\n2. **Processing Each Spot**: For each spot from 1 to `n`, the code determines the maximum allowed height by considering all applicable restrictions. The height is constrained by the minimum value of all relevant restrictions and the global maximum height `h`.\n3. **Calculating Profit**: The profit from each spot is the square of its assigned height, and these values are summed to get the total profit.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are respected while maximizing the profit from the given spots.",
