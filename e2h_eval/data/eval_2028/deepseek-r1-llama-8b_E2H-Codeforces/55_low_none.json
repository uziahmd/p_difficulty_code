    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Minimum Ternary String. Hmm. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing certain swap operations. \n\nWait, the allowed swaps are between adjacent '0's and '1's, and between adjacent '1's and '2's. So for example, I can swap '0' and '1' if they are next to each other, but not '0' and '2', or '1' and '2' unless they are adjacent. Oh right, because the problem statement says that you can only swap '01' <-> '10' or '12' <-> '21'. So '02' can't be swapped directly.\n\nSo the goal is to rearrange the string in a way that's as lex smallest as possible, using any number of these allowed swaps. But how do I model the possible transformations?\n\nHmm, thinking about the problem, the allowed swaps imply that certain characters can be reordered relative to each other. For instance, '0's can be moved past '1's, because swapping them is allowed. Similarly, '1's can be moved past '2's. But '0's cannot be moved past '2's directly, because there's no allowed swap between '0' and '2'. So that might complicate things.\n\nWait, let's think about what the movement possibilities are. \n\n- 0 can move past 1: So all 0s can be arranged among themselves relative to 1s. Like, 0s can be ordered before or after 1s, depending on the swaps.\n- 1 can move past 2: So all 1s can be arranged among themselves relative to 2s. So 1s can come before or after 2s.\n- But 0 and 2 cannot be directly swapped, so their relative order depends on how they interact with 1s.\n\nWait, maybe I should model the allowed rearrangements as certain groups. For example, the 0s can be arranged among themselves, but their relative positions to 2s might depend on the 1s in between.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of the string as consisting of three separate sequences: 0s, 1s, and 2s, but with some constraints on their ordering based on the allowed swaps.\n\nLet me try to figure out the ordering possibilities.\n\nSuppose I have a string like \"210\". Can I rearrange it into \"012\"? Let's see:\n\nOriginal: 2 1 0\n\nI can swap 1 and 0 (since they are adjacent), resulting in 2 0 1. Then, can I swap 2 and 0? No, because that's not allowed. So the string becomes \"201\", which is worse than the original. Hmm, so maybe \"210\" can't be rearranged into \"012\" because the 2 is stuck before the 0, since you can't swap 2 and 0 directly.\n\nWait, but wait. What about if there's a 1 in between? Like, let's say \"201\". Can I swap 2 and 0? No. Or maybe another approach. Hmm, perhaps the relative order between 0 and 2 can't be changed through the allowed swaps. Because the only way to move a 0 past a 2 would require moving through a 1.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the string is \"021\". Can I rearrange this into \"012\"? Let's see:\n\nThe allowed swaps are between 0 and 1, and between 1 and 2. So in \"021\", the 0 is followed by 2, which can't be swapped. So I can't change their order. So the string remains \"021\". So that suggests that 0s can't cross over 2s unless there's a 1 in between that allows them to be swapped via moving around.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed unless there's a 1 between them. Because without a 1, you can't swap them.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe the minimal string can be constructed by arranging the 0s as far left as possible, then the 1s, then the 2s. But that's not always possible because 0s can't cross 2s without a 1 in between.\n\nWait, no. Because without a 1, 0s can't move past 2s. So the relative positions of 0s and 2s are fixed except when there's a 1 that allows them to be reordered.\n\nWait, maybe the ordering between 0s and 2s is determined by their initial arrangement, unless a 1 is present between them. But even that may not help because you can't swap 0",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing a series of allowed swaps. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', and between adjacent '1' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the relative order of '0's and '2's cannot be changed unless there is a '1' between them. This means that '0's can only be moved past '1's, and '1's can only be moved past '2's. Therefore, the approach involves:\n\n1. **Separating Characters**: We can treat the string as consisting of three separate sequences: 0s, 1s, and 2s.\n2. **Ordering**: \n   - All '0's should come before '1's because they can be swapped with each other.\n   - All '1's should come before '2's for the same reason.\n3. **Constructing the Result**: We construct the result by first placing all '0's, followed by '1's, and then '2's.\n\nThis approach ensures that we get the lexicographically smallest string because '0' is the smallest, followed by '1', and then '2'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef minimal_ternary_string(s):\n    count0 = s.count('0')\n    count1 = s.count('1')\n    count2 = s.count('2')\n    \n    res = ['0'] * count0 + ['1'] * count1 + ['2'] * count2\n    return ''.join(res)\n\n# Read input\ns = input().strip()\nprint(minimal_ternary_string(s))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Counting Characters**: We count the occurrences of '0', '1', and '2' in the input string.\n- **Constructing Result**: Using these counts, we construct a new string starting with '0's, followed by '1's, and ending with '2's. This ensures the smallest lexicographical order because each character is placed in the earliest possible position based on their type.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach runs in O(n) time where n is the length of the input string, making it efficient even for large inputs up to 10^5 characters.",
