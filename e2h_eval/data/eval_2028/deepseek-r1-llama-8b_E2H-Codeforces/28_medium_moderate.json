String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vasily the Bear and Beautiful Strings.\" Hmm, sounds interesting.\n\nSo, the task is to count the number of beautiful strings based on certain criteria. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nA string is considered beautiful if it meets these conditions:\n1. It consists only of 0s and 1s.\n2. It has exactly n zeros and m ones.\n3. We can obtain a specific character 'g' (either 0 or 1) from the string with some modifications. \n\nWhat's a modification? Oh right, it's an operation where you replace the last two characters with one. The new character depends on which two you're replacing: if both are 0, replace with 0; if both are 1, replace with 1; otherwise, it becomes 0. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh, no— the problem says that the replacement is one if it replaces two zeros, else zero. So, if the last two are both 0, you replace them with one 0. If they are 0 and 1 (in any order), you replace with 0. If they are both 1, replace with one 1. Oh right, that's how it works.\n\nAnd the string can be modified any number of times, including zero. But each modification requires the string to have length at least two. So, for example, a string of length 1 can't be modified.\n\nThe goal is to find the number of such beautiful strings, modulo 1e9+7.\n\nSo, the approach is to model all possible beautiful strings that satisfy the given n, m, g constraints, and count them.\n\nHmm. How to model this?\n\nLet me think about the properties of the string after modifications. Each modification reduces the length by one. So, if the initial string has length L, each modification reduces it by one, until the length is 1.\n\nWait, but the process is applied any number of times, including zero. So the minimal possible length is 1.\n\nBut for the string to be beautiful, after some modifications, it must end up as a single character equal to 'g'. Because when you perform enough modifications, the string reduces to one character, which must be 'g'.\n\nWait, not necessarily. Because the problem says that 'g' is obtained via some number of modifications. So, the string can be modified any number of times (including zero), but in the end, the resulting string must have exactly 'g' as its sole character.\n\nWait, no. Because each modification replaces the last two characters with one. So the process gradually shortens the string. After k modifications, the string's length is (original length) -k. So, the final string after k modifications will be a single character if k = original_length -1.\n\nSo, to get 'g' as the final character, the initial string must allow for a sequence of modifications leading to that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be modified multiple times, but in such a way that the final character is 'g'.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to model the possible transformations. Let's think about the possible states a string can be in after some modifications.\n\nEach modification changes the last two bits into one. So, the state can be represented by the current string, but since the string can be very long, we need a more efficient way to represent it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using dynamic programming, tracking certain properties of the string as it's being modified.\n\nWait, let's consider that each modification reduces the length by one. So, the maximum number of modifications is (original_length -1). But the original string can be built in such a way that after some modifications, it becomes a single 'g' character.\n\nBut how does the original string relate to the possible modifications that can lead to 'g'?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem in terms of the counts of 0s and 1s and the parity or other properties that allow the string to be reduced to 'g' through a series of modifications.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to determine what conditions the original string must satisfy so that after some number of modifications, it results in 'g'.\n\nLet me think about the effect of each modification on the count of 0s and 1s.\n\nSuppose the last two characters are 'a' and 'b', where a and b are either 0 or 1.\n\nAfter a modification:\n\n- if a == b == 0: replace with 0. So, the count of 0s decreases by 1 (since two 0s become one). So, total 0s: old_0 - 2 + 1 = old_0 -1. 1s remain the same.\n\n- if a == b == 1: replace with 1. So, 1s decrease by 1 (two 1s become one). 0s remain the same.\n\n- else (one is 0 and the other is 1): replace with 0. So, 0s increase by 1 (since two different bits become one 0). 1s decrease by 1.\n\nSo each modification affects the counts of 0s and 1s in a particular way.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach a state where after some modifications, the string is just 'g', which is either 0 or 1.\n\nSo, the final state after k modifications is a single 'g'. So, the final counts are: if g=0, then 1 zero and 0 ones. If g=1, 0 zeros and 1 one.\n\nWe need to model the transitions between the possible counts of 0s and 1s, considering each possible modification step.\n\nThis suggests that dynamic programming might be a good approach here. Let's model dp[i][j] as the number of ways to reach i zeros and j ones after some modifications, with the string being reducible to 'g' through further modifications.\n\nWait, but since each modification reduces the string length, perhaps it's better to model it in reverse. That is, start from the final state and work our way back to the original string.\n\nAlternatively, for the original string, after any number of modifications, it can reach a state where the counts are suitable for the final 'g' character.\n\nBut how do we model the transitions?\n\nLet me think: each modification can be thought of as combining the last two characters into one, which affects the counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nSo, the reverse process would involve splitting the string into two parts, and determining how the previous state could have led to the current state.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's manageable.\n\nSo, let's consider that the string ends with a certain combination of 0s and 1s, and that during the modification steps, each step adds a certain pair.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the problem in terms of the counts of 0s and 1s, and how each modification step affects them.\n\nBut for the original string, the counts must be such that after a series of modifications, the final character is 'g'.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial string must have a certain relation between n and m, and the parity of the sum of some other parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the possible ways to combine pairs of 0s and 1s to form a single 'g' in the end.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nLet's denote that the initial string has c0 zeros and c1 ones. Then, through a series of modifications, it can be reduced to a single 'g' character.\n\nEach modification reduces the length by one, and thus, the number of modifications possible is (c0 + c1 - 1), because each modification reduces the length by 1, starting from (c0 + c1) down to 1.\n\nBut to end up with a single 'g', the final character must be 'g'. So, the sum of the 0s and 1s after all modifications is 1.\n\nWait, but each modification doesn't directly reduce the count of 0s or 1s, except for the cases where two same characters are merged. So, the counts can vary depending on the order of modifications.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe we should model the problem as building the string step by step, considering the possible ways to add pairs of characters that could eventually be merged into 'g'.\n\nWait, another approach: the original string can be viewed as a sequence of operations that, when performed, will result in a single 'g' character. So, perhaps the original string can be broken down into a series of steps where each step appends a certain pair of characters that, when modified, contribute to the final 'g'.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as counting the number of binary strings with exactly n 0s and m 1s, such that after applying some modifications, the resulting single character is 'g'.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model the problem as finding all such binary strings where, for some k (number of modifications), the string can be reduced to 'g' after k steps.\n\nBut the challenge is to find a way to model the possible reductions.\n\nLet me think about the necessary conditions for a string to be reducible to 'g'.\n\nEach modification affects the counts of 0s and 1s. So, perhaps there's a certain invariant or condition that the initial counts of 0s and 1s must satisfy.\n\nFor instance, suppose the final character is 'g' = 0. Then, the initial string must have a certain parity or condition related to the counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nLet me think about the effect of each modification on the counts.\n\nCase 1: Both are 0 → after modification, 0 count decreases by 1 (from two 0s to one 0).\nSo, new c0 = c0 -1, c1 remains.\n\nCase 2: Both are 1 → new c1 = c1 -1.\nc0 remains.\n\nCase 3: One is 0 and the other is 1 → new c0 = c0 +1 - 2* (number of 0s in the pair?), wait no: Wait, when you have a 0 and 1, you replace them with 0. So, the new c0 is (old c0) + 1 (since two characters are removed, one 0 and one 1, and replaced with one 0). So, the change is c0 increases by 1, c1 decreases by 1.\n\nSo, each modification can be represented as a transition:\n\n- For case 1: (c0, c1) → (c0 -1, c1)\n- For case 2: (c0, c1) → (c0, c1 -1)\n- For case 3: (c0, c1) → (c0 +1, c1 -1)\n\nBut wait, these are the changes per modification. However, the order matters because the choice of which pair to modify depends on the current state.\n\nBut since we're trying to reach (1, 0) or (0, 1), depending on 'g', perhaps we can model the problem as a graph where nodes are (c0, c1) and edges represent the possible transitions due to each modification.\n\nThe question is, how to count the number of paths from (n, m) to (1, 0) or (0, 1), depending on 'g', with each step being a modification (which may correspond to adding certain possible transitions).\n\nBut wait, this is in reverse. Because each modification reduces the counts in some way, perhaps the original string starts from (n, m) and can reach (1, 0) or (0, 1) via a series of steps.\n\nWait, but when you perform a modification, the counts decrease. So, going forward, you can't have more than the initial counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to model the problem as building the string step by step, considering that each step adds a pair of characters that can be merged into the desired 'g' in the end.\n\nSo, instead of thinking of the initial string as being built and then modified, think of the modifications as being done in reverse.\n\nIn other words, starting from the final character 'g', build the original string by adding pairs of characters that, when modified, would result in 'g'.\n\nEach addition in the reverse process corresponds to a modification in the forward process.\n\nSo, for example, to reach 'g' in the end, the last step must have been a modification that resulted in 'g'. So, before that step, the string must have had a certain configuration.\n\nIf the last modification resulted in 'g', then before that, the string was of length two, and those two were modified into 'g'.\n\nSo, for 'g' being 0, the last two could have been two 0s, or a 0 and a 1. Because modifying either case gives 0.\n\nSimilarly, for 'g' being 1, the last two could have been two 1s.\n\nSo, in the reverse process, each step adds two characters that could have been merged into 'g' in the next step.\n\nThis seems promising.\n\nSo, the approach is to model the reverse process: starting from the target (g), and then for each possible way to expand it by adding two characters that, when merged, would produce g.\n\nEach step adds two characters, increasing the counts accordingly.\n\nSo, the DP state can be the current counts of 0s and 1s, and the DP value is the number of ways to reach that state.\n\nThe initial state is (0, 1) if g is 1, or (1, 0) if g is 0, because that's the single character.\n\nThen, for each state (c0, c1), we can consider all possible ways to add two characters to the end, such that when they are merged, they produce 'g'.\n\nWait, no. Because in the reverse process, each step represents adding two characters that, when merged, would give the next step's 'g'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me rephrase: In the forward direction, the string is modified by merging the last two characters. So, each modification step reduces the string length by 1.\n\nIn the reverse process, each step increases the string length by 1. So, for each possible way to split the string into the last step, which was a merge of two characters into the current one.\n\nThus, for the reverse process, each step is adding two characters before the current state.\n\nSo, for example, to get to state S, we can have added two characters that, when merged, result in the current character.\n\nSo, for the reverse process, each state (c0, c1) can be reached by adding two characters, say 'a' and 'b', which when merged would result in the current character.\n\nWait, no. Because in the reverse process, the current state is after a merge, so the previous state had two more characters.\n\nSo, for the reverse process:\n\nTo get to (c0, c1), the previous state must have been (c0 + x, c1 + y), where x and y are the counts added by the two new characters, and the last two were merged into the current state's character.\n\nBut what's the relationship between x and y, and the current character?\n\nWell, the current character is determined by the two that were merged. So, for example, if the current character is '0', the two that were merged could have been:\n\n- Two 0s → merged into 0.\n- One 0 and one 1 → merged into 0.\n\nSimilarly, if the current character is '1', the two that were merged could have been two 1s.\n\nSo, for the reverse process, when adding two characters to form the previous state, the two can be any pair, but their merge must result in the current character.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the transitions in the reverse process as follows:\n\nSuppose in the reverse process, the current state is (c0, c1). To reach this state, the previous state was (c0 + a, c1 + b), where a and b are the counts of 0s and 1s added in the previous step. The two characters added must have been such that when they were merged, they produced the current character.\n\nSo, for each possible pair (a, b) that, when merged, result in the current character, we can add the ways from (c0 + a, c1 + b) to (c0, c1).\n\nWait, but how do we model the possible a and b for each current character?\n\nLet me think about it.\n\nSuppose the current character is '0' (so, in the forward process, the last modification resulted in '0'). Then, in the reverse process, the previous step must have been a string of length 2, which when modified became '0'.\n\nSo, the previous state had two characters, which could be:\n\n- (0,0) → merged into 0.\n- (0,1) → merged into 0.\n\nSo, in the reverse process, for the current state (c0, c1), which was obtained by merging two characters, the previous state could have been:\n\n- If the current character is '0', then the two added in the reverse step could be (0,0) → contributing (0,0) → or (0,1) → contributing (0,1).\n\nWait, perhaps more formally: when the current character is '0', the two added in the previous step could have been either 00, 01, or 10, but not 11, because merging 11 would result in 1, not 0.\n\nWait, no. Wait, merging 00 → 0, 01 → 0, 10 → 0, 11 → 1.\n\nSo, in the reverse process, for the current state (c0, c1), which is the result after a merge, the previous state must have been a state where the two added characters were such that their merge produces the current character.\n\nSo, if the current character is '0', then the two added could be:\n\n- 00 → so, the previous state is (c0 + 0, c1 + 0) → because the two 0s are added, and merged into 0. So, the new c0 is increased by 0 (wait, no: adding two 0s would mean that the previous state had c0 + 2, c1. Because the two 0s are added, and then merged into one 0, which is the current state.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused again.\n\nLet me clarify: in the reverse process, each step adds two characters to the end. The two added are then merged into one character in the next step.\n\nSo, in the reverse process, the transition is from (c0, c1) to (c0 + a, c1 + b), where a and b are the counts of 0s and 1s in the two added characters.\n\nThen, when these two are merged, the resulting character is determined by their values.\n\nSo, the transition is allowed only if the merge of the two added characters results in the current state's character.\n\nWait, no. Because in the reverse process, the current state is after the merge. So, the two added in the previous step are merged into the current state.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the reverse process as follows:\n\nAt each step, we can add two characters (x, y) to the end of the current string. Then, when you perform a modification on the last two, you get the next character.\n\nBut in the reverse process, each step is adding two characters, and the next character is determined by the merge of these two.\n\nSo, the initial state in the reverse process is (g). Then, each step adds two characters to the end, and the next character is determined by their merge.\n\nWait, no, because the next character is the result of merging the two added characters. So, the state after adding the two characters is (current c0, c1) plus (x, y), and then the next state is determined by the merge of x and y.\n\nSo, in the reverse process, the state transitions are:\n\nFrom (c0, c1), add two characters (x, y) → new state is (c0 + x, c1 + y), then the next state is determined by merging x and y into z, which becomes the next state.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reverse process is to model the possible ways to build the string by adding pairs of characters, ensuring that each pair, when merged, results in the desired final character.\n\nSo, for the reverse process:\n\n- Start with the final character 'g'.\n\n- For each possible way to add two characters (x, y) to the end, such that merging x and y gives 'g'.\n\n- Then, recursively build the rest of the string.\n\nSo, the DP state is the current count of 0s and 1s, and the DP value is the number of ways to reach that state.\n\nThe initial state is (0, 1) if g is 1, or (1, 0) if g is 0.\n\nWait, no. Because for the reverse process, the initial state is the final character. So, for g=0, the initial state is (1, 0), because the string is just '0'. For g=1, it's (0, 1).\n\nThen, each step adds two characters (x, y), and the merge of x and y must result in the current character (the head of the string in the forward process).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the reverse process as follows:\n\nAt each step, we can append two characters (x, y), and the merge of x and y must be equal to the current head of the string (which is the last character after the merge in the forward process).\n\nWait, but the head is determined by the merge. So, for example, if the current head is '0', then the two characters added must be such that their merge is '0'.\n\nWait, perhaps this is manageable.\n\nSo, the DP state is (c0, c1), representing the count of zeros and ones in the current string.\n\nInitially, for g=0, the string is \"0\", so c0=1, c1=0. For g=1, c0=0, c1=1.\n\nFor each state (c0, c1), we can consider all possible pairs (x, y) that, when merged, result in the current character (the head of the string in the forward process).\n\nWait, but the head is the last character after the merge. So, for the reverse process, the head is the current character, and the two added must merge into it.\n\nSo, for each state (c0, c1), and for each possible pair (x, y) that, when merged, give the current head (which is known based on the current state), we can add the counts of the two added to the current state.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to formalize it.\n\nLet's say that in the reverse process, the current state is (c0, c1), and the current head is 'h' (either 0 or 1). So, the state is (h, c0, c1), but perhaps that's too much information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the state as the current head and the counts of the remaining characters.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a better approach. Because the head determines which pairs (x, y) are allowed when adding two new characters.\n\nSo, the state is (h, c0_remaining, c1_remaining), where h is the current head character (0 or 1), and c0_remaining and c1_remaining are the counts of 0s and 1s in the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but this might complicate things because the state space becomes larger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the head is determined by the current state, because each state corresponds to a certain head.\n\nWait, but perhaps in the reverse process, the head is the last character of the current string, which is the result of merging the previous two.\n\nSo, the initial state is a single character 'g', so the head is 'g'.\n\nEach step adds two new characters (x, y) to the end, which are then merged into the new head.\n\nSo, the new head is determined by x and y.\n\nSo, in the reverse process, each step adds two new characters, which are then merged into the new head.\n\nThus, the state transitions are:\n\nFrom state (h_prev, c0, c1), add two new characters x and y. The new head is determined by x and y.\n\nSo, the new state is (h_new, c0 + x, c1 + y), where h_new is the result of merging x and y.\n\nWait, but wait: when you add two new characters, x and y, and then merge them, you get h_new. So, the state after adding x and y is (h_new, c0 + x, c1 + y), but that's not quite right.\n\nBecause the rest of the string is now longer by two characters, but the head is h_new.\n\nWait, perhaps the state should consist of the current head and the counts of the rest of the string.\n\nBut that might make the state too large.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the head is determined by the current state, and the counts are separate.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be.\n\nLet me try to model the reverse process as follows:\n\nEach step in the reverse process adds two characters, which are then merged into a new head. The counts of 0s and 1s are increased accordingly.\n\nSo, the initial state is (g), which is a single character. So, c0 is 1 if g is 0, else c1 is 1.\n\nWait, no. For g=0, the initial state is c0=1, c1=0. For g=1, it's c0=0, c1=1.\n\nThen, each step adds two new characters, x and y. These are added to the current string, which is then merged into a new head.\n\nThe new head is determined by x and y.\n\nSo, for each possible (x, y), we can compute the new head and update the counts.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, the current state is (c0, c1), which represents the counts of 0s and 1s in the current string. Adding two new characters x and y increases c0 and c1 by x and y respectively. Then, the new head is determined by x and y.\n\nSo, the transition is:\n\nFor a given state (c0, c1), and possible x, y (each 0 or 1), compute h_new = merge(x, y).\n\nThen, the new state is (h_new, c0 + x, c1 + y).\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because the current state's counts include the head. So, perhaps the counts in the state should exclude the head.\n\nAh, right! Because the state (c0, c1) represents the counts of the entire string, including the head. So, when we add two new characters, the counts increase by x and y, and then the new head is h_new.\n\nSo, the new state is (h_new, c0 + x, c1 + y).\n\nWait, but in the reverse process, the head is the result of merging the previous two. So, the process is:\n\nAdd two characters, then merge them into the head.\n\nSo, in the reverse process, each step is adding two characters and then merging them into the new head.\n\nSo, for each state (h_prev, c0_prev, c1_prev), adding x and y, then merging them into h_new.\n\nSo, the new state is (h_new, c0_prev + x, c1_prev + y).\n\nBut wait, the initial state is h_prev = g, c0_prev = 0, c1_prev = 0.\n\nBecause initially, the string is just 'g', which is either 0 or 1. So, when you add two characters x and y, you create a string of length 3, which is then merged into a new head of h_new.\n\nWait, perhaps this is correct.\n\nSo, the DP state is (h_prev, c0_prev, c1_prev), where h_prev is the current head, and c0_prev and c1_prev are the counts of 0s and 1s in the rest of the string.\n\nBut this might complicate things because the state includes the head.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the head can be determined by the counts and the way the previous step was taken.\n\nWait, perhaps not. So, perhaps the state needs to include the current head.\n\nSo, the initial state is (g, 0, 0), meaning that the head is 'g', and there are no other characters.\n\nThen, for each step, we can add two new characters x and y.\n\nThese are added to the counts, and then the new head is computed based on x and y.\n\nSo, the transition is:\n\nFor state (h_prev, c0_prev, c1_prev), and possible x, y in {0, 1}:\n\nCompute h_new = merge(x, y).\n\nThen, the new state is (h_new, c0_prev + x, c1_prev + y).\n\nBut wait, when you add x and y, the counts increase by x and y, but the new head is h_new.\n\nBut then, the rest of the string is (c0_prev + x, c1_prev + y) minus the head (h_new)?\n\nNo, because the counts in the state are for the entire string, including the head.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's try to think differently.\n\nThe total number of characters in the current state is 1 (head) + (c0_prev + c1_prev), because the rest of the string is (c0_prev + c1_prev) characters.\n\nWhen we add two new characters, the total becomes 1 + (c0_prev + c1_prev) + 2 = 3. Then, we merge the last two, reducing the length by 1. So, the new head is the result of merging those two.\n\nWait, but in the reverse process, each step adds two characters, which are then merged into the new head.\n\nSo, in the reverse process, each step increases the string length by 1 (from k to k+1, since adding two and then merging into one).\n\nWait, no. Because adding two characters increases the length by two, then merging reduces it by one, resulting in a net increase of one.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to model the reverse process as building the string from the end, considering each possible way to split it into the last step.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here. Let's think about the problem differently.\n\nWe need to count the number of binary strings with exactly n 0s and m 1s, such that after some number of modifications, the resulting single character is 'g'.\n\nEach modification reduces the length by one.\n\nSo, the initial string can have any length as long as it can be reduced to 'g' via a series of modifications.\n\nBut how do we model the possible modifications?\n\nAlternative Idea: The problem can be transformed into a combinatorial problem where we count the number of binary strings with n 0s and m 1s that can be reduced to 'g' via some modifications.\n\nEach modification is equivalent to choosing the last two characters and replacing them with their merge.\n\nSo, the process is deterministic in the sense that each step reduces the string length, and the merge depends on the last two.\n\nBut it's difficult to model the entire process.\n\nAlternative Approach: Think about the possible ways to represent the initial string as a binary tree, where each node represents a state (count of 0s and 1s), and each edge represents a possible modification.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to model the problem with a dynamic programming approach where dp[c0][c1] represents the number of ways to reach that state, starting from the initial state (n, m), and performing modifications until the state (1, 0) or (0, 1), depending on g.\n\nWait, that's a promising idea.\n\nSo, the DP state is (c0, c1), and the value is the number of ways to reach this state via a series of modifications.\n\nThe initial state is (n, m), and the goal is to reach either (1, 0) if g=0 or (0, 1) if g=1.\n\nEach modification can transition to a new state based on the possible ways to merge the last two characters.\n\nBut how?\n\nEach modification step reduces the length by one, and the counts of 0s and 1s change based on the last two characters.\n\nWait, but the last two can vary, so the transition is not straightforward.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that each modification can be represented as a certain transformation on the counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nAs earlier, each modification can have three possible outcomes:\n\n1. Merge two 0s → new c0 = c0 -1, c1 remains.\n2. Merge two 1s → new c1 = c1 -1, c0 remains.\n3. Merge a 0 and 1 → new c0 increases by 1 (since two are removed and replaced by 0), c1 decreases by 1.\n\nWait, no: When you merge a 0 and 1, you replace them with 0. So, the count of 0s increases by 1 (because two 0s would have been replaced by one 0, but in this case, it's a 0 and 1 → replaced by 0). So, the change is:\n\nc0 += 1 (because two characters are removed, one 0 and one 1, and added as one 0. So, the difference is (1-0) for 0s: 1 added.)\n\nc1 -= 1 (since one 1 is removed.)\n\nSo, for each modification, the counts change as per the above.\n\nSo, the transitions are:\n\n- From (c0, c1), you can transition to (c0 -1, c1) if the last two were 00.\n- Or to (c0, c1 -1) if the last two were 11.\n- Or to (c0 +1, c1 -1) if the last two were 01 or 10.\n\nBut the problem is that the last two characters can be any of these possibilities, so the transitions are not uniquely determined by the current state.\n\nThis makes the DP approach challenging, as for each state, we'd have to consider all possible ways to reach it.\n\nBut wait, perhaps we can model the DP state as (c0, c1, last_char), where last_char represents the last character of the string before the next modification. But that might not capture all necessary information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last two characters are needed, but that complicates the state even more.\n\nWait, but perhaps the last character can influence the possible transitions, but not the entire string. So, perhaps the state needs to include the last character.\n\nSo, the state is (c0, c1, last_char), where last_char is either 0 or 1.\n\nBut how many states would that be? For each c0 and c1 up to 105, and last_char, it's manageable.\n\nLet me see: 106 possible c0 values (0 to 105), 106 c1 values, and 2 last_char options. Total of 106 * 106 * 2 = about 22,000 states, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Initialize a DP table where dp[c0][c1][last_char] represents the number of ways to have a string with c0 0s, c1 1s, ending with 'last_char'.\n\n- The transitions are as follows:\n\nFor each state (c0, c1, last_char), we can consider all possible previous states that could lead to this state via a modification.\n\nBut wait, no. Because in the forward process, each modification reduces the string length, so the state (c0, c1, last_char) can only be reached by adding a new character to a shorter string.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the DP in the forward process, considering that each modification step reduces the string length.\n\nSo, the initial string is any binary string with n 0s and m 1s. For each possible way to perform a modification, the string reduces in length by one, and the counts of 0s and 1s change according to the rules.\n\nBut again, without knowing the exact sequence of modifications, this seems difficult.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since each modification is deterministic based on the last two characters, perhaps the DP can model the state as (c0, c1, last_char), and for each such state, track the number of ways to reach it.\n\nThe transitions would be as follows:\n\n1. If the last two characters were 00 → then the next state would have last_char = 0, and the counts would be c0-1, c1.\n\nBut wait, how do we know that the previous state had last_char 0? Because the previous state would have had the second last character as 0, and the last as 0, but that's not tracked.\n\nThis approach seems tricky.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since each modification is determined by the last two characters, perhaps the state should include the last character. So, for a state (c0, c1, last_char), the next state depends on the current last_char and the new character added.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state should include the last two characters, but that's even more complex.\n\nAnother Idea: Instead of tracking the exact sequence of modifications, perhaps we can precompute the possible transitions for each state (c0, c1) based on the possible last two characters.\n\nBut this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps it's better to look for a pattern or mathematical condition that determines whether a string can be reduced to 'g' via modifications.\n\nLet me think about the necessary conditions for the initial string to be reducible to 'g'.\n\nEach modification reduces the length by one, and the counts",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be transformed into a specific character 'g' through a series of modifications. Each modification involves replacing two characters with one, which affects the counts of '0's and '1's in the string.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using dynamic programming (DP) to model the possible states of the string after each modification. The key idea is to track the number of ways to reach each state, defined by the counts of '0's and '1's, as well as the last character of the string before the next modification.\n\n1. **State Representation**: Use a 3-dimensional DP array `dp[c0][c1][last_char]` where `c0` and `c1` are the counts of '0's and '1's respectively, and `last_char` is the last character of the string before the next modification.\n\n2. **Transitions**: For each state, consider all possible previous states that could lead to it via a modification. Each modification can be one of three types:\n   - Replacing two '0's.\n   - Replacing two '1's.\n   - Replacing a '0' and a '1'.\n\n3. **Initialization**: Start from the initial state where the string has exactly `n` '0's and `m` '1's, and no modifications have been performed yet.\n\n4. **Goal Check**: After processing all possible modifications, check if the string can be reduced to the character 'g'. This is done by checking if the final state matches the required counts for 'g'.\n\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, take modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) at each step to ensure numbers remain manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\nmax_c0 = n\nmax_c1 = m\n\n# Initialize DP table\ndp = [[[[0]*2 for _ in range(max_c1+1)] for __ in range(max_c0+1)] for ___ in range(2)]\n\n# Base case: initial state with no modifications\nif g == 0:\n    dp[1][0][0] = 1\nelse:\n    dp[0][1][1] = 1\n\nfor c0 in range(max_c0 + 1):\n    for c1 in range(max_c1 + 1):\n        for last in [0, 1]:\n            current = dp[c0][c1][last]\n            if current == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # Consider all possible previous transitions\n            # Case 1: last two were 00\n            if c0 >= 2:\n                new_last = 0\n                dp[c0 - 2 + 1][c1][new_last] = (\n                    dp[c0 - 2 + 1][c1][new_last] + current\n                ) % MOD\n            \n            # Case 2: last two were 11\n            if c1 >= 2:\n                new_last = 1\n                dp[c0][c1 - 2 + 1][new_last] = (\n                    dp[c0][c1 - 2 + 1][new_last] + current\n                ) % MOD\n            \n            # Case 3: last two were 01 or 10, resulting in 0\n            if c0 >= 1 and c1 >= 1:\n                new_last = 0\n                dp[c0 + 1][c1 - 1][new_last] = (\n                    dp[c0 + 1][c1 - 1][new_last] + current\n                ) % MOD\n            \n            # Case 4: last two were 01 or 10, resulting in 1\n            if c0 >= 1 and c1 >= 1:\n                new_last = 1\n                dp[c0 + 1][c1 - 1][new_last] = (\n                    dp[c0 + 1][c1 - 1][new_last] + current\n                ) % MOD\n\n# Now, compute the answer based on g\nif g == 0:\n    total = dp[1][0][0] + dp[0][1][0]\nelse:\n    total = dp[0][1][1] + dp[1][0][1]\n\nprint(total % MOD)\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution uses dynamic programming to explore all possible states of the string after each modification.
