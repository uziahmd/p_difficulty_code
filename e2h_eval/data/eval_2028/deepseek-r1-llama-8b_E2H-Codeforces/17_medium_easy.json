He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Prefixes and Suffixes.\" Hmm, Ivan has a string s of length n, and I don't know it. He tells me all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so from lengths 1 to n-1). But he doesn't say which are which—whether they're prefixes or suffixes. My task is to determine for each of the 2n-2 given strings whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the actual string s. And output a string of 'P' and 'S' accordingly.\n\nWait, but how do I approach this? Let me think.\n\nSo the input gives me all possible prefixes and suffixes, but not in any particular order. For each string of a certain length, I need to decide if it's a prefix, a suffix, or possibly both (but wait, no, because a proper prefix can't be a suffix unless the entire string is the same as the suffix, but that's only possible if the string is made up of repeated characters. Like \"aaaaa\" would have the prefix \"aa\" and suffix \"aa\").\n\nBut for each string, it's either a prefix, a suffix, or maybe both. Or wait, no. Because each string in the input is a candidate for being either a prefix or a suffix. So for each string, I need to figure out if it's a prefix of s, a suffix of s, or neither? Wait, no. Because according to the problem statement, every string in the input is either a prefix or a suffix of some string s of length n. So each string must be one or the other, but not necessarily both.\n\nWait, no. Because a string could be both a prefix and a suffix of the same s. Like if s is \"abaab\", then the prefix \"ab\" and the suffix \"ba\" might not overlap, but if s is \"aaa\", then the prefix \"aa\" is also a suffix.\n\nWait, no. For the example given in the note, the third case where the input is two strings: 'a' and 'c', with n=2. The output is 'PS'. So the possible s could be 'ac' or 'ca'. In both cases, the first string 'a' is a prefix of 'ac' but a suffix of 'ca'? No, wait, let's see.\n\nWait, for s = 'ac', the prefixes are 'a', 'ac' (but wait, n=2, so improper prefixes are only of length 1). So the only prefix is 'a'. The suffixes are 'c' (length 1). So the given strings are 'a' and 'c'. So 'a' is a prefix, 'c' is a suffix. So output is 'PS'.\n\nIn the other case, s='ca', the prefix is 'c', suffix is 'a'. So the input strings are 'a' and 'c' again. So in that case, 'a' is a suffix, 'c' is a prefix. So the output would be 'SP'.\n\nBut the problem says that any correct assignment is acceptable. So in this case, both 'PS' and 'SP' are acceptable, but the output can be either.\n\nSo the key is to find a way to assign P or S to each string such that there exists at least one possible s that satisfies all these assignments.\n\nHmm. How can I model this?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the string s. The prefixes and suffixes must form a chain that leads up to the entire string.\n\nFor instance, the longest prefix must be the one of length n-1, because any longer string isn't allowed. Similarly, the longest suffix is of length n-1.\n\nWait, but the input may not contain the longest prefix or the longest suffix. Wait, no. Because the input contains exactly 2 strings of each length from 1 to n-1. So for each length l, there are two strings. One is a prefix, the other is a suffix. Or maybe one is a prefix, another is a suffix, but their lengths could vary.\n\nWait, no. Because for a string s, the set of all prefixes includes all possible prefixes of s of lengths 1 to n-1. Similarly, the set of suffixes includes all possible suffixes of lengths 1 to n-1. So for each l, there are two strings in the input of length l: one is a prefix, the other is a suffix. Or perhaps one is a prefix of a longer string and a suffix of a different string. Wait, no, the problem states that the input is for a single s, but the strings are given in arbitrary order.\n\nSo for each l from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings of length l. One is a prefix of s, the other is a suffix of s.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings of that length: one is a prefix candidate, the other is a suffix candidate.\n\nSo my plan is:\n\n1. For each length l, collect the two strings of that length. Let's call them A and B.\n\n2. We need to determine which of A and B is the prefix of s, and which is the suffix.\n\n3. But this determination must be consistent across all l's. Because the prefix for l=1 must be the same as the prefix for l=2, etc., in the sense that the prefix of length l is a prefix of the prefix of length l+1.\n\nWait, that's correct. Because the prefix of length l is a substring of the prefix of length l+1. So for example, the prefix of length 2 must start with the prefix of length 1.\n\nSimilarly, the suffixes must form a chain: the suffix of length l is a suffix of the suffix of length l+1.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- For each l from 1 to n-1, we have two candidates. One is the prefix, the other is the suffix.\n\n- We need to choose for each l whether the first candidate is the prefix and the second is the suffix, or vice versa.\n\n- The selection must be consistent with the fact that the prefix of l is a prefix of the prefix of l+1, and similarly for suffixes.\n\nSo the process is to build the possible options step by step, ensuring that the choices are compatible.\n\nLet's think about building the possible prefixes and suffixes:\n\nWe can represent the possible prefixes as a list where each element is a possible current maximum prefix. Similarly for suffixes.\n\nAt each step l, we have two possible strings: one is the candidate for prefix, the other for suffix.\n\nWait, but for each l, the two strings could be either the prefix or the suffix. So for l, the two options are:\n\nOption 1: A is the prefix, B is the suffix.\n\nOption 2: B is the prefix, A is the suffix.\n\nBut these options must be compatible with the previous steps.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this by considering possible candidates for the current prefix and suffix, based on the previous steps.\n\nWait, here's an idea: for each length l from 1 to n-1, we have two possible candidates, say a and b. We need to choose which of these is the prefix and which is the suffix. However, the choice must satisfy that for l+1, the new prefix starts with the current prefix, and the new suffix ends with the current suffix.\n\nSo, let's model this as a dynamic programming problem. At each step l, we can keep track of possible pairs (prefix_candidate, suffix_candidate), ensuring that the next step's constraints are satisfied.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can construct the possible prefixes and suffixes step by step, ensuring that the constraints are met.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For each l from 1 to n-1, collect the two strings of that length into a list, say groups[l], which has two elements: group[0] and group[1].\n\n2. Now, for each l, we need to decide whether group[0] is the prefix and group[1] is the suffix, or vice versa.\n\n3. The decision for l must be consistent with the decisions for l-1 and l+1.\n\n4. The overall goal is to choose for each l whether the first or second string in the group is the prefix, such that for all l, the prefix of l is a prefix of the prefix of l+1, and the suffix of l is a suffix of the suffix of l+1.\n\nSo how can we model this?\n\nPerhaps we can model the possible options for the current prefix and suffix, and for each l, update these possibilities based on the next l.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. Suppose for l, we have two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: group[0] is prefix, group[1] is suffix.\n\nCase 2: group[1] is prefix, group[0] is suffix.\n\nBut these cases must also be compatible with the next l+1.\n\nWait, but for l+1, we have another group. Let's say the next group has two strings, c and d.\n\nThen, in case 1, the prefix for l+1 must start with the prefix for l. So the prefix for l+1 must be a superstring of the prefix for l.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix for l+1 must end with the suffix for l.\n\nSo, when considering the next group, for each possibility of the current state, we check if the new group's strings can fit as the new prefix and suffix, while satisfying the constraints.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo, the algorithm can proceed as follows:\n\nInitialize possible states for l=1. Each state consists of the current prefix and suffix.\n\nFor l=1, the two strings are A and B.\n\nPossible states after l=1:\n\nState 1: prefix=A, suffix=B.\n\nState 2: prefix=B, suffix=A.\n\nThen, for each subsequent l, for each possible state from the previous step, consider the two possible assignments for the current group, and check if they are compatible with the previous state.\n\nFor each state in the previous step, and for each possible assignment (current group's first is prefix, second is suffix; or vice versa), check if:\n\n- The current group's prefix starts with the previous state's prefix.\n\n- The current group's suffix ends with the previous state's suffix.\n\nIf this is true, then this new assignment is a valid state for the current l.\n\nWe continue this until all l's are processed.\n\nOnce all l's are processed, any of the possible states is a valid assignment, and we can output the corresponding P/S string.\n\nWait, but how do we handle the suffix part? Because the suffix for l+1 must end with the suffix for l.\n\nWait, the suffix for l is a suffix of the suffix for l+1. So the suffix for l must be a suffix of the suffix for l+1. Which means that the suffix for l+1 ends with the suffix for l.\n\nSo, for each transition from l to l+1, the new suffix must end with the old suffix.\n\nSimilarly, the new prefix must start with the old prefix.\n\nSo, the transition function is:\n\nFor each possible state (prev_prefix, prev_suffix) at l, and for each possible assignment (curr_prefix, curr_suffix) at l+1:\n\nCheck:\n\ncurr_prefix starts with prev_prefix.\n\ncurr_suffix ends with prev_suffix.\n\nIf both conditions are met, then (curr_prefix, curr_suffix) is a possible state for l+1.\n\nSo, for each l from 1 to n-2, we take the current possible states, and for each possible assignment of the next group, check if it's compatible.\n\nNow, for l = n-1, the suffix is of length n-1, and the actual string's suffix of length n is s itself. But since the input doesn't include s, perhaps the last step is sufficient.\n\nWait, but the string s of length n is not in the input. So our transitions only go up to l = n-1. So for l = n-1, the suffix is of length n-1, which must be a suffix of s. So for l = n-1, the suffix must be a suffix of s, and the prefix must be a prefix of s.\n\nBut since s is of length n, the prefix for l = n-1 is the first n-1 characters of s, and the suffix is the last n-1 characters.\n\nWait, but since the problem says that all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of some s, the transitions should correctly capture this.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the algorithm is:\n\n- For each l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   - Collect the two strings of length l into a group.\n\n- Then, perform a dynamic programming approach, where for each l, we track all possible possible (prefix, suffix) pairs that are compatible up to that l.\n\n- Start with l=1, possible states are (A, B) and (B, A), where A and B are the two strings of length 1.\n\n- For each subsequent l, for each possible state from the previous step, try both possible assignments of the current group's strings as prefix and suffix, and check if the new assignment is compatible with the previous state.\n\n- After processing all l's, any of the possible states is acceptable, and we can output the corresponding P/S string.\n\nWait, but how do we get the actual s? Oh, wait, no, we don't need to compute s. We just need to assign P or S to each input string.\n\nWait, no, because the input is given in a list, and each string is either a prefix or a suffix. So for each string, we can determine whether it was assigned as a prefix or a suffix in the final state.\n\nSo, for the final state, which is (prefix, suffix) of length n-1, we can map each string in the input to whether it's the prefix, the suffix, or possibly both (but in our case, each string is either a prefix or a suffix of the s).\n\nWait, but for l=n-1, the two strings in the group must be the prefix and the suffix of s. So, in the final state, one is the prefix, the other is the suffix.\n\nThus, for each string in the input, if it's the prefix of the final state, it's marked as 'P'; if it's the suffix, it's marked as 'S'.\n\nBut wait, the same string may appear in multiple groups. For example, a string of length 2 could be the prefix for l=2 and the suffix for l=1.\n\nWait, but no, because each string is of a fixed length. So, for a string of length l, it can only be a prefix or a suffix for that l. It can't be a prefix for another l or a suffix for another l.\n\nWait, no. Because a string like \"a\" could be the prefix for l=1, and a suffix for l=2 (like the string \"aa\" has \"a\" as a suffix). So the same string can be used in different groups.\n\nSo, when we have the final state (prefix, suffix) for l = n-1, we need to map each string in the input to whether it's the prefix of the final state, the suffix, or neither.\n\nWait, no. Because each string in the input is either a prefix for its own l or a suffix for its own l, depending on the assignments.\n\nWait, but the input contains all the prefixes and suffixes for s, grouped by their lengths. So for each string in the input, it is either a prefix for its l or a suffix for its l, but not both.\n\nBecause each string is part of a group for a specific l.\n\nSo, for each string in the input, if it is chosen as the prefix for its l, it's a 'P'; else, it's an 'S'.\n\nBut how do we track which strings are which?\n\nWait, perhaps during the DP process, for each state, we can track which of the group's strings were chosen as prefix and suffix.\n\nBut that sounds complicated. Alternatively, once we have the final state (prefix, suffix) for l = n-1, we can compare each string in the input to see whether it matches the prefix, the suffix, or neither.\n\nWait, but each string in the input belongs to exactly one group (its own length l). So for each string s_i in the input, it's either in the group for its l as the prefix or the suffix.\n\nSo, for each string s_i, its group is determined by its length.\n\nIn the final state, for each group l, the two strings are either (prefix, suffix) or (suffix, prefix). So, for each group l, we can determine which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nThus, for each string in the input, we can look up its group, and in that group, see whether it's the prefix or the suffix in the final state.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Group all strings by their lengths. So, for each l, group contains the two strings.\n\n2. Perform the DP to find all possible (prefix, suffix) pairs for l = n-1.\n\n3. For each group l, in the final state, determine which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n4. For each string in the input, find its group l, and based on the final state of that group, mark it as 'P' or 'S'.\n\nSo, now the challenge is to implement this.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nFirst, group the strings by their lengths.\n\nWe can create a dictionary where the key is the length l, and the value is a list of two strings.\n\nThen, for each l from 1 to n-1, we can get the two strings.\n\nNext, perform the DP.\n\nThe initial state is l=1, with two possible states: (A, B) and (B, A), where A and B are the two strings of length 1.\n\nThen, for each l from 2 to n-1:\n\n   For each possible state in the previous step (i.e., for l-1):\n\n      For each possible assignment of the current group's two strings (assign first as prefix, second as suffix; or second as prefix, first as suffix):\n\n         Check if the new prefix starts with the previous prefix.\n\n         Check if the new suffix ends with the previous suffix.\n\n         If both conditions are true, add this new assignment to the current possible states.\n\nOnce all l's are processed, any of the possible states is acceptable.\n\nBut how do we represent the possible states?\n\nEach state is a pair: (current_prefix, current_suffix).\n\nWe can represent this as a set of tuples.\n\nSo, for each step, we'll have a set of possible tuples.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut wait, what about the initial step? For l=1, the two strings are A and B.\n\nSo, the initial possible states are two:\n\nstate1: (A, B)\n\nstate2: (B, A)\n\nThen, for l=2:\n\n   group = [C, D]\n\n   For each state in the previous step:\n\n      For each possible assignment of C and D:\n\n         Check if the new prefix starts with the previous state's prefix.\n\n         Check if the new suffix ends with the previous state's suffix.\n\nSo, for each state in the previous step, we generate possible new states.\n\nNow, in code terms:\n\n- Read all the 2n-2 strings, and group them by their lengths.\n\n- For each l from 1 to n-1, collect the two strings.\n\n- Initialize a dictionary dp, where dp[l] is a set of possible (prefix, suffix) tuples.\n\n- dp[1] = {(s1, s2), (s2, s1)}, where s1 and s2 are the two strings of length 1.\n\n- For each l from 2 to n-1:\n\n   current_group = groups[l]\n\n   prev_states = dp[l-1]\n\n   current_states = set()\n\n   for (prev_p, prev_s) in prev_states:\n\n       # Try assigning current_group[0] as prefix, current_group[1] as suffix\n\n       new_p = current_group[0]\n\n       new_s = current_group[1]\n\n       if new_p.startswith(prev_p) and new_s.endswith(prev_s):\n\n           current_states.add( (new_p, new_s) )\n\n       # Try assigning current_group[1] as prefix, current_group[0] as suffix\n\n       new_p = current_group[1]\n\n       new_s = current_group[0]\n\n       if new_p.startswith(prev_p) and new_s.endswith(prev_s):\n\n           current_states.add( (new_p, new_s) )\n\n   dp[l] = current_states\n\nOnce all l's are processed, the possible states are dp[n-1].\n\nThen, for each group l, we need to determine which string is the prefix and which is the suffix in the final state.\n\nWait, no. Because for each group l, the two strings are in the group, and in the final state for l = n-1, the two strings are either (p, s) or (s, p), depending on the state.\n\nSo, for each group l, we can check the final state and mark the two strings as 'P' or 'S'.\n\nBut the problem is that the group for l=1 may have the same strings as another group. So, for example, a string of length 1 may be the prefix for l=1 and the suffix for l=2.\n\nThus, for each string in the input, we need to find its group (by its length) and then determine whether in that group's final state, it's the prefix or the suffix.\n\nWait, but the group's final state is determined by the DP. So for each group l, the two strings in the group have their roles determined by the final state.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each group l:\n\n   the two strings are group_strs = [s0, s1]\n\n   for each state in dp[n-1]:\n\n       if state is (s0, s1): then for group l, s0 is prefix, s1 is suffix.\n\n       elif state is (s1, s0): then s1 is prefix, s0 is suffix.\n\nSo, for each group l, in the final state, the two strings have their roles.\n\nOnce we have this mapping, we can create a list of 'P' and 'S' for each string in the input.\n\nBut wait, the input is given in a particular order. So the input list is the list of all strings, in the order they were read.\n\nWait, no. Because the input is given as 2n-2 lines, each being a string. So the order is as per the input.\n\nSo, for each string in the input, we need to find its group (based on length), and then within that group, determine whether it's the prefix or suffix in the final state.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read all 2n-2 strings into a list, say all_strings.\n\n2. Group the strings by their length: groups[l] = list of two strings.\n\n3. Process the groups using the DP to find all possible final states for l = n-1.\n\n4. For each group l, determine the two strings' roles based on the final states.\n\n5. For each string in all_strings, find its group, and then whether it's the prefix or suffix in that group's final state.\n\n6. Create the output string by marking each string as 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nBut wait, how do we handle multiple possible final states? Because the DP may have more than one possible final state. For example, in the third example, where the input is ['a', 'c'], the DP may have two possible final states.\n\nBut the problem says that any correct assignment is acceptable. So, as long as for each string, it's marked as 'P' or 'S' based on the group's final state, regardless of which of the possible final states is taken.\n\nWait, but in the DP, the final states are all possible ones. So for a group l, in the final states, for each possible state, the group's two strings have their roles determined.\n\nBut for the output, each string must be assigned as 'P' or 'S' based on the group's final state.\n\nSo, if in the final states, for group l, there are multiple possible states, how to choose which one to use for each string?\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the assignment is correct. So, any of the possible assignments is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps, for the purpose of the output, any of the possible assignments is acceptable.\n\nSo, for the output, for each string, we can choose any possible assignment that is consistent with the final states.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each group l, the two possible states (either (s0, s1) or (s1, s0)) are both acceptable, but for the output, we can choose either.\n\nBut wait, this may not hold for all l's. Because for higher l's, the assignments must be consistent.\n\nSo, perhaps the DP will result in a single possible state for l = n-1, making it easy.\n\nBut in the sample input, for example, the third case, the DP for l=2 (n=2) may have two possible states.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can pick any of the possible states for each l, as long as it's compatible.\n\nBut how do I represent this in the code?\n\nWait, perhaps for the output, any assignment that is compatible with at least one possible final state is acceptable.\n\nThus, the code can choose any of the possible final states for l = n-1, and for each group, select the assignment that fits that final state.\n\nWait, but the final states may have multiple options, and each option affects the mapping of the groups.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each group l, in the final state, for each possible state in dp[n-1], determine whether the two strings are in (p, s) or (s, p) order.\n\nThen, for each string in the group, mark it as 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nBut how to choose which state to use for the group.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can process all possible final states, and for each string, collect all possible 'P' or 'S' assignments that are compatible with any of the final states.\n\nBut that's computationally expensive, but since n is small (up to 100), it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can choose the first possible state for each group and proceed.\n\nBut that's risky because it may not be compatible with other groups.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can choose one possible state for each group, ensuring that all groups are compatible.\n\nBut that's complicated.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the final state is unique. Because the string s is uniquely determined by the chain of prefixes and suffixes.\n\nWait, no. Because the sample input 3 shows that there are two possible s's: 'ac' and 'ca'. Thus, the final state for l=1 is either (a, c) or (c, a), leading to different s's.\n\nSo, the DP may have multiple possible final states, which correspond to different possible s's.\n\nThus, the code must consider all possible final states and for each string, mark it as 'P' or 'S' based on all possible states.\n\nBut how to aggregate this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each string, it can be 'P' in some cases and 'S' in others, but the output requires that for each string, it is either 'P' or 'S' in the output.\n\nSo, the output can have multiple possible correct answers, but the code needs to produce one.\n\nThus, the approach is:\n\n- Once the DP is done, for each group l, the two strings can be in either order as (prefix, suffix) or (suffix, prefix).\n\n- For the output, for each string, if it's the first in the group's possible state, it's 'P'; else 'S'.\n\nBut since the group's possible states may vary, the code can choose any possible state for each group, as long as it's compatible with the DP.\n\nBut how to represent this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each group, the code can choose the first possible state in the DP's final states.\n\nBut this may not always work, as the same group may have different states in different final states.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can, for each group l, collect all possible mappings (whether the first string is prefix or suffix, and vice versa), and then for each string in the group, mark it as 'P' or 'S' based on all possible mappings.\n\nBut then, for a string, it can have multiple possible assignments, which is not allowed in the output.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a string where each character corresponds to a string in the input. So, for each string in the input, determine whether it is a prefix or a suffix based on the group's final state.\n\nBut how to get the group's final state.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can process each group l, and for each possible state in the DP's final states, mark the two strings as 'P' or 'S' in their respective positions. Then, for each string, collect all possible labels, and choose one that is consistent across all groups.\n\nWait, but that's computationally intensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can iterate through all possible final states, and for each, build the output string, and see if it's valid.\n\nBut since n is small, this is feasible.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read all the strings into a list, and group them by their lengths.\n\n2. Perform the DP to get all possible final states for l = n-1.\n\n3. For each final state, process each group l, and for each group, determine the two strings' roles.\n\n4. For each string in the input, collect all possible 'P' or 'S' assignments based on all possible final states.\n\n5. Choose an assignment where each string is assigned to 'P' or 'S' in a way that is compatible with all groups.\n\nBut this is tricky because a string may belong to multiple groups (unlikely, because each string has a unique length). Wait, no. Each string has a unique length, as per the grouping.\n\nSo, for each string, it's part of exactly one group.\n\nThus, for each string, its assignment is determined by its group's final state.\n\nBut since the group's final state can vary, the string's assignment can vary.\n\nThus, the code can pick any possible assignment of the group's final state, and for each string, mark it as 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nBut how to ensure that the assignment is consistent across all groups.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can pick one possible final state for each group, and then for each string, assign 'P' or 'S' based on whether it's the prefix or suffix in that group's final state.\n\nBut how to ensure that the group's final state is compatible with other groups.\n\nAh! Because the DP process ensures that the transitions are compatible, any final state in dp[n-1] is a valid assignment. So, the code can pick any of the possible final states, process each group l accordingly, and build the output.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\n- For the final state (prefix, suffix) of l = n-1, process each group l:\n\n   For group l, the two strings are s0 and s1.\n\n   If in the final state, the prefix is s0 and suffix is s1, then s0 is 'P' and s1 is 'S' in the output for this group.\n\n   Else, s1 is 'P' and s0 is 'S'.\n\n- But the group's final state depends on the selected final_state from dp[n-1].\n\nWait, no. Because the group's final state is part of the DP's process. So for each group l, the two strings can be in either (p, s) or (s, p) order, based on the final_state.\n\nThus, for each group l, the code can loop through all possible final_states and for each, mark the two strings as 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nBut then, how to combine all groups into a single output.\n\nWait, but each group's final state is independent in the DP. So, the code must choose a single final state for each group, but the groups are linked via the transitions.\n\nWait, no. Because the DP already enforces that the transitions between l and l+1 are compatible. So, the final states are all compatible.\n\nThus, the code can choose any of the final states in dp[n-1], and for each group, determine the two strings' roles.\n\nBut, for a given group, the code can have multiple possible assignments. For example, in the third sample input, for l=1, the two possible assignments are (a, c) and (c, a).\n\nThus, the code can choose any of the possible final states for each group, but it's better to choose a single final state for all groups.\n\nThus, the code can pick one possible final state for l = n-1, and then for each group, determine the two strings' roles.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read all strings into a list, and group them by their lengths.\n\n2. Perform the DP to get all possible final states for l = n-1.\n\n3. For each possible final_state in dp[n-1]:\n\n   a. For each group l, determine which string is the prefix and which is the suffix in the final_state.\n\n   b. For each string in the group, mark it as 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\n   c. Build the output string by going through the original list of strings, looking up their group and their role.\n\n   d. Check if this output is valid.\n\n4. Once a valid output is found, print it.\n\nBut how to implement step 3d: check if the output is valid.\n\nWait, but the DP ensures that the final_state is compatible with all previous groups. So, any of the possible final_states is a valid assignment.\n\nThus, the code can pick the first possible final_state in dp[n-1], and use it to build the output.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as follows:\n\n- After performing the DP and obtaining dp[n-1], pick the first final_state.\n\n- For each group l, determine which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n- For each string in the input, find its group, and mark it as 'P' or 'S' based on the group's final_state.\n\n- Then, construct the output string.\n\nBut wait, the groups are for each l, and in the final_state for l = n-1, the two strings are either in order (p, s) or (s, p).\n\nSo, for each group l, the two strings can be in either order.\n\nThus, for each group l, the code can check whether the final_state for l is (s0, s1) or (s1, s0).\n\nBut how does the code know which is which?\n\nBecause for each group l, the code can look at the final_state and see whether the two strings in the group match the order.\n\nThus, for each group l:\n\n   group_strs = groups[l]\n\n   for each state in dp[n-1]:\n\n       if state == (group_strs[0], group_strs[1]):\n\n           then in this group, group_strs[0] is prefix, group_strs[1] is suffix.\n\n       elif state == (group_strs[1], group_strs[0]):\n\n           then group_strs[1] is prefix, group_strs[0] is suffix.\n\nSo, for each group, the code can determine the two possible assignments.\n\nBut since the code has to pick one, it can choose the first occurrence.\n\nWait, but how to do this.\n\nSo, the code can, for each group l, look at the final_states and see if the group's two strings are in either order. Then, for each group, it can note which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nThus, the code can create a dictionary for each group l, indicating which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nOnce this is done, for each string in the input, the code can find its group, and then determine whether it's the prefix or suffix in that group.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead all the strings, group them.\n\nPerform the DP to get the final_states.\n\nFor each group l:\n\n   group_strs = groups[l]\n\n   for state in final_states:\n\n       if state is (group_strs[0], group_strs[1]):\n\n           prefix = group_strs[0]\n\n           suffix = group_strs[1]\n\n           break\n\n       elif state is (group_strs[1], group_strs[0]):\n\n           prefix = group_strs[1]\n\n           suffix = group_strs[0]\n\n           break\n\nThus, for each group l, the code determines which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nThen, for each string in the input, find its group l, and determine if it's the prefix or suffix in that group.\n\nThus, the code can build the output.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nRead all the strings into a list.\n\nGroup them by their lengths.\n\nPerform the DP.\n\nFor each group l, determine the two strings' roles (prefix and suffix).\n\nThen, for each string in the input, find its group, and assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nThus, the code can be structured.\n\nNow, time to write the code.\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen, read 2n-2 lines, stripping any newline characters.\n\nGroup the strings by their lengths.\n\nThen, perform the DP:\n\nInitialize dp as a dictionary where dp[l] is a set of tuples.\n\ndp[1] = {(s1, s2), (s2, s1)}.\n\nFor l from 2 to n-1:\n\n   group = groups[l]\n\n   prev_states = dp[l-1]\n\n   current_states = set()\n\n   for prev_p, prev_s in prev_states:\n\n       # Try first as prefix, second as suffix\n\n       new_p = group[0]\n\n       new_s = group[1]\n\n       if new_p.startswith(prev_p) and new_s.endswith(prev_s):\n\n           current_states.add( (new_p, new_s) )\n\n       # Try second as prefix, first as suffix\n\n      ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of a hypothetical string `s` of length `n`. The input provides all possible prefixes and suffixes of `s`, but not in any specific order.

Each length from 1 to n-1 will have exactly two strings.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: We use a DP approach to track possible states of the string `s` as we process each length from 1 to n-1. Each state consists of a possible prefix and suffix of the string at that length.\n3. **Transition Between States**: For each length, we consider both possible assignments of the two strings (one as prefix and the other as suffix) and check if they are compatible with the previous state.\n4. **Determine Final States**: After processing all lengths, we determine the valid final states for the longest prefix and suffix (length n-1).\n5. **Classify Each String**: Using the final states, we classify each string as 'P' or 'S' based on whether it is the prefix or suffix in its respective group.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nstrings = [input().strip() for _ in range(2 * n - 2)]\n\n# Group strings by their lengths\ngroups = {}\nfor s in strings:\n    l = len(s)\n    if l not in groups:\n        groups[l] = []\n    groups[l].append(s)\n\n# Initialize DP\ndp = {}\ndp[1] = set()\nif len(groups[1]) == 2:\n    s0, s1 = groups[1]\n    dp[1].add((s0, s1))\n    dp[1].add((s1, s0))\n\nfor l in range(2, n):\n    current_group = groups.get(l, [])\n    if not current_group:\n        continue  # Shouldn't happen as per problem statement\n    prev_states = dp[l-1]\n    current_states = set()\n    for (prev_p, prev_s) in prev_states:\n        # Try current_group[0] as prefix, current_group[1] as suffix\n        new_p = current_group[0]\n        new_s = current_group[1]\n        if new_p.startswith(prev_p) and new_s.endswith(prev_s):\n            current_states.add((new_p, new_s))\n        # Try current_group[1] as prefix, current_group[0] as suffix\n        new_p = current_group[1]\n        new_s = current_group[0]\n        if new_p.startswith(prev_p) and new_s.endswith(prev_s):\n            current_states.add((new_p, new_s))\n    dp[l] = current_states\n\n# Now, process each group to find their P/S\nfinal_states = dp[n-1]\n\n# For each group, determine which string is P and S\ngroup_assignments = {}\nfor l in groups:\n    group = groups[l]\n    possible_states = []\n    for state in final_states:\n        if state[0] == group[0] and state[1] == group[1]:\n            possible_states.append('P')\n            possible_states.append('S')\n            break\n        elif state[0] == group[1] and state[1] == group[0]:\n            possible_states.append('S')\n            possible_states.append('P')\n            break\n    # If no state found, but according to problem statement, it's guaranteed to exist\n    if not possible_states:\n        pass  # should not happen\n    else:\n        # Choose the first occurrence\n        group_assignments[l] = possible_states\n\n# Build the output string\noutput = []\nfor s in strings:\n    l = len(s)\n    if l not in group_assignments:\n        continue  # shouldn't happen\n    assignment = group_assignments[l]\n    if assignment[0] == 'P':\n        output.append('P')\n    else:\n        output.append('S')\n\nprint(''.join(output))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Grouping Strings**: Strings are grouped by their lengths to facilitate processing each length separately.\n2. **DP Initialization**: We start with the smallest length (1) and initialize the possible states for the prefix and suffix.\n3. **State Transitions**: For each subsequent length, we check both possible assignments of the current group's strings and transition from the previous states if they are compatible.\n4. **Final States**: After processing all lengths, we determine the valid final states for the longest prefix and suffix.\n5. **Classification**: Using the final states, each string is classified as 'P' or 'S' based on its role in its respective group.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly classify each string while considering all possible valid configurations of the string `s`.",
