There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a tennis tournament where players are eliminated in each game, and the tournament grid isn't fixed yet. But there's a specific rule: two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. My task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in.\n\nHmm, right. So the winner needs to play as many games as possible while following that rule. Let me think about how the tournament could be structured to maximize this.\n\nLet's consider some examples first. Like the sample input:\n\nFor n=2, the winner plays once. That's straightforward.\n\nn=3: The winner plays two games. How? Maybe the initial structure has them beat two opponents, but wait, how does that work? Oh, because after the first game, the winner has 1 game. Then, in the next round, they can play someone who also has 1 game. So two total.\n\nWait, another example: n=4. The sample says the answer is 2. Wait, how? Because if the winner plays two games, but how can that happen with four players?\n\nWait, maybe the structure is such that the winner plays two games, each time against someone who has a similar number of games. Like, in the first round, the winner plays someone (game count 0 for both before the game), then in the second round, plays someone else who has also played one game. That way, each step the difference is at most one.\n\nWait, but how does that work for higher numbers? Let's say n=10. The output is 4. How?\n\nI think the key is to model the problem in terms of the Fibonacci sequence. Because each game the winner plays requires that the opponent has either the same number of games or one less. So it's similar to the Fibonacci staircase.\n\nSo, let's model it as a Fibonacci-like problem. The maximum number of games is the largest k such that the sum of the first k Fibonacci numbers (with certain initial conditions) is less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly the Fibonacci sum, but something along those lines.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose f(k) is the minimum number of players required for the winner to play k games. For example:\n\nf(1) = 2 (needs at least two players for one game)\nf(2) = 3 (winner plays two games, each time requiring an opponent with 0 or 1 games. So first game: 1 vs 0. Second game: 1 vs 1. So total players needed: 3)\nf(3) = 5? Because to play three games, the winner must have opponents with 0, 1, and 2 games respectively. So for the third game, the opponent must have played two games, which implies that they themselves had to have played one game before. So the opponents' trees add up.\n\nWait, maybe the recurrence is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) + 1. Because for the k-th game, the opponent could have played k-1 games, which would require f(k-1) players, and the opponent's previous game would come from a subtree of f(k-2). Hmm, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of Fibonacci numbers: the minimal number of players needed to have a winner play k games is f(k+2), where f is the Fibonacci sequence starting with f(1)=2, f(2)=3, etc.\n\nWait, let's try calculating for small k:\n\nk=1: need 2 players → f(3) is 3? Or maybe f(2) is 2.\nWait, maybe the Fibonacci sequence starts as 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc. So f(1)=2, f(2)=3, f(3)=5, f(4)=8, f(5)=13.\n\nSo for n=10, we look for the largest k where f(k) <= 10. Let's see:\n\nf(1)=2 ≤10\nf(2)=3 ≤10\nf(3)=5 ≤10\nf(4)=8 ≤10\nf(5)=13 >10. So the largest k is 4. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes! So the approach is to find the largest k such that the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games is less than or equal to n.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum k where the (k+2)-th term in this modified Fibonacci sequence is <=n.\n\nWait, wait. Let me re-express this:\n\nWe can model the minimal number of players as a function where:\n\nm(k) = m(k-1) + m(k-2)\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, following a specific rule where two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the problem can be modeled using a Fibonacci-like sequence. The minimal number of players required for the winner to play `k` games can be represented by a sequence where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, starting with 2 and 3. This sequence helps us determine the maximum number of games the winner can play without violating the given rule.\n\n1. **Model the Problem with Fibonacci Sequence**: The minimal number of players needed for the winner to play `k` games follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, if `f(k)` represents the minimal number of players needed, then `f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)` with initial conditions `f(1) = 2` and `f(2) = 3`.\n2. **Find the Maximum k**: For a given number of players `n`, we need to find the largest `k` such that `f(k) <= n`. This is done by iterating through the Fibonacci sequence and checking the condition until it no longer holds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef max_games(n):\n    a, b = 2, 3\n    k = 1\n    while b <= n:\n        k += 1\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return k - 1\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(max_games(n))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start with the first two values of the sequence, `a = 2` and `b = 3`, corresponding to `f(1)` and `f(2)`.\n2. **Iterate Through the Sequence**: Using a loop, we generate the next terms of the sequence by summing the previous two terms (`a` and `b`). For each new term, we check if it exceeds `n`. If it does not, we increment the count of games `k`.\n3. **Return the Result**: Once the loop exits, `k` holds the maximum number of games the winner can play, which is then returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of games by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
