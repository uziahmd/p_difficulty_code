He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about converting a number from one base to another, but with some Roman numeral rules involved. Oh right, and the bases can be up to 25, which is manageable.\n\nThe input gives me two integers a and b. Wait, but b could be 'R', which indicates that the target base uses Roman numerals. Interesting. Then, there's a string c which is in base a. My task is to convert this into base b, but using Roman numerals if needed.\n\nLet me break this down. So first, I need to parse the input correctly. The first line has a and b, but b might be R. The second line is the number c in base a, possibly with leading zeros.\n\nThe output should be the same number in base b, without leading zeros. And if the target base is greater than 10, I use letters A-Z for 10 and beyond. If it's using Roman numerals (i.e., b is R), then I have to represent the number according to Roman rules, considering subtractive combinations like IV for 4, IX for 9, etc.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read a and b. Determine whether the target is a numeric base or Roman.\n2. Convert the given number c from base a to a decimal (base 10) integer.\n3. Then, convert this decimal number into base b, but using Roman numerals if b is R.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the conversion is directly from base a to base b, but when the target is Roman, we have to represent the number using Roman symbols instead of digits.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that each door's parts are a, either b or R, c, and then empty. So when the second part is R, it's the Roman system. So for the target, if b is R, we have to output the number as a Roman numeral. Otherwise, output it in base b as a string, omitting leading zeros.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Parse a and b. If b is R, then target is Roman. Else, target is base b as a string.\n- Convert the given c from base a to a decimal value.\n- Then, convert this decimal value to the target representation.\n\nBut how to handle the conversion when the target is Roman? Because in that case, each digit in the number needs to be processed according to Roman rules.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when the target is Roman, the entire number is represented as a Roman numeral, not digit-wise. For example, the number 5 in base 10 is written as V, not as the individual digits 5 in base 13 or something.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the number is converted into a decimal, and then into Roman numerals. So for example, if c is 16 in base R (which is base 5?), wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, the input is c in base a. So I first convert that to a decimal integer. Then, if the target base is R (meaning Roman numerals), I represent that decimal number as a Roman numeral. Otherwise, I represent it in base b, using digits or letters as appropriate.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the steps are:\n\n1. Parse a and b. If b is 'R', target is Roman. Else, target is base b as a string.\n2. Read c as a string in base a.\n3. Convert c from base a to a decimal integer D.\n4. If target is Roman:\n   a. Convert D to Roman numerals, following the rules.\n5. Else:\n   a. Convert D to base b, ensuring no leading zeros.\n\nSo the main parts are converting from base a to decimal, then handling the target representation.\n\nFirst, let's think about the base a to decimal conversion. Since c can be up to 103 digits long, we need an efficient way to process it. But since a is up to 25, it's manageable.\n\nImplementing a function to convert a string in base a to decimal: iterate through each character, multiply by a^position, sum all.\n\nWait, but the string can be very long, but in Python, even with 1000 digits, it's manageable as it handles big integers.\n\nNext, for the target conversion:\n\nIf target is Roman, then we need to write D as a Roman numeral. How do we do that?\n\nRoman numerals have specific values for each character. We can create a mapping from characters to their values. Also, we need to handle the subtractive cases like IV, IX, XL, XC, CD, CM.\n\nSo for the Roman conversion, perhaps we can find the largest possible Roman components and subtract them from D, then proceed with the remainder.\n\nFor example, for D=1999, it's MCMXCIX.\n\nSo the approach is to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another. The target base can either be a numeric base or the Roman numeral system. The conversion involves parsing the input, converting the number to a decimal (base 10) integer, and then converting it to the target base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Parse Input**: Read the input values which include two integers `a` and `b`, where `b` might be 'R' indicating Roman numerals. Also, read the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Convert to Decimal**: Convert the number `c` from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer.\n3. **Determine Target Conversion**:\n   - If the target base is Roman (`b` is 'R'), convert the decimal number to a Roman numeral.\n   - Otherwise, convert the decimal number to the specified base `b`.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the result without leading zeros.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef roman_to_int(s):\n    roman_map = {'I':1, 'V':5, 'X':10, 'L':50, 'C':100, 'D':500, 'M':1000}\n    total = 0\n    prev_value = 0\n    for c in reversed(s):\n        value = roman_map[c]\n        if value < prev_value:\n            total -= value\n        else:\n            total += value\n        prev_value = value\n    return total\n\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            num -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    a = int(input[idx])\n    idx +=1\n    b = input[idx]\n    idx +=1\n    c = input[idx]\n    idx +=1\n    \n    # Convert c from base a to decimal\n    decimal = 0\n    base_a = a\n    for ch in c:\n        decimal = decimal * base_a + int(ch)\n    \n    # Determine target type\n    if b == 'R':\n        print(int_to_roman(decimal))\n    else:\n        if decimal == 0:\n            print('')\n        else:\n            # Convert to base b\n            s = ''\n            remaining = decimal\n            while remaining > 0:\n                remainder = remaining % base_a\n                s = str(remainder) + s\n                remaining = remaining // base_a\n            # Remove leading zeros\n            print(s.lstrip('0') if s else '')\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the base `a`, target `b`, and the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The function converts the string `c` from base `a` to a decimal integer by iterating through each character and computing the sum.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target is Roman numerals, the function `int_to_roman` converts the decimal number to a Roman numeral string using predefined mappings and rules.\n4. **Numeric Base Conversion**: If the target is a numeric base, the function converts the decimal number to the specified base, ensuring no leading zeros.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed based on the target conversion type.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion process, ensuring correctness even for very large numbers up to the problem's constraints.",
