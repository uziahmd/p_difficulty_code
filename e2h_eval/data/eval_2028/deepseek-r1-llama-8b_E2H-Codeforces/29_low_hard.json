Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem statement says that Andrew and Eugene are playing a game where they manipulate a string of digits through a series of substitution queries. After processing all the queries, we need to compute the resulting number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nHmm. So the initial string is s, and each query is of the form di → ti. This means that every occurrence of digit di in the current string is replaced by ti. For example, if s is '123123' and the query is \"2→00\", then replacing all '2's with '00' gives '10031003'. Another example is when a query is \"3→\", which replaces all '3's with empty strings, so the string becomes '1212'.\n\nWait, but the order of the queries matters. Each query is processed in the order given. So the first query is applied, then the second, etc.\n\nThe output is the remainder when the final string is treated as a number divided by 1e9+7. Also, leading zeros are ignored, except when the entire string is zero—then it's considered as zero.\n\nSo how do I approach this? Well, the straightforward way would be to process each query in order, updating the string accordingly. But wait, if the string is long, and n is up to 105, this approach might be feasible because the maximum possible length after each substitution could be manageable.\n\nBut wait, the initial string can be up to 105 characters. Each substitution can potentially replace a single character with a longer or shorter string. So for each query, for each occurrence of di in the current string, we replace it with ti. So for each query, the string's length could change significantly.\n\nBut since the maximum n is 105, and each substitution step could take O(L) time where L is the current length of the string, the total time complexity should be manageable.\n\nSo let's think about the steps:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n2. Read n queries.\n3. For each query, process it in the order given:\n   a. For each character in the current string, check if it matches di.\n   b. If it does, replace it with ti.\n   c. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n4. After all queries are processed, compute the value of the resulting string modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but the problem is that after substitutions, the string could be very long. For example, if you have a query that replaces '0' with '0000', and you apply it multiple times, the length can explode exponentially. But the constraints say that the sum of the lengths of ti across all queries is up to 105. So even if each substitution adds some length, the overall string can't get too big beyond 105 * something manageable.\n\nWait, no. Because each substitution replaces a single digit with a string. So each substitution can multiply the string's length by the number of occurrences. But considering that the initial string is up to 105, and each substitution can add a lot, but the sum of the lengths of ti is up to 105, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: for each query, the ti can be any length. For example, a query like '0→11111' would replace each 0 with five 1s. So after one substitution, the string's length increases by a factor of 5 for every 0 present. But the sum of ti lengths is 105, meaning that in the worst case, each substitution can add up to 105 characters.\n\nWait, the sum of the lengths of ti for all queries is up to 105. So for each query, the ti string can be up to 105 in total across all queries. So the maximum possible length after each substitution is manageable.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: the initial string is up to 105. Then each substitution can add ti's length minus 1 (since we're replacing one digit with len(ti) digits). So for the first substitution, if ti has length m, the new string length becomes initial + (m-1)*number_of_replaced_digits. But the sum of all ti lengths is 105, so each substitution's ti can be up to 105 in total.\n\nBut over n=105 queries, the maximum possible string length is 105 + 104*(something), but perhaps it's manageable because each substitution is O(L) where L is the current length.\n\nSo processing each query by scanning the string and replacing each di with ti seems feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Start with s as the initial string.\n- For each query in the list of queries:\n   - di is the first character of the query, before '->'.\n   - ti is the rest of the line after '->'.\n   - Replace all occurrences of di in the current string with ti.\n-",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on an initial string of digits. Each query specifies replacing a digit with another string, and we need to compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Start by reading the initial string and the number of queries.\n2. **Process Queries**: For each query, replace every occurrence of the specified digit in the current string with the given substring.\n3. **Compute Result**: After processing all queries, convert the resulting string into a number and compute its value modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThe key steps involve efficiently handling each substitution query and ensuring that the string is updated correctly for each query.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    query = input().split('->')\n    di = query[0]\n    ti = query[1]\n    s = s.replace(di, ti)\n\nif not s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    num = 0\n    for c in s:\n        num = (num * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n    print(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from standard input.\n2. **Processing Each Query**: For each query, the digit to be replaced (`di`) and the replacement string (`ti`) are extracted. The current string `s` is then updated by replacing all occurrences of `di` with `ti`.\n3. **Computing the Result**: After all queries are processed, the resulting string is converted into a number. Each character of the string is processed from left to right, building the number and taking the modulo at each step to prevent overflow and ensure efficiency.\n\nThis approach ensures that each substitution is handled correctly and efficiently, even for the maximum constraints, by leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities and modular arithmetic.",
