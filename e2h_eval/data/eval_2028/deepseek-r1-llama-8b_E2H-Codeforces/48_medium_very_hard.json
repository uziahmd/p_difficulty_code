He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about converting a number from one base to another, but with a twist involving Roman numerals. Oh right, because the second part of each door can be either an integer or 'R', which represents the Roman numeral system.\n\nLet me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, each door has four parts. The first is an integer a, the second is either b (integer) or R. Then the third is c (integer), and the fourth is empty. To open the door, we need to convert c from base a to base b, but if the second part is R, then we have to use Roman numerals for the conversion.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait, the problem says that c is written in base a, and we need to write it in base b. But if the second part is R, then perhaps the conversion involves using the Roman numeral system for the output.\n\nHmm, looking at the sample input:\n\nIn the first example, the input is '10 2\\n1', which I think means a=10, b=2, and c is 1 in base 10. Wait, no, wait—the second line is the next line, which is c in base a. So in that case, the c is '1' in base 10, which is 1 in decimal. We need to convert that to base 2, which is 1. So the output is '1'.\n\nAnother sample: the input is '16 R\\n5'. So a is 16, b is R, meaning Roman numerals. c is 5 in base 16, which is 5 in decimal. So converting 5 to Roman is 'V', which is the output.\n\nWait, but how does the conversion work when the second part is R? Because in that case, the output is a Roman numeral, regardless of the original base a and the target base b.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in the Roman Empire.\" So when the second part is R, it means that the output is to be represented as a Roman numeral, not necessarily in base b.\n\nWait, no, perhaps that's not exactly right. Let me think.\n\nThe door's second part is either b or R. So, if it's R, then when opening the door, the c in base a is converted into Roman numerals. Otherwise, it's converted into base b.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read a and b (b can be R).\n- Read c in base a.\n- If the second part is R, convert c (interpreted as a number) to Roman numerals.\n- Else, convert c (interpreted as a number) to base b.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the key is to parse c as a number in base a, then output it as a string in base b if the second part is not R, else as a Roman numeral.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Parse a and b. Note that b can be 'R', which indicates that the output is to be in Roman numerals.\n2. Parse c as a string in base a. Convert it to a decimal (integer) value.\n3. If b is not 'R', then convert the decimal value to base b as a string, without leading zeros.\n4. If b is 'R', then convert the decimal value to Roman numerals as a string.\n5. Output the result.\n\nSo, the main tasks here are:\n\n- Implementing a function to convert a string in base a to a decimal integer.\n- Implementing a function to convert a decimal integer to Roman numerals.\n- Implementing a function to convert a decimal integer to base b as a string.\n\nLet's tackle each step.\n\nFirst, parsing c in base a. Since c can have leading zeros, but we have to process it correctly. For example, '001' in base 2 is 1.\n\nSo, for converting c_str (the string representation in base a) to a decimal number, we can process each character, mapping it to its value, and compute the total.\n\nBut wait, a can be up to 25, so digits can be 0-9, A-Z (but uppercase?), or maybe lowercase? Well, in the problem statement, it's not specified, but the input seems to be provided as per the code, which probably reads from stdin. So, the function needs to handle uppercase letters, but the problem statement says that in bases greater than 10, A is 10, B 11, etc. So, in the code, when processing each character in c_str, we need to check whether it's a digit or a letter, and map accordingly.\n\nWait, but the input is given as a string, like 'A', 'B', etc. So, in the code, when reading c_str, each character is checked: if it's a digit, its value is int(c). Otherwise, for uppercase letters, it's 10 + ord(c) - ord('A'). But wait, what about lowercase letters? Probably, the input will be given as uppercase, but to be safe, perhaps the code should treat letters as uppercase.\n\nSo, in the code, for each character in c_str:\n\nvalue = 0\n\nfor char in c_str:\n    if char.isdigit():\n        num = int(char)\n    else:\n        num = 10 + ord(char.upper()) - ord('A')\n    total += num * (a ** power)\n\nWait, but the order is important. For example, '12' in base 10 is 1*10^1 + 2*10^0.\n\nSo, for each character, starting from left to right, the current position is i, so the exponent is len(c_str) - i -1.\n\nSo, the code for converting c_str to decimal:\n\ndef str_to_decimal(c_str, a):\n    total = 0\n    length = len(c_str)\n    for i in range(length):\n        char = c_str[i]\n        if char.isdigit():\n            num = int(char)\n        else:\n            # assume uppercase, but maybe the input is lowercase?\n            # better to make it uppercase\n            char_upper = char.upper()\n            num = 10 + ord(char_upper) - ord('A')\n        # multiply by a^(length - i -1)\n        power = length - i -1\n        total += num * (a ** power)\n    return total\n\nWait, but wait: a can be any base between 2 and 25. So, for example, if a is 16, 'G' would be invalid. But according to the problem statement, the input is correct, so c_str is a valid number in base a.\n\nSo, that function should work.\n\nNext, the function to convert a decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nRoman numerals have specific rules. Each symbol can represent values, and subtractive notation is used for 4 and 9, etc.\n\nThe standard approach is to create a list of tuples, where each tuple is (value, symbol), ordered from largest to smallest. Then, we subtract the largest possible values, appending symbols as needed.\n\nFor example:\n\nroman_numerals = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each value in roman_numerals, while the number is >= value, append the symbol and subtract the value.\n\nBut wait, what about numbers larger than 300010? The problem statement says that the input c is such that if interpreted as Roman numerals, it won't exceed 300010. So, our function just needs to handle numbers up to 300010.\n\nSo, the function to convert a decimal to Roman is straightforward.\n\nNow, the function to convert a decimal to base b as a string.\n\nThis function must avoid leading zeros. So, for example, if the number is zero, it's handled, but the problem states that c is non-zero.\n\nThe steps for converting a decimal to base b:\n\n- Initialize an empty string.\n- While the number is greater than zero:\n   - Get the remainder when divided by b.\n   - Append the corresponding character for this remainder.\n   - Divide the number by b, integer division.\n- Reverse the string to get the correct order.\n\nBut again, we need to handle the digits correctly. For remainders 0-9, they are digits as usual. For 10 and above, letters A-Z, where A is 10, B is 11, up to Z being 35.\n\nSo, for a remainder r:\n\nif r < 10: char is str(r)\nelse: char is chr(ord('A') + (r - 10))\n\nWait, but wait: the problem statement says that in bases higher than 10, letters A for 10, B for 11, etc. So, for example, in base 16, 10 is 'A', 11 is 'B', up to 15 is 'F'.\n\nSo, the function to get the character for a remainder r:\n\ndef get_char(r, b):\n    if r < 10:\n        return str(r)\n    else:\n        return chr(ord('A') + (r - 10))\n\nWait, but what if b is larger than 36? No, because the problem constraints say that a and b are up to 25. So, for r up to 25-1=24, the function will generate up to 'O' (since 10 is A, 24 is O).\n\nWait, let's test:\n\nr=10 → A\nr=11 → B\n...\nr=24 → O\nr=25 → Z?\n\nWait, no: 10 is A, 11 B, ... 25 would be Z (since 10 is A, 25-10=15 → 15 letters after A is Z). But wait, 10 +15 =25, yes.\n\nSo, the function is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe steps are:\n\nRead a and b from the first line.\n\nRead the next line as c_str.\n\nCheck if the second part is 'R' or not.\n\nIf it's 'R', then convert c_str to decimal, then to Roman.\n\nElse, convert c_str to decimal, then to base b as a string, omitting leading zeros.\n\nWait, but in the input, the first line is two integers a and b, but the second part of the door can be R. So, the first line is a and b, where b is either an integer or 'R'? Or wait, no: the first line is two integers a and b, but the second part can be R. Or, perhaps, the first line is a and the second part, which can be R.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nAh! So, the first line is a and b, but b can be R. So, for example, in the sample input, one of the lines is '2 2\\n1111001'—so a=2, b=2.\n\nAnother sample line is '12 13\\nA' → a=12, b=13.\n\nWait, but wait, in the first sample input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSo, the first line is '10 2' → a=10, b=2.\n\nSecond line is '16 R' → a=16, b is R.\n\nThird line is '5 R' → a=5, b is R.\n\nFourth line is '2 2' → a=2, b=2.\n\nFifth line is '12 13' → a=12, b=13.\n\nSo, the first line is a and b, which could be 'R' as b's value. So, in the code, the first step is to read a and b, but b could be 'R' or an integer.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead the first line, split into a_str and b_str.\n\na = int(a_str)\n\nb = b_str if b_str == 'R' else int(b_str)\n\nWait, no: the first line is a and b, but only b can be R. So, the first line is two tokens, the second can be R.\n\nWait, no: the problem says, \"Only b may be replaced by an R\". So, the first line is a and b, where b is either an integer or R.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nline1 = input().strip().split()\n\na = int(line1[0])\n\nb = line1[1] if line1[1] == 'R' else int(line1[1])\n\nYes.\n\nThen, read the next line, which is c_str.\n\nSo, code:\n\nc_line = input().strip()\n\nc_str = c_line.split()[0]\n\nBecause in the sample input, the second line is like '16 R\\n5' → the split on whitespace gives ['16', 'R'] and [5]. Wait, no, because in the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1' which is a=10, b=2, and c_str is '1'.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to read it is that each line is split into a and the rest, but perhaps the first line is two tokens, a and b, and the next line is the c_str.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input description:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWait, perhaps it's a list of multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nWait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps each test case consists of two lines: the first is a and b, the second is c_str.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103.\n\nSo, each test case is two lines: first, a and b, second, c_str.\n\nSo, the code should read a and b from the first line, then c_str from the next line.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\n# Read a and b\na_b_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\na, b = a_b_line.split()\nif b == 'R':\n    b_val = b  # since in the next step, we'll use it as a flag\nelse:\n    b_val = int(b)\na = int(a)\n\nc_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nc_str = c_line.split()[0]\n\nSo, now, process c_str.\n\nConvert c_str to decimal.\n\nThen, based on whether b is 'R' or not, decide whether to convert to Roman or base b.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Convert c_str to decimal value (c_num) in base a.\n\nBut wait, what if c_str is '0'? According to the problem statement, c is non-zero.\n\nSo, code:\n\ndef str_to_decimal(s, base):\n    total = 0\n    length = len(s)\n    for i in range(length):\n        char = s[i]\n        if char.isdigit():\n            num = int(char)\n        else:\n            # assume uppercase\n            num = 10 + ord(char.upper()) - ord('A')\n        # calculate the power\n        power = length - i - 1\n        total += num * (base ** power)\n    return total\n\nc_num = str_to_decimal(c_str, a)\n\nThen, decide:\n\nif b_val == 'R':\n    # convert to Roman\n    roman = decimal_to_roman(c_num)\nelse:\n    # convert to base b as a string\n    base_b_str = decimal_to_base(c_num, b_val)\n    # remove leading zeros\n    if len(base_b_str) == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print(base_b_str.lstrip('0') or '0')\n\nWait, but wait: what if the result is zero? The problem says that c is non-zero, but the code may have to handle cases where the decimal is zero, but according to the problem statement, c is guaranteed to be non-zero.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\nSo, c_num is always at least 1, except when the second part is R and c is zero, but the problem says it's not zero.\n\nSo, we don't have to worry about zero in the output.\n\nBut for the base conversion, when converting to base b, if the number is zero, we'd have to output nothing, but the problem says it won't happen.\n\nSo, proceed.\n\nImplementing decimal_to_roman:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'), (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'), (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            num -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\nTesting this function:\n\ndecimal_to_roman(5) → 'V'\n\ndecimal_to_roman(4) → 'IV'\n\ndecimal_to_roman(3999) → 'MMMCMXCIX'\n\nThat looks correct.\n\nImplementing decimal_to_base:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    res = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        res.append(get_char(rem))\n        n = n // base\n    # reverse the list and join\n    res = ''.join(reversed(res))\n    return res\n\nAnd get_char is as before:\n\ndef get_char(r):\n    if r < 10:\n        return str(r)\n    else:\n        return chr(ord('A') + r - 10)\n\nWait, but for r=10, it's 'A'; r=11, 'B'; etc.\n\nTesting:\n\nget_char(0) → '0'\n\nget_char(9) → '9'\n\nget_char(10) → 'A'\n\nget_char(35) → 'Z'\n\nWait, but since the maximum base is 25, r can be up to 24. So, 10 is 'A', 24 is 'O'.\n\nSo, the function is correct.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling uppercase vs lowercase in c_str. So, in the str_to_decimal function, the code converts each character to uppercase, so it's case-insensitive.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nInput line 1: '10 2' → a=10, b=2.\n\nc_str is '1' → decimal is 1.\n\nSince b is 2, output is '1'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nLine 1: '16 R' → a=16, b=R.\n\nc_str is '5' → decimal is 5.\n\nConvert to Roman: 'V'.\n\nSample Output is 'V'.\n\nAnother sample: '5 R\\n4' → a=5, b=R.\n\nc_str is '4' → decimal is 4 → 'IV'.\n\nSample output is 'IV'.\n\nAnother sample: '2 2\\n1111001' → a=2, b=2.\n\nc_str is '1111001' → which is binary 1111001 = 1+8+32+64+128 = 233.\n\nConvert to base 2: 1111001 → same as the input, no leading zeros.\n\nOutput is '1111001'.\n\nAnother sample: '12 13\\nA' → a=12, b=13.\n\nc_str is 'A' → in base 12, 'A' is 10.\n\nConvert to base 13: 10 is 'A'.\n\nSo, output is 'A'.\n\nThese all match the sample outputs.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where c_str is '0' → but the problem says it's non-zero.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says that c is non-zero, so the code doesn't have to handle zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when converting to base b, and the number is 0. But that's not possible.\n\nAnother case: when the number is zero after conversion, but that's not possible because c is non-zero.\n\nWait, but what if the decimal is zero? No, because the problem says c is non-zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when converting to Roman numerals, the number is 300010, which is allowed.\n\nWhat about when converting to base b, the number is 1, which in base 2 is '1', which is correct.\n\nWhat about a=25, c_str is 'Z' → which is 35 in base 25. Wait, no, because in base 25, the maximum digit is 24, so 'Z' is 35, which is invalid. But the problem says the input is correct, so c_str is a valid number in base a.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's said that in bases greater than 10, letters A represent 10, B 11, etc. So, in a base a, the c_str is composed of digits and letters, but only valid for that base.\n\nSo, the function str_to_decimal will correctly process them.\n\nAnother test case: c_str is 'II' in base 10 → decimal is 2.\n\nConvert to base 2 → '10'.\n\nBut wait, the function returns '10' which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the output, leading zeros are omitted. So, in the function, when converting to base b, leading zeros are stripped.\n\nWait, the function returns the string as is, but when the function is called, for example, decimal_to_base(2, 2) → '10', which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: c_str is '0001' in base 10 → decimal is 1 → output is '1'.\n\nSo, the function works.\n\nNow, considering the problem's constraints, the maximum c_str length is 103, which is manageable.\n\nBut for very large numbers, the code may have to handle big exponents, but since a and b are up to 25, and the length is 103, the maximum possible value is (25^103 -1), which is a very big number. But in Python, integers can handle that.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that when the output is Roman numerals, the number is <=300010. So, the code doesn't have to handle very large numbers beyond that when outputting as Roman numerals.\n\nBut for the other cases, the code needs to handle up to 101510.\n\nSo, the code should be efficient enough.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when converting c_str to decimal, for a=25 and a long string, the code can take time. But given the constraints, it's manageable.\n\nNow, putting all this into code.\n\nSo, the code outline:\n\nRead a and b, with b possibly being 'R'.\n\nRead c_str.\n\nConvert c_str to decimal.\n\nIf b is 'R', output the Roman numeral.\n\nElse, output the number in base b as a string, without leading zeros.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef str_to_decimal(s, base):\n    total = 0\n    length = len(s)\n    for i in range(length):\n        char = s[i]\n        if char.isdigit():\n            num = int(char)\n        else:\n            # Treat as uppercase\n            char_upper = char.upper()\n            num = 10 + ord(char_upper) - ord('A')\n        power = length - i - 1\n        total += num * (base ** power)\n    return total\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'), (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'), (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            num -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    res = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        res.append(get_char(rem))\n        n = n // base\n    res = ''.join(reversed(res))\n    return res\n\ndef get_char(r):\n    if r < 10:\n        return str(r)\n    else:\n        return chr(ord('A') + r - 10)\n\n# Read input\na_b_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\na_str, b_str = a_b_line.split()\na = int(a_str)\nif b_str == 'R':\n    b_is_roman = True\nelse:\n    b_is_roman = False\n    b = int(b_str)\n\nc_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nc_str = c_line.split()[0]\n\n# Convert c_str to decimal\nc_num = str_to_decimal(c_str, a)\n\nif b_is_roman:\n    print(decimal_to_roman(c_num))\nelse:\n    # Convert to base b\n    base_b_str = decimal_to_base(c_num, b)\n    print(base_b_str)\n\nWait, but wait: in the code, when b is not 'R', we call decimal_to_base, which returns a string, but for numbers that are zero, it returns '0'. However, the problem states that c is non-zero, so we don't have to worry about that.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWait, perhaps the actual input is via standard input, but in testing, perhaps it's better to simulate.\n\nWait, no, in the problem statement, the sample input is given as a list, but perhaps in reality, it's the input lines.\n\nBut the code reads a and b from the first line, and c_str from the next line.\n\nSo, for the first sample input:\n\nFirst line: '10 2' → a=10, b=2.\n\nc_str is '1' → decimal is 1.\n\nSince b is 2, output is '1'.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nSecond line: '16 R' → a=16, b='R'.\n\nc_str is '5' → decimal is 5 → 'V'.\n\nThird sample: '5 R\\n4' → a=5, b='R'.\n\nc_str is '4' → decimal 4 → 'IV'.\n\nFourth sample: '2 2\\n1111001' → a=2, b=2.\n\nc_str is '1111001' → 233 in decimal → convert to base 2: 1111001.\n\nFifth sample: '12 13\\nA' → a=12, b=13.\n\nc_str is 'A' → in base 12, A is 10.\n\nConvert to base 13: 10 → 'A'.\n\nSo, the code should output these correctly.\n\nPotential issue: in the code, when b is not 'R', it calls decimal_to_base, which returns the string, but when n is zero, returns '0'.\n\nBut the problem states that c is non-zero, so it's okay.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the code, when converting to base, leading zeros are stripped. For example, if the number is 8 in base 16, it's '8', not '08'.\n\nYes, because the function returns the string without leading zeros.\n\nNow, considering all edge cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\na=10, b=2, c_str='1' → output '1'.\n\nTest case 2:\n\na=16, b=R, c_str='M' → M is 1000 in decimal. So, output 'M'.\n\nAnother test case: a=2, b=2, c_str='1111' → 15 in decimal → 1111 in binary.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=5, c_str='21' → 2*3 +1 =7 → convert to base 5 → 12.\n\nSo, the code should return '12'.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=10, c_str='4' → 4 in base 5 is 4 in decimal → output '4'.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=16, c_str='99' → 99 in base 10 is 99 in decimal. Convert to base 16: 63 → '3F'.\n\nWait, 99 /16 is 6 with remainder 3 → 'F' for 15, but wait 99 is 6*16=96, 99-96=3 → so 63 is incorrect. Wait, no: 16 ×6 is 96, 99-96=3 → so it's 6*16 +3 → 63 is incorrect.\n\nWait, 6 is in hex '6', so 63 is '6' '3' → '63'.\n\nSo, the code returns '63'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's implement the code.\n\nBut wait, in the code, when b is not 'R', it uses b_val, which is either the integer b or 'R' (but 'R' is handled earlier).\n\nWait, no: in the code, if b_str is 'R', then b_is_roman is True, else, b_val is set to int(b_str). So, the code is correct.\n\nAnother thing: in the code, when b is not 'R', and the function decimal_to_base returns a string, but when the string is all zeros, it returns '0' (though the problem says it's not possible).\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nSo, the final code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from one base to another, taking into account the possibility of using Roman numerals for the conversion. The problem involves reading input values, parsing them, and converting them according to specific rules.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line contains two integers, `a` and `b`, where `b` can be 'R' indicating the use of Roman numerals. The second line contains a non-negative integer `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion Functions**:\n   - **Base Conversion**: Convert the given number from base `a` to base `b`. If `b` is not 'R', we use standard base conversion.\n   - **Roman Numeral Conversion**: Convert the given number from its decimal form to Roman numerals if `b` is 'R'.\n3. **Handling Special Cases**: Ensure that leading zeros are omitted in the output when converting to a different base.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef str_to_decimal(s, base):\n    total = 0\n    length = len(s)\n    for i in range(length):\n        char = s[i]\n        if char.isdigit():\n            num = int(char)\n        else:\n            char_upper = char.upper()\n            num = 10 + ord(char_upper) - ord('A')\n        power = length - i - 1\n        total += num * (base ** power)\n    return total\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'), (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'), (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            num -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    res = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        res.append(get_char(rem))\n        n = n // base\n    res = ''.join(reversed(res))\n    return res\n\ndef get_char(r):\n    if r < 10:\n        return str(r)\n    else:\n        return chr(ord('A') + r - 10)\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\n\na_b_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\na_str, b_str = a_b_line.split()\na = int(a_str)\nb_is_roman = False\nif b_str == 'R':\n    b_is_roman = True\nelse:\n    b_val = int(b_str)\n\nc_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nc_str = c_line.split()[0]\n\n# Convert c_str to decimal\nc_num = str_to_decimal(c_str, a)\n\nif b_is_roman:\n    print(decimal_to_roman(c_num))\nelse:\n    # Convert to base b\n    base_b_str = decimal_to_base(c_num, b_val)\n    print(base_b_str)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input. The first line is split into `a` and `b`, where `b` can be 'R'. The second line is read as the string representation of the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `str_to_decimal` converts the string `c` from base `a` to a decimal (integer) value.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If `b` is 'R', the decimal number is converted to a Roman numeral using the `decimal_to_roman` function.\n4. **Base Conversion**: If `b` is not 'R', the decimal number is converted to the specified base using the `decimal_to_base` function, which ensures no leading zeros.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed based on whether the conversion was to Roman numerals or a standard base.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and constraints, ensuring correct conversion and formatting for the given problem.",
