Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Crazy Town,\" and from the description, it seems like it involves lines dividing a plane into regions, and moving between these regions with certain rules.\n\nHmm, the task is to find the minimum number of steps to get from the home block to the university block. Each step can move from one block to another if they share a common border of non-zero length. So, the key here is understanding how the lines partition the plane and how the regions are connected.\n\nWait, the problem says that two blocks are adjacent if their shared boundary has non-zero length. So, for example, if two regions meet only at a single point (an intersection), that's not considered a valid step. They have to share a line segment.\n\nI remember that when multiple lines intersect, they form a planar graph where each region is a face. The adjacency between regions depends on whether their boundaries share a segment. So, the regions are connected based on whether they are separated by a line or not.\n\nBut how do we model this? Because with 300 lines, the number of regions could be quite large, but perhaps we can represent each region as a node and model the connections between them. But that might not be feasible because the number of regions could be exponential in n, which is up to 300. That's way too big.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem can be approached differently. Since each line can split the plane into two parts, the position of a point (home or university) relative to each line determines which side of the line it's on. So, perhaps the problem reduces to determining how many lines separate the home from the university, and then using that to compute the minimal steps.\n\nWait, no. Because the minimal steps depend on the arrangement of lines and how they create regions. For example, if two lines cross, they create four regions. But how does that affect the path?\n\nAlternatively, think about the dual graph of the arrangement. In the dual graph, each region is a node, and edges connect regions that are adjacent. Then, the minimal number of steps is the shortest path from the home's region to the university's region in this graph.\n\nBut building the dual graph is computationally expensive for n=300. So that approach isn't feasible.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a smarter way. Since each step can cross any number of lines, but you can only move to adjacent regions, perhaps the minimal steps are related to the number of lines that separate the two points.\n\nWait, let's think about the arrangement of lines. For each line, the home and university are either on the same side or opposite sides. If they're on opposite sides, that line contributes to separating them. So, the total number of such lines is the number of lines that separate the two points. Let's call this value 'd'.\n\nWhat's the relationship between 'd' and the minimal steps required?\n\nIn an arrangement of lines, the minimal number of steps needed to go from one region to another is equal to the number of lines that separate them, but perhaps some conditions apply. Wait, no. Because depending on the arrangement of lines, sometimes you can cross multiple lines in a single step.\n\nWait, no. Because each step can only move to an adjacent region, which means that each step can only cross one line. Because each line divides the plane into two, and moving across one line would change the side of that line. So, if two regions are adjacent, they share a border along a segment of a single line.\n\nSo, the minimal number of steps is the number of lines that separate the home and the university. Because each such line must be crossed once, and each crossing requires a step.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each line that separates the two points must be crossed exactly once. So the minimal steps would be 'd', the count of lines that the home and university are on opposite sides of.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of lines where home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nThat's a much simpler approach! So, the solution is to iterate over each line, check the sign of home and university with respect to that line. If the signs are different, it means the line separates them, so increment the count.\n\nThen, output this count as the minimal steps.\n\nWait, let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\nHome: (1,1)\nUniversity: (-1,-1)\nn=2\nLines:\n0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0\n1x + 0y + 0 = 0 → x=0\n\nFor the first line, y=0: home is at y=1 → positive, university is y=-1 → negative. So different signs.\nSecond line, x=0: home x=1 → positive, university x=-1 → negative. Different signs.\nSo d=2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. The town is divided by multiple lines, and each step can only move to an adjacent block if they share a common border segment.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each line in Crazy Town divides the plane into two regions. If you are on opposite sides of a line, that line contributes to separating you from the university. Thus, the minimal number of steps required is equivalent to the number of lines that separate your home from your university.\n\n1. **Check Each Line**: For each line, determine if your home and university lie on opposite sides. This can be done by evaluating the sign of the expression \\(a \\cdot x + b \\cdot y + c\\) for both points.\n2. **Count Separating Lines**: Count how many lines have different signs for the home and university points. This count gives the minimum number of steps needed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef readints():\n    return list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) or (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0):\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n2. **Evaluate Each Road**: For each road defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\), the code evaluates the expression for both home and university coordinates.\n3. **Determine Separation**: If the signs of the evaluations are different, it means the line separates the home from the university, so the count is incremented.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of such separating lines is printed, which represents the minimum number of steps needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution by leveraging the geometric properties of lines and their impact on dividing the plane, ensuring optimal performance even for the maximum constraints.",
