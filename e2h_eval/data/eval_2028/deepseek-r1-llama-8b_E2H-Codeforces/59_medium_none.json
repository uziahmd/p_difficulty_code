    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Happy Sets,\" and from the description, I need to find the number of different arrays of sets that satisfy certain conditions. \n\nHmm, let me try to parse the problem statement step by step.\n\nFirst, the definition: A set A is a child of set B if for every x in A, there's an x+1 in B. So, for example, if A has {1}, then B must have at least 2. If A is empty, then any B is a parent since the condition is vacuously true. Also, if A has elements up to x, then B must have all those elements plus x+1.\n\nThe task is, given N and K, to count the number of arrays of N sets [S_1, S_2, ..., S_N] such that:\n\n1. Each set can contain zero or more distinct integers from 1 to K.\n2. There exists a rearrangement of the array into [S'_1, S'_2, ..., S'_N] where each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}.\n\nAnd we have to output the answer modulo 998244353.\n\nTwo arrays are considered different if any index has a different set. And two sets are different if they differ in at least one element.\n\nSo, the key here is to model the problem in terms of the properties that these sets must satisfy when arranged in some order. \n\nLet me think about the constraints on the sequence of sets after rearrangement. For each i, S'_i must be a subset of the next set's elements in a way that each element in S'_i is present as x+1 in S'_{i+1}.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the condition is that for every x in S'_i, S'_{i+1} contains x+1. So, for example, if S'_i has 1, then S'_{i+1} must have 2. If S'_i has 2, S'_{i+1} must have 3, etc.\n\nThis suggests that the sets must form a chain where each successive set in the rearranged array must include all the necessary higher elements.\n\nNow, the problem is to count all possible arrays (sequences of sets) that can be rearranged into such a chain. So each array is a collection of N sets, which can be ordered in a way that satisfies the child relationship.\n\nBut how do we model this? Maybe we can model the problem by considering the structure of the sets. Since the ordering must form a chain, perhaps each set in the array must fit into a hierarchy based on their maximum elements.\n\nWait, let's consider the maximum element in each set. Suppose that in the reordered sequence, each set S'_i has a maximum element m_i. Then, for S'_i to be a child of S'_{i+1}, m_i must be less than m_{i+1}, because if S'_i has an element x, then S'_{i+1} must have x+1, implying that the maximum of S'_i is less than the maximum of S'_{i+1}.\n\nWait, not necessarily. Because the maximum could be higher but not necessarily x+1. Hmm, but wait, suppose that S'_i has a maximum of m. Then, S'_{i+1} must include m+1 if S'_i includes m. But S'_i could have other elements that are not the maximum, like m-1, but then S'_{i+1} needs to include m as well.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum is the critical factor. Because, if a set S contains m, then the next set in the chain must contain m+1. So the maximum of S determines the minimum that the next set must include.\n\nSo, perhaps the entire chain's maximums form a non-decreasing sequence. Because each S'_i's maximum must be less than S'_{i+1}'s maximum. Because if S'_i has max m, then S'_{i+1} must have m+1. So the maximum increases by at least 1 each step.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Suppose S'_i has max m, but S'_i doesn't include m, only elements below. Then, S'_{i+1} doesn't need to include m+1. Wait, no: the condition is that for every x in S'_i, x+1 is in S'_{i+1}. So, if S'_i includes x, then x+1 must be in S'_{i+1}. So if S'_i has a maximum of m, then S'_{i+1} must have m+1. Because m is in S'_i, so S'_{i+1} must have m+1.\n\nAh, right. So the maximum of each set must be exactly one more than the maximum of the previous set. Because if the current set has a maximum m, the next must have m+1.\n\nWait, no. Let's say the first set has a maximum of m=3, then the next must have 4. Then the third must have 5, and so on. So the maximums must form a strictly increasing sequence where each is one more than the previous.\n\nWait, but what if the first set has a maximum of 0? No, since the elements are from 1 to K, so maximum can't be zero. Or wait, no, because the elements are from 1 to K, but the sets can be empty. So if the first set is empty, the next can have any elements including nothing.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each set can contain zero or more different integers from 1 to K. So empty sets are allowed.\n\nBut let's think about the chain. For an empty set, any set can follow it. Because the condition is vacuously satisfied.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the chain can have any number of empty sets, but once a non-empty set is included, the rest of the chain must have strictly increasing maximums.\n\nWait, that might complicate things. So maybe the approach is to consider all possible sequences of sets that can be arranged into a chain as described, regardless of their order in the original array.\n\nBut the problem is about counting all arrays of N sets that can be rearranged into such a chain. So each array is a multiset of N sets, and we can permute them in some order that satisfies the chain condition.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the number of N-length sequences of sets (allowing repeats) such that their multiset can be ordered in a way that each set is a child of the next.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to count all possible multisets of N sets that can be arranged into such a chain, multiplied by the number of permutations that form such a chain. Wait, no—no, the array is an ordered sequence. So perhaps the order matters, but we're counting all possible sequences that can be rearranged into a valid chain.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that there exists a rearrangement of the array into a chain. So for the array, any permutation that forms a chain is acceptable, but the array itself is a sequence that can be rearranged into such a chain.\n\nBut how does that affect the count? It's equivalent to considering that the multiset of sets can be arranged in a way that satisfies the chain condition. So the count is the number of such multisets, multiplied by the number of possible orderings that form a valid chain.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way to model this is to consider that for each possible chain structure (like a sequence of sets with strictly increasing maxima), count the number of ways to assign the sets to positions such that they can be arranged in that chain.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model the problem by considering the maximum element in each set.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the chain. Suppose that in the rearranged sequence S'_1, S'_2, ..., S'_N, the maximum of S'_i is m_i. Then, since S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}, m_i must be <= m_{i+1} -1. Because S'_i must contain elements x, which require S'_{i+1} to contain x+1, so the maximum of S'_i must be less than or equal to the maximum of S'_{i+1} minus 1.\n\nWait, no. Because if S'_i has a maximum of m, then S'_{i+1} must have m+1. So m_i < m_{i+1}.\n\nWait, that's correct. Because if S'_i has a maximum of m, then m is in S'_i, so S'_{i+1} must have m+1. Therefore, the maximum of S'_{i+1} must be at least m+1. But since S'_{i+1} is a set, its maximum could be m+1 or higher. However, if it's higher, say m+2, then S'_i+2 must have m+2, requiring S'_i+2 to have m+3, and so on.\n\nSo, the maximums of the sequence S'_1, ..., S'_N must form a strictly increasing sequence where each term is exactly one greater than the previous. Because otherwise, the chain would break.\n\nWait, is that always the case? Suppose S'_1 has maximum 2. Then S'_2 must have maximum >=3. But if S'_2's maximum is 3, then S'_3 must have maximum >=4. So the maximums are 2,3,4,..., which is a strictly increasing sequence with each step +1.\n\nSo, the chain must consist of sets whose maximums form a strictly increasing sequence by 1 each time.\n\nTherefore, the maximums of the rearranged sets must be m_1, m_1 +1, m_1 +2, ..., m_1 + (n-1), for some m_1.\n\nWait, no, because the maximum can start at any point. For example, the first set could have maximum 0 (if allowed), but since elements are from 1 to K, the maximum can't be 0. Wait, no, the sets can be empty, which have no elements, so their maximum is undefined. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nWait, the problem states that each set can contain zero or more different integers from 1 to K. So an empty set has no elements. So, what is the maximum of an empty set? It's not defined, but in our problem, perhaps for the purpose of the chain, an empty set can be followed by any set. Because the condition is that for every x in S'_i, x+1 is in S'_{i+1}. So if S'_i is empty, S'_{i+1} can be anything, including empty.\n\nSo, in the chain, we can have a run of empty sets, but once a non-empty set is included, the subsequent sets must have maximums that are exactly one higher than the previous.\n\nWait, no. Because once a non-empty set is in the chain, the next must have a maximum that is exactly one higher. So, for example:\n\nIf S'_i is non-empty with max m, then S'_{i+1} must have max m+1.\n\nSo, the chain can have a starting point where some sets are empty, followed by a non-empty set, which must be followed by a set with max m+1, and so on.\n\nBut then, how do the maximums look in the chain?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose N=3, K=2.\n\nCase 1: All sets are empty. Then, the chain is valid, because each set is a child of the next (since all are empty). So the array can be any sequence of three empty sets.\n\nCase 2: One set is non-empty. Say S'_1 is {1}, then S'_2 must have 2. But since K=2, S'_2 can be {2} or {1,2}. Then S'_3 must have 3, but K=2, so that's impossible. So in this case, N=3 is impossible if any set beyond the second is non-empty.\n\nWait, but K=2 allows 1 and 2. So for N=3, the maximum can be 2, and then the next set must have 3, which isn't allowed. So that would break the chain. Therefore, for N=3, if any set after the second is non-empty, it's impossible.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the maximum possible value of the maximum in the chain is K. Because once you reach K, the next set would need K+1, which is beyond the allowed values.\n\nSo, for N > K, the chain can't have all sets non-empty beyond K. So, in such cases, the chain must end with a set that has maximum K, and the next sets can be empty.\n\nWait, no. Because if a set has maximum K, the next set must have K+1, which is not allowed. So the next set must be empty, because if it's non-empty, it must contain K+1, which is impossible.\n\nWait, but if the next set is empty, then the condition is satisfied because there are no elements in S'_i (the current set) to check. So, in this case, the chain can have a non-empty set followed by an empty set.\n\nSo, for example, in N=3, K=2:\n\nWe can have S'_1 = {2}, S'_2 = empty, S'_3 = empty. Then, the chain is valid because S'_1 is a child of S'_2 (since S'_2 is empty, but S'_1 has 2, which requires S'_2 to have 3, which it doesn't. Wait, no! Oh wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, no. Because if S'_i is non-empty and has a maximum of m, then S'_{i+1} must have m+1. So, if S'_i is {2}, then S'_{i+1} must have 3, which is impossible since K=2. So S'_{i+1} can't have 3, so the only option is that S'_{i+1} is empty. But then, the condition for S'_i being a child of S'_{i+1} is that for every x in S'_i, x+1 is in S'_{i+1}. But S'_i has x=2, so S'_{i+1} must have 3, which is not possible. So S'_{i+1} can't be empty if S'_i is {2}.\n\nSo, the chain cannot have S'_i={2} followed by S'_{i+1}=empty. Therefore, the only way to have a non-empty set is if it's the last in the chain, but then the next set would have to have 3, which is impossible.\n\nWait, so that means that any non-empty set in the chain must be followed by another non-empty set with maximum increased by 1.\n\nWhich implies that the chain can't have a non-empty set unless the rest of the chain continues with the maximums increasing by 1 each time.\n\nSo, for N sets, the maximum can increase by 1 each step until it reaches K, and then it can't go further. So, the maximum possible length of a chain where all sets are non-empty is K steps. Because each step increases the maximum by 1.\n\nWait, no. For example, K=3, N=3. We can have S'_1={1}, S'_2={2}, S'_3={3}. Each step increases by 1. That's a valid chain.\n\nThen, if N=4, we can have S'_4 as empty, since S'_3 has maximum 3, which requires S'_4 to have 4, which is not possible. So S'_4 must be empty, but that's invalid because S'_3 has 3, which is in S'_3, so S'_4 must have 4, which is impossible. So, the chain can't have S'_3={3} followed by empty. So the chain can't have any non-empty set beyond K steps.\n\nSo, for a chain of N sets, the maximum can't exceed K, and the number of non-empty sets in the chain can't exceed K.\n\nWait, so for N> K, the chain can have at most K non-empty sets, and the rest must be empty. But the empty sets can only appear before the non-empty ones, because if a non-empty set is followed by an empty set, that's invalid.\n\nWait, no. Because if a non-empty set is followed by an empty set, the condition is violated. So, the chain can't have a non-empty set followed by an empty set. Thus, all non-empty sets must come first in the chain, followed by empty sets.\n\nWait, but then the maximums of the non-empty sets must form a strictly increasing sequence by 1 each step. So, for example, if we have a non-empty set with maximum m, the next must have m+1, and so on until K.\n\nOnce we reach K, the next set must have K+1, which is impossible. So, the chain can't have any non-empty sets beyond K.\n\nSo, the chain must be a prefix of non-empty sets with maximums 1, 2, ..., m, where m <= K, and then followed by empty sets.\n\nThus, for the chain to be valid, the maximums must be a sequence like m_1, m_1+1, ..., m_1 + t, where m_1 + t <= K, and the rest of the sets are empty.\n\nWait, but m_1 can be 0? No, because the elements start at 1. So m_1 must be at least 1 if the first set is non-empty.\n\nWait, no. The first set could be empty. So, the chain can have some empty sets, followed by a sequence of non-empty sets with increasing maxima, up to K, and then possibly more empty sets.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the chain can't have a non-empty set followed by an empty set, because that violates the condition.\n\nSo, the chain can consist of any number of empty sets (possibly zero) at the beginning, followed by a sequence of non-empty sets with maximums 1, 2, ..., m (m <= K), followed by any number of empty sets (possibly zero).\n\nSo, for example, the chain could be:\n\nE E N1 N2 ... Nt E E,\n\nwhere E represents empty sets and Ni represents non-empty sets with maximum i.\n\nSo, the structure is: any number of empty sets, followed by a consecutive sequence of non-empty sets with maxima 1, 2, ..., t, where t <= K, followed by any number of empty sets.\n\nSo, the total number of sets in the chain must be N.\n\nSo, for a given t (which is the maximum of the non-empty sets in the chain), the chain's structure is:\n\na leading empty runs (could be zero), then t non-empty sets with maxima 1..t, then trailing empty runs (could be zero). The sum of these parts is N.\n\nWait, but the leading and trailing empty runs can vary. So, for a given t, the number of ways to arrange the empty runs around the t non-empty sets is the number of ways to choose where the t non-empty sets are placed, with the rest being empty.\n\nBut since the chain is a sequence, the t non-empty sets must appear consecutively in order. So, the t non-empty sets form a block in the chain, and the rest are empty.\n\nSo, for a given t, the chain must have a contiguous block of t sets: the first is {1}, the second {2}, ..., the t-th {t}, and the rest are empty.\n\nWait, no. Because the t non-empty sets could be a subsequence, but in the chain, they must appear in order. So, the t non-empty sets must be a consecutive block in the chain.\n\nYes, because any other arrangement would not allow the chain condition. For example, if the non-empty sets are in positions 1, 3, 4, then S'_1 is {1}, S'_3 is {2}, and S'_4 is {3}, but then S'_2 must have 2, which is not present. So that's invalid.\n\nTherefore, the t non-empty sets must form a consecutive block in the chain.\n\nSo, for a given t, the chain is composed of:\n\n- l leading empty sets,\n- t non-empty sets with maxima 1, 2, ..., t,\n- r trailing empty sets,\nsuch that l + t + r = N.\n\nSo, for each possible t (from 0 to K), we can compute the number of chains for that t and sum over all t.\n\nWait, but what about t=0? Then, all sets are empty. That's allowed.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each possible t (number of non-empty sets in the chain, ranging from 0 to min(K, N)), compute the number of ways to arrange the chain as l empty sets, followed by t non-empty sets in order, followed by r empty sets, where l + t + r = N.\n\nThen, sum over all t the number of such chains multiplied by the number of possible ways to choose the non-empty sets.\n\nBut wait, the non-empty sets in the chain are specific: the first must have {1}, the second {2}, etc. Because each must have exactly the elements up to their maximum.\n\nWait, no. Each non-empty set in the chain can have any subset of the required elements. For example, the set with maximum 2 can be {2}, {1,2}, or {2, something}.\n\nWait, no, because the condition is that for each x in S'_i, x+1 is in S'_{i+1}. So, for the i-th non-empty set, which has maximum m, it can contain any subset of {1, 2, ..., m}, but for the chain condition, the next set must have m+1.\n\nSo, for each non-empty set in the chain, the set can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., m} that includes m. Because if it didn't include m, then the next set wouldn't need to have m+1, but wait, no: the next set must have m+1 regardless of whether the current set has m.\n\nWait, no. Because the next set must have m+1 because the current set's maximum is m, so m is in the current set, hence the next set must have m+1.\n\nWait, no. The condition is that for every x in S'_i, x+1 is in S'_{i+1}. So, if S'_i is {1}, then S'_{i+1} must have 2. It doesn't matter what else S'_{i+1} has. So, the next set must include 2, but can have other elements as well.\n\nSo, for each non-empty set in the chain, the set can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., m} such that it includes all elements up to some x, but perhaps not necessarily the maximum. Wait, no: the set can include any elements, but the maximum is determined by the set. So, for the i-th non-empty set in the chain (which has maximum m = i), the set must include at least m, but can include any subset of {1, 2, ..., m}.\n\nWait, no: the set can include any subset of {1, 2, ..., m}, including those that don't include m. For example, if the i-th set is {2}, then its maximum is 2, so the next set must include 3. But the i-th set's maximum is 2, so it's allowed.\n\nWait, no. The i-th set's maximum is m=i, because it's the i-th in the chain of non-empty sets. So, the i-th set must have maximum i. Because it's part of the chain, the first non-empty set has maximum 1, the second 2, etc.\n\nSo, for the i-th non-empty set in the chain, the set must have maximum i, which means it must contain i.\n\nBut it can have any subset of {1, 2, ..., i}, including the empty set? No, because the set must have maximum i, so it must include i. So, the set can't be empty.\n\nSo, each non-empty set in the chain must contain exactly the elements 1, 2, ..., i, but can also include other elements, as long as they are less than or equal to i.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the maximum is i, so the set must include i. But other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., i-1}.\n\nSo, for the i-th non-empty set in the chain, the set can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., i} that includes i.\n\nThe number of such subsets is 2^{i-1}.\n\nBecause for each element from 1 to i-1, it can be included or not, and i must be included.\n\nSo, for each t, the number of ways to choose the t non-empty sets is product_{i=1 to t} (2^{i-1}).\n\nWait, yes. Because each step contributes 2^{i-1} possibilities.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the total number of arrays is the sum over t from 0 to min(t_max, N) of (number of ways to choose the non-empty sets for t) multiplied by (number of ways to split N into l + t + r, where l and r are non-negative integers).\n\nBut wait, for each t, the t non-empty sets must form a contiguous block in the chain. So, the chain has l empty sets, followed by t non-empty sets, followed by r empty sets. The sum l + t + r = N.\n\nThe number of ways to choose l and r is the number of ways to choose l and r such that l >=0, r >=0, and l + t <= N. So for each t, the number of ways is (N - t + 1) — because l can range from 0 to (N - t), and r is determined as (N - t - l).\n\nWait, no. For a fixed t, the number of possible l and r is (N - t + 1). Because l can be 0,1,..., N-t, and r is N-t-l.\n\nSo, for each t, the contribution is (ways to choose non-empty sets) * (N - t + 1).\n\nBut t can't exceed K, because the maximum element in the non-empty sets is t, which can't exceed K. Also, t can't be larger than N, because each t adds t sets.\n\nSo, the maximum possible t is min(K, N).\n\nSo, the formula becomes:\n\nanswer = sum_{t=0}^min(K, N)} [ (2^{0} * 2^{1} * ... * 2^{t-1}) ) * (N - t + 1) ]\n\nWait, the product for the non-empty sets is product_{i=1 to t} (2^{i-1} ), which is 2^{0 + 1 + ... + t-1} }.\n\nThe sum of exponents is (t-1)*t / 2. So, the product is 2^{(t*(t-1))/2}.\n\nSo, the formula simplifies to:\n\nsum_{t=0}^T (2^{(t*(t-1)/2)} ) * (N - t + 1),\n\nwhere T is min(K, N).\n\nWait, but when t=0, the product is 1 (since there are zero terms), and the number of ways to arrange the chain is N + 1 (since l can be 0 to N, and r is N - l). Wait, no: for t=0, the chain is all empty sets. So the number of ways is 1 (all empty sets), multiplied by the number of possible arrangements. Wait, no: for t=0, the entire chain is N empty sets, so there's only one way to arrange the non-empty sets (since t=0). So, the contribution for t=0 is 1 * (N + 1) ? Or wait, no.\n\nWait, no. When t=0, the chain is all empty sets, so the entire array is a sequence of N empty sets. But the array can be any permutation of these sets, but since all are the same, there's only one possible array. So, the number of arrays for t=0 is 1.\n\nBut according to our earlier reasoning, for each t, the number of ways is (product) * (N - t + 1). For t=0, product is 1, and (N - 0 + 1) is N+1. So that would give (1) * (N+1) for t=0, which is incorrect.\n\nAh, so my earlier reasoning was wrong. So, I need to re-examine this.\n\nWait, no. Because when t=0, the non-empty sets contribute 1 (product is 1), and the number of ways to arrange the empty runs is N+1. But wait, for t=0, the entire chain is N empty sets, which can be arranged in any way as they are all the same. So the number of arrays is 1, not (N+1).\n\nSo, why is that?\n\nBecause for t=0, the chain is a single type of set (empty), so the number of arrays is 1. But according to the formula, (product) is 1, and (N - 0 + 1) is N+1. Which would imply that the contribution is N+1, which is wrong.\n\nSo, the initial approach is incorrect. So, I need to think differently.\n\nAlternative approach: For each t, the number of ways to choose the non-empty sets is as before, but the number of ways to arrange the empty runs is (N - t + 1) only if t <= N.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nFor a given t, the number of ways to arrange the l, t, and r parts is the number of ways to choose l and r such that l + t + r = N.\n\nThis is equal to (N - t + 1) when t <= N.\n\nBut for t=0, the number of ways is 1, because all N sets are empty.\n\nSo, the formula should be:\n\nfor t=0: 1 * (1) =1\n\nfor t>0: (product) * (N - t + 1)\n\nSo, the overall sum is:\n\n1 (for t=0) + sum_{t=1}^T [2^{(t(t-1)/2)} * (N - t +1) }\n\nSo, now, the problem reduces to computing this sum.\n\nNow, the question is, how to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nConstraints are N and K up to 2e5, so O(K) is acceptable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute the powers of 2 up to (T*(T-1)/2), mod 998244353.\n\n2. For each t from 0 to min(K, N):\n\n   a. Compute the product term, which is 2^{(t(t-1)/2)}.\n\n   b. For t=0: add 1 to the answer.\n\n   c. For t>0: compute the term as product * (N - t + 1), and add to the answer.\n\n3. Output the sum mod 998244353.\n\nBut wait, for t>0, t can't exceed K or N. So, T is min(K, N).\n\nBut wait, for t>0, t can be up to min(K, N). So, for t>0, the product is 2^{t(t-1)/2}, and the term is product * (N - t + 1).\n\nSo, the plan is to compute this for each t in 0..T.\n\nNow, let's think about precomputing the exponents.\n\nWe can precompute an array pow2 where pow2[i] is 2^i mod MOD, for i up to (max_t)*(max_t-1)/2, where max_t is min(K, N).\n\nBut for K up to 2e5, (2e5)^2 is 4e10, which is way too big to precompute.\n\nWait, but for t up to 2e5, the exponent t(t-1)/2 can be up to about (2e5)^2/2 = 2e10, which is impossible to compute directly.\n\nSo, we need a way to compute 2^{(t(t-1)/2)} mod MOD efficiently for each t.\n\nBut 2e5 is manageable if we compute exponents on the fly, but even that may be challenging.\n\nWait, but exponents can be computed using modular exponentiation, but for each t, calculating 2^{t(t-1)/2} mod MOD.\n\nBut t(t-1)/2 can be up to (2e5)^2 / 2 = 2e10, which is a 34-bit number. So, exponentiating 2 to that power is feasible using binary exponentiation, but doing it for each t up to 2e5 would take O(T log exponent) time, which for T=2e5 is about 2e5 * 40 = 8e6 operations, which is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute the exponents incrementally.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nLet's denote e(t) = t(t-1)/2.\n\nWe can compute e(t) for t from 0 to T.\n\nCompute e(0)=0, e(1)=0, e(2)=1, e(3)=3, e(4)=6, etc.\n\nEach e(t) = e(t-1) + (t-1).\n\nBecause for t:\n\ne(t) = t(t-1)/2 = (t-1)(t)/2 = (t-1)(t-1 +1)/2 = (t-1)(t-1)/2 + (t-1) = e(t-1) + (t-1).\n\nSo, this recurrence can be used to compute e(t) efficiently.\n\nSo, e(t) can be computed incrementally as:\n\ne(0) = 0\n\ne(t) = e(t-1) + (t-1), for t>=1.\n\nYes, because:\n\ne(t) = t(t-1)/2 = [ (t-1)(t) ] / 2 = (t-1)(t-1 + 1)/2 = (t-1)(t-1)/2 + (t-1) = e(t-1) + (t-1).\n\nSo, for t=1, e(1) = 0.\n\nt=2: e(2) = e(1) +1 = 1.\n\nt=3: e(3) = e(2)+2=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, using this, we can compute e(t) for t up to 2e5 in O(1) per step, which is manageable.\n\nThen, for each t, compute 2^e(t) mod MOD.\n\nBut 2^e(t) can be computed using fast exponentiation for each t.\n\nBut with t up to 2e5, and each exponentiation taking O(log e(t)) time, which for e(t) up to 2e10 is about 35 steps, the total time would be 2e5 * 35 = 7e6 steps, which is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a pattern or mathematical formula to compute 2^e(t) quickly.\n\nWait, but e(t) = t(t-1)/2.\n\nSo, 2^e(t) = 2^{ t(t-1)/2 }.\n\nHmm, but I don't see an obvious way to express this as a product or use exponent rules to compute it quickly.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to compute for each t, the exponent e(t) and then compute 2^e(t) mod MOD using binary exponentiation.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\n- Compute e(t) for t from 0 to T, using the recurrence.\n\n- For each t, compute 2^e(t) mod MOD using fast exponentiation.\n\n- Sum the contributions as discussed.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read N and K.\n\nCompute T = min(K, N).\n\nCompute the sum as follows:\n\nans = 1 (for t=0)\n\nprecompute e(t) for t from 1 to T.\n\nfor t in 1 to T:\n\n   compute pow_val = 2^(e(t)) mod MOD\n\n   term = pow_val * (N - t +1) mod MOD\n\n   ans += term\n\n   ans %= MOD\n\nSo, in code, it would be something like:\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\nN, K = map(int, input().split())\n\nT = min(K, N)\n\nans = 1  # t=0 case\n\ne_prev = 0\n\npow2_cache = [1]  # 2^0 is 1\n\nfor t in range(1, T+1):\n\n    e_current = e_prev + (t-1)\n\n    # compute 2^e_current mod MOD\n\n    pow_val = pow(2, e_current, MOD)\n\n    # compute the term: pow_val * (N - t + 1)\n\n    term = pow_val * (N - t + 1)\n\n    ans = (ans + term) % MOD\n\n    e_prev = e_current\n\nprint(ans)\n\nWait, but this won't handle the t=0 case correctly because in the initial ans is 1, and for t=0, it's added once.\n\nWait, no: for t=0,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid arrays of sets that can be rearranged into a chain where each set is a child of the next. The solution involves understanding the structure of such chains and efficiently computing the number of valid configurations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Chain Structure**: Each set in the chain must be a subset of the next set's elements. This implies that the maximum element in each subsequent set must be exactly one greater than the previous set.\n2. **Non-Empty Sets**: For each non-empty set in the chain, the number of valid configurations is determined by the number of subsets of integers up to its maximum value.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: We use modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and precompute powers of 2 efficiently using binary exponentiation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\nN, K = map(int, input().split())\nT = min(K, N)\n\nans = 1  # Contribution from t=0 case\n\ncurrent_e = 0  # e(0) = 0\nfor t in range(1, T + 1):\n    current_e += t - 1\n    pow_val = pow(2, current_e, MOD)\n    term = pow_val * (N - t + 1)\n    ans = (ans + term) % MOD\n\nprint(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by reading the input values and initializing necessary variables.\n2. **Loop Through Possible t Values**: For each possible number of non-empty sets `t` (from 1 to `min(K, N)`), we compute the contribution of each valid configuration.\n3. **Exponent Calculation**: Using the recurrence relation, we compute the exponent for the power of 2 required for each configuration.\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: We use modular exponentiation to compute large powers efficiently and handle the modulo operation to keep numbers manageable.\n5. **Sum Contributions**: For each `t`, we compute the number of valid configurations and add it to the total sum, which is then printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all valid configurations while adhering to the constraints, providing an optimal solution for large input sizes.",
