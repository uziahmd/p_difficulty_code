There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about maximizing profit by building houses on a street with certain restrictions. \n\nAlright, let me read the problem statement carefully again. So, there are n spots on the street where each house can be built with a height between 0 and h. Each spot contributes a squared value equal to the height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in the range from l_i to r_i (inclusive), the tallest house must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit.\n\nHmm. So, the constraints are that for each of the m ranges, the maximum height in that range doesn't exceed x_i. And I want to assign heights to each spot such that all these constraints are satisfied, and the sum of squares is as large as possible.\n\nThe input gives n, h, m, followed by m lines each with l_i, r_i, x_i. The output should be the maximum possible sum of squares.\n\nSo, how do I model this? It feels like a dynamic programming problem or maybe using some kind of constraints satisfaction approach. Since n and m are up to 50, which is manageable, perhaps a DP approach is feasible.\n\nLet me think about the possible approaches.\n\nOne way is to model the problem by considering each spot and the constraints that affect it. But the constraints can overlap, making it tricky. For example, a single spot might be covered by multiple restrictions, each imposing their own maximums. So, the actual maximum allowed for that spot is the minimum of all the x_i's of the restrictions that include it, as well as h.\n\nWait, no. Because each restriction specifies that the maximum in its range is <= x_i. So, for any spot in the range [l_i, r_i], the height cannot exceed x_i. So, for each spot, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of all x_i where the spot is in l_i..r_i, and also h. Because if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions, each imposes a ceiling, and the tightest one is the smallest x_i among them.\n\nBut wait, no. Because each restriction applies to a range, and the maximum in that range must be <= x_i. So, for a particular spot, the maximum possible height it can have is the minimum of all x_i's of the restrictions that include it, but also subject to being at least as small as each of those x_i's. Wait, no—each restriction that covers the spot requires that the maximum in that range is <= x_i. So, for each spot, the maximum it can have is the minimum x_i across all restrictions that include it, but also not exceeding h.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: Suppose a spot is in two ranges, each with their own x_i. Then, for each range, the maximum in that range must be <= x_i. So, for that spot, the maximum height it can take is the minimum of all x_i's of the restrictions that include it. Because if it takes a higher value than any of those x_i's, then that particular restriction would be violated.\n\nAh, right. So for each spot, the maximum allowed height is min{x_i for all i where l_i ≤ pos ≤ r_i} ∪ {h}. So, the maximum allowed is the minimum of all x_i's for the restrictions covering that spot, but also can't exceed h. Wait, but if the spot isn't covered by any restriction, then the maximum is h.\n\nSo, for each spot, the maximum height allowed is the minimum of x_i's of all restrictions that include it, and if there are none, then h.\n\nBut wait, that's only part of the problem. Because even if a spot's maximum allowed is, say, 5, but another spot in a different restriction could have a higher maximum. But the overall problem is that for each restriction, the maximum in its range must be <= x_i. So, for each range l_i to r_i, the maximum height in that range must be <= x_i. That includes any spot in that range.\n\nThis seems complicated because the constraints can overlap. So, it's not just about each spot's maximum, but also ensuring that for every restriction, the maximum in its range is <= x_i.\n\nHmm, so how can I model this? Maybe the key is to represent for each position, the maximum height it can have, but also track which restrictions are satisfied.\n\nWait, but with n=50, it's manageable to consider each position's height, but the number of possibilities could be high. So perhaps we need a dynamic programming approach that tracks the necessary information.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as finding for each spot the highest possible height it can have, given all the restrictions. But since the restrictions are interdependent, that's not straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps the constraints form",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street with given constraints. Each house contributes a profit based on its height squared, but there are restrictions on the maximum height within specific ranges of spots. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Constraints**: Each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a given range must be at most a certain height. For each spot, the maximum allowed height is determined by the minimum height constraint imposed by all applicable restrictions and the global maximum height `h`.\n\n2. **Determine Maximum Heights for Each Spot**: For each spot, compute the maximum allowable height considering all overlapping restrictions. This ensures that no restriction is violated.\n\n3. **Calculate Profit**: Once the maximum heights for each spot are determined, compute the total profit as the sum of the squares of these heights.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n\n# For each position, find the maximum allowed height\nmax_heights = [h] * (n + 1)  # positions are 1-based\n\nfor l, r, x in restrictions:\n    for pos in range(l, r + 1):\n        if max_heights[pos] > x:\n            max_heights[pos] = x\n\n# Now calculate the profit\nprofit = 0\nfor pos in range(1, n + 1):\n    profit += (max_heights[pos]) ** 2\n\nprint(profit)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of spots, maximum height, and number of restrictions. Each restriction specifies a range and a maximum height for that range.\n\n2. **Processing Restrictions**: For each spot, determine the maximum allowable height by considering the minimum height constraint from all applicable restrictions. This ensures that the tallest house in each specified range does not exceed the given restriction.\n\n3. **Compute Profit**: After determining the maximum allowable heights for each spot, compute the total profit by summing the squares of these heights.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each restriction and ensures that all constraints are satisfied while maximizing the profit.",
