And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Average Sleep Time.\" Hmm.\n\nThe task says that Polycarp has been keeping track of his sleep times for n days. But the doctor considers a week as k consecutive days. So, we need to calculate the average sleep time per week over all possible weeks in the given data.\n\nWait, right. So, if there are n days, then the number of possible weeks is n - k + 1. For each of these weeks (which are just sequences of k consecutive days), we sum up the sleep hours and then compute the average.\n\nSo, the steps are: for each window of size k in the array a, sum them all, then divide by the number of windows.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2*10^5. So, we need an efficient way to compute the sum of all windows without doing O(nk) operations, which would be too slow.\n\nHmm, how to compute the sum efficiently? Oh right, sliding window technique or using prefix sums.\n\nYes, the prefix sum approach would work here. Let me think about how to do that.\n\nLet's see:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array. The prefix sum at index i is the sum of the first i elements.\n\n2. Then, for each window starting at index i (from 0 to n - k), the sum is prefix_sum[i + k] - prefix_sum[i].\n\n3. Sum all these window sums and then divide by the number of windows.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read n and k.\n- Read the array a.\n- Compute the prefix sum array.\n- Iterate through each possible window, calculate each window's sum, add to total.\n- Finally, divide total by the number of windows and output with sufficient precision.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure about the indices. Since Python uses 0-based indexing, the prefix sum will have n+1 elements where prefix_sum[0] = 0, prefix_sum[1] = a[0], etc. So for a window from index s to s + k -1 in the original array, the sum is prefix_sum[s + k] - prefix_sum[s].\n\nYes.\n\nNow, considering the constraints. n can be up to 2e5, and for each window, the computation is O(1). So the overall complexity is O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nThen read the list a.\n\nCompute the prefix sums.\n\nCompute the total sum across all windows.\n\nDivide by (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\nThen print the average with 10 decimal places or more, ensuring that the error is within 1e-6.\n\nWait, but in the output examples, sometimes it's printed with 10 decimal digits, sometimes more. Like in the third example, the output is '28964.2857142857' which is 10 digits after the decimal. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nNo, looking at the examples:\n\nFirst example input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nThe output is 9.0000000000 → 10 decimal digits.\n\nSecond example input:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nOutput is 10.0000000000 → again 10 digits.\n\nThird example:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nn=8, k=2. So 7 windows.\n\nThe sum is 1+2=3, 2+4=6, 4+100000=100004, 100000+123=100123, 123+456=579, 456+789=1245, 789+1=790.\n\nAdding these: 3+6=9, +100004=100013, +100123=200136, +579=200715, +1245=201960, +790=202750.\n\nTotal is 202750. Divided by 7 gives approximately 28964.2857142857..., which is printed with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo, the output needs to have at least 6 decimal digits, but perhaps more, but the sample outputs have 10. So probably, the code should output 10 decimal digits.\n\nIn Python, when printing, we can format the output to have 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo, the plan is solid.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- When k = n: only one window, sum all elements, average is sum / 1.\n\n- When k=1: each element is a window, so average is sum(a)/n.\n\nOther cases: n =k =1.\n\nAlso, handling very large numbers, but since we're dealing with integers, adding them as integers and then converting to float at the end should be fine.\n\nWait, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a given dataset. Each week is defined as k consecutive days, and we need to compute the average over all such weeks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We are given `n` days of sleep data and need to find the average sleep time per week, where each week consists of `k` consecutive days. The number of such weeks is `n - k + 1`.\n\n2. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: Directly summing each window of `k` days would be inefficient for large `n`. Instead, we use prefix sums to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n\n3. **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the sleep data. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in O(1) time.\n\n4. **Sliding Window Technique**: Using the prefix sum array, iterate through each possible window of `k` days, compute the sum, and accumulate the total sum of all windows.\n\n5. **Compute Average**: Divide the total sum of all windows by the number of windows to get the average sleep time per week.\n\n6. **Precision Handling**: Ensure the result is printed with sufficient precision to meet the problem's requirements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n    \n    total = 0\n    num_windows = n - k + 1\n    for i in range(num_windows):\n        start = i\n        end = i + k\n        total += prefix[end] - prefix[start]\n    \n    average = total / num_windows\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, parsed into integers `n` and `k`, and the sleep data array `a`.\n- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array is built to allow quick calculation of any subarray sum.\n- **Total Sum Calculation**: Using the prefix sum array, we efficiently compute the sum of each window of `k` days and accumulate the total.\n- **Average Calculation**: The total sum is divided by the number of windows to get the average sleep time per week.\n- **Output**: The result is formatted to ensure it meets the required precision and printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle up to the maximum constraints efficiently, providing the correct result within acceptable time limits.",
