    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Golden Plate,\" and from the description, I need to calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding k rings of gilding.\n\nHmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully. Oh right, each ring is formed by the perimeter of a rectangle that's progressively smaller. The first ring is along the edge, then the next is two cells in, and so on. Each ring is one cell thick.\n\nSo the input gives me w (width), h (height), and k (number of rings). My task is to compute the total number of gilded cells.\n\nLet me think about how to model each ring. For each i-th ring (starting from 1 to k), the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)). Because each ring reduces both width and height by 4: subtract 2 from each side (left and right, top and bottom) which is 4 in total.\n\nWait, but for each ring, the perimeter is the number of cells around the current rectangle. So for a rectangle of size a x b, the number of perimeter cells is 2*(a + b - 2). Because each of the four sides contributes (length) cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice.\n\nFor example, if the rectangle is 3x3, the perimeter is 8 cells (since 2*(3+3-2) = 8). Which matches the first sample input where 3x3 with k=1 gives 8.\n\nAnother example: 7x9 with k=1. The perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28, which matches the second sample output.\n\nAnd when k=2, the next ring would be 7-4=3 columns and 9-4=5 rows. The perimeter for 3x5 is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Adding to the previous 28, gives 40, which matches the third sample.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each ring from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute the current width and height: w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h -4*(i-1).\n   b. If either w_i or h_i is less than or equal to 0, we can't form the ring, so we break out of the loop.\n   c. Calculate the perimeter for this ring: 2 * (w_i + h_i - 2)\n   d. Sum all these perimeters.\n\nBut wait, the condition for k is given as 1 ≤ k ≤ floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). So for some cases, it's possible that after k rings, the dimensions are still positive. But perhaps during calculation, for some i up to k, the w_i or h_i could be invalid. So I need to make sure that for each i, the current w_i and h_i are at least 3, because otherwise, the ring can't be formed.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial problem says that the i-th ring is based on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). So for each i, the rectangle must have at least 3 cells in each dimension, else the ring can't exist.\n\nWait, but the constraints say that k is chosen such that it's within the maximum possible. So perhaps in code, I don't have to worry about that case. But maybe it's better to handle it just in case.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\nRead w, h, k from input.\n\nInitialize total_gilded = 0.\n\nLoop i from 1 to k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   if current_w <= 2 or current_h <=2: skip (but according to constraints, this won't happen)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   add perimeter to total_gilded\n\nReturn total_gilded.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nLet me test this logic against the samples.\n\nSample 1: 3 3 1.\n\ni=1: current_w=3, current_h=3. perimeter = 2*(3+3-2) = 8. Total is 8.\n\nSample 2:7 9 1.\n\ni=1: 7+9-2=14, 2*14=28. Total 28.\n\nSample3:7 9 2.\n\ni=1: 7+9-2=14*2=28.\n\ni=2: current_w=7",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding k rings of gilding. Each ring is formed by the perimeter of an increasingly smaller rectangle inside the plate.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each ring is formed by the perimeter of a rectangle that is 2 cells inward from the previous ring. The i-th ring reduces both the width and height of the rectangle by 4 cells (2 cells from each side). The perimeter of a rectangle with dimensions `a x b` is calculated as `2 * (a + b - 2)` because we subtract the 4 corners which are counted twice.\n\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the current dimensions of the rectangle, calculate its perimeter, and add it to the total count of gilded cells.\n\n3. **Constraints Handling**: The problem constraints ensure that the given k will not cause the rectangle dimensions to become invalid (i.e., less than 3 cells in any dimension), so we don't need additional checks beyond the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the dimensions of the plate (w, h) and the number of rings (k).\n- **Loop Through Each Ring**: For each ring, starting from 1 up to k, the code calculates the current dimensions of the rectangle considering the inward reduction for each subsequent ring.\n- **Calculate Perimeter**: For each rectangle, the perimeter is computed using the formula `2 * (width + height - 2)`, which accounts for all bordering cells without double-counting the corners.\n- **Summing Up**: The perimeters of all rings are summed up to get the total number of gilded cells, which is then printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal within the given constraints.",
