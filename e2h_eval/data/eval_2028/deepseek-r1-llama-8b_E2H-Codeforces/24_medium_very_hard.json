She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a browser with multiple tabs and Luba needs to close some of them as quickly as possible.\n\nHmm, the problem statement says that Luba has n opened tabs, indexed from 1 to n. The cursor is currently at position 'pos'. She needs to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. So, she has to close all tabs outside this range.\n\nEach second, she can either move the cursor left or right (but not beyond the current open tabs) or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor. Oh right, because when you close tabs, the remaining ones have their own a and b which define the new boundaries.\n\nSo, the goal is to find the minimum number of seconds needed to achieve this.\n\nLet me think about the steps she needs to take. She might need to move the cursor to certain positions to close the necessary tabs, then close them, and maybe move again if needed.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what needs to be closed. There are two cases: the initial position is inside [l, r], or outside. Wait, no, the initial position could be anywhere, but she needs to end up with exactly [l, r].\n\nWait, let's break it down.\n\nCase 1: Tabs to the left of l need to be closed.\nCase 2: Tabs to the right of r need to be closed.\n\nBut depending on where the cursor is, she might have to move to specific points before closing.\n\nLet me consider the example given in the problem statement.\n\nIn the first test case:\nInput is 6 3 2 4. So, n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nShe needs to close tabs 1 and 5,6.\n\nHer steps were:\nMove to tab 2 (cost 1 step), close left (cost 1 step), move to 3 (another step?), then to 4 (another step), then close right (1 step). So total 5 steps.\n\nWait, how does moving work? Each move takes one second, regardless of how far she moves. So, for example, moving from 3 to 2 is one step, from 2 to 4 is two steps (2→3, then 3→4). Or wait, no—each move is one step, but each move is a single position change. So moving from i to j takes |i-j| steps.\n\nWait, no. The problem says each second, she can either move or close. So moving from i to j takes |i-j| seconds because each move is one step per second.\n\nSo, the movement cost is the distance between the current position and the target.\n\nNow, the strategy is:\n\n- Determine which tabs need to be closed on the left and right.\n- Decide the optimal order of moving and closing to minimize the steps.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps.\n\nFirst, check if l and r are already such that all tabs outside are closed. For example, if l=1 and r=n, then no action is needed. That's the third test case in the sample, which outputs 0.\n\nOtherwise, she needs to close the left and/or right parts.\n\nLet's compute the left part and the right part.\n\nLeft part: any tabs before l must be closed. So, she needs to close from 1 to l-1.\n\nRight part: any tabs after r must be closed. So, she needs to close from r+1 to n.\n\nWait, but if l=1, there's nothing to the left. Similarly for r=n.\n\nSo, first, determine whether we need to close left and/or right.\n\nIf both are needed, then she needs to handle both.\n\nSo, for the left side:\n\nShe needs to get to a position where she can close the left side. But the only way to close the left is to have the cursor at some position i, and then close left, which will close all tabs to the left of i. So, the optimal position for closing the left is as far to the right as possible within the left segment. Because that way, she can cover as much as possible in one step.\n\nSimilarly for the right: she needs to get to a position as far left as possible within the right segment to close the right side.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify.\n\nFor the left closure: to close all tabs before l, she needs to position the cursor at a position >= l. Because when she closes left, everything to the left of current position is closed. So, the best spot is the minimal i >= l, which is l itself.\n\nSo, to close the left, she needs to get to position l and then close left, which will close all tabs before l.\n\nSimilarly, for the right, she needs to get to position r and close right, which will close all tabs after r.\n\nBut wait, what if she doesn't need to close both sides? For example, if l is 2 and r is 4, and the initial position is 3. She can close left first by moving to 2 and closing, then move to 4 and close right. Or maybe she can close right first by moving to 4, then close, then move back to 2 and close left.\n\nWhich approach is better?\n\nDepends on the distances and the order.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal strategy is to decide the order of closing left and right, and compute the time for each, then choose the minimal.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes it's better to close one side first, then the other.\n\nSo, let's model this.\n\nFirst, let's determine whether we need to close left (left_needed = (l > 1)), and whether we need to close right (right_needed = (r < n)).\n\nIf neither is needed, return 0.\n\nIf only left is needed, or only right is needed, handle accordingly.\n\nIf both are needed, then we need to plan the order.\n\nSo, let's model the steps required for each scenario.\n\nCase 1: Only left needed.\n\nShe needs to:\n\n- Move to l, which takes |pos - l| steps.\n- Close left, which is 1 step.\n\nTotal: |pos - l| + 1.\n\nCase 2: Only right needed.\n\nShe needs to:\n\n- Move to r, which takes |pos - r| steps.\n- Close right, which is 1 step.\n\nTotal: |pos - r| + 1.\n\nCase 3: Both left and right needed.\n\nHere, she has two options:\n\nOption A: Close left first, then right.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Move from pos to l: steps = |pos - l|.\n2. Close left: 1 step.\n3. Now, the available tabs are from l to r. So, she needs to move from l to r to close the right side.\n   The distance from l to r is (r - l).\n   So, move: (r-l) steps.\n4. Close right: 1 step.\nTotal steps: |pos - l| + 1 + (r-l) + 1.\n\nOption B: Close right first, then left.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Move from pos to r: |pos - r| steps.\n2. Close right: 1 step.\n3. Now, the available tabs are from l to r. So, move from r to l: (r - l) steps.\n4. Close left: 1 step.\nTotal steps: |pos - r| + 1 + (r - l) + 1.\n\nWe need to choose the minimal between option A and option B.\n\nBut wait, after closing left, the a becomes l, and b becomes r. So, when moving from l to r, the distance is r - l, yes.\n\nSo, the total for option A is (distance to l) + 1 (close left) + (distance from l to r) + 1 (close right).\n\nSimilarly for option B.\n\nSo, the minimal steps for case 3 would be the minimum of these two options.\n\nAdditionally, there's another possibility: maybe she can reach a position that allows her to close both sides in fewer steps by moving through other positions.\n\nBut I think the two options A and B are the only possibilities since any other path would require more steps.\n\nWait, no. What if after closing one side, the other side is closer?\n\nLike, suppose she closes left first. Then, she can move to the right side and close right. Alternatively, maybe she can find a point where she can do something else.\n\nBut I think that considering the two options (A and B) covers all possibilities because any other path would have a longer total distance.\n\nSo, the minimal steps for case 3 is min(A, B).\n\nBut wait, what about if after closing left, she doesn't need to go all the way to r?\n\nNo, because after closing left, the right part is from l to r, and she needs to close the right of r, which requires being at r.\n\nSo, for case 3, the two options are the only ones to consider.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nCompute:\n\nleft_needed = l > 1\nright_needed = r < n\n\nIf neither, output 0.\n\nElse if only left needed, steps = |pos - l| + 1.\n\nElse if only right needed, steps = |pos - r| + 1.\n\nElse (both needed):\n\noption_a = |pos - l| + 1 + (r - l) + 1\noption_b = |pos - r| + 1 + (r - l) + 1\nsteps = min(option_a, option_b)\n\nWait, no. Because option_a is the sum for closing left first, then right.\n\nWait, in option_a, after moving to l and closing, she can directly move to r (distance is r-l) and close right.\n\nSimilarly for option_b.\n\nSo, yes, the formula is correct.\n\nWait, but let's test this with the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 3 2 4.\n\nn=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nleft_needed = True, right_needed=True.\n\noption_a: |3-2|=1, +1 (close left) → 2 steps so far. Then, moving to 4 is 2 steps (from 2 to 4 is 2 steps). Then +1 to close right. Total 1+1+2+1=5.\n\noption_b: |3-4|=1, +1 (close right) → 2 steps. Then, moving from 4 to 2 is 2 steps, +1 to close left. Total 1+1+2+1=5. So min(5,5)=5. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: 6 3 1 3.\n\nHere, l=1, r=3. So, left_needed is False because l=1, and right_needed is 3 <6 → True.\n\nSo, right_needed is True.\n\nSo, she needs to close right.\n\nShe is at pos=3.\n\nTo close right, she needs to move to 3, then close right. But wait, after closing right, the right part is 3 to 6, but she needs to keep 1-3. So, she needs to close the right of 3, which is 4,5,6.\n\nSo, steps: move from 3 to 3 (no steps), close right (1 step). Total 1.\n\nWhich is the sample output.\n\nThird sample: 5 2 1 5.\n\nSo, l=1, r=5. So, all tabs are kept. No steps needed.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nleft_needed: yes (since 2>1)\nright_needed: yes (4<5)\n\nCompute option_a and option_b.\n\noption_a: |3-2|=1 +1 + (4-2)=2 +1 → 1+1+2+1=5.\n\noption_b: |3-4|=1 +1 + (4-2)=2 +1 → same 5.\n\nSo, total steps 5.\n\nBut what if pos is 1, l=2, r=4, n=5.\n\nleft_needed: 2>1 → yes.\n\nright_needed: 4<5 → yes.\n\noption_a: |1-2|=1 +1 + (4-2)=2 +1 → 5.\n\noption_b: |1-4|=3 +1 + (4-2)=2 +1 → 3+1+2+1=7.\n\nSo option_a is better.\n\nAnother case: n=100, pos=50, l=30, r=70.\n\nleft_needed: yes.\n\nright_needed: yes.\n\noption_a: |50-30|=20 +1 + (70-30)=40 +1 → 62.\n\noption_b: |50-70|=20 +1 +40 +1 →62.\n\nSo, same.\n\nAnother case: n=10, pos=5, l=3, r=8.\n\nleft_needed: yes.\n\nright_needed: yes.\n\noption_a: move to 3: 5-3=2 steps. Close left (1). Move to 8: 5 steps (3 to 8 is 5). Close right (1). Total 2+1+5+1=9.\n\noption_b: move to 8: 3 steps. Close right (1). Then move to 3: 5 steps. Close left (1). Total 3+1+5+1=10.\n\nSo option_a is better.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold.\n\nSo, now, the plan is:\n\n- Compute whether left and/or right need to be closed.\n\n- For each case, compute the steps accordingly.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where l=1 and r=n: steps 0.\n\nCase where l=1 and r <n: need to close right.\n\nCase where r=n and l>1: need to close left.\n\nCase where l>1 and r<n.\n\nAnother edge case: initial pos is l or r.\n\nE.g., pos is l: then, for left_needed, she can close left immediately.\n\nSimilarly, if pos is r, she can close right.\n\nSo, let's code this.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nCompute left_needed = (l > 1)\n\nright_needed = (r < n)\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n    # compute option_a and option_b\n\n    move_to_l = abs(pos - l)\n\n    move_to_r = abs(pos - r)\n\n    option_a = move_to_l + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n\n    option_b = move_to_r + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n\n    total = min(option_a, option_b)\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n    # only close left\n\n    total = abs(pos - l) +1\n\nelse:\n\n    # only close right\n\n    total = abs(pos - r) +1\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what about when after closing one side, the other side's required movement is different.\n\nWait, no. Because once you close left, the available tabs are from l to r, so the movement to r is (r - l) steps.\n\nBut what if after closing left, the right is not just from l to r, but perhaps from l to r?\n\nYes, because after closing left, the left boundary is l.\n\nSo, for example, if she closes left first, she's at l. Then she needs to go to r to close the right.\n\nWhich is (r-l) steps.\n\nSame if she closes right first, then goes to l.\n\nSo, the formula holds.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nleft and right needed.\n\noption_a: 1 +1 +2 +1=5.\n\noption_b:1 +1 +2 +1=5.\n\nmin is 5.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3.\n\nonly right needed.\n\nsteps: |3-3|=0 +1=1.\n\nSample3:\n\nn=5, l=1, r=5. Output 0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5.\n\noutput 0.\n\nAnother case:\n\nn=7, pos=4, l=2, r=5.\n\nleft_needed: yes.\n\nright_needed: no (r=5 <7? Yes, so right_needed is yes.\n\nWait, no. r=5 <7, so right_needed is yes.\n\nSo, she needs to close both.\n\nCompute option_a:\n\nmove to 2: 4-2=2 steps. Close left: 1. Then move to 5: 3 steps. Close right:1. Total 2+1+3+1=7.\n\noption_b:\n\nmove to 5: 1 step. Close right:1. Then move to 2: 3 steps. Close left:1. Total 1+1+3+1=6.\n\nSo, option_b is better, steps 6.\n\nSo, our formula would compute:\n\nmove_to_l = 2, move_to_r=1.\n\noption_a: 2+1+3+1=7.\n\noption_b: 1+1+3+1=6.\n\nSo, min(7,6) is 6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code should correctly handle this.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nThe code will read four integers from input.\n\nThen, compute left_needed and right_needed.\n\nBased on that, compute the steps.\n\nHandle the cases.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nleft_needed = l > 1\n\nright_needed = r < n\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n    move_to_l = abs(pos - l)\n\n    move_to_r = abs(pos - r)\n\n    option_a = move_to_l + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n\n    option_b = move_to_r + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n\n    total = min(option_a, option_b)\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n    total = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelse:\n\n    total = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what about when l is 1 and r is less than n.\n\nLike n=10, l=1, r=5.\n\nSo, she needs to close right (5 <10).\n\nSo, steps: move to 5 (distance from pos), then close right.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat if pos is 5? Then steps are 0 +1 =1.\n\nAnother case: pos is 3, l=2, r=4, n=6.\n\nleft and right needed.\n\noption_a: 3-2=1 +1 +2 +1=5.\n\noption_b: 3-4=1 +1 +2 +1=5.\n\nSo, 5 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: pos is 1, l=2, r=3, n=5.\n\nleft_needed: yes (2>1).\n\nright_needed: 3<5 → yes.\n\nSo, option_a: move to 2 (1 step) + close left (1) → 2 steps so far.\n\nThen move to 3: 1 step. Close right: 1.\n\nTotal 1+1+1+1=4.\n\noption_b: move to 3 (2 steps) + close right (1) → 3 steps.\n\nThen move to 2: 1 step. Close left: 1.\n\nTotal 2+1+1+1=5.\n\nSo, option_a is better.\n\nWhich is computed as 1+1 +1+1=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nI think this should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment in her browser. The goal is to efficiently move the cursor and close tabs either to the left or right of the current position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Need to Close Tabs**: Determine if tabs need to be closed on the left (if `l > 1`), on the right (if `r < n`), both, or neither.\n2. **Calculate Movement and Closing Steps**:\n   - If only left or right tabs need closing, calculate the steps required to move to the respective end and close the tabs.\n   - If both left and right tabs need closing, compute the steps for two strategies: closing left first then right, and vice versa.
