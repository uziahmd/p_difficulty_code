Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Lanterns.\" Hmm.\n\nSo, the setup is that Vanya is walking along a straight street of length l. There are n lanterns placed along this street. Each lantern can light all points within a distance d from it. The goal is to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nWait, right. So each lantern covers a segment of the street. The union of all these segments needs to cover the entire [0, l] interval. And we need the smallest possible d.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Well, let's think about the input. We have n lanterns, each at position ai. We need to determine the minimal radius d where every point on the street is within d of at least one lantern.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is that the minimal d is determined by the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. Because, for any two adjacent lanterns, if their coverage doesn't overlap, then the midpoint between them will be the furthest point not covered, which determines the required d.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider the edges of the street. Like, the first lantern's left end (ai - d) must be <= 0, and the last lantern's right end (ai + d) must be >= l. Otherwise, the ends might not be covered.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because the coverage depends on the order along the street.\n\n2. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the distance between them. The required d for each pair is half of that distance because the midpoint would be the furthest point not covered otherwise. The maximum of these values across all consecutive pairs is a candidate for d.\n\n3. Also, check the coverage from the first lantern to the start (0) and from the last lantern to the end (l). The required d for the first is max(0 - a1, 0) / 1, but wait no, more accurately, the first lantern's coverage starts at a1 - d. It must be <=0, so d must be at least a1. Similarly, the last lantern must cover up to l, so d must be at least l - a_last.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe first lantern is at a1. To cover 0, the radius d must be at least a1. Because 0 is at a distance of a1 from a1. So d >= a1.\n\nSimilarly, the last lantern is at a_n. To cover l, the radius must be at least (l - a_n). So d >= (l - a_n).\n\nSo the minimal d is the maximum between the largest gap between consecutive lanterns (divided by two) and the maximum of a1 and (l - a_n).\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because the largest gap determines the minimal required radius to bridge it. But also, the first and last lanterns have to cover the ends of the street, which may require a larger radius than the gaps.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Sort the lanterns in increasing order of their positions.\n- Compute the initial required d as the maximum between a1 and (l - a_last).\n- Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them, divide by 2, and track the maximum. If this maximum is larger than the current d, update d.\n- The overall minimal d is the maximum between the initial d and the maximum of the gaps.\n\nWait, but the initial d is the maximum of a1 and (l - a_last), which are the required to cover the ends. Then, the maximum gap between any two consecutive lanterns gives the minimal d needed for the middle parts. So the overall minimal d is the maximum between the initial d and the maximum gap.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause if the maximum gap between two lanterns is larger than the initial d, then we need to choose d to be that maximum gap divided by two. Because otherwise, the midpoint of that gap won't be covered. For example, if two lanterns are 5 units apart, then the required d is 2.5 to cover the midpoint.\n\nSo, to compute the minimal d, we need to consider both the endpoints and the largest gap between consecutive lanterns.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the list of ai.\n\n2. Check if the sorted list has only one lantern. In that case, d must be the maximum of (a1) and (l - a1), since the lantern has to cover both ends. Wait, no: if there's only one lantern, then the radius must be at least a1 (to cover 0) and at least (l - a1) (to cover l). So d is the maximum of a1 and (l - a1). That",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all points on a street of length \\( l \\) are lit by \\( n \\) lanterns placed at specific positions. Each lantern lights all points within a distance \\( d \\) from it.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to facilitate the calculation of distances between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Edge Cases Handling**: If there's only one lantern, the required radius \\( d \\) must cover both ends of the street, which means \\( d \\) is the maximum of the distance from the lantern to the start and the end of the street.\n3. **Calculate Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them. The midpoint of this distance determines the required radius to cover the gap. Track the maximum of these midpoints.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The required radius \\( d \\) is the maximum value between the largest gap midpoint and the furthest end coverage needed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef minimal_d():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    l = int(input[1])\n    ai = list(map(int, input[2:2+n]))\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n    \n    ai.sort()\n    \n    # Check for single lantern case\n    if n == 1:\n        d = max(ai[0], l - ai[0])\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n        return\n    \n    max_end = max(ai[0], l - ai[-1])\n    max_gap = 0.0\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = ai[i] - ai[i-1]\n        mid = gap / 2.0\n        if mid > max_gap:\n            max_gap = mid\n    \n    d = max(max_end, max_gap)\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nminimal_d()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of lanterns \\( n \\), the length of the street \\( l \\), and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to facilitate the calculation of distances between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Single Lantern Case**: If there's only one lantern, the required radius must cover both ends of the street, so \\( d \\) is the maximum of the distance from the lantern to the start and the end of the street.\n4. **Gap Calculation**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the distance between them is computed, and the midpoint (which is the furthest point not covered by either lantern) is tracked as the maximum gap.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The required radius \\( d \\) is determined by taking the maximum of the furthest end coverage and the largest gap midpoint. This ensures that the entire street is lit with the minimum possible radius.",
