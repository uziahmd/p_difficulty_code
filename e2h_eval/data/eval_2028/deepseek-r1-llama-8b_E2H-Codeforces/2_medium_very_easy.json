Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X'. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe grid is n x n, where n is odd. The conditions for it being an 'X' are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same character.\n2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same character, which is different from the diagonal ones.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to check the two main diagonals. Then, check that all non-diagonal cells have the same character and that this character is different from the diagonal.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is n, followed by n lines each containing n characters. So in Python, I can read n, then read each line, stripping any leading/trailing whitespace, since sometimes when you split lines, there might be newlines or spaces.\n\nWait, but looking at the sample input, it's given as strings with '\\n' separators. So each of the next n lines is a string representing a row. So for example, in the first sample, the first line is '5', then the next five lines are the rows.\n\nSo in code, perhaps something like:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNext, I need to check the diagonals. The main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left.\n\nFor each cell (i, j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j, and on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n-1 (since indexes start at 0).\n\nSo for the grid, I can collect all the characters on both diagonals.\n\nBut wait, the condition is that both diagonals must have the same character. So first, I should extract all the characters from both diagonals and see if they're all the same.\n\nWait, no. Because maybe one diagonal has some other characters? No, because the problem says that on both diagonals, all letters are the same. So the entire main diagonal must be the same as the entire anti-diagonal.\n\nSo step 1: Check that all the cells on the main diagonal are the same as each other, and all cells on the anti-diagonal are the same as each other. Also, the two diagonals must have the same character.\n\nWait, but perhaps the main diagonal is all 'x's and the anti-diagonal is all 'x's. That's acceptable. Or maybe the main is 'a's and the anti is 'a's. So the two diagonals must have the same character.\n\nSo first, collect the main diagonal characters into a set. If the size is more than 1, then it's invalid. Similarly for the anti-diagonal. Also, check that the main and anti-diagonals have the same character.\n\nIf either diagonal has more than one distinct character, the answer is NO.\n\nOnce that's done, we move to checking the other cells.\n\nThe other cells (non-diagonal) must all be the same, and this must be different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo for all cells that are not on either diagonal, their character must be the same as each other and different from the diagonal.\n\nSo let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n\n2. Extract main diagonal and anti-diagonal characters.\n\n   a. For each cell (i, j):\n      - if i == j → main diagonal\n      - if i + j == n-1 → anti-diagonal\n\n3. Check if all main diagonal are the same and all anti-diagonal are the same.\n\n4. Check if main and anti-diagonal have the same character.\n\n   If any of these checks fail, output NO.\n\n5. Now, for all other cells (i,j) not on either diagonal, check that their character is the same across all such cells.\n\n6. Additionally, this character must be different from the diagonal's character.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nNow, thinking about how to implement this.\n\nFor step 2, let's collect the main_diagonal_chars and anti_diagonal_chars.\n\nThen, for the main diagonal, check if all elements are equal. Same for anti.\n\nThen, check if the two sets are the same. Wait, no. Because main and anti could be different but have the same character. Like, if main is all 'x's and anti is all 'x's, that's fine. But if main is 'x's and anti is 'y's, that's bad.\n\nSo, for main_diag_char = main_diagonal_chars[0], and similarly for anti_diag_char, then if main_diag_char != anti_diag_char, it's invalid.\n\nWait, but what if the main diagonal has only one cell? Like when n=1. But according to the problem statement, n >=3 and is odd, so n is at least 3. So main and anti diagonals have at least 3 cells each? No, for n=3, each has 3 cells.\n\nWait, no. For n=3, the main diagonal is 3 cells (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). Anti-diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So for n=3, they share the center cell.\n\nSo in that case, the main and anti diagonals have overlapping cells. So, for example, in the sample input where n=3:\n\nLooking at the second sample input:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\nRow 1: s w s\nRow 2: w s w\n\nMain diagonal is (0,0)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,2)=w.\n\nAnti-diagonal is (0,2)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,0)=w.\n\nSo both diagonals have only 'w's.\n\nOther cells: (0,1)=s, (1,0)=s, (1,2)=s, (2,1)=s.\n\nSo all non-diagonal cells are 's's, and 's' is different from 'w'.\n\nSo it's a valid 'X'.\n\nSo the output is YES.\n\nAnother sample is the third input:\n\n3\nx p x\np x p\nx p x\n\nWait, no, the third sample's input is:\n\nxpe\n\nWait, perhaps the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x p x\nRow 1: p x p\nRow 2: x p x\n\nWait, no. Let me look again.\n\nSample Input 3:\n['3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. Oh, perhaps I made a mistake in reading.\n\nWait, the third sample input is:\n\n3\nx p x\np x p\nx p e?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me see.\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample inputs are:\n\nThe third case is:\n\n3\nxpx\npxp\nxpe\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse each row correctly.\n\nBut perhaps that's not important now. Let's proceed.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nImplement the steps as above.\n\nNow, code-wise.\n\nFirst, read n and the grid.\n\nThen, for each cell, collect main_diag and anti_diag chars.\n\nCheck main_diag is all same, anti_diag is all same, and main_diag_char == anti_diag_char.\n\nIf any of these fail, return NO.\n\nElse, check all other cells:\n\nLoop through each cell (i,j), if it's not on either diagonal, collect its char.\n\nIf any of these collected chars are different, return NO.\n\nAlso, check that this char is different from the diag char.\n\nIf all pass, return YES.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nmain_diag = []\nanti_diag = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j:\n            main_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n        if i + j == n - 1:\n            anti_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\n# Check main_diag has all same\nif len(main_diag) == 0:\n    # Not possible as n >=3\n    pass\nmain_char = main_diag[0]\nif any(c != main_char for c in main_diag):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check anti_diag has all same\nanti_char = anti_diag[0]\nif any(c != anti_char for c in anti_diag):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check if main and anti are same\nif main_char != anti_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Now check all other cells\nother_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if (i != j) and (i + j != n-1):\n            c = grid[i][j]\n            if other_char is None:\n                other_char = c\n            else:\n                if c != other_char:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit()\n\n# Also, check that other_char is different from main_char\nif other_char == main_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but wait: what if there are no other cells? Like when n=1, but n is at least 3, so that's not a problem.\n\nSo in code, the above should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n5\n\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nMain diagonal: positions (0,0) = 'x', (1,1)='o', (2,2)='x', (3,3)='o', (4,4)='x'\n\nSo main_diag is ['x','o','x','o','x'] → not all same. So output is NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample:\n\n3\n\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nMain_diag is [w, w, w]\n\nAnti_diag is [w, w, w]. So same.\n\nOther cells are s's.\n\nSo other_char is 's' != 'w' → YES.\n\nThird sample:\n\n3\n\nx p x\np x p\nx p e\n\nWait, the third row is 'xpe' → which is 'x', 'p', 'e'.\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nMain_diag: (0,0)=x, (1,1)=x, (2,2)=e.\n\nSo main_diag is ['x','x','e'], which has different characters. So the code would detect that in the main_diag check and output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all diagonals are 'a's and others are 'b's. Should output YES.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, diagonals are 'a's, but non-diagonal cells have 'a's as well. Then, other_char is 'a' which is same as main_char, so output NO.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1. But according to problem statement, n >=3, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\nSuppose main and anti-diagonals are 'x's, but non-diagonal cells have 'y's. Output YES.\n\nWhat about when some non-diagonal cells have different letters? Like in a 3x3 grid, main and anti are 'x's, but one non-diagonal cell is 'y' and another is 'z'. Then, code will detect in the loop and output NO.\n\nSo I think this logic should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Reading the grid correctly: each row is read as a string, which may include \\n or other whitespace. So using .strip() is correct because it removes leading and trailing whitespace, including newlines.\n\nWait, for example, if a row is entered as 'abc\\n', then .strip() will make it 'abc'. Which is correct.\n\nAnother thing: when collecting the diagonals, for each cell, we take grid[i][j]. So for a row like 'abc', grid[i][j] is the j-th character.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nI think that's all.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter \"X\".
