There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about maximizing profit by building houses on a street with certain restrictions. \n\nAlright, let me read the problem statement carefully again. So, there are n spots on the street where each house can be built with a height between 0 and h. Each spot contributes a squared value equal to the height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in the range from l_i to r_i (inclusive), the tallest house must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit.\n\nHmm. So, the constraints are that for each of the m ranges, the maximum height in that range doesn't exceed x_i. And I want to assign heights to each spot such that all these constraints are satisfied, and the sum of squares is as large as possible.\n\nThe input gives n, h, m, followed by m lines each with l_i, r_i, x_i. The output should be the maximum possible sum of squares.\n\nSo, how do I model this? It feels like a dynamic programming problem or maybe using some kind of constraints satisfaction approach. Since n and m are up to 50, which is manageable, perhaps a DP approach is feasible.\n\nLet me think about the possible approaches.\n\nOne way is to model the problem by considering each spot and the constraints that affect it. But the constraints can overlap, making it tricky. For example, a spot might be covered by multiple restrictions, so the maximum of all applicable restrictions' x_i values would determine its maximum possible height.\n\nWait, no. Because each restriction is a separate constraint. For instance, if a spot is in two overlapping ranges, each with their own x_i, then the height must be <= the minimum of those x_i. Because both restrictions must be satisfied, so the height can't exceed either of them.\n\nAh, right. So for each spot, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of all x_i for all restrictions that include this spot in their l_i to r_i range.\n\nBut wait, that's not exactly correct. Because each restriction is a condition on the maximum height in a certain interval. So, for a given spot, all the restrictions that cover it impose a maximum height. So, the maximum height for the spot is the minimum of all x_i's from the restrictions that include it.\n\nYes, because if any restriction includes the spot and requires it to be at most x_i, then the height cannot exceed x_i. So, the maximum allowed height for each spot is the minimum of all x_i's where the spot is within [l_i, r_i].\n\nBut wait, what about the initial maximum height h? Oh right, because each spot's height can't exceed h. So for each spot, the maximum allowed height is the minimum between h and the minimum x_i across all restrictions that cover it.\n\nSo, for each spot i, compute the maximum possible height as min(h, min{x_i | i is in [l_j, r_j] for restriction j}).\n\nNo, wait. Because each restriction is a separate constraint. So for each spot, the maximum height allowed is the minimum of all x_i where the spot is in [l_i, r_i], but also, it can't exceed h. So, for each spot, we can precompute the effective maximum height as the minimum between h and the minimum x_i of all restrictions that cover it.\n\nWait, no. Because a spot could be covered by multiple restrictions. Each of those restrictions imposes a maximum height for that spot. So, the spot's height must be <= each of those x_i's. Therefore, the maximum possible height is the minimum of all x_i's from the covering restrictions, and also not exceeding h.\n\nSo yes, for each spot, its maximum possible height is the minimum between h and the smallest x_i among all restrictions that include it.\n\nSo first step: for each spot, find the minimal x_i from all restrictions that cover it. Then, the maximum height for that spot is the minimum between h and that minimal x_i.\n\nOnce I have the maximum allowed height for each spot, the problem reduces to choosing a height for each spot (from 0 up to its maximum) such that the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because the problem requires that for each restriction, the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i. So, if I set each spot's height to the minimal x_i of the covering restrictions, then each restriction will have their maximum as required.\n\nWait, no. Because suppose two spots are in the same restriction. If each of them is set to x_i, then the maximum is x_i. But for another restriction that overlaps, say, the first spot, perhaps with a lower x_j, then the first spot's maximum would be x_j, which is lower than x_i. So when that's done, the maximum in the new restriction's range would be min(x_j, other spots' x). Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect. Because if a spot is included in multiple restrictions, setting it to the minimum x_i of those might not be sufficient for all. For example, suppose a spot is included in two restrictions, one with x=3 and another with x=5. Then, the spot's maximum is 3. Now, for the first restriction, the max is 3, which is okay. For the second restriction, the spot's 3 is less than 5, which is also okay. So yes, that's acceptable.\n\nSo, the approach of setting each spot's height to the minimum x_i across all its covering restrictions (and not exceeding h) would satisfy all constraints. Because each spot's height is <= x_i for every restriction that covers it. Thus, for each restriction, the maximum in its range is the maximum of the heights in that range, which is <= x_i for each spot in it, hence the maximum is <= x_i.\n\nTherefore, the initial idea is valid. So, for each spot, compute the maximum allowed height as the minimum of h and the minimal x_i of all restrictions covering it.\n\nOnce we have the maximum allowed heights for each spot, the problem becomes assigning to each spot a height between 0 and its maximum allowed, such that the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nAh, but wait—no. Because for some restrictions, the maximum in their range may not be achieved by the individual spot's maximum. For example, imagine a restriction that covers a range where each spot's maximum is 3, but the restriction's x_i is 4. Then, the maximum in that range could be 3, which is <= x_i=4. So that's acceptable.\n\nSo, the initial approach seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. For each spot i (from 1 to n), determine all the restrictions that include it.\n2. For each such restriction, note its x_i.\n3. For the spot i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of all x_i's from the covering restrictions, and also the overall maximum h.\n4. Once I have for each spot i the maximum allowed height s_i = min( h, min {x_j | j is a restriction covering i} ), then the problem reduces to choosing a height a_i for each spot, such that 0 <= a_i <= s_i, and the sum of a_i^2 is maximized.\n\nBut wait, no. Because even if each spot's a_i is set to s_i, that might not necessarily make each restriction's maximum within x_i. Or wait, no—because each a_i is <= the x_i's of all covering restrictions. So the maximum in any restriction's range is the maximum of the a_i's in that range, which is <= the minimal x_i of all covering restrictions for each a_i. But wait, perhaps the maximum in the restriction's range could be higher than some x_j, but not necessarily.\n\nWait, no. Because for each spot in the restriction's range, its a_i is <= all x_k where k is a restriction that includes it. So for the current restriction, the a_i's in its range are each <= x_j (the x of this restriction), because this restriction's x_j is one of the x_k's that the a_i must be <=.\n\nSo, for the current restriction, the maximum a_i in its range is <= x_j. Thus, the initial approach works.\n\nSo, the problem can be simplified by precomputing s_i for each spot, which is the minimum between h and the minimal x_j over all restrictions that include it.\n\nThen, the problem reduces to choosing a_i for each spot, where 0 <= a_i <= s_i, and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nThis is a classic problem. To maximize the sum of squares given upper bounds, the optimal choice is to set each a_i to its maximum possible s_i. Because the square function is increasing for non-negative numbers.\n\nWait, right! Because the square function is convex and increasing for x >= 0. So, to maximize the sum of squares, each a_i should be as large as possible, i.e., a_i = s_i.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Are there any dependencies between spots that might require some a_i to be smaller than s_i?\n\nNo, because once the maximum allowed for each spot is determined, setting each a_i to s_i will automatically satisfy all the constraints. Because for each restriction, the maximum a_i in its range is <= s_i, which is <= x_j for that restriction.\n\nBecause s_i is the minimum of all x_k for restrictions covering spot i, including the current restriction j. So, s_i <= x_j. Thus, in the range l_j to r_j, all a_i's are <= s_i <= x_j. Hence, the maximum in that range is <= x_j, satisfying the restriction.\n\nTherefore, the optimal solution is to set each a_i to s_i. So, the maximum profit is the sum of s_i squared for all spots.\n\nWait, that's a huge simplification. So the problem reduces to computing s_i for each spot, then summing s_i squared.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- For each spot i, find all restrictions that include it (l_i <= i <= r_i).\n- For each such restriction, collect x_i.\n- Compute s_i as the minimum of h and the minimum x_i across all such restrictions.\n- Sum s_i squared.\n\nThat makes the problem straightforward.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n, h, m.\n2. Read each of the m restrictions, storing l_i, r_i, x_i.\n3. For each spot i from 1 to n:\n   a. Find all restrictions where l_i <= i <= r_i.\n   b. For those restrictions, collect x_i.\n   c. s_i is min(h, min of the collected x_i's). If no restrictions cover spot i, then s_i is h.\n4. Sum all s_i squared.\n\nWait, but wait. What if a spot is not covered by any restriction? Then, the only constraint is that its height cannot exceed h. So, s_i is h.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\n- Create a list of restrictions.\n- For each spot i in 1..n:\n   - min_x = infinity\n   - for each restriction in restrictions:\n       if l <= i <= r:\n           if x < min_x:\n               min_x = x\n   - s_i = min(h, min_x if min_x is not infinity else h)\n   - add s_i^2 to the total.\n\nWait, but for a spot not covered by any restriction, min_x remains infinity, so s_i is h.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code can be written in Python as follows.\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is n, h, m.\n\nThen, read m lines, each containing l, r, x. Store these as a list of tuples.\n\nThen, for each spot from 1 to n:\n\n   Initialize current_min_x to a very high value (like h+1 or something).\n\n   For each restriction in the list:\n\n       if l <= spot <= r:\n\n           if x < current_min_x:\n\n               current_min_x = x\n\n   if current_min_x is still high (i.e., no restrictions applied):\n\n       s_i = h\n\n   else:\n\n       s_i = min(h, current_min_x)\n\n   add s_i^2 to the total.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the current_min_x is initially set to a very high value (like h+1). For each restriction that includes the spot, we take the minimum x. So, if no restrictions include the spot, current_min_x remains h+1, which is higher than h. So, s_i = min(h, h+1) => h.\n\nYes.\n\nAlternatively, initialize current_min_x as None, and for each restriction that includes the spot, collect x_i, and then after processing all, if no x_i found, s_i is h; else, it's min(h, min_x).\n\nEither way, it's manageable.\n\nSo, now, let's test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nFor spot 1:\n\nCheck each restriction. Only the first one includes 1. x is 1. So current_min_x is 1. So s_i = min(3, 1) = 1. Contribute 1.\n\nSpot 2:\n\nCheck each restriction. Second restriction includes 2, x=3. Third includes 2? No, third is 3-3. So only x=3. So s_i = min(3, 3) =3. Contribute 9.\n\nSpot3:\n\nOnly the third restriction applies, x=2. So s_i = min(3,2)=2. Contribute 4.\n\nTotal 1+9+4=14. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nSo, for spot1:\n\nNo restrictions apply. So s_i =10. Contribute 100.\n\nSpot2:\n\nRestriction 2-3 with x=8. So s_i= min(10,8)=8. Contribute 64.\n\nSpot3:\n\nBoth restrictions apply. x=8 and x=7. Min is7. So s_i=7. 49.\n\nSpot4:\n\nOnly the second restriction applies, x=7. So s_i=7. 49.\n\nTotal: 100 +64 +49 +49=262. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, h=5, m=0. Then s_i=5, profit is 25.\n\nAnother case: n=2, h=5, m=1, l=1, r=2, x=3.\n\nSpot1: min(5,3)=3. Spot2: same. So sum is 9+9=18.\n\nWhat about overlapping restrictions that have different x's?\n\nLike, spot 2 is in two restrictions:\n\nRestriction1: l=1, r=2, x=5.\n\nRestriction2: l=2, r=2, x=4.\n\nSo for spot2: min(5,4) is4. So s_i=4.\n\nSo, for spot1: s_i=5 (only restriction1 applies). Spot2:4.\n\nSum is 25+16=41.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the logic seems solid.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python.\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nThen, read m lines, each as l, r, x. Note that l and r are integers, 1-based.\n\nWe can store the restrictions as a list of tuples.\n\nThen, for each spot from 1 to n:\n\ncurrent_min_x = None\n\nfor each (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n\n   if l <= spot <= r:\n\n       if current_min_x is None or x < current_min_x:\n\n           current_min_x = x\n\nif current_min_x is None:\n\n   s_i = h\n\nelse:\n\n   s_i = min(h, current_min_x)\n\nsum += s_i **2\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nrestrictions = []\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    restrictions.append( (l, r, x) )\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor spot in range(1, n+1):\n\n    min_x = None\n\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n\n        if l <= spot <= r:\n\n            if min_x is None or x < min_x:\n\n                min_x = x\n\n    if min_x is None:\n\n        s = h\n\n    else:\n\n        s = min(h, min_x)\n\n    total += s * s\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but in Python, the print function adds a newline, but the sample expects the output as a string without quotes. So, in the sample, the output is '14' and '262', which are the integers. So, the code can just print the total as an integer.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nProcessing:\n\nspot1: only first restriction. x=1. min_x=1. s=1.\n\nspot2: second restriction, x=3. s=3.\n\nspot3: third, x=2. s=2.\n\nSum is 1+9+4=14.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, h=5, m=1, l=1, r=1, x=3.\n\nspot1: min_x=3. s=3. sum 9.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: spot in multiple restrictions.\n\nspot is 3, with restrictions:\n\nl=1, r=4, x=5.\n\nl=2, r=3, x=4.\n\nSo, for spot3: min(5,4) =4. So s=4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nI think that's the correct approach.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street with certain height restrictions. Each spot on the street can have a house with a height that contributes to the total profit based on the square of its height. The challenge is to respect all given height restrictions while maximizing the profit.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Restrictions**: Each restriction specifies a range of spots and a maximum height allowed in that range. For each spot, the height must be less than or equal to the minimum height allowed by all applicable restrictions.\n2. **Compute Maximum Allowed Height for Each Spot**: For each spot, determine the minimum height allowed by any restriction that covers it. This value will be the effective maximum height for that spot, which cannot exceed the overall maximum height `h`.\n3. **Sum of Squares**: Once the maximum allowed height for each spot is determined, compute the total profit by summing the squares of these heights.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n\ntotal = 0\nfor spot in range(1, n + 1):\n    min_x = None\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        if l <= spot <= r:\n            if min_x is None or x < min_x:\n                min_x = x\n    if min_x is None:\n        s = h\n    else:\n        s = min(h, min_x)\n    total += s * s\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of spots, maximum height, and number of restrictions. Each subsequent line reads a restriction specifying a range and maximum height.\n2. **Determine Effective Heights**: For each spot, iterate through all restrictions to find the minimum height allowed by any restriction that includes the spot. If no restrictions apply, the maximum height is the overall limit `h`.\n3. **Calculate Profit**: Compute the sum of the squares of these effective heights to get the total profit.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are respected while maximizing the profit efficiently. The complexity is manageable given the problem constraints, making it suitable for the input size limits.",
