She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a girl named Luba who has multiple tabs open in her browser and needs to close some of them as quickly as possible. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds she needs to spend to leave only a specific segment of tabs open.\n\nHmm. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, initially, she has n tabs open, numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position pos. She wants to keep the tabs from l to r inclusive. So, any tabs outside this range must be closed. The operations she can perform are moving the cursor left or right (but not beyond the currently open tabs), or closing all tabs to the left or right of the current position.\n\nEach operation takes one second. We need to calculate the minimal time to achieve the desired state.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. The key here is to figure out the optimal order of moving and closing to minimize the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to determine which tabs need to be closed. These are the ones outside [l, r]. So, any tab less than l or greater than r needs to be closed.\n\nWait, but closing isn't just one action. Each close operation can close a lot of tabs at once. For example, if I'm at position i and I close all to the left, that would close all tabs from a to i-1, where a is the current leftmost open tab. Similarly for the right.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Identify the necessary close operations: left or right.\n2. Determine the order in which to perform these operations and the movements required to reach the positions where the closes are most efficient.\n\nLet me break down the problem into parts.\n\nFirst, figure out whether we need to close tabs on the left, the right, both, or neither.\n\nCase 1: l=1 and r=n. No need to close anything. So the answer is zero.\n\nOtherwise, we have to consider when there are tabs to close on either side.\n\nSo, first, check if l > 1. If yes, then we need to close all tabs to the left of l. Similarly, if r < n, then we need to close all tabs to the right of r.\n\nWait, but wait. Because after some tabs are closed, the available tabs change, so the 'left' and 'right' boundaries change. So, the initial a is 1, and b is n. But as tabs are closed, a and b change.\n\nBut for the initial calculation, perhaps we can model the necessary actions based on the initial positions.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nSuppose we need to close both left and right.\n\nWe have to decide the order: close left first, then right, or vice versa. Or maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to move to the optimal point to close left, then right, or right then left.\n\nWait, let's think about an example.\n\nTake the first sample input: 6 3 2 4.\n\nSo, initial tabs 1-6. Cursor is at 3. Need to close 1,5,6.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n- Move from 3 to 2 (cost 1).\n- Close left (closes 1). Now a becomes 2.\n- Then, move from 2 to 3 (cost 1).\n- Move to 4 (cost 1).\n- Close right (closes 5 and 6). Total steps: 1+1+1+1=4? Wait, the sample output is 5. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no. Let me recount the sample steps.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 3 2 4\n\nOutput: 5.\n\nThe note says:\n\nShift to 2 (step 1), close left (step 2). Then shift to 3 (step 3), shift to 4 (step4), close right (step5). So total 5 steps.\n\nAh, right. So, the movement from 2 to 3 is step 3, and then to 4 is step 4. So each movement is a step.\n\nSo, for the left closure, she moves to 2, which is one step. Then, the right closure requires moving to 4, which is two steps away (from 3 to 2 was one, then back to 3 and then to 4).\n\nWait, perhaps the initial position is 3. So, to close the left, she needs to be at position 2, which is one step. Then, she can close the left, which will remove all tabs before 2. Then, she needs to get to the right side (position 4) to close the right. From 2 to 4 is two steps (since",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves calculating the optimal sequence of movements and tab closures to achieve the desired state efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Necessary Closures**: Determine if tabs need to be closed on the left (if l > 1) or right (if r < n). If both are needed, both operations must be performed.\n2. **Calculate Movements**: For each required closure, compute the minimal steps needed to move the cursor to the optimal position for closing and then perform the closure.\n3. **Optimal Order**: Decide the order of closing left and right tabs to minimize the total steps. This can be either left first or right first, whichever is more efficient based on the initial cursor position and the target segment.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Check if no tabs need to be closed\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\n# Determine which sides need to be closed\nleft_close = l > 1\nright_close = r < n\n\n# Calculate the steps for left and right closes\ndef calculate_steps(initial_pos, target_pos):\n    # Steps to move from initial_pos to target_pos\n    steps_move = abs(initial_pos - target_pos)\n    return steps_move + 1  # +1 for the close action\n\nsteps = 0\n\nif left_close and right_close:\n    # Option 1: Close left first\n    steps_left = calculate_steps(pos, l)\n    steps_right = calculate_steps(l, r)\n    total_option1 = steps_left + steps_right\n    # Option 2: Close right first\n    steps_right_first = calculate_steps(pos, r)\n    steps_left_after = calculate_steps(r, l)\n    total_option2 = steps_right_first + steps_left_after\n    steps = min(total_option1, total_option2)\nelif left_close:\n    steps = calculate_steps(pos, l)\nelif right_close:\n    steps = calculate_steps(pos, r)\nelse:\n    # Both are already covered\n    steps = 0\n\nprint(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution starts by checking if the target segment [l, r] covers all tabs, in which case no actions are needed. If both left and right closures are required, it calculates the steps for both possible orders (left first or right first) and chooses the one with fewer steps. For each closure, the steps include moving the cursor to the optimal position and performing the closure. The minimal total steps are then computed and printed. This approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and optimal.",
