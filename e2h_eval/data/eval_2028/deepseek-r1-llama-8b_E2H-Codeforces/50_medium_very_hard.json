    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem is called \"Tree Sum\". Hmm. The task involves counting something over all possible edge-weighted trees that meet certain criteria and then summing a specific value for each of those trees.\n\nLet me try to parse the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem defines a 'good' tree. The tree has n vertices, each edge has a weight of either 1 or -1. For each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to i is -1. So, for every node, the product of its adjacent edges must be -1.\n\nWait, that's an interesting condition. So each node must have an odd number of edges with weight -1 because (-1) raised to an odd power is -1. Because when you multiply an even number of -1s, the product is 1, which doesn't satisfy the condition. So each node must have an odd number of edges with weight -1 connected to it.\n\nSo how can this happen in a tree? Well, in a tree, each node except the leaves has degree at least 2. But wait, considering the condition, each node's degree must be such that the number of -1 edges is odd.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a way to model this condition. Let's think about the parity of the number of -1 edges around each node.\n\nWait, but the product being -1 implies that the number of -1 edges is odd for each node. So each node must have an odd number of edges with weight -1.\n\nBut in a tree, the sum of degrees is 2(n-1). So the total number of edges is n-1. Each edge contributes to two nodes (its endpoints), so the sum of the parities of the number of -1 edges across all nodes must be even. Because each edge contributes to two nodes: if the edge has weight -1, it adds 1 to both nodes' counts; if it's 1, it adds 0 to both.\n\nSo let's compute the sum of the parities. Each node's count mod 2 is 1 (since the number is odd). There are n nodes, each contributing 1, so the total sum is n mod 2. But since each edge contributes 0 or 2 to the sum (because adding 1 to two nodes), the sum is always even. So n mod 2 must be 0. Therefore, n must be even.\n\nWait, that's a crucial observation. So for the tree to be good, n must be even. Otherwise, it's impossible. Because the sum of the parities (n) must be even for the condition to hold.\n\nSo when n is odd, the answer is zero. That makes sense because the sample input for n=2 is allowed, but for n=1, it's also allowed but trivial.\n\nWait, in the sample input, n=2 is handled. The output is -1, which modulo 998244353 is 998244352. So that's consistent.\n\nSo for n=1, the condition is trivially satisfied because there are no edges. The product is 1, but the problem says it should be -1. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the condition is that for each vertex i, the product of edges incident to i is -1. For n=1, there are no edges, so the product is 1. But the condition requires it to be -1. So for n=1, it's impossible. Hence, the answer is zero.\n\nWait, but the sample input includes n=1 as one of the test cases, and the output is zero. So that aligns with this reasoning.\n\nSo, first conclusion: if n is odd, the answer is zero.\n\nOtherwise, for even n, we proceed.\n\nNow, the main problem is to find the sum of d(1, n) over all good trees. d(1, n) is the sum of the weights along the unique path between vertices 1 and n.\n\nSo for each good tree, compute the path from 1 to n, sum the edge weights along that path, and add all these sums together.\n\nWe need to calculate this total sum, modulo 998244353.\n\nThe question is, how to model this efficiently, especially since n can be up to 5e5.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the structure of the good trees.\n\nEach good tree has edges with weights 1 or -1, and each node has an odd number of -1 edges.\n\nLet me consider the root as node 1. Then, the path from 1 to n is determined by the tree structure.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a graph where each node has a certain state based on the edges.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model each edge's contribution to the sum based on whether it's part of the path from 1 to n.\n\nBut wait, each edge is either 1 or -1. So each edge in the path contributes its value to the sum d(1,n). All other edges contribute nothing.\n\nSo the sum over all d(1,n) is equal to the sum over all good trees of the sum of the edge weights on the path from 1 to n.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as the sum of the expected value of each edge being on the path multiplied by the number of times it is included, summed over all edges.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, for each edge e, we can compute how many good trees have e on the path from 1 to n. Then, the total contribution of e to the sum is (count) * (weight of e) * (number of times e is on the path). But wait, each edge's weight is either 1 or -1. So for each edge e, letâ€™s denote its weight as w_e, which is either 1 or -1. Then, for each edge e, the contribution to the total sum is (number of good trees where e is on the path) * w_e.\n\nSo our task reduces to calculating for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by w_e, and then summing all these contributions.\n\nBut wait, the path from 1 to n depends on the tree structure. So for each edge e, how many good trees have e on the path between 1 and n.\n\nAlternatively, for each edge, we can compute the probability that it is on the path, multiplied by the total number of good trees, and multiply by w_e.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model this combinatorially.\n\nFirst, note that the tree is rooted at 1. So the path from 1 to n is the same as the unique simple path in the tree between them.\n\nIn a tree, any edge that lies on this path is called a bridge. But perhaps more importantly, in a tree, the path from u to v is unique, so each edge can be characterized as being on some paths and not others.\n\nBut perhaps for each edge e, we can determine the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n.\n\nHow?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tree. Since the tree is rooted at 1, each edge connects a node to its parent in the tree. So, the edges on the path from 1 to n are exactly those edges that lie on the path from the root to the node n.\n\nSo, for a given edge e between u and its parent p(u), e is on the path from 1 to n if and only if u is in the subtree of n when considering the tree after removing the edge e.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when you remove edge e, the tree splits into two components. One component contains 1, and the other contains the rest of the tree. So for e to be on the path from 1 to n, n must be in the component that is not separated when e is removed. Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, no. If you remove e, which is on the path from 1 to n, then 1 and n are in different components. So when e is on the path from 1 to n, then removing e separates 1 and n.\n\nSo, for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of good trees where, when e is removed, 1 and n are in different components.\n\nSo, for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to the number of good trees where 1 and n are disconnected when e is removed.\n\nThis is similar to the concept of edge separations in trees.\n\nSo, for edge e, let's say the tree is split into two subtrees when e is removed: one containing 1, the other containing n.\n\nThus, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to the number of ways to assign edge weights such that:\n\n1. The edge e has a certain weight (either 1 or -1).\n\n2. The resulting tree satisfies the condition for all nodes (each node has an odd number of -1 edges).\n\n3. The tree remains connected, and the removal of e disconnects 1 and n.\n\nHmm, but this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as follows:\n\nFor each edge e, the contribution to the sum is (number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n) * (w_e). So, for each edge, we can compute this separately.\n\nLet me focus on a single edge e. Let's assume that e is between u and v, and without loss of generality, let's suppose that u is closer to 1 than v.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to fix the edge e as part of the path. Then, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to the number of ways to build the tree such that:\n\n- The subtree under e (the part that would be disconnected if e is removed) contains n.\n\nBecause then, when e is removed, 1 is in one component, and n is in another.\n\nSo, for edge e, let's split the tree into two parts: the part containing 1 and the part containing n. To have e on the path, n must be in the part that is not connected to 1 when e is removed.\n\nSo, for edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of good trees where, when e is fixed, the subtree on the other side of e (i.e., the one containing n) is connected and satisfies the good tree conditions.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this as follows: for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to the number of ways to choose the weights of the edges in the subtree of n (when considering e as part of the path) such that all conditions are met.\n\nWait, perhaps it's helpful to consider the entire tree as a structure where e is part of the path from 1 to n. Then, the subtree of n in the direction away from 1 must form a connected tree, and all the conditions on the product of edges around each node must be satisfied.\n\nBut this feels a bit vague. Maybe I should think in terms of dynamic programming or combinatorics.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the number of good trees and the expected value of d(1,n) in those trees, then multiplying by the number of good trees.\n\nWait, but that might not directly help because d(1,n) is a sum over edges on the path. Each edge's contribution is independent, but they're dependent on the structure of the tree.\n\nWait, but perhaps each edge's inclusion in the path is independent of the others? No, that's not true because including one edge affects the structure of the tree, which in turn affects whether other edges are on the path.\n\nHmm. Another approach: for each edge e, compute the probability that it is on the path from 1 to n in a good tree, and then multiply that by the weight of e and the total number of good trees.\n\nBut how to compute that probability.\n\nLet me think about the structure of a good tree.\n\nEach node must have an odd number of -1 edges.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the assignment of edge weights is constrained in a certain way.\n\nWait, perhaps each node's parity of -1 edges is determined by the number of children it has, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tree forms a certain kind of structure, like a chain, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: the condition that each node has an odd number of -1 edges implies that the tree is bipartitioned into two sets, say A and B, such that every edge connects a node in A to a node in B. This is similar to a bipartition in a graph, but perhaps it's a necessary condition here.\n\nWait, because if each node has an odd number of -1 edges, then the product around each node is -1. Suppose we have a bipartition where all nodes in A have even number of -1 edges and nodes in B have odd. But that may not fit the condition.\n\nWait, maybe the tree is a bipartitioned into two sets where one set has all even degrees and the other has all odd. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tree is a chain, where each internal node has exactly one child, but I don't think that's necessarily the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the tree is a star, but again, the condition may not hold unless the number of edges meets certain criteria.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to realize that the condition on the product being -1 for each node implies that the tree is a chain. Because in a chain, each node (except the ends) has two edges, but that would require the product to be 1 if both edges are -1, which is not allowed. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the tree is a straight line, like a path from 1 to n. So each internal node has two edges. But then, for each internal node, the product would be 1 if both edges are -1. Which is invalid. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, maybe this line of thinking isn't getting me anywhere. Let's try a different approach.\n\nSince each node has an odd number of -1 edges, perhaps the number of -1 edges in the entire tree is odd * n / 2. But the total number of edges is n-1, so the sum of all the parities (each node's count) is n, which must be even because each edge contributes 2 to the sum (if it's -1, adds 1 to two nodes). So n must be even, as we established earlier.\n\nSo, for each good tree, the number of -1 edges is such that each node has an odd count, and the total is even.\n\nBut how does this affect the structure of the tree?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tree can be viewed as a collection of edges where each node's edges alternate between -1 and 1. But that's just a guess.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be simplified by noting that the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees is zero. But that's not the case, as the sample input shows.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be derived based on the properties of the good trees.\n\nAnother idea: since the problem is linear in nature (sum over all edges on the path), perhaps the expectation of each edge being on the path can be computed, and then multiplied by the total number of good trees and the edge's weight.\n\nBut to compute the expectation, we'd need to find the probability that an edge is on the path from 1 to n in a good tree.\n\nSo, for each edge e, let's compute the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n. Then, the contribution of e is (count) * w_e.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to computing for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by w_e, and summing over all edges.\n\nBut how to compute this count.\n\nLet me think about the edge e. Let's fix it as part of the path from 1 to n. Then, the rest of the tree must be constructed in a way that satisfies the good tree conditions.\n\nWhen e is on the path, the subtree below e (the part containing n) must form a connected tree. So, the structure is as follows: the edge e is on the path from 1 to n, and the subtree under e must form a connected tree, with all nodes satisfying the product condition.\n\nSo, for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to the number of ways to assign weights to the edges in the subtree under e, such that:\n\n1. The subtree is connected and forms a good tree.\n\n2. The rest of the tree (above e) is also a good tree.\n\nBut this seems a bit abstract. Perhaps there's a way to model this recursively.\n\nSuppose that the tree is built by choosing an edge e on the path. Then, the subtree under e must be a good tree, and the rest of the tree (from 1 to the parent of e) must also be a good tree.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to the product of the number of good trees in the subtree under e and the number of good trees above e.\n\nBut then, the subtree under e must form a tree that is connected and satisfies the good conditions, and similarly for the rest.\n\nBut perhaps the structure is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to (number of good trees in the subtree under e) * (number of good trees in the remaining tree).\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nLet me denote T(k) as the number of good trees on a subtree of size k. Wait, but the structure depends on how the subtree is connected.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me try to look for patterns in small cases.\n\nSample Input 1: n=2.\n\nOnly one possible tree (it's a single edge between 1 and 2). The edge weight must be -1, because for each node, the product is -1. So, the sum d(1,2) is -1, and there's only one such tree. So the answer is -1 mod 998244353.\n\nSample Input 3: n=4.\n\nThe output is -10, which mod 998244353 is 998244343.\n\nWait, according to the note, there are 16 good trees, and the sum of d(1,4) is -10.\n\nEach good tree has certain properties.\n\nPerhaps the sum can be expressed as a function of n, such as (-1)^{something} multiplied by a combinatorial term.\n\nWait, let's think about the path from 1 to n. The sum is the sum over all edges on the path of their weights. So for each edge, the number of times it's on the path is the number of good trees where it is on the path.\n\nIf we can find for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path, then multiply by w_e, and sum over all edges, that's the answer.\n\nSo, the problem now becomes: for each edge e, compute the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, and multiply by w_e, summing all these.\n\nSo, for each edge, how many good trees have e on the path.\n\nLet me think of the tree as a collection of edges, and for each edge e, the number of trees where e is on the path is equal to the number of trees where:\n\n- The subtree of e (the part that would be disconnected if e is removed) contains n.\n\nBecause when e is on the path from 1 to n, removing e would separate 1 and n.\n\nSo, for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to the number of good trees where:\n\n- The edge e is assigned a certain weight.\n\n- The subtree of e (the part that would be disconnected if e is removed) contains n.\n\n- The rest of the tree (the part connected to 1) forms a good tree.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nLet me model this as follows: for edge e, which is part of the path from 1 to n, the subtree under e must be a good tree, and the rest of the tree (the part above e) must also be a good tree.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to the product of the number of good trees in the subtree under e and the number of good trees in the subtree above e.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to f(k) * f(n - k - 1), where k is the size of the subtree under e.\n\nWait, but I'm not making progress here.\n\nPerhaps it's better to consider that each edge e splits the tree into two parts: the part containing 1 and the part containing n.\n\nFor e to be on the path, n must be in the part that is not connected to 1 when e is removed.\n\nSo, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to the number of good trees where:\n\n- The subtree under e (the one containing n) is connected and satisfies the good conditions.\n\n- The rest of the tree (the one containing 1) is also connected and satisfies the good conditions.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to the product of the number of good trees in the subtree under e and the number of good trees in the rest of the tree.\n\nBut the subtree under e is a tree of size (n - 1), and the rest is a tree of size (k), where k is the size of the subtree.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to the number of ways to assign the weights in the subtree under e as a good tree, multiplied by the number of ways to assign the weights in the rest of the tree as a good tree.\n\nBut this seems plausible.\n\nSo, for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to the product of the number of good trees in the subtree under e and the number of good trees in the rest of the tree (which is a tree of size (n-1) minus the subtree size).\n\nWait, but the rest of the tree is connected and includes node 1.\n\nSo, for edge e, which connects u and v, suppose that when e is considered, the subtree under e is of size s = n - 1. Because when e is on the path, the subtree under e must include n. So, the size of the subtree under e is s = (n-1), because the total number of nodes is n, and the edge e connects 1 to the root of the subtree.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try to model this with a specific example. Suppose n=4, and edge e connects 1 to 2. Then, the subtree under e would include 2,3,4. The rest of the tree is just 1.\n\nWait, no. Because if e is on the path, then the subtree under e (after removing e) is a connected component containing n=4. So, the subtree under e has size 3 (nodes 2,3,4). The rest of the tree is just node 1.\n\nSo, for edge e between 1 and 2, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to the number of good trees on the subtree of 2 (size 3) multiplied by the number of good trees on the subtree of 1 (size 1).\n\nBut the subtree of 1 is trivial, as it's just node 1 with no edges. But wait, for n=4, the edge e is on the path, so the subtree under e must be a good tree, and the rest (just node 1) must also be a good tree.\n\nBut the subtree under e (size 3) must form a good tree, and the rest (node 1) is trivially a good tree.\n\nBut wait, the rest is just node 1, which has no edges, so the product is 1, which doesn't satisfy the condition. So, the subtree under e must be a good tree, and the rest must also be a good tree.\n\nBut for the rest (node 1), the product is 1, which violates the condition. So, perhaps this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rest (node 1) doesn't need to be a good tree because it's just a single node. Wait, for a single node, the product of edges is 1, but the condition requires it to be -1. So, that's a problem.\n\nThis suggests that my previous approach is flawed.\n\nHmm. So perhaps I need to re-examine the conditions.\n\nWait, for each node, including node 1, the product of edges incident to it must be -1. So, node 1 cannot be isolated. It must have at least one edge, and the product of that edge's weight must be -1. So, node 1 must have exactly one edge with weight -1, or three edges with -1, etc., but in a tree, node 1 can have any number of edges, but in a tree, it's connected, so node 1 must have at least one edge.\n\nWait, but for a tree with n=4, node 1 can have multiple edges, but the product of all those edges must be -1.\n\nWait, for node 1, the product of all edges connected to it must be -1. So, if node 1 has k edges, then the number of -1 edges among them must be odd.\n\nSo, for example, if node 1 has one edge, that edge must be -1. If it has two edges, one is -1 and the other is 1, giving a product of -1. Etc.\n\nSo, the condition applies to all nodes, including the root.\n\nThis complicates things because the root can't be isolated.\n\nSo, going back to the original problem.\n\nEach edge e splits the tree into two parts: the part containing 1 and the part containing n.\n\nFor e to be on the path from 1 to n, n must be in the part that is separated when e is removed.\n\nSo, for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to the number of ways to construct the tree such that:\n\n- The subtree containing n is connected and forms a good tree.\n\n- The subtree containing 1 is connected and forms a good tree.\n\nBut the subtree containing 1 must include all the other nodes except those in the n's subtree.\n\nWait, but how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to the product of the number of good trees in the n's subtree and the number of good trees in the 1's subtree.\n\nBut the 1's subtree must form a connected tree, and the n's subtree must also form a connected tree.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to the number of good trees in the n's subtree (which is a tree of size (n - 1)) multiplied by the number of good trees in the 1's subtree (which is a tree of size (k), where k is the number of nodes not in the n's subtree, including 1).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to f(s) * f(t), where s is the size of the subtree under e (the part containing n), and t is the size of the part containing 1 (t = n - s).\n\nBut what is f(s)?\n\nf(s) is the number of good trees of size s, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps f(s) is the number of good trees on a subtree of size s, given that the root of the subtree (say, u) is connected via edge e to the parent in the overall tree.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem using generating functions or combinatorial identities.\n\nWait, considering that the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees is required, perhaps we can find a way to express this sum in terms of the number of good trees and some combinatorial factors.\n\nBut without knowing the exact structure of the good trees, it's difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of good trees in the entire tree multiplied by the probability that e is on the path in a randomly chosen good tree.\n\nSo, if we can compute the probability that e is on the path in a good tree, then the contribution of e is (probability) * (total number of good trees) * w_e.\n\nBut how to compute this probability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability that e is on the path is 1/2, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, in a normal tree, the probability that an edge is on the path from root to a leaf is related to the sizes of the subtrees. For a random tree, each edge is on the path with probability proportional to the size of the subtree.\n\nBut in our case, the trees are not random; they are constrained to be good trees.\n\nSo, perhaps the probability that e is on the path is determined by the constraints imposed by the good tree conditions.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to the number of good trees multiplied by the probability that e is on the path, which depends on the structure.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAnother angle: since each node must have an odd number of -1 edges, perhaps the tree is a collection of edges arranged in a way that forms a bipartition with specific properties.\n\nWait, perhaps the tree must be a straight line, but earlier thoughts suggest that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tree must be a star, with all edges emanating from node 1. Let's see.\n\nIn a star-shaped tree, node 1 is connected to all other nodes. So, for n=4, the edges are 1-2, 1-3, 1-4.\n\nEach of these edges is part of the path from 1 to any other node. So, for each edge, e.g., 1-2, the path from 1 to 4 goes through 1-2-1-3-1-4? No, that's not a tree. Wait, no. In a star, the tree is 1 connected to 2, 3, 4. So the path from 1 to 4 is direct, edge 1-4.\n\nWait, that's right. So in a star-shaped tree, the path from 1 to any other node is the direct edge. So for n=4, all edges except the ones connecting to 1 are not on the path from 1 to 4.\n\nWait, no. Only the edge 1-4 is on the path. The other edges (1-2, 1-3) are not on the path from 1 to 4.\n\nSo, in a star-shaped tree, only the edges directly connecting 1 to other nodes can be on the path. Others are not.\n\nBut in this case, for n=4, the path from 1 to 4 is the edge 1-4. So for each edge, we can compute whether it's on the path.\n\nBut this is getting too specific.\n\nPerhaps the key insight is that for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to the number of good trees where the subtree under e (containing n) forms a good tree, and the rest of the tree (containing 1) also forms a good tree.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nAnother idea: since each node must have an odd number of -1 edges, perhaps the entire tree can be seen as a collection of edges that form a certain structure, like a perfect matching. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of good trees is equal to 2^{(n-1)/2} * something, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for n=2, the number of good trees is 1. For n=4, the sample says 16.\n\nWait, 2^{4-1} is 8, but 16 is 2^4. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of good trees is 2^{(n/2 -1)}, but for n=2, 2^{0}=1, which fits. For n=4, 2^{1}=2, but the sample says 16, which is 2^4. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but the sample for n=4 says 16 good trees. 16 is 2^4. So perhaps for even n, the number of good trees is 2^{(n-1)}.\n\nWait, but for n=2, it's 1=2^0. So yes, 2^{n-1} for n even.\n\nWait, no, n=2: 2^{2-1}=2, but the sample shows 1. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of good trees is 2^{(n/2)-1} * something.\n\nNot sure.\n\nBut perhaps for even n, the number of good trees is equal to 2^{(n/2)-1} * (n/2)! ?\n\nNo, for n=2, that would be 2^{0} *1=1, which matches. For n=4, 2^{1}*2=4, but the sample says 16.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of good trees is equal to 2^{(n-1)} / 2, but for n=2, that's 1, which matches. For n=4, 8, but sample says 16.\n\nNo, that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother approach: for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to f(s) * f(t), where s is the size of the subtree under e, and t is the size of the rest.\n\nBut I'm stuck on finding f(s).\n\nWait, perhaps for the subtree under e, which is of size s, the number of good trees is equal to 2^{s-1}, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for a subtree of size 1, it's 1 (no edges, but the product is 1, which is invalid). So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a subtree of size s, the number of good trees is 2^{s-2}.\n\nWait, for s=2, the number of good trees is 1 (only edge between the two nodes, which must be -1, so 1 possibility). 2^{2-2}=1, which matches.\n\nFor s=3: each node must have an odd number of -1 edges. So, the root has two edges (to two children). The product for the root is (-1) * (-1) = 1, which is invalid. So, that's not allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps for s=3, the number of good trees is zero, but that's not the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering that the product around each node is -1. So, for each node, the number of -1 edges is odd.\n\nBut this is a global condition on the tree. So, perhaps the entire tree must have an even number of -1 edges, as each edge contributes to two nodes.\n\nWait, yes, because each -1 edge contributes +1 to the count of two nodes. So, the total number of -1 edges is even.\n\nBut for each node, the count is odd. So, n must be even, as we saw earlier.\n\nBut how to model this for the sum.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees is equal to the product of the contributions of each edge.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge e, the number of times it's included in the path is equal to the number of good trees where e is on the path. So, the sum is the sum over all edges of (count_e) * w_e.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to computing count_e for each edge.\n\nNow, for each edge e, how to compute count_e.\n\nLet me think about the edge e between u and v, where u is on the path from 1 to n.\n\nWhen e is on the path, the subtree under e (the part containing n) must form a connected good tree, and the rest of the tree (including 1) must also form a connected good tree.\n\nSo, the count_e is equal to the number of ways to assign weights to the edges in the subtree under e such that it's a good tree, multiplied by the number of ways to assign weights to the edges in the rest of the tree (excluding e) such that it's a good tree.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nWait, perhaps for the subtree under e, which has size s, the number of good trees is g(s). And for the rest, which has size (n - s), the number is g(n - s). Then, count_e = g(s) * g(n - s).\n\nBut then, for each edge e, we have to compute g(s) and g(n-s), multiply them, and multiply by w_e.\n\nSo, the problem now is to find g(k), the number of good trees on k nodes.\n\nBut how to compute g(k).\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me try to find a recurrence relation for g(k).\n\nConsider building a tree of size k. The root is connected to some number of children. For each child, the subtree under it must also be a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the path sums between vertices 1 and n for all good edge-weighted trees with n vertices. A tree is considered good if each vertex has an odd number of edges with weight -1. The result should be computed modulo 998244353.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Good Trees**: A good tree requires each vertex to have an odd number of edges with weight -1. This implies that the product of the weights of edges incident to any vertex must be -1. For a tree to satisfy this condition, it must have an even number of vertices (n must be even).\n\n2. **Path Sum Calculation**: For each edge, determine how many good trees include this edge on the path from vertex 1 to vertex n. The contribution of each edge to the total sum is then calculated based on its weight (-1 or 1) and the number of times it appears on this path.\n\n3. **Combinatorial Insight**: For each edge, the number of good trees where the edge is on the path can be derived using combinatorial properties. Specifically, the number of such trees is determined by the product of the number of ways to form valid subtrees on either side of the edge.\n\n4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, all calculations are performed modulo 998244353.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    \n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Calculate the number of good trees and their contributions\n    power = pow(2, n-1, MOD)\n    inv_2 = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD)\n    ans = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        # Each edge contributes to the sum based on being on the path\n        # For each edge, the count is (good_trees_subtree * good_trees_other) * w_e\n        # Here, each edge has a weight of 1 or -1, but since we're considering all possibilities,\n        # the average contribution can be calculated.\n        # Since each edge is equally likely to be on the path, the number of good trees where it is on the path is:\n        # (number of good trees) * probability that the edge is on the path.\n        # From combinatorial analysis, for each edge, the number of good trees where it is on the path is equal to:\n        # (number of good trees) * (1/2)\n        # So, the contribution is (good_trees / 2) * (-1) because each edge's weight is -1.\n        # However, for a tree with n nodes, there are n-1 edges, each contributing similarly.\n        # The total number of good trees is 2^(n-2) * something, but we can simplify.\n        # The final formula for the sum is (-1)^(k) * (n-1 choose k) * ... but for our case, each edge contributes:\n        # (number of good trees) * (1/2) * (-1)\n        # So, the total sum is (number of good trees) * (-1) * (n-1) / 2\n        # But the number of good trees is 2^{n-2} when n is even.\n        # Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to note that for each edge, the number of good trees where it is on the path is equal to 2^{n-3}.\n        # Then, each edge contributes (-1) * 2^{n-3}.\n        # With n-1 edges, the total sum is -(n-1) * 2^{n-3}.\n        # But let's test this for small n:\n        # n=2: sum is -1.
