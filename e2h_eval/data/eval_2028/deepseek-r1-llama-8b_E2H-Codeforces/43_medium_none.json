He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Check the string,\" and from the description, it seems like we have to verify if a given string meets certain conditions based on how it was built by three friends—A, B, and C.\n\nHmm. Let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, the process is: A creates a string with some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's to the end. Then C appends some 'c's. But here's the catch: C must append a number of 'c's equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before he adds his part. Also, the order of the letters must be strictly a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, any other order isn't allowed.\n\nOur task is to check if a given string could have been formed this way. If yes, output \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\nSo, the steps for the solution are:\n\n1. Check the structure of the string. It should consist of a sequence of 'a's, followed by a sequence of 'b's, followed by a sequence of 'c's. Any interleaving or other characters would make it invalid.\n\n2. Once we confirm that the string is in the correct order, we need to count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n\n3. The number of 'c's added by C must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. Also, since C appends after B, the total 'c's must be exactly equal to one of these two counts.\n\nWait, but wait. The initial string after B has both 'a's and 'b's. So when C appends, the count of 'a' is fixed, as well as the count of 'b's. So the number of 'c's added by C must equal the count of 'a's (before C's addition) or the count of 'b's (before C's addition). But wait, the problem says that the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's OR the number of 'b's in the string. So, after B's step, the string is a's followed by b's. So when C appends, the number of 'c's is equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's.\n\nBut also, the entire string must follow the order a's -> b's -> c's.\n\nSo first, the string must be in the form a^m b^n c^k, where m, n, k are at least 1 because the problem says that after each step, at least one of each character exists.\n\nSo first, the string should not have any 'a's after a 'b' or 'c', nor any 'b's after a 'c'. So the string must be a sequence of a's, then b's, then c's without any breaks.\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is check the structure of the string. How can I do that?\n\nLet me think: iterate through the string and ensure that once a character changes, it doesn't go back. For example, the string can have a's, then switch to b's, then to c's. Any other pattern is invalid.\n\nOnce the structure is confirmed, we can proceed to count the a's, b's, and c's.\n\nThen, we need to check whether the count of c's is equal to the count of a's or to the count of b's.\n\nWait, but wait. The count of c's is exactly what C appended. So before C appends, the string is a's followed by b's. Then C appends k 'c's. So the total c's in the string is k.\n\nBut according to the problem, k must equal the number of a's (m) or the number of b's (n).\n\nSo, for the string to be valid, it must satisfy:\n\n- The string is a^m b^n c^k.\n\n- k equals m or k equals n.\n\nAdditionally, m and n must be at least 1, since after A and B's steps, there's at least one a and one b.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Check that the string is in the form a^m b^n c^k, with m >=1, n >=1, k >=1.\n\n   To do this, iterate through the string and ensure that all a's come first, then all b's, then all c's.\n\n   For example, if the string is 'aabbc', that's fine. If it's 'ababc', no, because after the first a comes a b, then another a which is invalid.\n\n2. Once the structure is validated, count the number of a's (m), b's (n), and c's (k).\n\n3. Check if k equals m or k equals n.\n\nIf both conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where m equals n? Then k can be equal to either, so it's acceptable.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement step 1.\n\nI can loop through the string and track the current allowed characters. Initially, the allowed characters are only 'a's. Once a 'b' is encountered, the allowed characters become 'a's and 'b's. Once a 'c' is encountered, the allowed characters are only 'c's. Any character that comes after that point which is not allowed (like an 'a' after a 'c') makes the string invalid.\n\nAlternatively, the string can be divided into three parts: a's, b's, and c's. So, the string should start with a's, transition to b's, and then to c's. There shouldn't be any transitions beyond that.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nInitialize state as 'a'. Then, for each character in the string:\n\n- If current state is 'a':\n   - if char is 'a': continue\n   - elif char is 'b': state becomes 'ab' (meaning we're now in the b phase)\n   - elif char is 'c': invalid, because it's not allowed before the b's are done.\n- Else if current state is 'ab' (after seeing a 'b'):\n   - if char is 'a': invalid (can't have a after b)\n   - if char is 'b': continue\n   - if char is 'c': state becomes 'abc' (now in c phase)\n- Else if current state is 'abc' (in c phase):\n   - char must be 'c', else invalid.\n\nAdditionally, during this process, if any character violates the allowed set, the string is invalid.\n\nSo, the code can have variables tracking the allowed states. Let's see:\n\nWe can represent the state as a variable that starts at 'a' and can transition to 'ab' upon encountering 'b', and then to 'abc' upon encountering 'c'.\n\nAt any point, if a character is not allowed in the current state, the string is invalid.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\nInitialize state as 'a'.\n\nFor each char in S:\n   if state == 'a':\n      if char == 'a': continue\n      elif char == 'b': state = 'ab'\n      else: # char is 'c' which is invalid before 'b's are added.\n          return False\n   elif state == 'ab':\n      if char == 'a': return False\n      elif char == 'b': continue\n      elif char == 'c': state = 'abc'\n      else: return False\n   elif state == 'abc':\n      if char != 'c': return False\n   else:\n      return False\n\nAfter processing all chars, the state must be 'abc' (all three phases have been passed). Otherwise, invalid.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, after each step, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b' (after B's step). So, after B's step, the string is a^m b^n. Then C appends k c's, making the total string a^m b^n c^k.\n\nSo, the initial state is 'a', then 'ab', and finally 'abc'.\n\nSo, the code must ensure that the entire string is processed, ending in state 'abc'. Otherwise, the string is invalid.\n\nSo, the code needs to process the entire string, checking the transitions.\n\nOnce the structure is valid, we can count the a's, b's, and c's.\n\nCount the number of a's before the first 'b' (m), the number of b's before the first 'c' (n), and the number of c's (k).\n\nWait, but in the string, the 'c's are all at the end. So, the count of a's is the number of a's up to the first 'b' (if any). Similarly, the count of b's is the number of b's between the last a and the first c. And the count of c's is the number after the last b.\n\nBut to compute m, n, k correctly, perhaps we can split the string into a's, then b's, then c's.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nIn 'aaabccc', the a's are 3, b's are 1, c's are 3.\n\nIn 'aabc', it's a's=2, b's=1, c's=1.\n\nWait, but wait: in the third example, the input is 'aabc'—wait, no, the sample input given is ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'], and the outputs are ['YES', 'NO', 'YES'].\n\nWait, for the third example, 'aabc'—the structure is a's, then a, then b, then c. That would be invalid because after a 'a', you can't have a 'b' after another 'a' in the same group. Because the a's must come first, then b's, then c's.\n\nWait, no, wait. Oh, wait, the third example's input is 'aabc'? Or maybe I'm misreading. Wait, the sample input shows the third string as 'aabc'?\n\nWait, no, looking back: the sample input is a list of strings: ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'], and the outputs are YES, NO, YES.\n\nWait, 'aabc'—does this string pass the structure check?\n\nLet me think: the string is 'a a a b c'—no, wait, no, 'a a b c'—so the structure is a's, then b's, then c's. Wait, no, 'a a b c' is a's (two), then b (one), then c (one). So the structure is correct.\n\nWait, but the sample says the third example is 'aabc'—is that a typo or did I get the sample wrong? Because 'aabc' is a string where the first three are a's, then a 'b', then 'c'—but wait, the string is 'aabc'—which is 'a a b c'? No, 'a a b c' would be 'aabc', but the third example is 'aabc'—wait, no, the third example in the input is 'aabc'? Or maybe the sample is presented as a list, and the third string is 'aabc'?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sample. Let me recheck.\n\nIn the note, the third example is considered correct because the number of c's equals the number of b's. The string is 'aabc', which is a, a, b, c.\n\nWait, but wait: 'aabc' is four characters. So the a's are two, then a 'b', then a 'c'. So the structure is a's, then b's, then c's. Because after the first 'a's, the 'b' comes, then 'c's.\n\nSo yes, the structure is correct.\n\nSo, in code, the way to process the string is to:\n\n- Split it into runs of a, b, c in order.\n\nSo, for example, the string 'aaabccc' is split into ['a', 'a', 'a'], ['b'], ['c', 'c', 'c'].\n\nSimilarly, 'aabc' is ['a', 'a'], ['b'], ['c'].\n\nIf any run is not in the order a → b → c, it's invalid.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nLoop through the string, tracking the current run type. It can be 'a', 'b', or 'c', or 'none' initially.\n\nWhen the first character is 'a', the run is 'a'; when a 'b' is found after 'a', the next run is 'b'; when a 'c' is found after 'b', the next run is 'c'; any other transition is invalid.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\ncurrent_run = None\nfor char in s:\n    if current_run is None:\n        if char == 'a':\n            current_run = 'a'\n        else:\n            # string starts with non-a, which is invalid since A created the string with a's.\n            return False\n    elif current_run == 'a':\n        if char == 'b':\n            current_run = 'ab'  # meaning now we're in a+b phase\n        elif char == 'c':\n            # can't have c before b\n            return False\n        else:  # same run\n            continue\n    elif current_run == 'ab':\n        if char == 'c':\n            current_run = 'abc'\n        elif char == 'a':\n            # a after b is invalid\n            return False\n        else: # same run\n            continue\n    elif current_run == 'abc':\n        if char != 'c':\n            return False\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# After the loop, check if all runs are complete\nif current_run != 'abc':\n    return False\n\nWait, but in the 'ab' phase, the run is 'ab', which means that the next allowed characters are 'b's or 'c's. So, after 'ab', if another 'a' is found, it's invalid.\n\nBut in code, the current_run transitions from 'a' to 'ab' when 'b' is encountered. Then, any 'a' in 'ab' phase will cause a failure.\n\nSo, the code above would handle that.\n\nOnce the string passes the structure check, we can count the a's, b's, and c's.\n\nWait, but the counts must be for the entire a run, the entire b run, and the entire c run.\n\nSo, for example, the a run is all the a's at the beginning, the b run is all the b's following the a's but before the c's, and the c run is all the c's at the end.\n\nSo, the code can collect the runs.\n\nAn alternative approach is to find the indices where the runs change.\n\nSo, for the string s:\n\nFind the index where the run changes from a to b, say pos_a. All a's are before pos_a.\n\nThen, find the index where the run changes from b to c, say pos_b. All b's are between pos_a and pos_b.\n\nThe c's are from pos_b onwards.\n\nIf pos_a is 0, then the a run is from 0 to pos_a-1. Wait, no: for the first run being 'a's, pos_a is the first index where a 'b' is found. So the a run is from 0 to pos_a-1.\n\nSimilarly, the b run is from pos_a to pos_b-1, assuming that the next run is 'c's.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can find the positions where the runs end.\n\nAnother approach is to split the string into runs and check their types.\n\nFor example, create a list of runs, each run being a tuple of (type, start, end).\n\nSo, for 'aaabccc', the runs are [('a', 0, 2), ('b', 3, 3), ('c',4,6)].\n\nFor 'aabc', the runs are [('a',0,1), ('b',2,2), ('c',3,3)].\n\nIf the runs are not in the order a → b → c, then the string is invalid.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\n- Iterate through the string, grouping consecutive same characters, noting their type and start and end indices.\n\n- Check that the first run is 'a's, the second is 'b's, the third is 'c's.\n\n- Also, if there are more than three runs, it's invalid.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nruns = []\nprev_char = None\nstart = 0\n\nfor i, c in enumerate(s):\n    if c != prev_char:\n        if prev_char is not None:\n            runs.append( (prev_char, start, i-1) )\n        prev_char = c\n        start = i\n# add the last run\nruns.append( (prev_char, start, len(s)-1) )\n\nThen, check if the runs are in the order a, b, c, and that each subsequent run is a new type, and that all are present.\n\nSo, expected_runs = [('a', 0, m-1), ('b', m, n-1), ('c', n, len(s)-1)] for some m and n.\n\nWait, but the runs list must be exactly three elements, and each must be a, then b, then c.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif len(runs) != 3:\n    return False\n\nrun_types = [run[0] for run in runs]\n\nif run_types != ['a', 'b', 'c']:\n    return False\n\nSo, this would handle the structure.\n\nOnce the structure is confirmed, we can compute the counts.\n\nFor the a's, it's the length of the first run.\n\nFor the b's, it's the length of the second run.\n\nFor the c's, it's the length of the third run.\n\nSo, m = runs[0][2] - runs[0][1] + 1\n\nWait, no: runs[0][1] is the start index, runs[0][2] is the end index. So, the count is runs[0][2] - runs[0][1] + 1.\n\nBut wait, in Python, indexes are zero-based. So, for a run from start to end (inclusive), the count is end - start + 1.\n\nSo, for the first run, a's count is runs[0][2] - runs[0][1] + 1.\n\nSame for the others.\n\nOnce we have m, n, k, we need to check if k == m or k == n.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nGenerate the runs.\n\nCheck if runs are exactly three, and their types are a, b, c in order.\n\nIf not, output NO.\n\nElse, compute m, n, k.\n\nIf k equals m or k equals n, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but what about cases where the string is just 'abc'?\n\nThat would be a's:1, b's:1, c's:1.\n\nSo k equals both m and n, so condition is satisfied.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbbbbc'—a's:2, b's:5, c's:1. Here, k is 1. So, is 1 equal to m (2) or n (5)? No. So condition fails, output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbcc' → a:2, b:2, c:2. So k=2, which equals m and n. So condition is satisfied.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the sample input 'bbacc' is output 'NO'. Let's see why.\n\nIn 'bbacc', the runs are:\n\nFirst run is 'b's, which is invalid because the first run must be 'a's. So the structure is incorrect, hence output is NO.\n\nAnother sample: 'aaabccc' → runs are a:3, b:1, c:3. So k=3 equals m=3 → condition holds.\n\nThird sample: 'aabc' → a:2, b:1, c:1. So k=1, which equals n=1 → condition holds.\n\nSo, all samples are covered.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: minimal string.\n\ns = 'abc' → a:1, b:1, c:1 → k=1 equals both m and n → YES.\n\nCase 2: s = 'acb' → invalid structure → NO.\n\nCase 3: s = 'abba' → invalid, since after 'ab', a 'b' is allowed, but then an 'a' comes, which is invalid.\n\nCase 4: s = 'abcab' → after c, a comes again → invalid.\n\nCase 5: s = 'aabbc' → a:2, b:2, c:1. So k=1. Does it equal m or n? m is 2, n is 2. 1 is neither, so condition fails → NO.\n\nCase 6: s = 'aabbbc' → a:2, b:3, c:1. Again, k=1 does not equal m or n → NO.\n\nCase 7: s = 'aaabbbccc' → a:3, b:3, c:3 → k=3 equals both → YES.\n\nAnother edge case: s = 'a' → invalid because it's only a's, but the problem says that after B's step, the string has at least one b. So the string must have at least a's, then b's, then c's. So the minimal string is 'abc' (length 3).\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that the initial string from A has some a's, B appends some b's, so the combined string has at least one a and one b. Then C appends c's, which must be equal to either a or b count. So the final string must have at least three characters: a's, then b's, then c's.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose A gives 'a', B appends 'b' → string is 'ab'. Then C appends 1 'c' (since 1 is the count of a's or b's). So the final string is 'abc', which is length 3.\n\nBut what if C appends 0 'c's? No, because the problem says that C appends \"some number\" of c's, which implies at least one.\n\nWait, the problem says \"appends some number of letters 'c'\". The term \"some number\" could mean zero or more, but in context, the note says that the string after B's step has at least one a and one b. So, C appends some number (could be zero?), but in the problem statement, it's unclear.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" So, the word \"some\" can imply zero or more, but the note says that the string after B's step has at least one a and one b.\n\nWait, but in the note, it says that after B's step, the string has at least one a and one b.\n\nBut when C appends, if C appends zero 'c's, the string remains the same as after B's step. But the problem statement says \"some number\", which may include zero.\n\nWait, but the note says that at least one a and one b exist after B's step, but what about the c's? For example, can C choose to append zero c's, leaving the string as ab?\n\nIn that case, the string would be 'ab', which would have a's=1, b's=1, c's=0. But then, the c's count (0) is not equal to a's (1) or b's (1), so it's invalid.\n\nBut the problem statement says that C appends \"some number\" of c's, which could include zero. But according to the sample input, the third example is 'aabc' which has a c count of 1.\n\nBut the problem statement says, \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\"\n\nWait, the problem says that \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\nSo, if C appends zero, then the number of 'c's is zero. Which must be equal to a's or b's count. Since a's and b's counts are at least one, zero can't be equal to either, so appending zero is impossible.\n\nThus, the number of 'c's must be at least one and equal to either a's or b's count.\n\nTherefore, the minimal string is 'abc', which has a=1, b=1, c=1.\n\nSo, in our code, the runs must have exactly three runs: a, b, c. Each with counts >=1.\n\nSo, in the code, after generating the runs, we must check that each run has at least one character.\n\nBecause, for example, if the string is 'ac', it's invalid because the runs are a and c, but no b's.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor run in runs:\n    if run[2] - run[1] + 1 < 1:\n        return False\n\nSo, each run must have at least one character.\n\nThus, adding this to the checks.\n\nPutting it all together, the code will:\n\n1. Generate the runs.\n\n2. Check that the runs are exactly three, in the order a, b, c.\n\n3. Check that each run has at least one character.\n\n4. Compute m, n, k.\n\n5. Check if k equals m or n.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nImplementing the runs:\n\nIn Python, we can loop through the string and track the current run.\n\nInitialize current_char as None.\n\nruns = []\n\nfor char in s:\n\n    if char != current_char:\n\n        if current_char is not None:\n\n            runs.append( (current_char, start, i-1) )\n\n        current_char = char\n\n        start = i\n\n# add the last run\n\nruns.append( (current_char, start, len(s)-1) )\n\nWait, but in code, perhaps using a list to track the runs is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can use itertools.groupby.\n\nYes, in Python, itertools.groupby can help here.\n\nUsing groupby, we can group consecutive same characters.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nfrom itertools import groupby\n\ns = 'aaabccc'\n\nruns = []\nfor key, group in groupby(s):\n    runs.append( (key, len(list(group))) )\n\nThis will give us a list of tuples (char, count), e.g., for 'aaabccc', it will be [('a',3), ('b',1), ('c',3)].\n\nThen, the runs must be exactly three elements, each with count >=1.\n\nMoreover, the keys must be in the order 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nimport itertools\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nif not s:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Generate runs\nruns = []\nfor key, group in itertools.groupby(s):\n    runs.append( (key, sum(1 for _ in group)) )\n\n# Check if runs are exactly a, b, c\nif len(runs) != 3:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nrun_chars = [run[0] for run in runs]\nif run_chars != ['a', 'b', 'c']:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check each run has at least one character\nfor char, count in runs:\n    if count < 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\n# Now, compute m, n, k\nm = runs[0][1]\nn = runs[1][1]\nk = runs[2][1]\n\nif k == m or k == n:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but wait: in the runs, the first run is 'a's, second 'b's, third 'c's.\n\nSo, m is runs[0][1], n runs[1][1], k runs[2][1].\n\nSo, the code above will work.\n\nTesting this code against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → runs are a:3, b:1, c:3 → k=3, m=3 → YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → runs are b:2, a:1, c:2 → len(runs)=3, but first run is 'b' → invalid → NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → runs are a:2, b:1, c:1 → k=1, n=1 → YES.\n\nSo, the code works for the samples.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → runs are a:1, b:1, c:1 → k=1 equals m and n → YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abba' → runs are a:1, b:2, a:1 → len(runs)=3, but third run is 'a' → invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbbc' → runs are a:1, b:3, c:1 → k=1, which is less than m=1 and n=3. So 1 == m, so YES.\n\nWait, because m=1, n=3, k=1. So k equals m (1) → condition holds → output YES.\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbbc' → runs a:2, b:3, c:1 → k=1. 1 != 2 or 3 → NO.\n\nWait, but 1 is less than 2 and 3. So no.\n\nWhat about 'aaabbbccc' → a:3, b:3, c:3 → k=3 equals m and n → YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabba' → runs a:2, b:2, a:1 → len(runs)=3, but third run is a → invalid.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, let's think about possible errors.\n\nWhat if the string is empty? According to the problem, |S| is at least 1.\n\nWhat if the string is 'a' → runs is a:1, but len(runs)=1 → invalid.\n\nWhat if the string is 'ab' → runs a:1, b:1 → len(runs)=2 → invalid.\n\nWhat about 'abcde' → the runs would be a:1, b:1, c:1, d:1, e:1 → len(runs) is 5 → invalid.\n\nThus, the code correctly handles all these cases.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nAnother edge case: 'abcb' → runs a:1, b:1, c:1, b:1 → len(runs) is 4 → invalid.\n\nThus, the code returns NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabb' → runs a:2, b:2 → len(runs) is 2 → invalid.\n\nThus, code correctly returns NO.\n\nSo, the code should handle all the cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by three friends A, B, and C following specific rules. The string must consist of a sequence of 'a's followed by 'b's and ending with 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must equal the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check the Structure**: The string must be in the form `a^m b^n c^k` where `m`, `n`, and `k` are the counts of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's respectively. The string should transition from 'a' to 'b' and then to 'c' without any interleaving or other characters.\n2. **Count the Characters**: After confirming the structure, count the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n3. **Check the Condition**: Verify if the number of 'c's (`k`) is equal to either the number of 'a's (`m`) or the number of 'b's (`n`).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom itertools import groupby\n\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Generate runs of consecutive same characters\nruns = []\nfor key, group in groupby(s):\n    runs.append((key, sum(1 for _ in group)))\n\n# Check if there are exactly three runs: a, b, c\nif len(runs) != 3:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nrun_chars = [run[0] for run in runs]\nif run_chars != ['a', 'b', 'c']:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Each run must have at least one character\nfor char, count in runs:\n    if count < 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\n# Calculate the counts of a, b, c\nm = runs[0][1]\nn = runs[1][1]\nk = runs[2][1]\n\nif k == m or k == n:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Structure Check**: The code uses `itertools.groupby` to group consecutive characters. It ensures the string transitions correctly from 'a' to 'b' and then to 'c' without any invalid transitions.\n2. **Run Generation**: The runs are generated to check the order and count of each character segment.\n3. **Validation**: The code checks if there are exactly three runs, each corresponding to 'a', 'b', and 'c' in order. Each run must have at least one character.\n4. **Count Check**: Finally, the code verifies if the number of 'c's matches the number of 'a's or 'b's, ensuring the string meets the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the structure and the count conditions, ensuring the solution is correct and optimal.",
