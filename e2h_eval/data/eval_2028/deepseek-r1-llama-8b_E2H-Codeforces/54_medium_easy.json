Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.

That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Mister B and Angle in Polygon.\" Hmm, the task is to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 of a regular convex n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. And if there are multiple options with the same minimal difference, any can be chosen.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the regular polygon. A regular polygon has all sides equal and all internal angles equal. So, for an n-gon, each internal angle is (n-2)*180 / n degrees. But wait, when considering the angles formed by three points, it's probably related to the central angles or the angles subtended by certain chords.\n\nWait, but the angle we're trying to form is at vertex v2, with v1 and v3 on its sides. So, in a regular polygon, each side is connected in order. So, for a square, each internal angle is 90 degrees. If I pick a vertex as v2, then v1 and v3 would be adjacent to it, forming a straight line across the square's diagonal, but wait, no—wait, in that case, the angle formed might be different.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the possible angles that can be formed within the polygon. For a regular polygon, the possible angles are determined by the steps between the vertices. Like, for a triangle, the only possible angle is 60 degrees because all angles are 60. But for a square, possible angles could be 90, 45, or maybe others?\n\nHmm, perhaps for any regular polygon, the possible angles that can be formed at a vertex are multiples of the base angle, depending on how many steps away the other two points are. For example, in a square:\n\nIf v2 is vertex 2, then v1 could be vertex 1 and v3 could be vertex 3, making a straight line, which gives an angle of 180 degrees. Or, v1 could be 1 and v3 could be 4, which forms a right angle of 90 degrees. Or, perhaps another configuration?\n\nWait, maybe I should model this. The central angle between two consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees. So, for a square, each step is 90 degrees. When you select points, the angle at v2 depends on the steps taken from v2 to reach v1 and v3.\n\nSo, suppose v2 is fixed. Then, the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2 determine the angle. Let's say the polygon is numbered 1, 2, 3, ..., n in a clockwise direction.\n\nFor a given v2, let's imagine moving k steps clockwise and m steps counter-clockwise from v2 to reach v1 and v3. Wait, but since the polygon is regular, moving k steps clockwise is the same as moving (n -k) steps counter-clockwise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible pair (i, j), where i and j are the number of steps to the left and right of v2, respectively, the angle can be computed based on i and j. Because the polygon is regular, the angle will depend on the minimal steps between the points.\n\nWait, maybe the angle can be calculated as the sum of the two adjacent angles formed by the lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. Or perhaps it's the external angle formed by those two points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle is the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 as seen from v2. Hmm, in a circle, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc opposite to it. But in this case, the points are arranged on the polygon, which is a regular polygon inscribed in a circle.\n\nWait, so the polygon is regular, which means all its vertices lie on a circle. So, for a regular polygon, each vertex is equally spaced around the circumference. So, the central angle between consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees.\n\nNow, when we select three points v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 is determined by the arcs between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3. Wait, perhaps not directly, but the inscribed angle theorem tells us that the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc that isn't covered by the angle. Or maybe I'm mixing up something.\n\nLet me think again. Suppose the polygon is inscribed in a unit circle. Then, each vertex is at an angle of (k * 360/n) degrees, where k is 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1. Let's fix v2 at angle 0 degrees for simplicity. Then, v1 is at some position, say, angle d degrees, and v3 is at some other position, say, angle e degrees. The angle at v2 is the angle between the vectors from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3.\n\nIn this case, the angle between these two vectors can be found using the dot product formula. Alternatively, since all points are on the unit circle, the angle between them can be determined by the difference in their angles. Wait, but the actual angle at v2 may not just be the difference between d and e, because that's the central angle. The angle at v2 is actually the inscribed angle over the arc between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, no. The inscribed angle theorem states that the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended at any point on the remaining part of the circumference. So, in this case, if the arc between v1 and v3 is θ degrees, then the angle at v2 is θ/2.\n\nBut wait, v2 is one of the points on the circumference, not the center. So, the angle at v2 is indeed half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3.\n\nSo, for our problem, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3.\n\nBut since the polygon is regular, the arc between any two vertices is a multiple of the base angle (360/n degrees). So, the arc can be k*(360/n) degrees, where k is the number of edges between the two points.\n\nWait, for example, in a square (n=4), the arc between two adjacent vertices is 90 degrees. So, if v1 is two steps away from v3 (so they are opposite each other), the arc is 180 degrees, leading to an angle of 90 degrees at v2.\n\nSo, the angle at v2 is (arc_length)/2, where arc_length is the measure of the arc between v1 and v3.\n\nBut how do we compute the arc_length? It depends on how far apart v1 and v3 are around the polygon.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each possible pair (v1, v3), compute the angle at v2, then find the one closest to 'a'.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 105, doing this naively for all possible triplets would be O(n^3), which is 105^3 = ~1e6 operations—manageable, but perhaps we can find a smarter way.\n\nWait, but even 1e6 is acceptable for Python. So perhaps we can precompute all possible possible angles for all possible v2 and find the minimal difference.\n\nBut wait, for each v2, the possible angles are determined by the steps between v1 and v3. Since the polygon is regular, for a given v2, the angle can be calculated based on the number of steps between v1 and v3.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nSuppose v2 is fixed. Let's number the vertices in a circle, so v2 is at position 0. Then, for any other vertex, the distance can be measured as the minimal steps in either direction. So, for any vertex x, the minimal distance from v2 is min( (x - v2) mod n, (v2 - x) mod n ), but perhaps it's easier to represent the step count as the minimal steps between them.\n\nWait, no. Because the arc length between v1 and v3 as seen from the center is determined by the minimal path around the circle. So, if v1 is k steps ahead of v2 in the clockwise direction, and v3 is m steps behind, the total arc between v1 and v3 is (k + m) steps, but that's only if k + m <= n/2. Otherwise, the minimal arc is (n - (k + m)) steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal arc between v1 and v3 is the minimal of (d, n - d), where d is the absolute difference in their positions relative to v2. But since the polygon is circular, the arc between v1 and v3 can be considered as the minimal of the clockwise and counter-clockwise distances.\n\nSo, for a fixed v2, let's consider all possible pairs (v1, v3) such that v1 and v3 are on either side of v2. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 is the sum of their steps from v2 in both directions. But that's not exactly correct.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given v2, the possible angles are generated by choosing two points, one on each side of v2, and the angle is determined by the sum of their steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given v2, the minimal angle is achieved when the two points are as close as possible in steps.\n\nWait, perhaps for each v2, the possible angle is determined by the minimal arc between v1 and v3, and thus, the angle is half of that arc.\n\nSo, for each v2, the possible angles can be generated by varying the steps between v1 and v3.\n\nBut how to efficiently compute the possible angles for each v2?\n\nLet me think differently. Since the polygon is regular, for any triplet of vertices, the angle at v2 depends solely on the steps between v1 and v3. So, for each possible pair of steps (k, m), where k is the number of steps to one side of v2, and m is the number of steps to the other side, the angle would be determined by the minimal arc between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible k from 1 to floor((n-1)/2), the angle is (k * 2 * (360/n)) / 2 = (k * 360)/n degrees. Wait, no—because the arc is 2k steps (one step in each direction), so the arc length is (2k * 360/n) degrees. Then, the angle at v2 is half that, which is (k * 360/n) degrees.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me clarify.\n\nSuppose v2 is at position 0. Then, v1 is at position k steps clockwise (so at angle (k*360/n) degrees), and v3 is at position -m steps (so at angle (-m*360/n) degrees). The arc between v1 and v3 is the minimal of (k + m) * (360/n) degrees and (n - (k + m)) * (360/n) degrees. But since we are looking for the minimal arc, it's the smaller of the two. However, the angle at v2 is half of this minimal arc.\n\nWait, no. Because the angle at v2 is the inscribed angle, which is half the measure of the arc that is intercepted by the angle. So, the angle at v2 is (arc) / 2, where 'arc' is the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2.\n\nWait, that's the key. So, the angle is half the measure of the arc opposite to v2. So, for the points v1 and v3, the arc that doesn't pass through v2 is the one that contributes to the angle.\n\nSo, if v1 and v3 are on opposite sides of v2, the arc that doesn't contain v2 is the sum of their steps, but if they are on the same side, the arc is the difference between them.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as follows:\n\nThe arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't include v2 is the minimal of the two possible arcs. So, the angle is half of that.\n\nTherefore, for any two points v1 and v3, the angle at v2 is (min(d, n-d)) * (360/(2n)) degrees, where d is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the polygon.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the minimal arc between v1 and v3 is min(d, n-d), where d is the number of steps between them. So, the angle at v2 is (min(d, n-d) * 360) / (2n) degrees.\n\nWait, because the arc length is min(d, n-d) * (360/n) degrees. Then, the inscribed angle is half that, so (min(d, n-d) * 360/n ) / 2 = (min(d, n-d) * 180 ) / n degrees.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for any pair (v1, v3), the angle at v2 is (s * 180) / n, where s is the minimal number of steps between v1 and v3.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding, for each v2, the pair (v1, v3) such that s is as close as possible to (a * n) / 180, but rounded to the nearest integer.\n\nWait, because the desired angle is a, which is given in degrees. So, the target s is (a * n) / 180. But s must be an integer because it's the number of steps. So, we need to find s such that s is as close as possible to (a * n) / 180, but s must be an integer between 1 and (n//2), inclusive.\n\nWait, why between 1 and (n//2)? Because s is the minimal steps, so it can't be more than n/2. For example, in a square (n=4), the maximum minimal steps is 2.\n\nSo, for each v2, the minimal angle is determined by the s closest to (a * n) / 180. So, for each v2, we can compute s_target = round(a * n / 180). But s must be an integer in [1, n//2]. If the computed s_target is outside this range, we adjust it to the nearest possible value.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute s_min and s_max as the possible values of s. So, for each v2, we can generate all possible s values (from 1 to max_s, where max_s is floor(n/2)), compute the corresponding angle, and find the one closest to a.\n\nBut for each v2, the optimal s is the one that brings the angle closest to a. So, for each v2, we can compute the s that is closest to (a * n)/(180) and then check which s in the allowed range gives the best approximation.\n\nOnce we have the best s for a particular v2, the next step is to find the specific v1 and v3 positions relative to v2.\n\nWait, but how to construct the triplet v1, v2, v3 given v2 and s.\n\nSuppose v2 is fixed. To get s steps on one side, we can choose any starting point, but the polygon is regular, so the exact choice doesn't matter as long as the minimal steps between v1 and v3 is s.\n\nWait, but the angle is the same regardless of which v1 and v3 we choose, as long as their minimal steps apart is s.\n\nSo, for a given v2 and s, any pair of points that are s steps apart on either side of v2 will give the same angle.\n\nSo, for each v2, the best s is the one that brings the angle closest to a. Once we have the best s, we can pick any v1 and v3 that are s steps apart from v2 on either side.\n\nWait, but how to find v1 and v3 given s and v2?\n\nLet's fix v2 as position 0 in a 0-based index. Then, the positions of v1 and v3 can be:\n\nv1 is at position (s) steps from v2 in the clockwise direction.\n\nv3 is at position (-s) steps, which is equivalent to (n - s) steps in the clockwise direction.\n\nOr, alternatively, v1 is at (s) steps, and v3 is at (n - s) steps.\n\nWait, because s is the minimal steps, so the other way around is longer than s steps.\n\nSo, for example, in a square (n=4), s=2 steps: v1 is at 2 steps from v2, and v3 is at 2 steps in the other direction (which is 2 steps, but in a square, that's the same as being opposite).\n\nWait, perhaps the positions can be represented as (v2 + s) mod n and (v2 - s) mod n.\n\nSo, for any v2, the possible v1 and v3 are (v2 + s) mod n and (v2 - s) mod n.\n\nBut wait, in the case where s is larger than n/2, like in n=5, s=3 steps, the minimal steps would actually be 2 steps (since 5-3=2). So, perhaps s should be capped at floor(n/2).\n\nWait, yes. So, for each v2, the s can range from 1 to max_s, where max_s is floor(n/2). So, when we calculate s_target, we need to cap it within this range.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each possible v2 (from 1 to n):\n\n   a. Compute s_target = (a * n) / 180. Round this to the nearest integer. But ensure s is within 1 to max_s.\n\n   b. Find the s in 1..max_s that is closest to s_target. If s_target is exactly halfway between two integers, choose the lower or higher one? Well, since any solution is acceptable, perhaps choose the closest one.\n\n   c. For this s, compute the angle as (s * 180) / n degrees.\n\n   d. Keep track of the triplet (v1, v2, v3) that gives the minimal |angle - a|.\n\nBut wait, perhaps for each v2, there might be multiple s values that give a good approximation. For example, s and s+1 may both be candidates.\n\nSo, perhaps for each v2, we should consider all possible s in the vicinity of s_target, compute their angles, and choose the one with the minimal difference.\n\nAlternatively, for each v2, compute the optimal s as the one that when plugged into (s * 180)/n gives the closest angle to a.\n\nBut how to compute s for each v2.\n\nAnother approach: for each v2, compute the s that is the closest to s_optimal = a * n / 180. But since s must be an integer in 1..max_s, s_optimal could be a non-integer. So, for each v2, the best s is floor(s_optimal) or ceil(s_optimal), whichever is closer.\n\nWait, but s_optimal could be 2.3, so s=2 or 3. We need to choose which is closer to s_optimal.\n\nSo, for each v2, compute s_optimal as a * n / 180. Then, the possible s candidates are floor(s_optimal), ceil(s_optimal), and possibly s_optimal rounded to the nearest integer.\n\nBut since s must be an integer, we'll have to choose between floor and ceil, or perhaps even beyond if s_optimal is less than 1 or more than max_s.\n\nWait, for example, if s_optimal is 0.5, then s=1 is the only option. Similarly, if s_optimal is 3.6 and max_s is 3, then s=3 is the only option.\n\nSo, the algorithm for each v2 is:\n\nCompute s_optimal = (a * n) / 180.\n\nThen, s_candidate = round(s_optimal)\n\nBut s_candidate must be within 1 to max_s.\n\nIf s_candidate < 1 → set to 1.\n\nIf s_candidate > max_s → set to max_s.\n\nElse, s_candidate is as is.\n\nBut wait, perhaps s_candidate could be 1 or max_s, but there might be cases where s_candidate ±1 could yield a better angle.\n\nAlternatively, for each v2, compute s_floor = floor(s_optimal), s_ceil = ceil(s_optimal), and also consider s_floor -1 and s_ceil +1, but ensure they are within 1..max_s.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal s is the one that when multiplied by 180 and divided by n gives the angle closest to a. So, for each v2, compute all possible s in 1..max_s, compute the angle, and find the s that gives the minimal |angle - a|.\n\nBut for n up to 105, and v2 up to 105, this would be manageable.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- Iterate over each possible v2 (from 1 to n).\n\n- For each v2, iterate over all possible s from 1 to max_s.\n\n- For each s, compute the angle as (s * 180) / n.\n\n- Compute the absolute difference between this angle and a.\n\n- Keep track of the triplet (v1, v2, v3) that gives the minimal difference.\n\nBut wait, since the polygon is regular and symmetric, perhaps we can find a way to compute this more efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible s, we can precompute the best possible triplet.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's manageable to precompute for each v2, the best s, then find the triplet.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the code structure.\n\nWe can represent the polygon as a list of vertices, numbered from 1 to n.\n\nFor each v2 in 1..n:\n\n   max_s = (n // 2) \n\n   s_optimal = (a * n) / 180\n\n   s_candidate = round(s_optimal)\n\n   if s_candidate < 1: s_candidate = 1\n\n   elif s_candidate > max_s: s_candidate = max_s\n\n   else: pass\n\n   Now, consider s_candidate and possibly s_candidate + 1 and -1, but within 1..max_s.\n\n   For each possible s in [s_candidate -1, s_candidate, s_candidate +1], but within 1..max_s:\n\n      compute the angle for this s: angle = (s * 180) / n\n\n      compute the difference: abs(angle - a)\n\n      keep track of the triplet (v1, v2, v3) with the minimal difference.\n\nBut wait, perhaps for a given s, the triplet is uniquely determined except for the order of v1 and v3.\n\nBecause v1 can be either (v2 - s) or (v2 + s), and v3 can be the other.\n\nSo, for each s, there are two possible triplets: (v2 -s, v2, v2 +s) or (v2 +s, v2, v2 -s). But since v1 and v3 are distinct, it's okay.\n\nBut wait, the polygon is circular, so v2 - s is equivalent to v2 + (n - s). So, for a given s, the positions are (v2 + s) mod n and (v2 - s) mod n.\n\nThus, for each v2 and s, the triplet is (v2 + s, v2, v2 - s) mod n.\n\nWait, but since the polygon is numbered 1 to n, the modulo operation can wrap around.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to compute the indices as (v2 + s - 1) % n + 1 and (v2 - s - 1) % n + 1. Because if v2 is 1-based, adding s steps would take us to (v2 + s -1) mod n + 1.\n\nSo, for example, if v2 is 4 in a square (n=4), adding 2 steps would take us back to 2 (since (4+2-1)=5, mod 4 is 1, plus 1 is 2). Similarly, subtracting 2 steps from 4 would take us to 2.\n\nSo, for each v2 and s, the triplet is (v2 + s, v2, v2 - s), but adjusted for 1-based indexing.\n\nBut wait, when v2 is 1, subtracting s could result in 0, which should be converted to n.\n\nSo, the general formula for v1 and v3 is:\n\nv1 = ((v2 - 1) + s) % n + 1\n\nv3 = ((v2 - 1) - s) % n + 1\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for each v2, iterate s from 1 to max_s, compute the angle, and track the minimal difference.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 105, this approach would involve 105 * 52 = ~5,460 iterations, which is very manageable.\n\nSo, now the plan is:\n\n1. Read n and a.\n\n2. Compute max_s = n // 2.\n\n3. Initialize variables to track the minimal difference and the corresponding triplet.\n\n4. For each v2 in 1..n:\n\n   a. For s in 1..max_s:\n\n      i. compute angle = (s * 180) / n\n\n      ii. compute current_diff = abs(angle - a)\n\n      iii. if current_diff is less than the minimal difference so far, update the triplet.\n\n      iv. Also, check s+1 and s-1, but within 1..max_s, and see if they improve the difference.\n\nWait, but for each s, we can compute the angle, and for that s, the triplet is uniquely determined as (v1, v2, v3) where v1 = (v2 + s) mod n and v3 = (v2 - s) mod n.\n\nBut perhaps for a given s, there are two possible triplets: (v1, v2, v3) and (v3, v2, v1). But since the output requires v1, v2, v3 in any order, as long as v2 is in the middle, any arrangement is acceptable.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the output is to print three integers, which can be in any order as long as they form the desired angle. Wait, no—the problem says the output should be three space-separated integers: v1, v2, v3. So, the order matters in that v2 is the middle one.\n\nSo, for each triplet, the order is v1, v2, v3, with v2 in the middle.\n\nThus, for each s, the triplet is (v1, v2, v3), where v1 is (v2 + s) mod n, and v3 is (v2 - s) mod n.\n\nWait, no—because when s is added, v1 is (v2 + s) mod n, but when subtracted, v3 is (v2 - s) mod n.\n\nBut since the polygon is circular, mod n arithmetic applies.\n\nBut in 1-based indexing, it's a bit tricky. So, perhaps the correct way is to compute v1 and v3 as:\n\nv1 = (v2 - 1 + s) % n + 1\n\nv3 = (v2 - 1 - s) % n + 1\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor v2 in range(1, n+1):\n    for s in range(1, max_s + 1):\n        v1 = (v2 - 1 + s) % n + 1\n        v3 = (v2 - 1 - s) % n + 1\n        angle = (s * 180) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < current_min:\n            current_min = diff\n            best_triplet = (v1, v2, v3)\n        elif diff == current_min:\n            # choose the first encountered, or compare triplets lex order?\n            # but since any is acceptable, just keep the first.\n\nBut wait, perhaps for a given v2, there are multiple s that give the same minimal difference. We need to find the first occurrence.\n\nBut what about the possibility that a larger s could yield a better angle? For example, if s is 2 and s is 3, and both give the same difference as the current minimal.\n\nIn that case, perhaps we need to compute all s and track the minimal.\n\nBut for each v2, the code above iterates s from 1 to max_s, so it will capture the first occurrence of the minimal difference.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize by, for each v2, finding the s that is closest to s_optimal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to precompute all possible s for all v2, compute the angles, and find the triplet with the minimal difference.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead n and a.\n\nCompute max_s = n // 2.\n\nInitialize best_diff to a large value, say infinity.\n\nbest_triplet = None.\n\nfor v2 in 1..n:\n\n    for s in 1..max_s:\n\n        compute v1 and v3 as per the formula.\n\n        compute angle = (s * 180) / n\n\n        compute current_diff = abs(angle - a)\n\n        if current_diff < best_diff:\n\n            best_diff = current_diff\n\n            best_triplet = (v1, v2, v3)\n\n        elif current_diff == best_diff:\n\n            # optional: compare with existing best and keep the lex smaller triplet, but it's not required.\n\n            pass\n\nOnce all are processed, output the best_triplet.\n\nWait, but this approach considers all possible v2 and s, which is O(n^2), but n is 105, so 105^2 is 11,025 iterations—very manageable.\n\nBut wait, let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 15\n\nSample Output: 1 2 3\n\nExplanation: In a triangle, the only possible angle is 60 degrees, which is the angle at any vertex when the other two are adjacent.\n\nSo, for n=3, max_s is 1.\n\nFor each v2 (1,2,3):\n\n   s can be 1.\n\n   angle is (1 * 180)/3 = 60.\n\n   Which matches a=15? No. Wait, but 60 is 45 away from 15. Wait, but the problem expects the closest possible.\n\nWait, but in this case, the only possible angle is 60 degrees. So, the minimal difference is 45 degrees. So, the sample output is correct.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput: 4 67\n\nOutput: 2 1 3\n\nWait, for n=4, max_s is 2.\n\nFor each v2 in 1..4:\n\n   s ranges from 1 to 2.\n\nFor v2=2:\n\n   s=1: angle is 45 degrees. Difference is 22.\n\n   s=2: angle is 90 degrees. Difference is 23.\n\nSo, the minimal is 22.\n\nWhich is better than other v2's.\n\nSimilarly, for v2=1:\n\n   s=1: angle 45. Diff 22.\n\n   s=2: angle 90. Diff 23.\n\nSo, for v2=1, the triplet is (2,1,4).\n\nWait, but the sample output is 2 1 3.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the way v1 and v3 are computed.\n\nWait, for v2=2, s=1:\n\nv1 = (2-1 +1) mod4 +1 = (2) mod4 +1= 2+1=3.\n\nv3 = (2-1 -1) mod4 +1 = (0) mod4 +1= 0+1=1.\n\nSo, triplet is 3 2 1. But sample output is 2 1 3. Oh, wait, perhaps the order can be any as long as v2 is in the middle.\n\nWait, the triplet is 1, 2, 3.\n\nWait, for v2=2, s=1: v1 is 3, v3 is 1. So the triplet is (3,2,1), but the output is 2 1 3, which is 1, 2, 3.\n\nSo, perhaps the code is capturing the triplet as (v1, v2, v3), but the sample output is ordering them as (v3, v2, v1). But the problem allows any ordering as long as the angle is correct.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that any triplet is acceptable as long as the angle is as close as possible. So, the triplet (3,2,1) is correct, but the sample output is (1,2,3). How is that possible?\n\nAh, wait, in the sample explanation, the output is 1 2 3, which implies that v1 is 1, v2 is 2, and v3 is 3. But according to our calculation, for v2=2, s=1, v1 is 3 and v3 is 1. So the triplet is (3,2,1).\n\nBut the sample output is (1,2,3). So, perhaps I've misunderstood the triplet's formation.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the angle is formed is that v1 and v3 are on the same side of v2. Or perhaps the angle is formed by two lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3, but the angle is the internal angle of the polygon.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle is the internal angle of the polygon when you connect v1, v2, v3. But wait, the polygon's internal angle is (n-2)*180/n, which is different from the angle formed by three arbitrary points.\n\nWait, no. The internal angle of the polygon is the angle between two adjacent edges. For example, in a square, each internal angle is 90 degrees, but the angle formed by connecting three vertices may be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem statement says that v1 and v3 lie on the sides of the polygon. So, the sides are the edges of the polygon.\n\nWait, no, the problem statement says: \"v1 and v3 lie on its sides\". Wait, \"its\" refers to the polygon's sides.\n\nSo, the polygon is a regular polygon, and the sides are the edges between consecutive vertices.\n\nSo, v1 and v3 must be on the sides of the polygon, but they don't have to be vertices. Wait, no, the problem statement says that v1, v2, v3 are vertices of the polygon.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3\".\n\nSo, the sides are the edges of the polygon, which are between consecutive vertices. So, v1 and v3 must lie on the sides of the polygon.\n\nWait, but the vertices themselves are the endpoints of the sides. So, perhaps the problem is that v1 and v3 are on the sides, meaning that they are between two consecutive vertices.\n\nBut the problem statement says that v1, v2, v3 are vertices of the polygon, so perhaps the sides are the edges, and v1 and v3 must lie on the sides, which implies that they are the endpoints of those sides.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem says that v1 and v3 lie on the sides of the polygon, but they are vertices. So, each side is between two consecutive vertices, and the vertices are the endpoints of the sides. So, v1 and v3 must be on the sides, but since they are vertices, they are the endpoints.\n\nSo, in that case, the angle at v2 is formed by the two sides of the polygon that meet at v2.\n\nWait, no, because v1 and v3 are on the sides, but the angle is at v2, which is a vertex.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"the angle is formed at v2, where v1 and v3 lie on its sides.\"\n\nSo, v2 is a vertex of the polygon. The sides of the polygon are the edges between consecutive vertices. So, the sides are the edges, and the vertices are the endpoints.\n\nSo, v1 and v3 must lie on the sides of the polygon. So, the sides are the edges between consecutive vertices. So, for example, in a square, the sides are between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-1.\n\nSo, v1 and v3 must be on these edges, but they are also vertices. So, the only way v1 and v3 lie on the sides is if they are the endpoints of the sides.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, suppose the polygon is a pentagon. Then, a side is between 1-2. A point on this side is somewhere between 1 and 2. But the problem says v1 and v3 are vertices, so they must be the endpoints.\n\nSo, in that case, the only possible way for v1 and v3 to lie on the sides is that they are the endpoints of those sides.\n\nThus, the angle at v2 is the internal angle of the polygon.\n\nWait, that can't be right because in the first sample, the triangle's internal angle is 60 degrees, which is the only possible angle.\n\nBut in the second sample, a square, the internal angle is 90 degrees. So, why is the sample output 45 degrees? Because the user can choose any three vertices that form an angle as close as possible",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices of a regular convex polygon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given angle. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently computing the possible angles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding three vertices \\( v1, v2, v3 \\) in a regular polygon such that the angle at \\( v2 \\) is closest to a given value \\( a \\). The vertices are numbered from 1 to \\( n \\) in a clockwise order.\n\n2. **Polygon Properties**: A regular polygon has equal sides and internal angles. For an \\( n \\)-gon, each internal angle is \\( \\frac{(n-2) \\times 180}{n} \\) degrees. However, when considering angles formed by three vertices, we need to consider the arcs between them.\n\n3. **Angle Calculation**: The angle at \\( v2 \\) can be computed using the inscribed angle theorem, which states that the angle at \\( v2 \\) is half the measure of the arc opposite to it. For a regular polygon, the arc length is a multiple of the central angle \\( \\frac{360}{n} \\) degrees.\n\n4. **Optimal Steps**: For each vertex \\( v2 \\), we consider steps \\( s \\) from \\( v2 \\) to compute the angle. The optimal \\( s \\) is determined by rounding \\( \\frac{a \\times n}{180} \\) to the nearest integer, ensuring it falls within the valid range [1, \\( \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor \\)].\n\n5. **Efficient Search**: We iterate over each vertex \\( v2 \\) and for each possible step \\( s \\), compute the corresponding angle and track the triplet that minimizes the absolute difference from \\( a \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\nmax_s = n // 2\nbest_diff = float('inf')\nbest_triplet = None\n\nfor v2 in range(1, n + 1):\n    for s in range(1, max_s + 1):\n        # Compute v1 and v3\n        v1 = (v2 - 1 + s) % n + 1\n        v3 = (v2 - 1 - s) % n + 1\n        # Calculate the angle\n        angle = (s * 180.0) / n\n        current_diff = abs(angle - a)\n        # Update the best if this is better\n        if current_diff < best_diff:\n            best_diff = current_diff\n            best_triplet = (v1, v2, v3)\n        elif current_diff == best_diff:\n            # If same difference, keep the first one encountered\n            if best_triplet is None:\n                best_triplet = (v1, v2, v3)\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, best_triplet)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the values of \\( n \\) (number of vertices) and \\( a \\) (target angle).\n2. **Initialization**: Variables are initialized to track the best difference and the corresponding triplet of vertices.\n3. **Iterating Over Vertices**: For each vertex \\( v2 \\), we consider all possible steps \\( s \\) from 1 to \\( \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor \\).\n4. **Computing Positions**: For each step \\( s \\), the positions of \\( v1 \\) and \\( v3 \\) relative to \\( v2 \\) are computed using modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the polygon.\n5. **Angle Calculation**: The angle at \\( v2 \\) is calculated and compared to \\( a \\) to determine how close it is.\n6. **Tracking Best Triplet**: The triplet with the smallest difference is tracked and printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal triplet of vertices forming the angle closest to \\( a \\) while considering all possible configurations in the regular polygon.",
