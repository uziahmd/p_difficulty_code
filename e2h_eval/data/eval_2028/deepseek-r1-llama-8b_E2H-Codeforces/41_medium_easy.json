There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about maximizing profit by building houses on a street with certain restrictions. \n\nAlright, let me read the problem statement carefully again. So, there are n spots on the street where each house can be built with a height between 0 and h. Each spot contributes a squared value equal to the height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in the range from l_i to r_i (inclusive), the tallest house must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit.\n\nHmm. So, the constraints are that for each of the m ranges, the maximum height in that range doesn't exceed x_i. And I want each spot's height as high as possible to maximize the sum of squares.\n\nI think this is a dynamic programming problem because the optimal choice for one spot depends on the choices of previous spots, especially when considering overlapping restrictions.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Maybe we can model the state as the current position and the maximum allowed height up to that point. Wait, but the restrictions can span multiple positions, so it's not just about the previous position. Hmm, perhaps for each position i, the maximum height allowed is the minimum of all the x_j's that include i in their range. Or maybe not exactly, because the x_j's could vary for different ranges.\n\nWait, no. The restrictions are that for each restriction, in its [l, r] interval, the maximum height is <= x_i. So for a particular spot k, the maximum height it can have is the minimum of all x_i where l_i <=k <=r_i. Because for any such x_i, the height at k must be <=x_i. So for each spot, the maximum possible height is the minimum of all x_i that cover it, but also cannot exceed h.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So for each spot, the maximum allowed height is min(h, the minimum x_i among all restrictions that include this spot). So the first step is to compute for each spot what the maximum possible height it can have is.\n\nBut wait, that might not be correct because the x_i's are the maximum allowed for the entire interval. So if two restrictions apply to the same spot, then the maximum height for that spot is the minimum of all applicable x_i's.\n\nSo for each spot i, the max height is the minimum of x_i across all restrictions that include i, and also cannot exceed h. Because if any restriction says that in some interval containing i, the maximum is <=x, then the spot i's height must be <=x. So the maximum possible for i is the smallest x across all such restrictions, but not exceeding h.\n\nWait, but if a spot is not covered by any restriction, then it can be up to h. Like in the second example, spot 1 isn't covered by any restriction, so it can be 10.\n\nSo, for each spot, I can precompute the maximum allowed height as min(h, the minimum x_i of all restrictions that include this spot).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the x_i is the maximum allowed in that specific restriction. So for spot i, any restriction that has l_i <=i <= r_i imposes that the height at i must be <=x_i. So the maximum possible height for i is the minimum of all x_i's from such restrictions. If there are no restrictions covering i, then the maximum is h.\n\nYes, that's right. So first, for each spot, compute the maximum allowed height, which is h if no restrictions apply to it, else the minimum of the x_i's for the restrictions that include it, but not exceeding h.\n\nWait, but wait: For example, suppose two restrictions apply to spot 3. One has x=5 and another x=3. Then the maximum allowed is 3.\n\nSo, for each spot, the maximum possible height is min( h, min{ x_i | l_i <=i <= r_i } ), where x_i is considered only if the restriction applies to i.\n\nIf a spot is not covered by any restriction, then it can be h.\n\nSo, the first step is to compute for each spot i, the maximum possible height it can have.\n\nOnce I have that for each spot, I can model the problem as choosing for each spot a height between 0 and its computed maximum, such that the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nBut wait, is that sufficient? Because the problem is not just to set each spot's height as high as possible, but to ensure that for each restriction, the maximum in its [l, r] interval is <=x_i. However, if for each spot i, the maximum allowed is the minimum of all x_i's for the restrictions that include it, then setting each spot's height to that maximum would automatically satisfy all restrictions. Because for each restriction, the maximum in its interval is the minimum of all x_i's including that restriction, which is <=x_i. So the overall maximum in the interval would be <=x_i.\n\nWait, no. Suppose we have two overlapping restrictions. For example, suppose for interval [2-3], x is 5, and another interval [3-4], x is 3. Then spot 3's maximum is min(5, 3) = 3. So for the [2-3] interval, the maximum is 3, which is <=5, and for [3-4], the maximum is 3, which is <=3. So that works.\n\nSo, yes, if for each spot i, we set its height to the minimum of all x_i's of the restrictions that cover it (but not exceeding h), then all restrictions are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the maximum profit is achieved by setting each spot's height to the maximum allowed by all applicable restrictions.\n\nWait, but does that hold? What if setting a spot to a lower height allows more spots to have higher heights, thus increasing the total?\n\nNo, because the sum of squares is maximized when each term is as large as possible. Since each spot's height is independent except for the restrictions, the optimal is to set each spot to its maximum allowed height.\n\nBecause the function f(a) = a² is convex, and for independent variables, the sum is maximized when each variable is as large as possible.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to computing for each spot the maximum allowed height and then summing their squares.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think of a case where this approach might not work.\n\nSuppose we have two spots, 1 and 2. Suppose there are two restrictions:\n\nRestriction 1: l=1, r=1, x=2\nRestriction 2: l=2, r=2, x=2\n\nSo for spot 1, the maximum is min(2, ...) (only restriction 1 applies, x=2). Similarly for spot 2.\n\nSo both spots can be 2. The sum is 8.\n\nAlternatively, if spot 1 is 2 and spot 2 is 2, that's the maximum.\n\nAnother case: suppose a spot is covered by two restrictions with x=3 and x=5. So the maximum allowed is 3. So that spot is set to 3.\n\nSo, in all cases, setting each spot to the maximum allowed seems to work.\n\nWait, but what if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions, and the minimum x is less than h. For example, a spot is covered by a restriction x=3, and another x=5. Then the maximum allowed is 3.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each spot, find the minimum x_i among all restrictions that include it. Then set the spot's height to that x_i, but not exceeding h. Then the sum of squares is the maximum possible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each spot i (from 1 to n), compute the minimal x_i among all restrictions that include it. Let's call this min_x[i]. If no restrictions apply, min_x[i] is h.\n\n2. Then, for each spot i, the height is min(min_x[i], h). Wait, but min_x[i] is already the minimum of x's, which are <=h, right? Because each x_i is given as <=h. So the height for spot i is min_x[i].\n\nWait, no. Because min_x[i] is the minimum of x_i's for restrictions that include i. But since each x_i is <=h, min_x[i] will be <=h. So the height for i is min_x[i], or h if no restrictions apply.\n\nWait, no. If no restrictions apply, then min_x[i] is undefined. So for such spots, the maximum height is h.\n\nSo, for each spot i:\n\nif there are no restrictions that include i, then height is h.\n\nelse, height is the minimum x_i across all restrictions that include i.\n\nWait, but in code, how do I represent that? Because I can loop through all restrictions, and for each spot i, collect all x's from restrictions that include i, then take the minimum.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n- Read n, h, m.\n\n- Read m restrictions: l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\n- For each spot i from 1 to n:\n\n   - Initialize min_x to h.\n\n   - For each restriction that includes i (i.e., l_i <=i <=r_i):\n\n      - if x_i < current min_x, update min_x to x_i.\n\n   - After processing all applicable restrictions, if min_x is still h, it means no restrictions apply, so the height is h.\n\n   - Else, height is min_x.\n\nBut wait, no. Because for each restriction, x_i could be larger than h, but the problem says x_i is given as 0<=x_i <=h. So no, x_i is always <=h, so min_x will be <=h.\n\nSo for each spot i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum x_i of all restrictions that include i, if any. Otherwise, it's h.\n\nSo, after computing this for each spot, the height is known, and the sum is the sum of squares.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nInitialize an array max_heights of size n+1 (since spots are 1-based), with each element initially set to h.\n\nThen, for each of the m restrictions:\n\n   l, r, x = ... \n\n   for i in l to r:\n\n       if x < max_heights[i]:\n\n           max_heights[i] = x\n\nSo, after processing all restrictions, each max_heights[i] is the minimal x_i among all applicable restrictions, or h if none.\n\nWait, but the initial value for max_heights[i] is h. For each restriction that includes i, if x is smaller than the current value, replace it. So yes, this correctly computes the minimal x_i across all applicable restrictions.\n\nOnce we have max_heights[i] for each spot i, the profit is the sum of squares of these values.\n\nSo, the code becomes:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nmax_heights = [h]*(n+1)\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n        if x < max_heights[i]:\n\n            max_heights[i] = x\n\nThen, compute the sum of squares.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nSo for spot 1:\n\nOnly the first restriction applies. x is 1. So max_heights[1] is 1.\n\nSpot 2: Only second restriction applies, x=3. So max_heights[2]=3.\n\nSpot 3: Third restriction x=2. So max_heights[3]=2.\n\nSum is 1+9+4=14. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nProcessing:\n\nRestriction 1: l=2, r=3, x=8.\n\nSo for i=2 and 3, compare x=8 with their current max_heights, which is 10.\n\nSince 8<10, set to 8.\n\nRestriction 2: l=3, r=4, x=7.\n\nFor i=3: current max is 8, x=7 is smaller. So set to7.\n\nFor i=4: current is 10, x=7 is smaller. Set to7.\n\nSo max_heights after processing:\n\nspot 1: 10\n\nspot 2:8\n\nspot3:7\n\nspot4:7\n\nSum is 100 +64 +49 +49 = 262. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes, so the approach is correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Read all the restrictions, for each spot, track the minimal x, then compute the sum of squares.\n\nNow, let's implement this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead the first line as n, h, m.\n\nmax_heights = [h]*(n+1) # since spots are 1-based.\n\nThen, for each of the m lines:\n\nread l, r, x.\n\nloop i from l to r inclusive:\n\n   if x < max_heights[i], set max_heights[i] =x.\n\nFinally, sum the squares of max_heights[1..n].\n\nPrint the sum.\n\nSo, the code should be something like:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nmax_heights = [h] * (n + 1)\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n        if x < max_heights[i]:\n            max_heights[i] = x\ntotal = sum(a*a for a in max_heights[1:n+1])\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings. But in the way the problem is presented, the input is provided as lines. So perhaps the code needs to read m lines, each with l, r, x.\n\nWait, in the sample input shown, it's written as ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7'], but that's probably a formatting issue. In actual code, we'll read each line as a separate input.\n\nSo the code above should handle it.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nAfter processing the first three restrictions, the max_heights become [3,1,3,2].\n\nSum is 1^2 +3^2 +2^2=1+9+4=14.\n\nSecond sample: n=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nProcessing the two restrictions.\n\nmax_heights starts as [10,10,10,10,10].\n\nAfter first restriction (2-3,8): spots 2 and 3 are set to 8.\n\nAfter second restriction (3-4,7): spot3 is now 7, spot4 is set to7.\n\nSo max_heights is [10,8,7,7].\n\nSum is 100+64+49+49=262.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the solution is to process each restriction, updating the maximum height for each spot as the minimum of all applicable x_i's, and then compute the sum of squares.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street with certain height restrictions. Each spot on the street can have a house with a height that contributes to the total profit based on the square of its height. The goal is to determine the optimal heights for each spot while respecting the given restrictions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Restrictions**: Each restriction specifies that the tallest house within a given range must not exceed a certain height. This means for each spot covered by multiple restrictions, the height must be limited by the smallest of these restrictions.\n2. **Compute Maximum Allowed Heights**: For each spot, compute the maximum allowed height as the minimum value of all applicable restrictions. If a spot is not covered by any restriction, it can be as high as the given maximum height `h`.\n3. **Sum of Squares Calculation**: Once the maximum allowed heights for each spot are determined, compute the total profit by summing the squares of these heights.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nmax_heights = [h] * (n + 1)\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    for i in range(l, r + 1):\n        if max_heights[i] > x:\n            max_heights[i] = x\n\ntotal = sum(a * a for a in max_heights[1:n+1])\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the number of spots `n`, the maximum allowed height `h`, and the number of restrictions `m`.\n2. **Initialization**: An array `max_heights` is initialized where each element is set to `h`, representing the maximum possible height for each spot initially.\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code updates the maximum allowed height for each spot within the specified range. This ensures that each spot's height respects the most restrictive (smallest) restriction.\n4. **Profit Calculation**: After processing all restrictions, the total profit is calculated by summing the squares of the maximum allowed heights for each spot.\n5. **Output**: Finally, the total profit is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal heights for each spot while ensuring all restrictions are respected, maximizing the total profit.",
