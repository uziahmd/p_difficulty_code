He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Check the string,\" and from the description, it seems like I need to verify if a given string meets certain conditions based on how it was built by three friends—A, B, and C.\n\nHmm. Let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, the process is: A creates a string with some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's to the end. Then C appends some 'c's. But here's the catch: C must append a number of 'c's equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before he adds his part. Also, the order of the letters must be strictly a's followed by b's followed by c's. Oh right, because each friend appends their letters at the end.\n\nThe task is, given a string, determine if it could have been formed this way. If yes, output YES; else, NO.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to check is whether the string has all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. If any other order exists, it's invalid.\n\nAdditionally, the counts of c's should be equal to either the count of a's or the count of b's. So, let's break down the steps.\n\nStep 1: Check the structure of the string. It should consist of a's, followed by b's, followed by c's. No mixing between these sections.\n\nHow can I check this? Well, I can iterate through the string and ensure that after the first 'b' comes, no 'a' appears again, and after the first 'c' comes, no 'a' or 'b' appears.\n\nAlternatively, I can split the string into runs of the same character and check that the runs are in the order a -> b -> c.\n\nYes, that's a good approach. For example, in the string \"aaabccc\", the runs are a:3, b:1, c:3. That's valid. But a string like \"abac\" would have runs a, b, a, which is invalid.\n\nSo, step one is to check that the runs are exactly a's, then b's, then c's, and nothing else.\n\nIf that's not the case, immediately return NO.\n\nIf the runs are correct, then proceed to step two.\n\nStep two: Check the counts. Let me denote:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's\n\nWe need to verify that count_c equals either count_a or count_b.\n\nBut wait, also, in the string constructed by C, the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's OR the number of 'b's before C added them. Because when C adds, the string has (count_a + count_b) characters before him, but the counts of 'a' and 'b' are fixed once B is done.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: when C appends the 'c's, the counts of 'a's and 'b's are already determined. So, for example, suppose the string after B is \"aabbb\". So count_a=2, count_b=3. Then C must add either 2 or 3 'c's. So the total count_c is either 2 or 3.\n\nSo the condition is count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, combining both steps:\n\n1. The string must be in the form a^+ b^+ c^+. So, the runs must be a's, then b's, then c's, with all runs non-empty because the problem states that after B gives the string to C, there is at least one a and one b. Wait, wait. The note says that after B appends, the string has at least one a and one b. So, the original string from A must have at least one a, because B appends at least one b. So the overall string must have a run of a's (length >=1), then b's (length >=1), then c's (length >=1). Otherwise, it's invalid.\n\nWait, the initial string from A is some a's. So, count_a is at least 1. Then B appends some b's, so count_b is at least 1. Then C appends some c's, so count_c is at least 1.\n\nTherefore, in the final string, all three runs must be present and non-zero. So, during the run checking, if any of the runs is zero, it's invalid.\n\nWait, no. Because the runs are a's, then b's, then c's. Each run must have at least one character, since each friend appends some letters. So, for example, the string cannot have zero a's, because A appends some. Similarly, B adds some b's, so the count_b is at least 1. C adds some c's, so count_c is at least 1.\n\nTherefore, in the runs, all three parts must exist. So, for example, if the string is \"abc\", it's valid. But \"acb\" is invalid because the runs are a, bc—no, wait, \"acb\" would have a, then c, then b, which is wrong.\n\nWait, no. Let's think: \"acb\" would have the first run as 'a', then 'c', then 'b'. So the order is a->c->b, which is not a->b->c. Therefore, it's invalid.\n\nSo, in the run analysis, the sequence of run types must be a, b, c. So, for example, the runs can't have a, then b, then a, then c, etc.\n\nSo, for step 1:\n\n- The string must consist of runs of a's, followed by runs of b's, followed by runs of c's.\n\n- Each run must be non-empty.\n\nIf any of these conditions is violated, output is NO.\n\nOnce that's confirmed, then we check step 2: count_c must equal count_a or count_b.\n\nWait, but what about the case where all three are present, but the c's are equal to the sum of a and b? Or other possibilities?\n\nNo, because according to the problem statement, C appends a number of c's equal to the number of a's or the number of b's. So, the c's count must be exactly equal to one of them.\n\nSo, for example, if the a's count is 5, b's is 3, then c's can be 5 or 3.\n\nSo, now the plan is:\n\n1. Split the string into runs.\n\n   - For each run, record the character and its length.\n\n   - Ensure that the runs are in the order [a, b, c], each non-empty.\n\n2. Once the runs are correct, compute count_a = run1 length, count_b = run2 length, count_c = run3 length.\n\n3. Check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all conditions are met, output YES. Else, NO.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, I'll need to split the string into runs.\n\nHow to do that in Python:\n\nInitialize a list to hold the runs. Each element is a tuple (char, count).\n\nLoop through each character in the string:\n\n   If the current character is the same as the previous, increment the count.\n\n   Else, add a new tuple to the runs list, starting with this character and count 1.\n\nAfter processing the entire string, check the runs.\n\nFor example, for 'aaabccc', the runs are [('a',3), ('b',1), ('c',3)].\n\nFor 'aabc', the runs are [('a',2), ('b',1), ('c',1)].\n\nBut for 'abac', the runs are [('a',1), ('b',1), ('a',1), ('c',1)], which is invalid because the order is a, b, a, c.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nCheck if the runs list has exactly three elements, and their chars are 'a', 'b', 'c' in order.\n\nAlso, each run's count must be at least 1.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\nruns = []\ncurrent_char = s[0]\ncount = 1\nfor c in s[1:]:\n    if c == current_char:\n        count +=1\n    else:\n        runs.append( (current_char, count) )\n        current_char = c\n        count = 1\nruns.append( (current_char, count) )\n\nThen, check:\n\nif len(runs) !=3: → invalid.\n\nelse:\n\n   chars = [run[0] for run in runs]\n\n   if chars != ['a', 'b', 'c'] → invalid.\n\n   Also, each run must have count >=1, which they will because the initial loop only adds when a change occurs, and the string is non-empty.\n\nWait, the input string is guaranteed to consist of a, b, c, and length >=1.\n\nSo, each run's count is at least 1.\n\nSo, after ensuring that runs is exactly 3 elements, and their chars are a, b, c, in order, proceed.\n\nThen, compute count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\ncount_a = runs[0][1]\n\ncount_b = runs[1][1]\n\ncount_c = runs[2][1]\n\nCheck if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nIf yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the cases where count_c is more than both a and b? Like, say a=2, b=3, c=4. Then, c is not equal to either, so invalid.\n\nSo, the condition is strict.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase 1: All three runs are present, but c's count is neither a nor b.\n\nE.g., 'aaaabbbbcccc' → a=4, b=4, c=4. So count_c=4 equals a and b. So valid.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbbc' → a=2, b=3, c=1. So c=1 is less than both, so invalid.\n\nCase 2: Only two runs, e.g., 'aabbaa' → runs would be a:2, b:2, a:2 → len(runs) =3, but chars are a, b, a → invalid.\n\nAnother edge case: 'abc' → runs are a, b, c. a=1, b=1, c=1 → c=1 equals a and b. So valid.\n\nWhat about 'aabbc'? → a=2, b=2, c=1 → c=1, which doesn't match a or b. So invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbbccc' → a=3, b=3, c=3 → valid.\n\nWait, but what if a=3, b=3, c=3, but the counts are equal. So condition holds.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbbc' → a=1, b=3, c=1 → c is 1, which equals a. So valid.\n\nWait, yes, because 1 equals a's count.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, thinking about possible errors.\n\nWhat about when the string has no c's? Like 'aabbb'. Then, the runs are a, b. So len(runs)=2 → invalid.\n\nSimilarly, a string with no b's would have runs a, c → invalid.\n\nSo, the code correctly handles these.\n\nAnother test case from the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\nLet's see each case.\n\nFirst string: 'aaabccc'\n\nRuns: a:3, b:1, c:3.\n\ncount_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3.\n\nSo, count_c is 3, which equals a's count. So valid → YES.\n\nSecond string: 'bbacc'\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe string is 'bba cc' → the runs are 'b's (2), then 'a' (1), then 'c's (2). So runs are [b, a, c]. So the order is incorrect. So invalid → NO.\n\nThird string: 'aabc' → runs are a:2, b:1, c:1.\n\ncount_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1.\n\ncount_c is 1, which equals count_b. So valid → YES.\n\nYes, the sample outputs match.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbaaccc' → runs are a:1, b:2, a:2, c:3 → len(runs) is 4 → invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaaccc' → runs are a:2, b:2, a:2, c:3 → len>3 → invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcbcbc' → runs are a:1, b:1, c:1, b:1, c:1 → len=5 → invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcabc' → runs are a, b, c, a, b, c → len>3 → invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'abba' → runs are a:1, b:2, a:1 → len=3, but the order is a, b, a → invalid.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nRead the input string.\n\nProcess the runs.\n\nCheck the runs.\n\nCompute the counts.\n\nCheck the condition.\n\nOutput YES or NO.\n\nSo, the code outline:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nif not s:  # but according to input constraints, s is at least length 1.\n\nBut no, input is guaranteed to be 1<=|S|<=5000.\n\nSo, proceed.\n\nThen, process the runs.\n\nThen, check the runs.\n\nThen, check the counts.\n\nSo, code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nif len(s) < 3:\n    # can't have a, b, c each appearing at least once.\n    # because len(s) <3 → a, b, c each must be at least 1, which requires at least 3 letters.\n    # Wait, no. Because a, b, c each must appear at least once. So the minimal length is 3.\n\n    # So, if len(s) <3 → invalid.\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nruns = []\ncurrent_char = s[0]\ncount = 1\n\nfor c in s[1:]:\n    if c == current_char:\n        count +=1\n    else:\n        runs.append( (current_char, count) )\n        current_char = c\n        count = 1\nruns.append( (current_char, count) )\n\n# Now check runs.\n\nif len(runs) !=3:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    chars = [run[0] for run in runs]\n    if chars != ['a', 'b', 'c']:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        a_count = runs[0][1]\n        b_count = runs[1][1]\n        c_count = runs[2][1]\n        if c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what if the string is exactly 3 characters, like 'abc'? Then the code processes correctly.\n\nWait, len(s) is 3. Runs will be 3, len(runs) is 3.\n\nchars will be a, b, c. So condition satisfied.\n\ncount_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=1. So c_count is 1, which equals a and b. So output YES.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbc'.\n\nRuns are a:2, b:2, c:1.\n\nc_count is 1. Is 1 equal to a (2) or b (2)? No. So output NO.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaabbbbcccc' → a:4, b:4, c:4. So c_count=4 equals a and b → YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaabbb' → len(s) is 6. Runs are a:3, b:3. So len(runs) is 2 → invalid.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaaccc' → runs are a:2, b:2, a:2, c:3 → len(runs)=4 → invalid.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nWait, what about the string 'abcabc'? The runs are a:1, b:1, c:1, a:1, b:1, c:1 → len(runs)=6 → invalid.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → runs a:2, b:2, c:2 → valid, c_count=2 equals a and b → YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aabba' → runs a:2, b:2, a:1 → len(runs)=3, but chars are a, b, a → invalid.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code looks correct.\n\nI think this should solve the problem.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by three friends A, B, and C following specific rules. The string must be structured such that it consists of runs of 'a's followed by runs of 'b's and then runs of 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must equal either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Structure**: The string must be divided into runs where each run consists of the same character. The order of these runs must be 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's. Each run must be non-empty.\n2. **Count Check**: After verifying the structure, check if the count of 'c's is equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the length is at least 3, since each a, b, c must appear at least once\nif len(s) < 3:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nruns = []\ncurrent_char = s[0]\ncount = 1\n\nfor c in s[1:]:\n    if c == current_char:\n        count += 1\n    else:\n        runs.append((current_char, count))\n        current_char = c\n        count = 1\nruns.append((current_char, count))\n\n# Check if there are exactly three runs and they are in order a, b, c\nif len(runs) != 3:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    chars = [run[0] for run in runs]\n    if chars != ['a', 'b', 'c']:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        a_count = runs[0][1]\n        b_count = runs[1][1]\n        c_count = runs[2][1]\n        if c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Structure Check**: The string is processed to split it into runs of consecutive characters. If the runs do not strictly follow the order 'a', 'b', 'c' or if there are not exactly three runs, the string is invalid.\n2. **Count Validation**: After confirming the correct order of runs, the counts of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's are checked. The count of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's for the string to be valid.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the structural integrity and the count conditions of the string, ensuring that the solution handles all edge cases correctly.",
