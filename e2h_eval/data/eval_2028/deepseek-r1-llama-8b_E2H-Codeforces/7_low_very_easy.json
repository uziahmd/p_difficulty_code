He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Rudolf and Snowflakes, hard version. Hmm. From the description, it says that a snowflake is an undirected graph constructed in a specific way. \n\nLet me try to understand the structure of a snowflake. The initial step is one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to it, where k must be greater than 1. So after this first step, we have 1 + k vertices. Then, for each vertex that has only one edge (the ones that were just added), we connect each to k new vertices. And this last step must be done at least once.\n\nSo the process goes like this:\n1. Start with 1 node.\n2. Add k nodes connected to it. Now total is 1 + k.\n3. For each of the k nodes (since they have degree 1 now), add k new nodes connected to each. So each contributes k nodes, but wait, no—each of those k nodes will create k new children. So the next step adds k * k nodes. So the total becomes 1 + k + k^2.\n4. But wait, the problem says the third step should be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake is when after the second step, we do the third step once. So the minimal n would be 1 +k +k^2. But maybe more steps can be added? Like, after that, each of the leaves (those added in step 3) will also get k children. So each time you perform the third step, you're adding a layer of k^m nodes for m=2,3,... etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the snowflake can have multiple layers beyond the initial two. Because the third step is done at least once, but could be done multiple times. So the structure is like a tree where each non-leaf node has exactly k children, except for the root which has k children, but then each of those have k, and so on.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The initial structure is: root has k children. Each of those k children then have k children as well because the third step is done at least once. So the minimal structure is depth 2. If the third step is done again, each of the existing leaves (from the second step) gets k children. So the structure can have any depth >=2.\n\nSo the total number of nodes depends on how many times the third step is applied. Let's model the total nodes.\n\nEach time we do the third step, all current leaves are expanded by k nodes. So the number of nodes added in each expansion is equal to the number of leaves multiplied by k.\n\nLet me denote m as the number of layers after the root. So for example, if m=1, it's the root plus its k children. Total nodes: 1 +k = k+1.\n\nIf m=2, then each of the k children has k children, so total nodes: 1 +k +k^2.\n\nIf m=3, then each of the k^2 leaves adds k children, so total nodes: 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, but the third step is done at least once. So m must be at least 2. So the minimal possible n is when m=2: 1 +k +k^2.\n\nBut wait, maybe the third step is done more than once. So m can be 2,3,4,... up to some maximum.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: for a given n, does there exist a k>1 and m>=2 such that n equals 1 +k*(1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1}).\n\nWait, no. Wait, each step adds a layer. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{m} k^i, but starting from i=0, which is 1, then i=1 is k, etc., but wait, the initial step is 1, then k children (so sum is 1+k). Then, each of those k nodes adds k children, so sum is 1 +k +k^2. Then, each of the k^2 nodes adds k children, sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3, and so on.\n\nWait, no. Because each step after the initial addition is expanding the leaves. So the total number of nodes is 1 +k*(1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1}), where m is the number of expansion steps, including the first expansion. Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as:\n\nAfter the initial step, we have the root and k children. That's m=1, giving n=1 +",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with exactly `n` vertices can exist. A snowflake graph is defined as an undirected graph constructed by repeatedly adding layers of `k` new vertices to each leaf node, starting from a single root node.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph starts with a single root node. Each subsequent layer adds `k` new nodes to each leaf node, where `k > 1`. This process continues for at least two layers.\n2. **Formulating the Problem**: The total number of nodes in a snowflake graph after `m` layers (including the root) can be expressed as a geometric series. Specifically, the number of nodes `n` can be written as:\n   \\[\n   n = 1 + k \\times (1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m-1})\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   n = 1 + k \\times \\frac{k^{m} - 1}{k - 1}\n   \\]\n3. **Iterative Check**: For each test case, we check if there exists an integer `k > 1` and an integer `m >= 2` such that the above formula holds true for the given `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 3:\n        return False\n    # We need to find m >= 2 and k >=2 such that n = 1 + k*(k^m -1)/(k-1)\n    # Rearranged: n -1 = k * (k^m -1)/(k-1)\n    # Let's try possible m values and see if (n-1) can be represented as such.\n    max_m = 60  # Since k^m can't be more than n-1, which is up to 1e18\n    for m in range(2, max_m +1):\n        # We have (n-1) must be divisible by (k^m -1)/(k-1) for some k\n        # So for each m, we look for k where (n-1) is equal to k * s, where s = (k^m -1)/(k-1)\n        # Let's denote s = (k^m -1)/(k-1).
