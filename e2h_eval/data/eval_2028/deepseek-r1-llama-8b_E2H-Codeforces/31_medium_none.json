Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Cards.\" Hmm. Let me read the description carefully.\n\nSo, Vanya has some cards with numbers on them. Each number can be positive, negative, or zero, but their absolute value doesn't exceed x. Natasha hid all his cards, but he found n of them. He wants the sum of all the found cards to be zero. But right now, the sum isn't zero. So, he needs to find some more cards (from the infinite supply) to make the total sum zero. Our task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nWait, the initial set of found cards is n, but we can add any number of other cards (with values between -x and x) as needed. We need to find the smallest number of such cards that, when added, make the total sum zero.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this?\n\nLet's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, compute the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this S. We need the total sum after adding some cards to be zero. So, the sum of the new cards should be -S. Because S + new_sum = 0 → new_sum = -S.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to: what's the minimal number of cards needed to reach a sum of -S, where each card contributes at most x (in absolute value).\n\nBut wait, each card can contribute up to x in magnitude. So, for example, if we have a sum we need to achieve, say T = -S, then the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |T| / x. Because each card can contribute at most x towards T.\n\nWait, let's test this with the examples.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\nThe sum is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. So T is -2. Wait, no, because the new sum should be 0. So current sum is 2, so we need the new sum to be -2. So T is -2. So |T| is 2. Each card can contribute up to 2. So the minimal number is 2 / 2 = 1. So output is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample:\n2 3\n-2 -2\nSum is -4. So T is 4. We need to get a sum of 4. Each card can contribute up to 3. So 4 /3 is 1.333, so ceiling is 2. So output is 2.\n\nYes, that matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems to be:\n\n1. Calculate the sum S of the found cards.\n2. Compute the required sum T = -S.\n3. The minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |T| divided by x. Because each card can contribute at maximum x towards T.\n\nWait, but what about when T is zero? Then we don't need any more cards. That's a base case.\n\nSo, the formula is: if T == 0, return 0. Else, compute m = |T|. The minimal number is m / x, rounded up.\n\nWait, but division in programming can be tricky. For example, if m is exactly divisible by x, then it's m/x. Otherwise, it's (m//x)+1.\n\nAlternatively, in code, it's (m + x -1) // x.\n\nYes, that would handle both cases.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read n and x.\n- Read the list of numbers.\n- Compute S = sum of the list.\n- If S is zero, output 0.\n- Else, compute T = -S.\n- Compute m = absolute value of T.\n- Compute the minimal number of cards as (m + x -1) // x.\n\nThat's the plan.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All found cards sum to zero. So nothing needed. Output 0.\n\nCase 2: Sum is 5, x is 3. 5/3 is 1.666, so 2 cards.\n\nWait, 3+2=5, but wait each card can be at max 3. So two cards, 3 and 2. Yes.\n\nAnother case: Sum is 0. Output is 0.\n\nWhat if the sum is 1, x is 1. Then one card is needed.\n\nWhat if sum is 0 after adding some cards? Like if the initial sum is already zero, then no cards needed.\n\nWait, but the problem says that Natasha hid all the cards, but Vanya found some. So, initially, the sum could be anything, but the goal is to make it zero by adding some cards.\n\nAnother edge case: when the sum is very large, but x is small.\n\nLike, sum is 1000, x is 1. Then 1000 cards needed.\n\nSo, the code seems straightforward.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nWe'll read the input from stdin. The first line has n and x. The second line has n integers.\n\nCompute S = sum of those integers.\n\nIf S is zero, print 0.\n\nElse, compute m = abs(-S). Then compute (m + x -1) // x.\n\nPrint that number.\n\nWait, but wait! Wait, the initial sum is S. We need the new cards to sum to -S. So the sum of the new cards is T = -S. So yes.\n\nSo, for example, in the second sample:\n\nn=2, x=3. The numbers are -2 and -2. Sum is -4. So T is 4. x is 3. 4 /3 is 1.333, so 2 cards.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x=3. (5+3-1)//3 =7//3=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, handling the input:\n\nRead the first line as n and x. Then read the next line as list of integers.\n\nIn Python, it's something like:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\n\nif s ==0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    m = abs(s)\n    min_cards = (m + x -1) // x\n    print(min_cards)\n\nWait, but wait—wait, no. Because s is the sum of the found cards. The target is to add some cards whose sum is -s. So m is the absolute value of s.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, no. Let's correct: T is the sum needed. T is -s.\n\nSo the absolute value is |T| = |s|.\n\nSo m is |s|.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 3 2, and cards [-1,1,2]. Sum is 2. So m is 2. (2+2-1)/2 =3//2=1. So output 1.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, x=3. Cards are -2,-2. Sum is -4. m is 4. (4+3-1)/3=6//3=2. Output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 0. Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 1, x=1. Output is 1.\n\nSum is 5, x=3. Output is 2.\n\nSum is 10, x=3: 10/3 is 3.333, so 4 cards.\n\nBecause 3*3=9, which is less than 10. 4*3=12 >=10.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his found cards (including the new ones) equals zero. Each card can have a number between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: Compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Required Sum**: The target sum needed from the additional cards is the negative of the current sum. This is because we want the total sum to be zero.\n3. **Compute the Minimum Number of Cards**: The minimum number of additional cards required is determined by dividing the absolute value of the required sum by the maximum absolute value x on any card. If there's a remainder, we round up to ensure we cover the entire required sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\n\nif s == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    m = abs(s)\n    min_cards = (m + x - 1) // x\n    print(min_cards)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: We first read the number of found cards `n` and the maximum absolute value `x` of the cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: We compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n3. **Check for Zero Sum**: If the sum is already zero, no additional cards are needed, so we print 0.\n4. **Calculate Required Sum**: If the sum is non-zero, we compute the absolute value of the negative of the sum, which gives us the target sum needed from the additional cards.\n5. **Determine Minimum Cards**: Using integer division, we calculate the minimum number of cards required by taking the ceiling of the division of the target sum by x. This is efficiently done using the formula `(m + x - 1) // x`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and correctly determine the minimum number of additional cards needed to balance the sum to zero.",
