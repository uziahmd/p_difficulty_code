Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The task is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The substrings can overlap, which is an important point.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. First, I need to understand what exactly a substring is here. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string. So for example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears starting at position 0 and position 2. They overlap because the second occurrence starts where the first ends.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum possible length of such a substring that occurs at least twice. If no such substring exists (like in a string with all unique characters), then the answer should be 0.\n\nWait, but the sample input includes 'abcd' which has all unique characters, so the output is 0. So that's correct.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Generate all possible substrings of the given string.\n2. For each possible length, starting from the maximum possible down to 1, check if any substring of that length appears more than once.\n3. The first length where this condition is met will be our answer.\n\nBut how do I efficiently generate these substrings and check for duplicates?\n\nLet me think about the brute-force approach first, since the string length is up to 100, which is manageable. For a string of length n, there are O(n^2) possible substrings. Storing all substrings and checking for duplicates could be feasible here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a sliding window approach with some hashing could help. But for small n, perhaps the brute-force is acceptable.\n\nWait, but for each possible length l, we can check all possible substrings of that length and see if any appears more than once.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Iterate l from the maximum possible (n-1, since a substring of length n occurs only once) down to 1.\n   - For each l, collect all substrings of length l.\n   - Check if any substring occurs more than once.\n   - If yes, return l as the answer.\n- If after checking all lengths, none found, return 0.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, let's get the length of the input string, say s = input().strip()\n\nThen, for l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\nFor each l, generate all possible substrings of length l.\n\nHow to generate them? For i from 0 to len(s) - l inclusive, the substring starts at i and has length l.\n\nCollect all these substrings into a set, and as soon as a duplicate is found, return l.\n\nWait, but using a set might not work directly because the same substring could appear multiple times, so adding to a set would just store one instance. So, perhaps using a dictionary or a list to track occurrences.\n\nAnother approach: For each l, create a dictionary where keys are the substrings and the values are counts. As we process each substring, we increment the count. If any count reaches 2, we know we've found a duplicate.\n\nWait, but even better: for each substring, as soon as two occurrences are found, we can immediately return l as the result.\n\nYes, that's efficient.\n\nSo, for each l starting from the largest possible:\n\n   Create a dictionary or a hash map to track substrings and their positions.\n   For each i from 0 to len(s) - l:\n       substring = s[i:i+l]\n       if substring is already in the dictionary:\n           return l\n       else:\n           add it to the dictionary\n   After processing all i, if no duplicates found, continue to the next smaller l.\n\nIf all l's are checked and no duplicates, return 0.\n\nThis way, we can stop as soon as the maximum possible l is found.\n\nThat's efficient because for each l, we process all substrings of that length, and as soon as a duplicate is found, we return.\n\nNow, considering edge cases:\n\nCase 1: All characters are unique. Then, the answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: The entire string is repeated, like 'aaaaa'. Then the maximum l is 4 (since the substring 'aaaa' appears starting at 0 and 1).\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the string 'aaaaa' has substrings of length 5 (the whole string, which occurs once). So for l=5, it's unique. Then l=4: 'aaaa' occurs starting at 0 and 1. So the maximum l is 4.\n\nSo the code needs to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: 'ababa' as in the sample. The substrings are:\n\nLooking for the maximum l.\n\nCheck l=4: substrings are 'abab', 'baba'. No duplicates.\n\nl",

The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Generate Substrings**: For each possible length `l` starting from the maximum possible down to 1, generate all substrings of that length.\n2. **Check for Duplicates**: For each length `l`, use a dictionary to track the substrings and their positions. If any substring is found more than once, return the current length `l` as the result.\n3. **Edge Cases**: If no such substring exists (all characters are unique), return 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check each possible substring length, starting from the largest, and stop as soon as we find the longest valid substring.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor l in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n    seen = {}\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        seen[substr] = True\n\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n2. **Iterate Over Lengths**: We iterate over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (`n-1`) down to 1.\n3. **Track Substrings**: For each length `l`, we create a dictionary to track substrings. As we generate each substring, we check if it has been seen before.\n4. **Check for Duplicates**: If a duplicate substring is found, we immediately print the current length `l` and exit the program.\n5. **Handle Unique Strings**: If no duplicates are found for any length, we print 0.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures optimal performance for strings up to the maximum allowed length.",
