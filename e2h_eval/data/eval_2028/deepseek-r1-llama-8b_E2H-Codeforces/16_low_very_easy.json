Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Crazy Town,\" and from the description, it seems like it involves lines dividing a plane into regions, and moving between these regions with certain rules.\n\nHmm, the task is to find the minimum number of steps to get from the home block to the university block. Each step allows moving to an adjacent block that shares a border of non-zero length. So, the key here is understanding how the lines partition the plane and how the points lie in relation to these lines.\n\nWait, but how do the lines affect the regions? Each line divides the plane into two parts. So, for each line, the home and university points will be on either side or the same side. If they are on the same side for all lines, then they are in the same region, right? But if they are on opposite sides for some lines, those lines contribute to the separation.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the arrangement could be more complex than that. Like, multiple lines can create a situation where the home and university are in different regions not just because of one line, but because of several lines working together.\n\nOh, right! This sounds like the concept of convex hulls or something related to linear separations. Alternatively, maybe it's about the arrangement of the lines and determining whether the two points are on the same side for all lines, but that's probably not sufficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of steps is determined by the number of lines that separate the two points. Because each such line would contribute to a boundary that the path must cross. So, if there are k lines that separate the home and university, then the minimal steps required would be k.\n\nLet me think about that. Because each line that separates them acts as a barrier that you have to cross. And each crossing takes one step. So, the minimal steps would be the count of lines that separate the two points.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because when you move from one region to another, you're crossing a single line at a time. So, the minimal path would involve crossing each separating line once.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each line, determine whether the home and university are on opposite sides. The total count of such lines is the answer.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because sometimes a single line can't separate them directly, but after considering all lines, their arrangement might require more steps.\n\nNo, wait. Because each line that separates the two points adds a necessary crossing. So, the minimal number of steps is exactly the number of lines that separate the two points.\n\nTherefore, the solution reduces to counting how many of the given lines have the home and university on opposite sides.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each line, compute the value (ai * x + bi * y + ci) for both home and university.\n2. If the signs of these values are different, increment the count.\n3. The count is the minimal number of steps required.\n\nThat's straightforward. Now, let's test this logic with the example provided.\n\nIn the sample input:\n\nHome is (1, 1), university is (-1, -1). There are 2 roads.\n\nFirst road: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0. Home is at y=1, which is above. University is at y=-1, below. So, they are on opposite sides. So, this line contributes.\n\nSecond road: 1x + 0y -3 = 0 → x=3. Home is at x=1 <3, university is at x=-1 <3. Both are on the same side (left of the line). So, no contribution.\n\nWait, but the output is 2. Hmm, that suggests that the count is 2. But according to my reasoning, only the first line contributes.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the sample input. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the sample input has two test cases? Or maybe it's just one with multiple outputs. Wait, the problem says the output is two numbers, the home and university steps. Oh, wait, no. Looking back, the sample input is:\n\nThe first part is the home and university coordinates. Then comes n=2, followed by two lines.\n\nWait, the sample input is written as three blocks, but perhaps that's a formatting issue. Anyway, the sample input has two test cases, each requiring a step count.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the input is structured as follows:\n\nThe first line is home's x1 y1.\n\nSecond line is university's x2 y2.\n\nThird line is n.\n\nThen n lines follow.\n\nSo, for the sample, the home is (1,1), university is (-1,-1), n=2.\n\nLines:\n\n0 1 0 → y=0.\n\n1 0 0 → x=0?\n\nWait,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. The town is divided by multiple lines, and each step allows moving to an adjacent block that shares a border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each line that separates the home and university contributes to the minimal path. Specifically, if a line separates the home and university, it means they lie on opposite sides of that line. The minimal number of steps required to move from one block to another is equal to the number of such separating lines.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n1. For each given line, compute the value of the line equation at both the home and university coordinates.\n2. If the signs of these values are different, it means the points lie on opposite sides of the line, and thus, the line separates them.\n3. Count the number of such separating lines. This count is the minimal number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read home coordinates\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    # Read university coordinates\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        # Calculate the values for home and university\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe code reads the input coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads (lines). For each line, it checks whether the home and university lie on opposite sides by evaluating the line equation at those points. If they do, it increments the count of separating lines. Finally, the count is printed, representing the minimum number of steps needed to move from the home block to the university block.",
