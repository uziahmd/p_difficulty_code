After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about determining the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. Hmm.\n\nSo, each student has marks for m subjects. A student is considered the best at a subject if no one else has a higher mark for that subject. And a student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. My task is to find out how many such students there are.\n\nLet me think about the input. The first line gives n and m. Then there are n lines, each representing a student's grades. Each grade is a string of m characters, each being a digit from 1 to 9. So for example, if a student has '232' for three subjects, that means their marks are 2,3,2 respectively.\n\nThe output is a list (or maybe just a single number) of the count of successful students.\n\nHmm, how to approach this? I need to process each student and for each subject, check if they have the maximum mark in that subject. If any of them do, then the student is successful.\n\nWait, but how do I efficiently compute this?\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nFor each subject across all students:\n- Find the maximum mark in that subject.\n- For each student, check if their mark in that subject equals the maximum. But wait, no, not exactly. Because the maximum might be achieved by multiple students. Only if a student has the maximum in a subject, but whether they are the best depends on whether others have the same or lower.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the definition says a student is the best at a subject if there's no student who got a higher mark. So if two students have the same maximum mark in a subject, then neither is the best because there exists another student with the same mark. So the best is when a student has a mark that is strictly higher than all others in that subject.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says, \"a student is the best at some subject if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\" So if a student has the highest mark, even if others also have that mark, then that student is the best. Because no one has a higher mark. So the condition is: for a subject, a student is the best if their mark is greater than or equal to all others? Or is it strictly greater than all others?\n\nWait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again.\n\n\"A student is the best at some subject if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\"\n\nOh right, so if any other student has a higher mark, then the original student is not the best. So for a student to be the best, their mark must be strictly higher than all others in that subject. Because if someone else has the same mark, then the original student isn't the best.\n\nWait, no. Because suppose two students have the same maximum mark. Then, for that subject, both of them have the same mark as others. So neither is the best because there's no one with a higher mark. Wait, no. Wait, the condition is that the student is the best if no other student has a higher mark. So if two students have the same maximum, then for that subject, both are considered best? Or not?\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose in subject X, student A has 5, student B has 5. Then, for student A, is there any student with a higher mark in X? No. Because 5 is the maximum. So student A is the best at X. Similarly, student B is also the best at X. So, in that case, both are considered best.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct according to the problem statement. Because the problem says, \"no student\" has a higher mark. So if another student has the same mark, then the condition holds. So yes, both would be considered best.\n\nWait, but that complicates things because for a subject, multiple students can be the best. So for each subject, we need to find all students who have the maximum mark in that subject.\n\nThen, for each student, if they are in the set of bests for at least one subject, they are counted as successful.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each subject, determine which students are the best (i.e., their mark is the maximum in that subject).\n\n2. For each student, check if they are in the best set for any subject.\n\n3. Count the number of students who meet this condition.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, I'll need to process each subject separately.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Read each student's grades. Maybe store them as a list of strings, where each string represents the marks for each subject.\n\n- For each subject (from 0 to m-1):\n\n   a. For each student, get their mark in this subject.\n\n   b. Find the maximum mark among all students in this subject.\n\n   c. Collect all students whose mark in this subject is equal to the maximum.\n\n   d. Store these students for this subject.\n\n- Once all subjects are processed, for each student, check if they are in any of the best sets for any subject.\n\n- Count how many students satisfy this.\n\nNow, the challenge is to efficiently represent each student and track whether they are a best in any subject.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- Create a list of sets, where each set contains the indices of students who are best in that subject.\n\nAlternatively, for each subject, collect the indices of the best students.\n\nThen, for each student, check if their index is present in any of the sets.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    students.append(line)\n\nbest_in = [set() for _ in range(m)]  # each set contains student indices for that subject\n\nfor subject in range(m):\n    max_mark = -1\n    for student_idx in range(n):\n        mark = int(students[student_idx][subject])\n        if mark > max_mark:\n            max_mark = mark\n    # Now, find all students with max_mark in this subject\n    for student_idx in range(n):\n        if int(students[student_idx][subject]) == max_mark:\n            best_in[subject].add(student_idx)\n\n# Now, for each student, check if they are in any best_in[subject]\ncount = 0\nfor student_idx in range(n):\n    for subject in range(m):\n        if student_idx in best_in[subject]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nSo, students are:\n\nStudent 0: '223' → subjects 0:2, 1:2, 2:3\n\nStudent 1: '232' → 2,3,2\n\nStudent 2: '112' → 1,1,2\n\nProcessing each subject:\n\nSubject 0:\n\nmarks are 2,2,1 → max is 2.\n\nStudents 0 and 1 have 2 in subject 0 → best_in[0] = {0,1}\n\nSubject 1:\n\nmarks 2,3,1 → max is 3. Only student 1 has 3 → best_in[1]={1}\n\nSubject 2:\n\nmarks 3,2,2 → max is 3. Only student 0 has 3 → best_in[2]={0}\n\nNow, for each student:\n\nStudent 0: in subject 0 and 2 → counts as successful.\n\nStudent 1: in subject 1 → counts.\n\nStudent 2: not in any → total 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSecond sample:\n\n3 5\n\n91728 → student 0: 9,1,7,2,8\n\n11828 → student 1:1,1,8,2,8\n\n11111 → student 2: all 1's\n\nProcess each subject:\n\nSubject 0: 9,1,1 → max 9 → only student 0.\n\nSubject 1:1,1,1 → max 1 → all students have 1.\n\nSo best_in[1] includes all 3.\n\nSubject 2:7,8,1 → max 8 → student 1.\n\nSubject 3:2,2,1 → max 2 → student 0 and 1.\n\nSubject4:8,8,1 → max 8 → students 0 and 1.\n\nSo for each student:\n\nStudent 0: in subject 0, 3,4 → counts.\n\nStudent 1: in subject1, 2,4 → counts.\n\nStudent2: in subject1 → counts.\n\nSo total 3, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the logic seems solid.\n\nNow, potential edge cases:\n\nWhat if all students have the same mark in a subject?\n\nE.g., n=2, m=1.\n\nStudent 0: 5.\n\nStudent 1:5.\n\nThen, in subject 0, both are best, since no one has a higher mark.\n\nSo both are successful.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. Then the student is successful.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStudent0: 55.\n\nStudent1: 22.\n\nIn each subject, student0 has 5 and 5, which are higher than 2 and 2.\n\nSo student0 is the best in both, thus counted once.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=4, m=2.\n\nAll students have 9 in subject0 and 9 in subject1.\n\nThen, each student is best in both subjects. So all 4 are counted.\n\nWait, no. Because for each subject, the max is 9, which is achieved by all. So each student is best in both subjects. So all are successful.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code handles this.\n\nAnother edge case: m=0? But according to the constraints, m is at least 1, so no.\n\nWhat about n=0? Also, according to constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nWait, the input is given as a single string, perhaps? Or in the example, the input is given as ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', ...], but in reality, the program reads from stdin. So perhaps in the actual code, I can read the first line as n and m.\n\nBut in the code, the way to read it is via input(). So for each line, we can process it.\n\nWait, the initial problem says the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a row are not separated by spaces.\n\nSo each of the next n lines is a string of length m, consisting of digits.\n\nSo, the code can read the first line as n, m.\n\nThen, read n lines, stripping any whitespace, and process each.\n\nWait, but sometimes, after reading via input(), you might get extra newlines or something. So perhaps better to use .strip().\n\nSo in code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nstudents = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen proceed as before.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code structure is as I outlined earlier.\n\nPotential issues: handling large n and m. But since the constraints are up to 100, it's manageable.\n\nTime complexity: for each of m subjects, for each student, checking their mark. So O(m*n) for each subject, leading to O(m^2 *n). Since m and n are up to 100, that's 10^6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1.\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n5\n\nOutput: 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2.\n\nLines:\n\n55\n\n22\n\nEach student is best in both subjects.\n\nSo output is 2.\n\nWait, no. For subject0, both have 5 and 5. So both are best. Same for subject1. So each student is best in both. So both are successful.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2.\n\nLine1: 99\n\nLine2: 91\n\nIn subject0: 9 vs9 → both are best.\n\nIn subject1:9 vs1 → only line1 is best.\n\nSo for student0: is best in subject0 and 1 → counts.\n\nStudent1: best in none except subject0.\n\nSo total 2 (student0 and student1 are both best in subject0, but for the problem, each student is counted if they are best in any subject.)\n\nWait, student1 is not best in any subject because in subject1, his mark is 1, which is less than 9.\n\nWait no: in subject0, both are best. So student1 is best in subject0.\n\nSo in this case, both are considered successful.\n\nSo output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code correctly counts them.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, m=2.\n\nLines:\n\n98\n\n87\n\n76\n\nSubject0: 9,8,7 → max 9 → only student0.\n\nSubject1:8,7,6 → max 8 → only student0.\n\nSo only student0 is successful.\n\nThus, output is 1.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nI think this covers the necessary cases.\n\nSo the final code is as written earlier.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** We start by reading the number of students `n` and the number of subjects `m`. Each student's marks are provided as a string of `m` characters.\n2. **Tracking Best Students per Subject:** For each subject, we determine which students have the highest mark. These students are considered the best in that subject.\n3. **Checking Success:** For each student, we check if they are the best in any subject. If they are, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Efficiency:** The approach efficiently processes each subject and checks each student's performance, ensuring it handles the constraints effectively.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nbest_in = [set() for _ in range(m)]\n\nfor subject in range(m):\n    max_mark = -1\n    for student_idx in range(n):\n        mark = int(students[student_idx][subject])\n        if mark > max_mark:\n            max_mark = mark\n    # Collect all students with max_mark in this subject\n    for student_idx in range(n):\n        if int(students[student_idx][subject]) == max_mark:\n            best_in[subject].add(student_idx)\n\ncount = 0\nfor student_idx in range(n):\n    for subject in range(m):\n        if student_idx in best_in[subject]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The first line of input is parsed to get `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). The subsequent lines are read into a list of strings representing each student's marks.\n2. **Tracking Best Students:** For each subject, we iterate through each student to find the maximum mark. We then collect all students who achieved this maximum mark in that subject.\n3. **Checking Success:** Each student is checked against the sets of best students for each subject. If a student is found in any of these sets, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Output Result:** The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the number of successful students by leveraging sets to track the best performers in each subject and checking each student's eligibility across all subjects.",
