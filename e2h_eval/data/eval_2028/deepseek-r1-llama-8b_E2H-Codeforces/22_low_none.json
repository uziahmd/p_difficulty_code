After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about determining the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. Hmm.\n\nSo, each student has marks for m subjects. A student is considered the best at a subject if no one else has a higher mark for that subject. And a student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. My task is to find out how many such students there are.\n\nLet me think about the input. The first line gives n and m. Then there are n lines, each representing a student's grades. Each line has m characters, which are digits from 1-9. Oh right, each character represents the mark for a specific subject. So for example, if a line is '223', then for the first subject, the student got 2, second 2, third 3.\n\nWait, but the way the input is given is a bit tricky. For example, the sample input shows something like '3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112'. So each student's data is a string of m characters, without any separators. So for each student, the string is directly the concatenation of their marks for each subject.\n\nSo the first step is to read the input correctly. For each student, I'll need to process their marks into an array or list where each element is the mark for a subject.\n\nOnce I have the marks for each student, I need to determine for each subject who the best student is. Then, for each student, check if they are the best in any subject.\n\nBut how do I compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read all the student data. For each student, I can represent their marks as a list of integers. For example, the string '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n\nThen, for each subject (from 0 to m-1), I need to find the maximum mark across all students. The student(s) with this maximum mark are the best for that subject.\n\nWait, but since each subject is independent, for each subject, I can scan all students' marks and find the maximum. Then, any student who has that maximum mark in their own subject's marks is a candidate for being the best in that subject.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n2. For each of the n students:\n   a. Read their marks string.\n   b. Convert it into a list of integers (each character is converted to int).\n   c. Store this list as part of a list of students.\n3. For each subject index (from 0 to m-1):\n   a. Find the maximum mark in that subject across all students.\n   b. Collect all students who have this maximum mark in that subject.\n4. For each student, check if they are present in any of the best lists (for any subject). If yes, count them as successful.\n5. The total count is the answer.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nI can create a list called 'subjects_best' where each entry is a list of student indexes (or the student objects) who are best in that subject.\n\nAlternatively, for each subject, we can iterate through all students and record the max and the students achieving it.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, read each student's string and convert it into a list of integers.\n\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    s = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in s]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nNext, for each subject, find the best students.\n\nsubject_best = [[] for _ in range(m)]  # each subject has a list of students who are best\n\nfor subject in range(m):\n    max_mark = -1\n    for student in students:\n        if student[subject] > max_mark:\n            max_mark = student[subject]\n    # Now find all students with max_mark in this subject\n    for i, student in enumerate(students):\n        if student[subject] == max_mark:\n            subject_best[subject].append(i)\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, the indexes are 0-based? Because in the loop, i goes from 0 to n-1.\n\nYes, because each student is stored in order.\n\nSo, for each subject, collect all the students who have the maximum in that subject.\n\nOnce we have subject_best filled, the next step is to count how many students are in at least one of these lists.\n\nWe can create a set of student indices who are successful.\n\nsuccessful_students = set()\n\nfor i, student in enumerate(students):\n    for subject in range(m):\n        if i in subject_best[subject]:\n            successful_students.add(i)\n            break  # no need to check other subjects\n\nThe size",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark for that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the number of students `n` and the number of subjects `m`. Then read each student's grades.\n2. **Convert Grades**: Convert each student's grades string into a list of integers for easier manipulation.\n3. **Identify Best Students per Subject**: For each subject, determine the highest mark achieved by any student. Collect all students who achieved this highest mark for that subject.\n4. **Count Successful Students**: Check each student to see if they are among the best in any subject. If they are, count them as successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    s = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in s]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nsubject_best = [[] for _ in range(m)]\nfor subject in range(m):\n    max_mark = -1\n    for i, student in enumerate(students):\n        if student[subject] > max_mark:\n            max_mark = student[subject]\n    for i, student in enumerate(students):\n        if student[subject] == max_mark:\n            subject_best[subject].append(i)\n\nsuccessful = set()\nfor i in range(n):\n    for sbj in range(m):\n        if i in subject_best[sbj]:\n            successful.add(i)\n            break\n\nprint(len(successful))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). Each subsequent line represents a student's grades as a string.\n2. **Converting Grades**: Each student's grades string is converted into a list of integers. This allows us to easily access individual subject marks.\n3. **Finding Best Students**: For each subject, iterate through all students to find the maximum mark. Then, collect all students who achieved this maximum mark for that subject.\n4. **Counting Successes**: Using a set to track successful students, check each student against the best students for each subject. If a student is found in any of these lists, they are marked as successful.\n5. **Output Result**: The size of the set gives the number of successful students, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines successful students by leveraging sets for quick lookups and iterating through subjects to find the best performers.",
