    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about finding the number of positive integers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeros. And then I have to output all those n's in increasing order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n, because there are usually more 2s than 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is sum of n divided by 5, plus n divided by 25, and so on until n divided by 5^k is zero.\n\nSo, for example, for n=5: 5//5 =1, 5//25=0. So total 1 zero. For n=6, same as 5, because 6//5 is 1, 6//25 is 0. So 1 zero. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 5! is 120, which has one zero. 6! is 720, which also has one zero. Oh right, because 6 doesn't contribute another 5. So how does it increase? Like, for 10, we have 10//5 =2, 10//25=0, so two zeros. Then 15 would have 3, etc.\n\nWait, but wait: 24! has how many zeros? Let's calculate. 24 /5=4, 24/25=0. So 4 zeros. Then 25! adds 6 (because 25 is 5*5, so adding another 1). So 25! has 4+1=6 zeros. So yeah, each multiple of 5 contributes at least one, and each multiple of 25 contributes an extra, and so on.\n\nSo the function to compute the number of trailing zeros given n is straightforward. Now, the problem is the inverse: given m, find all n where trailing_zeros(n) equals m.\n\nBut how do I find the n(s) that give exactly m trailing zeros?\n\nI think binary search could be used here. Because the number of trailing zeros is a monotonically non-decreasing function as n increases. So for a given m, there might be a range of n's that all have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nWait, but wait: let's think. For example, when m=5, looking at the sample input, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. So five numbers. Each of these has exactly 5 trailing zeros.\n\nWait, why does 9 have 5 trailing zeros? Let me check:\n\nCompute trailing zeros for 9: 9//5=1, 9//25=0. So 1. That's not 5. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample input. Oh wait, the sample input says m is 1 and 5. Let me check.\n\nIn the first sample input, the output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. So for m=1, the output is 5, but for m=5, it's 0. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the inputs.\n\nWait, the sample input is ['1', '5'], which means m is 1 and 5. The output is two lines. The first line is 5 followed by the numbers 5,6,7,8,9. The second line is 0.\n\nWait, so for m=1, the output is 5 numbers, which makes sense. Because 5! has one zero, 6! also has one, but wait, no—wait, 5! is 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1 zero), 7! is 5040 (1 zero), 8! is 40320 (1 zero), 9! is 362880 (1 zero). Wait, so 5 to 9 all have 1 zero? That can't be right. Because 10! is 3628800, which has two zeros. So for m=1, the possible n's are from 5 to 9 inclusive, which is 5 numbers.\n\nAh, right. So for m=5, the output is 0, meaning there are no n's whose factorial has exactly 5 trailing zeros.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for a given m, find all n such that trailing_zeros(n) = m. We need to output the count and the list of n's.\n\nSo the approach is to find the minimal n where trailing_zeros(n) >= m, and then find the maximal n where trailing_zeros(n) <= m. Wait, no, perhaps more precise: find the lower bound and upper bound where the count is exactly m.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to find the smallest n where the trailing zeros is m, and then find the largest n where the trailing zeros is m. Then the count is the difference between them plus one, and the numbers are from lower to upper.\n\nBut wait, sometimes there may be no such n. For example, if m is 5, perhaps there's no n where trailing_zeros(n) is exactly 5.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimal n_min such that trailing_zeros(n_min) == m.\n\n2. Find the maximal n_max such that trailing_zeros(n_max) == m.\n\n3. If n_min > n_max, then there are zero numbers. Else, the count is n_max - n_min + 1.\n\n4. Collect all n from n_min to n_max inclusive.\n\nSo the main task is to find for a given m, the range of n's where trailing_zeros(n) = m.\n\nHow to find n_min and n_max efficiently?\n\nI think binary search is the way to go.\n\nFor n_min: we can perform a binary search to find the smallest n where trailing_zeros(n) >= m. But wait, no. Because trailing_zeros is a non-decreasing function. So for some m, the minimal n where trailing_zeros(n) >= m may have trailing_zeros(n) larger than m. So that won't directly help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should find the lower bound and upper bound where trailing_zeros is exactly m.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to find the first occurrence of m in the trailing_zeros function and the last occurrence.\n\nLet me think: for a given m, find the smallest n where trailing_zeros(n) = m, and the largest such n.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the minimal n where trailing_zeros(n) >= m, and then check if it is exactly m. If it is, then perhaps the next numbers up to some point will also have m zeros.\n\nWait, maybe for a given m, the numbers n that have exactly m trailing zeros form a consecutive range. So once you find the first n where trailing_zeros(n) is m, the next numbers will also have m until you hit a multiple of 5 again, which increases the count.\n\nSo perhaps the process is:\n\n- Find the lower bound where trailing_zeros(n) = m.\n\n- Then find the upper bound where trailing_zeros(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find these bounds.\n\nAlternatively, I can use binary search to find the minimal n where trailing_zeros(n) >= m, and see if it's equal to m. Similarly, find the maximum n where trailing_zeros(n) <= m, and see if it's equal to m.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to find the minimal n where trailing_zeros(n) >= m, then check if that n gives exactly m. Then, the minimal n is the first occurrence of m. Similarly, find the maximal n where trailing_zeros(n) <= m, and check if it's exactly m.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the structure of the function f(n) = trailing_zeros(n).\n\nf(n) increases by 1 each time n crosses a multiple of 5, 25, 125, etc.\n\nSo for n in [5, 9], f(n) =1.\n\nn=10: f(n)=2.\n\nn=14: f(14) = 2 (since 14//5=2, 14//25=0).\n\nn=15: 15//5=3, 15//25=0. So f(15)=3.\n\nSo for m=2, the numbers n=10,11,12,13,14 all have f(n)=2. So the count is 5.\n\nSo the idea is that for a given m, the possible n's form a continuous interval. So to find all n's where f(n) = m, we can find the first n where f(n) =m, then find the last n where f(n)=m.\n\nOnce I have the first and last, the count is last - first +1.\n\nSo how to find the first and last n for a given m.\n\nSo to find the first n where f(n) =m:\n\nWe can perform a binary search between low and high.\n\nThe function f(n) is non-decreasing, so binary search is feasible.\n\nSimilarly for the last n.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps for the first occurrence:\n\nWe can search for the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\nOnce found, check if f(n) is exactly m. If yes, then that's the first occurrence. If not, then there's no solution.\n\nWait, no. Because if n is the first occurrence where f(n)>=m, but f(n) is larger than m, then there's no n where f(n) is exactly m.\n\nLike in the sample input, when m=5, the output is 0.\n\nSo, for example, when m=5, we need to find whether any n exists such that f(n) =5.\n\nWhat's f(n) for some n around that.\n\nLet me compute f(n) for n=25: 25//5=5, 25//25=1. So total 6. So 25 gives 6 zeros.\n\nWait, so what's the value of f(n) for n=24? 24//5=4, 24//25=0. So 4.\n\nSo between 24 and 25, f(n) jumps from 4 to 6. So m=5 is skipped. Hence, no n has exactly 5 trailing zeros.\n\nSo for m=5, the output is 0.\n\nSo how to detect that.\n\nThus, for a given m, the process is:\n\n1. Check if m is achievable. How? Well, we can find the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\nIf f(n) is larger than m, then no solution exists.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nSo the steps for a given m:\n\na. Compute the lower bound: find the smallest n where f(n) >= m.\n\nb. Compute the upper bound: find the largest n where f(n) <= m.\n\nc. Check if f(lower_bound) == m. If not, return 0.\n\nd. Else, find the upper_bound as the maximum n where f(n) ==m.\n\nThen, the count is upper_bound - lower_bound +1.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nImplement a helper function to compute f(n).\n\nImplement a binary search to find the lower and upper bounds.\n\nWait, but how to find the upper bound.\n\nWait, for upper bound, since f(n) increases, the maximum n where f(n) =m is the maximum n such that f(n) <=m.\n\nWait, no. Because after lower_bound, the f(n) remains m until some higher n is reached.\n\nWait, perhaps the upper_bound is the minimal n where f(n) >m.\n\nSo the upper_bound is the first n where f(n) >m.\n\nWait, but no, because for n=9, f(n)=1. Then n=10, f(n)=2. So for m=1, the upper_bound is 9, because f(9)=1, and f(10)=2>m=1.\n\nSo the upper_bound for m=1 is 9.\n\nSo to find the upper_bound, we can find the minimal n where f(n) >m, then subtract 1.\n\nBut wait, what if m=0? Well, according to the problem statement, m starts at 1, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor a given m:\n\n- Use binary search to find the minimal n_low where f(n_low) >= m.\n\n   If f(n_low) != m, then output 0.\n\n- Else, find the minimal n_high where f(n_high) > m.\n\n   Then the upper_bound is n_high -1.\n\nSo the n's are from n_low to upper_bound.\n\nBut wait, what if n_low is the only n that satisfies f(n) =m? Then upper_bound is n_low.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\nif f(n_low) != m: return 0\n\nelse:\n\n   find n_high as the first n where f(n) >m.\n\n   upper_bound = n_high -1\n\n   count = upper_bound - n_low +1\n\n   if count <0: count =0\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, for the binary search part.\n\nImplementing the binary search for the minimal n where f(n) >=m.\n\nAnd then another binary search for the minimal n where f(n) >m.\n\nWait, but for the second part, perhaps it's more efficient to just compute the upper_bound as the maximum n where f(n) <=m, but that seems similar.\n\nAlternatively, since f(n) is non-decreasing, the set of n's where f(n)=m is a contiguous interval. So, the first occurrence is the lower_bound, and the last occurrence is upper_bound.\n\nThus, the code steps are:\n\nFunction to compute trailing zeros:\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n\n    count =0\n\n    while n>0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nThen, for a given m:\n\nleft=0, right= ... some upper limit.\n\nBut what's the upper limit for binary search? Since for n, the number of trailing zeros increases roughly as n/4 (since 5^k grows quickly). So for m up to 1e5, n can be up to 5*m. Or even 5*m*4.\n\nSo setting right as something like 5*(m+1)*5 is overkill, but acceptable.\n\nWait, actually, for m=1e5, the minimal n_low would be somewhere around 5e5 or more.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to find an initial right for binary search.\n\nWe can start with right=5*m, but perhaps 5*m is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, for m=1e5, the minimal n is around 5e5, but 5e5 is manageable.\n\nSo, the binary search for n_low:\n\nlow=0, high=5*m.\n\nWhile low < high:\n\n   mid = (low + high)//2\n\n   if f(mid) >= m:\n\n       high=mid\n\n   else:\n\n       low=mid+1\n\nAfter the loop, low is the minimal n where f(n)>=m.\n\nThen, check if f(low) ==m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, find the upper_bound.\n\nFor upper_bound:\n\nWe need the minimal n where f(n)>m.\n\nSo, again, binary search.\n\nlow=low, high=some big number.\n\nWait, perhaps high can be 5*(m+1).\n\nWait, but perhaps a better way is to set high to low*5, but that's probably overkill.\n\nAlternatively, for the upper_bound, the maximum n that can be considered is low + 5* (since adding 5 will increase the count by 1, possibly more).\n\nWait, perhaps we can use a binary search between low and 5*(m+1), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can set high initially as low *5, which would cover cases where adding 5 multiples may cause a jump.\n\nSo, for the upper_bound binary search:\n\nlow=low\n\nhigh=low *5\n\nwhile low < high:\n\n   mid=(low + high)//2\n\n   if f(mid) >m:\n\n       high=mid\n\n   else:\n\n       low=mid+1\n\nAt the end, high is the minimal n where f(n) >m.\n\nSo upper_bound is high-1.\n\nSo the numbers are from low to high-1.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_low via binary search.\n\nIf f(n_low) !=m, output 0.\n\nElse, compute n_high via binary search as the first n where f(n) >m.\n\nupper_bound =n_high -1.\n\ncount = upper_bound -n_low +1.\n\nIf count is negative, output 0.\n\nElse, output count and the list of numbers.\n\nWait, but for the case where n_low is 5, and n_high is 10, then the upper_bound is 9, which is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nm=1.\n\nCompute n_low: find minimal n where f(n)>=1.\n\nCheck f(0)=0, f(5)=1.\n\nSo n_low is 5.\n\nCheck f(5)=1==m: yes.\n\nThen compute n_high: minimal n where f(n)>1.\n\nWhat's f(9)=1, f(10)=2>1.\n\nSo n_high is 10.\n\nupper_bound=10-1=9.\n\ncount=9-5+1=5.\n\nSo output is 5, followed by 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nFind n_low: minimal n where f(n)>=5.\n\nCompute f(20): 20//5=4, 20//25=0. So 4.\n\nf(21)=4, f(22)=4, f(23)=4, f(24)=4, f(25)=6.\n\nSo the minimal n where f(n)>=5 is 25.\n\nCheck f(25)=6 !=5. So output is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nn_low is 10, since f(10)=2.\n\nCheck f(10)=2==m: yes.\n\nCompute n_high: minimal n where f(n)>2.\n\nf(14)=2, f(15)=3>2.\n\nSo n_high is 15.\n\nupper_bound=14.\n\ncount=14-10+1=5.\n\nSo the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. It's given as a single integer, but in the sample, it's given as a list, perhaps due to handling multiple test cases. But in this problem, it's a single m.\n\nWait, the input is a single integer m, but in the sample, the input is given as ['1', '5'], which suggests that perhaps the input is taken as a list of strings. But in the problem statement, the input is \"the only line of input contains an integer m\".\n\nWait, perhaps the input is a single string, perhaps with leading/trailing spaces, but in code, we can read it as m=int(input().strip()).\n\nSo in code:\n\nm = int(input().strip())\n\nThen, implement the helper function.\n\nBut in Python, functions are easy.\n\nSo define count_trailing_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nNow, implement the binary search for n_low.\n\nSet low=0, high=5*m.\n\nBut wait, what if m is 1e5? 5*1e5 is 500,000. Which is manageable.\n\nSo:\n\nlow =0\n\nhigh=5*m\n\nwhile low < high:\n\n    mid = (low + high) //2\n\n    if count_trailing_zeros(mid) >= m:\n\n        high=mid\n\n    else:\n\n        low=mid +1\n\nn_low = low\n\nif count_trailing_zeros(n_low) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    # find n_high\n\n    # Binary search for minimal n where count_trailing_zeros(n) >m\n\n    low_high = n_low\n\n    high_high = n_low *5  # arbitrary, but should cover.\n\n    while low_high < high_high:\n\n        mid = (low_high + high_high) //2\n\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) >m:\n\n            high_high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low_high = mid +1\n\n    n_high = high_high\n\n    upper_bound =n_high -1\n\n    count = upper_bound -n_low +1\n\n    if count <0:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        print(count)\n\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, upper_bound+1))))\n\nWait, but wait: in the else clause, after checking n_low, we proceed to find n_high.\n\nBut in the binary search for n_high, it's possible that n_high is beyond the necessary, but the code should handle it.\n\nTesting the sample case:\n\nm=1.\n\nn_low=5.\n\nn_high found as 10.\n\nupper_bound=9.\n\ncount=5.\n\noutput is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nn_low=25, but f(25)=6!=5. So output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nn_low is 25, f(25)=6 ==m.\n\nThen, find n_high as the first n where f(n)>6.\n\nf(29)=29//5=5, 29//25=1, 5+1=6.\n\nf(30)=30//5=6, 30//25=1, 6+1=7>6.\n\nSo n_high is 30.\n\nupper_bound=29.\n\ncount=29-25+1=5.\n\nNumbers 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nYes, because 25! has 6 zeros, 26! same, etc., until 29!.\n\nSo code should output 5, followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\nm=0: but according to the problem statement, m starts at 1, so no need.\n\nAnother edge case: m=1, but perhaps n_low=5, and n_high=10, but what if 5 is the only n?\n\nNo, 5,6,7,8,9 all have 1 zero.\n\nAnother case: m=0, but according to problem statement, m is at least 1.\n\nNow, in code, what if m is very large, say 1e5. How does the binary search handle that?\n\nIt should be fine, as the number of steps is logarithmic.\n\nSo, now writing the code.\n\nAlso, note that the output for k=0 is just 0, without any space.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nSo, the code will read m, compute n_low, check if it's valid, then compute n_high, compute upper_bound, then output the count and the numbers.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_low via binary search.\n\nIf invalid, print 0.\n\nElse, compute n_high via binary search.\n\nCompute upper_bound =n_high-1.\n\nCompute count = upper_bound -n_low +1.\n\nIf count is zero, print 0.\n\nElse, print count, followed by the numbers.\n\nWait, but in code, after computing count, if count is negative, which can happen if n_high is less than n_low, but that shouldn't happen because n_high is found correctly.\n\nBut to be safe.\n\nSo, now, code:\n\nm = int(input().strip())\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count =0\n    while n>0:\n        n = n//5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nlow =0\nhigh=5*m\n\nn_low=0\nwhile low < high:\n    mid = (low + high)//2\n    tz = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n    if tz >=m:\n        high=mid\n    else:\n        low=mid+1\nn_low = low\nif count_trailing_zeros(n_low)!=m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Find n_high\n    low_high =n_low\n    high_high =n_low *5\n\n    while low_high < high_high:\n        mid = (low_high + high_high)//2\n        tz = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if tz >m:\n            high_high = mid\n        else:\n            low_high = mid +1\n    n_high = high_high\n    upper_bound =n_high -1\n    count = upper_bound -n_low +1\n    if count <0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print(count)\n        if count ==0:\n            print()\n        else:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, upper_bound+1))))\nWait, but in the else clause, when count is zero, we still need to print 0.\n\nWait, no. Because in the condition above, if count is negative, we print 0. But count can be zero if, for example, n_high is n_low, and upper_bound is n_low -1, which would make count negative.\n\nWait, but let's think.\n\nSuppose m=6.\n\nn_low=25.\n\nn_high is 30.\n\nupper_bound=29.\n\ncount=29-25+1=5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: m=7.\n\nn_low is 30, because f(30)=7.\n\nn_high is 35? Or let's compute.\n\nWait, f(34)=34//5=6, 34//25=1, 6+1=7.\n\nf(35)=35//5=7, 35//25=1, 7+1=8.\n\nSo n_high is 35.\n\nupper_bound=34.\n\ncount=34-30+1=5.\n\nNumbers 30,31,32,33,34.\n\nEach has 7 zeros.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: m=3.\n\nn_low is 15, since f(15)=3.\n\nn_high is 20, because f(20)=4>3.\n\nupper_bound=19.\n\ncount=19-15+1=5.\n\nSo numbers 15-19 have 3 zeros.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, after printing count, if count is zero, it prints a blank line. But in the sample input, when m=5, the output is 0, and nothing else.\n\nWait, no. In the sample input, for m=5, the output is 0. So the code, for count=0, should print 0.\n\nWait, in the code, when count is zero, it will execute:\n\nprint(0)\n\nBecause in the code:\n\nif count <0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nElse:\n\n   print(count)\n\n   ... \n\nSo in the case where count is zero, it will print 0, and then the numbers. Wait, no.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nIn the else clause:\n\nif count <0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   print(count)\n\n   if count ==0:\n\n       print()\n\n   else:\n\n       print(...)\n\nWait, no. Wait, the code after 'else:' is:\n\nprint(count)\n\nif count ==0:\n\n    print()\n\nelse:\n\n    print('...')\n\nWait, no. No, looking back:\n\nAfter:\n\nif count <0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    print(count)\n\n    if count ==0:\n\n        print()\n\n    else:\n\n        print(' '.join(...))\n\nWait, no, the code inside else is:\n\nprint(count)\n\nif count ==0:\n\n    print()  # which is a blank line.\n\nelse:\n\n    print(' '.join(...))\n\nSo, for count=0, it will print 0, then a blank line.\n\nWhich is incorrect.\n\nBecause in the sample input, when m=5, the output is 0, not 0 followed by a blank line.\n\nSo the code needs to be adjusted.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the code.\n\nLooking back, in the code, after:\n\nelse:\n\n    print(count)\n\n    if count ==0:\n\n        print()\n\n    else:\n\n        print(' '.join(...))\n\nWait, no. The code is:\n\nif count <0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    print(count)\n\n    if count ==0:\n\n        print()\n\n    else:\n\n        print(' '.join(map(str, ...)))\n\nSo, for count=0, it will print 0, then a new line (print()), which is incorrect.\n\nWait, but when count is zero, it's because upper_bound <n_low, which shouldn't happen because n_high is found as the first n where f(n) >m.\n\nWait, but when can count be zero?\n\nOnly when upper_bound <n_low.\n\nWhich would imply that the initial n_low is such that f(n_low) =m, but upper_bound is n_low -1.\n\nWhich would mean that n_low is the only n where f(n)=m.\n\nBut that's impossible because, for example, if m=6, n_low is 25, and n_high is 30, upper_bound is 29. count is 5.\n\nSo when can count be zero?\n\nOnly if upper_bound <n_low.\n\nWhich would happen if n_high is n_low.\n\nBecause upper_bound is n_high-1.\n\nSo, for example, suppose n_high is n_low.\n\nThen upper_bound =n_low -1.\n\ncount= n_low-1 -n_low +1 =0.\n\nWhich would be if n_low is the only n where f(n)=m.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nWait, can there be only one n where f(n)=m?\n\nYes, for example, m=4.\n\nWait, let's compute f(n) for n=24,25.\n\nn=24: 24//5=4, 24//25=0. So 4.\n\nn=25: 25//5=5, 25//25=1. So 6.\n\nSo between 24 and 25, f(n) jumps from 4 to 6.\n\nSo m=5 is skipped.\n\nBut what about m=4.\n\nn=24:4, n=25:6.\n\nSo the only n where f(n)=4 is 24.\n\nSo for m=4, the output is 1, followed by 24.\n\nSo in this case, n_low=24, n_high=25, upper_bound=24.\n\ncount=24-24+1=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code would handle this.\n\nBut in this case, the code would print count=1, then print 24.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut what about if m is such that n_high is equal to n_low.\n\nWhich would imply that upper_bound is n_low-1.\n\nWhich is only possible if n_high is n_low.\n\nWhich would require that f(n_low) >m.\n\nBut earlier, in the code, we have checked that f(n_low) ==m.\n\nSo in that case, count cannot be zero.\n\nThus, the code's condition 'if count<0' is redundant, but it's kept for safety.\n\nWait, but when can count be negative?\n\nIt can't. Because count is upper_bound -n_low +1.\n\nIf upper_bound >=n_low, then count is >=0.\n\nElse, count is negative.\n\nBut in our code, upper_bound can't be less than n_low.\n\nBecause n_high is the first n where f(n) >m.\n\nThus, upper_bound =n_high-1.\n\nWhich is >=n_low.\n\nBecause n_high is >=n_low.\n\nThus, count is upper_bound -n_low +1 >=0.\n\nSo the condition 'if count <0' can be removed.\n\nThus, the code can be adjusted.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif count <0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    print(count)\n\n    if count ==0:\n\n        print()\n\n    else:\n\n        print(' '.join(...))\n\nBut in reality, count can't be zero unless the initial condition is wrong.\n\nWait, no. Because if m=4, count is 1.\n\nIf m=5, count is 0.\n\nWait, no, in m=5, the code returns 0.\n\nSo, perhaps the code is correct.\n\nBut perhaps the 'if count <0' can be removed.\n\nBut in any case, the code should work.\n\nNow, testing for m=4.\n\nn_low=24, f(24)=4.\n\nn_high is 25.\n\nupper_bound=24.\n\ncount=24-24+1=1.\n\nThus, the code outputs 1 followed by 24.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nn_low=25, f(25)=6.\n\nn_high=30.\n\nupper_bound=29.\n\ncount=5.\n\nThus, 5 numbers.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo the final code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list all such integers in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are typically more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{count\\_trailing\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division result is zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently find the range of \\( n \\) values that produce exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros, we use binary search:\n   - **Lower Bound**: Find the smallest \\( n \\) (let's call it `n_low`) where the count of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\).\n   - **Upper Bound**: Find the smallest \\( n \\) (let's call it `n_high`) where the count of trailing zeros exceeds \\( m \\). The upper bound for our range is then `n_high - 1`.\n\n3. **Check Validity**: After determining `n_low` and `n_high`, we check if `n_low` actually produces exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. If not, there are no valid \\( n \\) values.\n\n4. **Count and List Valid Values**: If valid, the range of \\( n \\) values that produce exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros is from `n_low` to `n_high - 1`. The count of these values is calculated, and they are listed in increasing order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nm = int(input().strip())\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nlow = 0\nhigh = 5 * m\n\n# Find the lower bound where count >= m\nn_low = 0\nwhile low < high:\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n    tz = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n    if tz >= m:\n        high = mid\n    else:\n        low = mid + 1\nn_low = low\n\nif count_trailing_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Find the upper bound where count > m\n    low_high = n_low\n    high_high = n_low * 5  # Initial estimate for upper bound\n\n    while low_high < high_high:\n        mid = (low_high + high_high) // 2\n        tz = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if tz > m:\n            high_high = mid\n        else:\n            low_high = mid + 1\n    n_high = high_high\n    upper_bound = n_high - 1\n    count = upper_bound - n_low + 1\n\n    print(count)\n    if count == 0:\n        print()\n    else:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, upper_bound + 1))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer \\( m \\).\n2. **Helper Function**: `count_trailing_zeros(n)` computes the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\).\n3. **Binary Search for Lower Bound**: We perform a binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) where the trailing zeros count is at least \\( m \\).\n4. **Validity Check**: If the computed lower bound does not exactly match \\( m \\), we output 0.\n5. **Binary Search for Upper Bound**: Another binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) where the trailing zeros count exceeds \\( m \\). The upper limit is adjusted accordingly.\n6. **Output**: The count and list of valid \\( n \\) values are printed. If no valid values exist, 0 is printed.",
