    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Neko does Maths\" and the task is to find a non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple (LCM) of a+k and b+k is as small as possible. If there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, I have to choose the smallest one.\n\nHmm. So, given two integers a and b, I need to compute this k. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem with some examples. Like the sample input: 6 and 10. When k=2, 6+2=8 and 10+2=12. The LCM is 24. But why is that the best? Let's see if other k's give a better result.\n\nFor k=0: 6 and 10. LCM is 30.\nk=1: 7 and 11, LCM is 77.\nk=2: 8 and 12, LCM 24.\nk=3: 9 and 13, LCM 117.\nSo yes, 24 is the smallest here.\n\nAnother sample is when a=5 and b=10. Choosing k=0 gives 5 and 10, LCM is 10. That's already pretty good. Because adding any k would increase both numbers, but their GCD might decrease or not.\n\nWait, wait. So maybe the optimal k is such that the two numbers a+k and b+k have the maximum possible GCD. Because LCM(a+b) = (a + b) * GCD / something. Wait, no, more accurately, LCM(x, y) = (x * y) / GCD(x, y). So, for fixed x and y, a larger GCD reduces the LCM. So to minimize the LCM, we need to maximize the GCD of a+k and b+k.\n\nWait, right! So, the problem reduces to finding k such that the GCD of (a + k) and (b + k) is as large as possible. Because then, their LCM will be minimized.\n\nBut wait, because the LCM is (a + k)(b + k)/GCD(a + k, b + k), so higher GCD reduces the LCM. So yes, maximizing the GCD will minimize the LCM.\n\nBut how do we find the k that maximizes this GCD?\n\nLet me think about the difference between a and b. Let d = |a - b|. Because when we add k to both a and b, the difference remains the same. So, the GCD of (a + k) and (b + k) is the same as the GCD of (a + k) and (a + k - (b + k)) which is the same as GCD(a +k, d).\n\nWait, that's a key insight. Because (a +k) and (b +k) can be thought of as two numbers where their difference is d. So the GCD of the two numbers is equal to the GCD of (a +k) and d.\n\nSo, to maximize the GCD, we want (a +k) to share as many factors as possible with d.\n\nHmm, but since d is fixed, perhaps the maximum possible GCD is a divisor of d. So the optimal k is such that (a +k) is a multiple of a certain divisor of d, which could be d itself.\n\nWait, but (a +k) could be any number. So, the maximum possible GCD is the maximum divisor of d that divides (a +k). So, perhaps the way to proceed is to find all divisors of d and see which one gives the maximum possible GCD.\n\nWait, but d could be zero? No, because a and b are given, but in the problem statement, a and b can be up to 1e9, but they might be equal. Wait, if a equals b, then d is zero. Then, for any k, a +k and b +k are equal, so their GCD is a +k, which is maximum. So in that case, k is zero, because that's the smallest possible.\n\nSo, the first thing I should do is check if a == b. If yes, then the answer is k=0.\n\nOtherwise, when a != b, d = |a - b|.\n\nNow, the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) is the same as GCD(a +k, d). So, to maximize this GCD, (a +k) must be a multiple of a large divisor of d.\n\nSo, the strategy is to find the largest possible divisor g of d such that (a +k) is a multiple of g. Because then, the GCD will be at least g, and possibly higher.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely correct. Because (a +k) can be a multiple of g, but if g is a divisor of d, then the GCD could be up to g. So, the maximum possible GCD is the maximum divisor of d that divides (a +k).\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible GCD is the largest divisor of d that divides (a +k). So, to maximize the GCD, we can try to make (a +k) divisible by as large a divisor of d as possible.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|.\n\n2. If d is zero, return k=0.\n\n3. Else, find all the divisors of d.\n\n4. For each divisor g in the divisors of d (sorted in descending order), check if (a +k) can be made divisible by g. That is, find the smallest k such that (a +k) mod g == 0.\n\nBut wait, since a +k must be divisible by g, then k ≡ (-a) mod g. So, the smallest non-negative k is (g - a % g) % g.\n\nWait, but a can be larger than g. So, (g - a % g) could be negative, but mod g makes it positive.\n\nWait, but how? Let's take an example.\n\nSuppose a is 6, b is 10. So d is 4.\n\nThe divisors of 4 are 1, 2, 4.\n\nWe can process them in reverse order: 4, 2, 1.\n\nFor each g, find the smallest k that makes (6 +k) divisible by g.\n\nFor g=4: 6 +k ≡ 0 mod4 → k ≡ (-6) mod4 → 6 mod4 is 2, so -2 mod4 is 2. So k=2.\n\nThen, the GCD is 4, which is the maximum possible. So that's the best option.\n\nSo the LCM is (6+2)*(10+2)/4 = 8*12/4 = 24, which is the sample.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Find all divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g (starting from the largest down to 1), compute the required k to make a +k divisible by g.\n\n- For each such k, calculate the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k). Since (a +k) and (b +k) have GCD g, their LCM is (a +k)*(b +k)/g.\n\nBut wait, since (a +k) is a multiple of g, and (b +k) is also a multiple of g (because (b +k) = (a +k) + d, and d is a multiple of g?), Wait, no. Wait, d is |a - b|, which is fixed. So, if a +k is a multiple of g, then (a +k) + d is (b +k) → (a +k) +d = (b +k). So, since d is a multiple of g, then (b +k) is (a +k) + (multiple of g) → which is also a multiple of g. So yes, (b +k) is also a multiple of g.\n\nSo, the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) is at least g.\n\nBut wait, could it be larger? Because the actual GCD could be a multiple of g, like 2g, 3g, etc., but that depends on whether (a +k) is a multiple of a higher multiple.\n\nNo, because the maximum possible GCD is the maximum divisor of d that can divide (a +k). So, for each g, which is a divisor of d, the maximum possible GCD is g, because (a +k) is a multiple of g, and d is a multiple of g, but (a +k) may not be a multiple of a larger divisor of d beyond g.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think differently.\n\nThe GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) is the same as GCD(a +k, d). Because (b +k) = (a +k) + d.\n\nSo, for each candidate g, which is a divisor of d, if (a +k) is a multiple of g, then the GCD is at least g. But could it be higher? Well, if (a +k) has a higher common factor with d, but that would require that (a +k) is a multiple of a larger divisor of d.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible GCD is the maximum divisor of d that divides (a +k). So, to get the maximum possible GCD, we need to choose (a +k) to be a multiple of the largest possible divisor of d.\n\nSo, the optimal approach is to consider all divisors of d, sorted in decreasing order. For each divisor g, compute the minimal k needed so that (a +k) is a multiple of g. Then, compute the resulting LCM and choose the k that gives the smallest LCM.\n\nIf there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest k.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|.\n\n2. If d == 0, return k=0.\n\n3. Else, find all the divisors of d, including 1 and d.\n\n4. Sort these divisors in decreasing order.\n\n5. For each divisor g in this order:\n\n   a. Compute the required k to make (a +k) divisible by g. The required k is (g - (a % g)) % g. Because a % g gives the remainder when a is divided by g. So, to make a +k ≡ 0 mod g, k must be (g - (a % g)) mod g. But since k is non-negative, we can compute it as (g - (a % g)) % g.\n\n   b. Compute the current pair: x = a +k, y = b +k. Since x and y are both multiples of g, their GCD is at least g. But perhaps higher.\n\n   c. Calculate the LCM of x and y. Since x and y are (a +k) and (b +k), which are (x) and (x +d), the LCM is (x*(x +d))/g' where g' is the GCD of x and d.\n\n   Wait, but since x is a multiple of g, and d is a multiple of g, then GCD(x, d) is at least g. Hmm, but that's not necessarily the case. Because x could share more factors with d.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the actual GCD of x and d, and use that for the LCM calculation.\n\nSo, for each g, the steps are:\n\n- Compute k = (g - (a % g)) % g.\n\n- Compute x = a +k, y = b +k.\n\n- Compute g_current = GCD(x, d). Because the GCD of x and y is the same as GCD(x, y - x) = GCD(x, d).\n\nWait, no. Because y = x + d, so GCD(x, y) = GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d).\n\nSo, for each g, after computing k, we can compute x and then compute g_current as GCD(x, d). Then, the LCM is (x*y)/(g_current).\n\nBut since x is a multiple of g, and d is a multiple of g, then GCD(x, d) must be at least g. But it could be higher.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, if d is 4 and g is 2. Suppose a is 6, so x becomes 8. d is 4. GCD(8,4) is 4, which is higher than g.\n\nSo, the actual GCD could be higher than g, which complicates things.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach of considering only the divisors of d isn't sufficient because the GCD could be a multiple of g.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Because even though we choose g as a divisor of d, the actual GCD could be higher, thus giving a lower LCM.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach needs to be adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible GCD is the maximum possible divisor of d, but when we select x as a multiple of g, the GCD could be larger than g.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nBecause d is a multiple of g, so d = g * m, where m is some integer.\n\nThen, x is a multiple of g, say x = g * p.\n\nThen, the GCD of x and d is GCD(g*p, g*m) = g * GCD(p, m).\n\nSo, the GCD can be as high as g * m, but that's only if p and m are such that their GCD is m.\n\nWhich would happen if p is a multiple of m.\n\nSo, to maximize the GCD, we can set p to be a multiple of m.\n\nBut that's a bit abstract. Maybe it's better to think that the GCD can be as high as possible, depending on the value of x.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is incomplete because choosing x as a multiple of g may lead to a higher GCD than g, thus leading to a better LCM.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the optimal k is the one that maximizes the GCD(x, d), regardless of whether x is a multiple of a particular g.\n\nBut how to find that efficiently.\n\nHmm. Maybe another way to look at it is that the optimal k is such that x is a multiple of some divisor of d, but perhaps the optimal x is such that x is a multiple of a divisor of d that is as large as possible, but not necessarily just the divisors of d.\n\nWait, but that brings us back to the original problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when x and y are as small as possible, but that's not necessarily true because their product divided by their GCD could vary in non-trivial ways.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nLet me think of another approach.\n\nThe LCM of x and y is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). We need to minimize this.\n\nSince y = x + d, because y = (a +k) + d = (b +k) → because d = |a - b|, but since we're taking absolute value, let's assume d is positive.\n\nWait, no. Wait, a and b could be in any order. So, suppose a <= b. Then, d = b - a.\n\nSo, y = (a +k) + (b - a) = b +k.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the LCM is (x * (x +d)) / g, where g is the GCD of x and d.\n\nSo, our goal is to find x such that x = a +k, and then compute this LCM.\n\nBut how do we find the x that minimizes this expression.\n\nAn alternative approach: perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when x is the minimal possible x that is a multiple of some divisor of d.\n\nWait, but again, I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal LCM is achieved when x is the minimal possible x that is a multiple of the largest possible divisor of d, but perhaps that's not always the case.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, let's take another sample input.\n\nSample Input 3 is 5 10. So, a=5, b=10, d=5.\n\nDivisors of 5 are 1,5.\n\nProcessing in reverse order: 5, 1.\n\nFor g=5:\n\nk = (5 - (5%5)) mod5 → 5 -0 mod5 → 0.\n\nSo, x=5, y=10.\n\nGCD is 5, so LCM is 10.\n\nWhich is the sample output.\n\nFor g=1: k = (1 - (5%1)) mod1 → 0.\n\nx=5, same as above.\n\nSo, the minimal k is 0.\n\nAnother sample: 21 and 31. d=10.\n\nDivisors are 1,2,5,10.\n\nProcessing 10,5,2,1.\n\nFor g=10:\n\nk = (10 -21%10) mod10 → 10-1=9 mod10 →9.\n\nx=21+9=30.\n\ny=31+9=40.\n\nGCD(30,10) is 10. So LCM is (30*40)/10=120.\n\nFor g=5:\n\nk=(5 - (21%5)) mod5 →5-1=4 mod5 →4.\n\nx=25, y=35.\n\nGCD(25,10)=5. So LCM is (25*35)/5=175.\n\nWhich is higher than 120.\n\nFor g=2:\n\nk=(2 -21%2) mod2 → 2-1=1 mod2 →1.\n\nx=22, y=32.\n\nGCD(22,10) is 2. LCM is 352.\n\nWhich is worse.\n\ng=1: k=0. x=21, y=31. GCD(21,10)=1. LCM=651.\n\nSo, the minimal is 120, achieved at k=9.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, in this case, processing the divisors in order and selecting the first that gives the minimal LCM works.\n\nBut what about cases where a larger g doesn't give the minimal LCM? Hmm, perhaps it's always the case that the largest possible g gives the minimal LCM.\n\nBecause the LCM is (x*(x+d))/g', where g' is the GCD of x and d.\n\nWhen x is a multiple of a larger g, then g' could be larger, which reduces the LCM.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal LCM is achieved when g' is as large as possible.\n\nThus, the approach of trying the divisors of d in decreasing order and computing the corresponding k, then calculating the LCM, and choosing the k that gives the minimal LCM would work.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Compute d = |a - b|.\n\n- If d ==0: return k=0.\n\n- Else, find all divisors of d.\n\n- Sort the divisors in descending order.\n\n- For each divisor g in this order:\n\n   a. Compute k = (g - (a %g)) %g.\n\n   b. Compute x = a +k, y = b +k.\n\n   c. Compute current_gcd = gcd(x, d).\n\n   d. current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd.\n\n   e. Keep track of the minimal current_lcm and the corresponding k.\n\n   f. Once a minimal lcm is found, if a smaller k is found that gives the same LCM, we choose the smaller k.\n\n- After processing all divisors, choose the k that gives the minimal LCM. If multiple k's, pick the smallest one.\n\nWait, but in the process, perhaps the first g that gives the minimal LCM is not the one that gives the minimal LCM. Because a larger g may lead to a higher current_gcd, but x may be larger, leading to a larger product.\n\nSo, for example, perhaps a smaller g leads to a larger x, but a much larger current_gcd, leading to a smaller overall LCM.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nLet me think of an example.\n\nSuppose a=3, b=7. d=4.\n\nDivisors of 4: 4,2,1.\n\nFor g=4:\n\nk= (4 -3%4) mod4 → (4-3) mod4=1 mod4=1.\n\nx=4, y=8. current_gcd = GCD(4,4)=4. LCM= (4*8)/4=8.\n\nFor g=2:\n\nk= (2-3%2) mod2 → 2-1=1 mod2=1.\n\nx=4, y=8. Same as before.\n\ncurrent_gcd is 4 again.\n\nSame LCM.\n\nWait, that's interesting.\n\nWait, perhaps for different g's, the same x can be achieved.\n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is correct.\n\nBut let's think of another example.\n\nSuppose a=8, b=14. d=6.\n\nDivisors of 6:6,3,2,1.\n\nFor g=6:\n\nk=(6 -8%6) mod6 →8 mod6 is 2. 6-2=4 mod6=4.\n\nx=12, y=18. GCD(12,6)=6. LCM=36.\n\nFor g=3:\n\nk=(3 - (8%3)) mod3 →8 mod3 is 2. 3-2=1 mod3=1.\n\nx=9, y=15. GCD(9,6)=3. LCM= (9*15)/3=45.\n\nWhich is higher than 36.\n\ng=2:\n\nk= (2 -8%2) mod2 →8 mod2 is 0. 2-0=2 mod2=0.\n\nx=8, y=14. GCD(8,6)=2. LCM= (8*14)/2=56.\n\ng=1:\n\nk=0.\n\nx=8, y=14. Same as above, LCM=56.\n\nSo, the minimal is 36, achieved at g=6.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nAnother example: a=12, b=20. d=8.\n\nDivisors:8,4,2,1.\n\ng=8:\n\nk= (8 -12%8) mod8 →12 mod8=4. 8-4=4 mod8=4.\n\nx=16, y=24. GCD(16,8)=8. LCM= (16*24)/8=48.\n\ng=4:\n\nk= (4-12%4) mod4 →12 mod4=0 →4-0=4 mod4=0.\n\nx=12, y=20. GCD(12,8)=4. LCM= (12*20)/4=60.\n\nWhich is higher than 48.\n\ng=2:\n\nk= (2-12%2) mod2 →12 mod2=0 →2-0=2 mod2=0.\n\nx=12, y=20. Same as above.\n\ng=1:\n\nk=0.\n\nSame as above.\n\nSo, the minimal is 48.\n\nThus, the approach seems to hold.\n\nAnother test case: a=2, b=6. d=4.\n\nDivisors:4,2,1.\n\ng=4:\n\nk= (4-2%4) mod4 →2 mod4=2. 4-2=2 mod4=2.\n\nx=4, y=8. GCD(4,4)=4. LCM= (4*8)/4=8.\n\ng=2:\n\nk= (2-2%2) mod2 →2-0=2 mod2=0.\n\nx=2, y=6. GCD(2,4)=2. LCM= (2*6)/2=6.\n\nWhich is better than 8.\n\nSo, in this case, the approach would select g=2, leading to a better LCM.\n\nAh, so this shows that the initial approach of checking all divisors and choosing the first that gives the minimal LCM may not work because a smaller g may give a better result.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier reasoning, when g=4, the LCM is 8, but when g=2, the LCM is 6, which is better.\n\nSo, in this case, the approach of processing from largest g to smallest, and stopping at the first minimal LCM would have selected 8, but the actual minimal is 6.\n\nSo, this suggests that the approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, what went wrong?\n\nIn this case, when g=4, the k is 2, leading to x=4, y=8, LCM 8.\n\nWhen g=2, k=0, leading to x=2, y=6, LCM 6.\n\nWhich is better.\n\nSo, the approach of processing from largest to smallest and choosing the first minimal LCM is flawed.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, the initial approach may not find the minimal LCM.\n\nSo, what's the correct way to handle this?\n\nIdea: for each divisor g, compute the possible k, then compute the LCM, and track the minimal across all divisors.\n\nOnly then, after considering all possible divisors, pick the k that gives the minimal LCM. If multiple k's give the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest k.\n\nSo, the approach is to generate all possible candidates for k, compute their LCM, and then choose the best one.\n\nBut how to efficiently generate all possible k's.\n\nBecause a and b can be up to 1e9, but the number of divisors of d is manageable, as d can be up to 1e9, but the number of divisors is O(sqrt(d)), which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the revised plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|.\n\n2. If d ==0, return k=0.\n\n3. Else, find all the divisors of d.\n\n4. For each divisor g in the list of all divisors (including 1 and d), compute the required k as (g - (a %g)) %g.\n\n5. Also, include the case where k=0 (since sometimes, k=0 might give a better result, as in the previous example).\n\n6. For each candidate k (from step 4 and 5), compute x = a +k, y = b +k.\n\n7. Compute the current_gcd = GCD(x, d).\n\n8. Compute current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd.\n\n9. Track the minimal current_lcm and the corresponding k.\n\n10. After considering all divisors and k=0, choose the k that gives the minimal current_lcm. If multiple k's have the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nWait, but including k=0 may not be necessary because when g is a divisor, and for some g, k=0 may be part of the computation.\n\nWait, in the example a=2, b=6, d=4.\n\nDivisors are 4,2,1.\n\nWhen g=4, k is 2.\n\nWhen g=2, k is (2 - (2 mod2)) mod2 → 2-0=2 mod2=0.\n\nSo, when g=2, k is 0.\n\nWhich is included in the process.\n\nSo, the approach is to process all divisors, including 1, and compute k for each.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Generate all divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g, compute k.\n\n- Compute the current LCM for each k.\n\n- Choose the k with the smallest LCM. If tie, choose the smallest k.\n\nThus, the approach is to generate all possible k's from the divisors, compute their LCM, and select the best.\n\nBut why does this work?\n\nBecause any optimal k must be such that x is a multiple of a divisor of d. Because the GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d.\n\nWait, because GCD(x, d) must divide both x and d. So, it's a divisor of d.\n\nThus, to maximize GCD(x, d), x must be a multiple of some divisor of d.\n\nHence, all possible x's that can give the maximum possible GCD are those where x is a multiple of a divisor of d.\n\nThus, the candidates for x are all multiples of the divisors of d.\n\nBut the number of such x's is infinite, but for each divisor g, the minimal x is a +k, where k is (g - a mod g) modg.\n\nThus, the process is to consider all possible x's that are multiples of any divisor of d, and compute the corresponding k.\n\nSo, the algorithm will generate all such x's, compute their LCM, and find the best one.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute d = abs(a - b).\n\n2. If d ==0, return k=0.\n\n3. Else, find all the divisors of d.\n\n4. For each divisor g, compute k = (g - (a %g)) %g.\n\n   a. This ensures that x = a +k is a multiple of g.\n\n5. Also, compute the case where k=0. Because sometimes, the optimal k is 0.\n\nWait, no. Because when g is a divisor, and for g=1, the k will be (1 - (a mod1)) mod1 → 0, since a mod1 is 0.\n\nSo, including all the g's will cover the k=0 case.\n\nSo, no need to add it separately.\n\n6. For each computed k, compute x = a +k, y = b +k.\n\n7. Compute current_gcd = gcd(x, d).\n\n   a. Since x and y differ by d, their GCD is the same as gcd(x, d).\n\n8. Compute current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd.\n\n9. Keep track of the minimal current_lcm and the corresponding k.\n\n10. After processing all divisors, select the k that gives the minimal current_lcm. If multiple k's have the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nThus, the algorithm will correctly find the optimal k.\n\nNow, the question is: How to implement this.\n\nImplementing the steps:\n\nFirst, write a function to find all the divisors of a number d.\n\nHow to find all divisors of d efficiently.\n\nYes, the standard approach is to iterate up to sqrt(d), and for each i that divides d, add i and d/i to the list of divisors.\n\nOnce all divisors are collected, sort them in ascending or descending order, but during processing, it's not necessary to sort; instead, process all of them.\n\nBut in practice, when generating the divisors, we can collect them in a list, then process each.\n\nBut in code, perhaps it's easier to collect all unique divisors.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\ndef get_divisors(d):\n    if d == 0:\n        return []\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(d)) +1):\n        if d %i ==0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(d//i)\n    return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)\n\nWait, but in the case of d=0, but in our problem, d=0 is only when a==b, which is handled separately.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCompute d = abs(a -b).\n\nif d ==0:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   compute all divisors of d.\n\n   for each g in divisors:\n\n      compute k.\n\n      compute x = a +k.\n\n      compute current_gcd = math.gcd(x, d)\n\n      current_lcm = (x * (a +k +d)) // current_gcd\n\n      track min_lcm and min_k.\n\nBut wait, a +k is x, and b +k is x +d.\n\nSo, y = x +d.\n\nSo, current_lcm = (x * (x +d)) // current_gcd.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, in the example a=2, b=6, d=4.\n\ndivisors are 4,2,1.\n\nFor g=4:\n\nk = (4 -2%4) mod4 → (4-2) mod4=2 mod4=2.\n\nx=4, y=8.\n\ncurrent_gcd = gcd(4,4)=4.\n\nlcm= (4*8)/4=8.\n\nfor g=2:\n\nk=(2 - 2%2) mod2 → 2-0=2 mod2=0.\n\nx=2, y=6.\n\ncurrent_gcd = gcd(2,4)=2.\n\nlcm = (2*6)/2=6.\n\nso, the minimal is 6.\n\nThus, the algorithm would correctly select k=0.\n\nSo, the code would process all divisors, including 1, and compute for each the k and the lcm.\n\nThus, the code will correctly find the minimal lcm.\n\nSo, the next step is to implement this.\n\nNow, some code details.\n\nIn Python, the math.gcd function returns the absolute value, but since d is positive (as we take absolute), it's fine.\n\nWe'll collect all the divisors, loop through each, compute k, x, y, current_gcd, current_lcm.\n\nWe'll keep track of the minimal current_lcm and the minimal k.\n\nSo, the initial minimal_lcm can be set to a very high value, like infinity, and the minimal_k can be None.\n\nFor each candidate:\n\ncompute k.\n\nx = a +k.\n\ny = x +d.\n\ncurrent_gcd = math.gcd(x, d).\n\ncurrent_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd.\n\nif current_lcm < minimal_lcm:\n\n   update minimal_lcm and minimal_k.\n\nelif current_lcm == minimal_lcm:\n\n   if k < minimal_k:\n\n       update minimal_k.\n\nAfter processing all divisors, output the minimal_k.\n\nWait, but what about the case where x is a multiple of a higher divisor than the ones considered? Or perhaps the code is missing some possibilities.\n\nNo, because we're considering all possible divisors of d. Any x that is a multiple of a divisor of d is covered.\n\nSo, the code should handle all possible cases.\n\nAnother edge case: when d is 1.\n\nSay a=5, b=6. d=1.\n\ndivisors are 1.\n\nFor g=1:\n\nk= (1 -5%1) mod1 →0.\n\nx=5, y=6.\n\ncurrent_gcd = gcd(5,1)=1.\n\nlcm=30.\n\nSo, the minimal is 30.\n\nAnother case: a=0, b=0. d=0. So, k=0.\n\nBut in the problem statement, a and b are >=1.\n\nSo, no issue.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=3. d=0. So, k=0.\n\nSo, the code handles this.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport math\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nd = abs(a - b)\n\nif d ==0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    # find all divisors of d\n\n    def get_divisors(n):\n\n        if n ==0:\n\n            return []\n\n        divisors = set()\n\n        for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) +1):\n\n            if n %i ==0:\n\n                divisors.add(i)\n\n                divisors.add(n//i)\n\n        return sorted(divisors)\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n    minimal_lcm = float('inf')\n\n    minimal_k = None\n\n    for g in divisors:\n\n        k = (g - (a %g)) %g\n\n        x = a +k\n\n        y = b +k\n\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, d)\n\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n\n        if current_lcm < minimal_lcm:\n\n            minimal_lcm = current_lcm\n\n            minimal_k = k\n\n        elif current_lcm == minimal_lcm:\n\n            if k < minimal_k:\n\n                minimal_k = k\n\n    print(minimal_k)\n\nWait, but wait: in the example where a=2 and b=6, d=4.\n\nThe code would process g=4, compute k=2, current_lcm=8.\n\nThen process g=2, compute k=0, current_lcm=6.\n\nWhich is less than 8, so minimal_k is updated to 0.\n\nThen process g=1, compute k= (1 -2%1) mod1 →0.\n\nx=2, y=6.\n\ncurrent_gcd=2.\n\ncurrent_lcm= (2*6)/2=6.\n\nWhich is equal to the current minimal_lcm.\n\nSo, since k=0 is not larger than current minimal_k (which is 0), no change.\n\nThus, the code would correctly choose k=0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: a=6, b=10. d=4.\n\ndivisors are 4,2,1.\n\nFor g=4: k=2. x=8, y=12. current_gcd=4. lcm=24.\n\ng=2: k= (2 -6%2) mod2 → (2-0) mod2=0. x=6, y=10. current_gcd=2. lcm=30.\n\nSo, 24 is better.\n\ng=1: k=0. x=6, y=10. current_gcd=2. lcm=30.\n\nThus, the code chooses k=2, which is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=10. d=5.\n\ndivisors:5,1.\n\ng=5: k=0. x=5, y=10. current_gcd=5. lcm=10.\n\ng=",
