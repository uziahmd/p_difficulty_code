Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, Morse code and some dynamic programming, maybe? The task is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nThe problem says that each time we add a '0' or '1' to the string S, we need to compute the number of non-empty substrings that represent valid English letters according to Morse code. And since the numbers can get really big, we have to output them modulo 1e9+7.\n\nFirst, let's understand the Morse code part. Each letter is represented by a string of 1-4 characters, consisting of 0s and 1s. But not all possible combinations are valid. There are four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So any substring that maps to one of these four shouldn't be counted.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each new character added to S, we need to consider all possible substrings ending at that character and check if they form a valid Morse code. Then sum all the valid ones.\n\nBut wait, how do we efficiently track this as each character is added? Because checking every possible substring each time would be too slow, especially since m can be up to 3000, which isn't too bad, but with substrings up to length 3000, that's O(n^2) operations—might be manageable, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nI think dynamic programming is the way to go here. Let's model the problem with states that track the validity of the current substring.\n\nLet me think about the possible states:\n\nFor each position i in the string S, we can track the number of valid substrings ending at i of length 1, 2, 3, 4. But wait, no—because each substring's validity depends on its entire sequence. So, for each possible current state (like the last few bits), we can transition based on the new character.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this with a DP array where dp[i] represents the total number of valid substrings ending exactly at position i. Wait, but each substring is determined by its starting point and ending point. So, for each new character, we can look back 1, 2, 3, 4 steps and see if the substring ending at i is valid.\n\nWait, but the problem is that for each step, adding a new character could create new substrings of various lengths. So for each new character c, the new substrings are c itself, c plus the previous one, c plus the two before, etc., up to 4 characters.\n\nBut considering that, for each new character, the maximum length we need to check is 4. So for each i, we check the substrings ending at i with lengths 1, 2, 3, 4. For each of these lengths, we need to determine whether the substring is valid.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Keep track of the string S as it's built.\n- For each new character, process it and calculate how many new valid substrings are added.\n- Sum all these to get the total valid substrings after each step.\n\nBut how do we compute, for each possible substring ending at the current position, whether it's valid?\n\nHmm. Let's consider that each new character can form a new substring of length 1, 2, 3, or 4. We need to check each of these possibilities.\n\nBut checking each substring directly might not be efficient. Instead, perhaps we can use a DP table where dp[k] represents the number of valid substrings ending at the current position, of length k.\n\nWait, maybe we can model it as follows:\n\nWe can have a DP array that keeps track of the possible last k characters. For each new character, we can update the DP array.\n\nWait, another approach: For each position, we can track the possible prefixes of length 1, 2, 3, 4, and for each, whether adding the new character results in a valid substring.\n\nWait, maybe for each position i, we can track for each possible length l (1<=l<=4) whether the substring ending at i with length l is valid.\n\nBut then, for each new character, we need to check all possible lengths from 1 to 4, and see if the substring is valid.\n\nBut how to efficiently do that without having to check all possible substrings each time?\n\nAn alternative idea: precompute all possible valid Morse code patterns except the four invalid ones. Then, for each new character, we can look back 1, 2, 3, 4 positions and check if the substring is in the set of valid codes.\n\nBut the issue is that for each new character, the substring can vary in length. So for each possible length l (1 to 4), we take the last l characters and",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of valid Morse code substrings after each modification to the string S. Each character added to S can form new substrings of lengths 1, 2, 3, or 4. Our task is to count these valid substrings efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Morse Code Validity Check**: Each substring must be a valid Morse code representation of an English letter. The invalid strings are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". We will use a set to store all valid Morse codes.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: We maintain a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the total number of valid substrings ending at the i-th position in S. For each new character, we update the DP array by checking all possible substrings ending at this character of lengths 1 to 4.\n3. **Efficient Substring Check**: For each new character, we look back up to 4 positions to check if the substring formed is valid. If it is, we update the DP array accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n# Precompute all valid Morse codes except the four invalid ones\nvalid_codes = set()\nfor l in range(1, 5):\n    for code in [f'{i:0{l}b}' for i in range(2**l)]:\n        if code not in [\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"]:\n            valid_codes.add(code)\n\nm = int(input())\nS = []\nresult = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    c = input().strip()\n    S.append(c)\n    dp = [0] * 5  # dp[k] is the number of valid substrings ending with length k\n    for k in range(1, 5):\n        start = max(0, len(S) - k)\n        substr = ''.join(S[start:len(S)])\n        if substr in valid_codes:\n            dp[k] = dp[k-1] + 1\n        else:\n            dp[k] = dp[k-1]\n    total = sum(dp[1:5]) % MOD\n    result.append(str(total))\n\nprint('\\n'.join(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Valid Codes**: We generate all possible Morse code strings of lengths 1 to 4 and exclude the invalid ones.\n2. **Iterate Through Modifications**: For each modification, we append the character to the string S and update our DP array.\n3. **Update DP Array**: For each new character, we check substrings of lengths 1 to 4 ending at this character. If the substring is valid, we update the corresponding DP value.\n4. **Sum Valid Substrings**: Sum the values from the DP array to get the total number of valid substrings and print the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count valid substrings without redundant checks, making the solution both effective and efficient.",
