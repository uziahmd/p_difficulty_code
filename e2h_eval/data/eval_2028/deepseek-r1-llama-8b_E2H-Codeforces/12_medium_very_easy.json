The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, Xenia is in a city with houses arranged in a ring, right? She needs to do some tasks, and each task requires her to be at a specific house. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks.\n\nWait, the problem says that each task i must be done after all tasks j where j < i. Oh, right, because the list is given in order. So for each task ai, she must reach it after completing all previous ones.\n\nHmm, how do I model this? Well, let's think about the movement. The ring road is circular, so moving from house n to 1 takes one unit of time as well.\n\nSo, the initial position is house 1. For each task in order, she needs to go from the current position to the required house, but considering that she might have to loop around if the next task is earlier in the ring.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal path is to go as far as possible in the clockwise direction each time, because the ring is one-way and you can't go counter-clockwise. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think about the sample input. In the first example, the tasks are 3,2,3. The output is 6. The path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. So the steps are:\n\n1. Go to 2 (time 1).\n2. To 3 (time 2).\n3. Then, since the next task is 2, which is before 3 in the ring, she has to go back to 1 (time 3), then 2 (time4). Then again to 3 (time5?), wait no, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, let's count each move:\n\n1 → 2: 1 step.\n2 →3: 2 steps.\n3→4: 3 steps.\n4→1: 4 steps.\n1→2:5 steps.\n2→3:6 steps. Yes, that's six steps.\n\nSo the total time is 6.\n\nIn this case, the tasks required her to loop around the ring more than once. Because each task must be done in order, but sometimes the next task is earlier in the ring, requiring her to go all the way around.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each task, determine the distance from the previous position to the new task, considering that she might have to go all the way around the ring if the new task is on the opposite side.\n\nWait, but how to compute the minimal steps between two points on the ring?\n\nWell, the ring has n houses. So the distance between house a and b is the minimum of (b -a) mod n or (a -b) mod n. But wait, since the movement is only clockwise, the distance from a to b is (b -a) if b >=a, else (n - a + b). Because the ring is circular and you can't move counter-clockwise.\n\nWait, for example, if n=4, a=3, b=2. The distance would be 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps. Alternatively, (2 -3) mod4 is -1 mod4 = 3. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to compute the distance between them, and sum all those distances plus any initial movement from 1 to the first task.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial position is 1. Then, the first task is a1. So the distance from 1 to a1 is (a1 -1) if a1 >=1, else (n -1 + a1). Wait, no: 1 to a1 is (a1-1) steps because they're adjacent in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, 1 is followed by 2, then 3, etc., up to n, which loops back to 1.\n\nSo, the distance from 1 to a1 is (a1 -1) % n? No, wait, when a1 is 1, it's zero steps. When a1 is 2, it's 1 step, and so on.\n\nBut since the movement is only clockwise, the distance from a to b is (b -a) if b >=a, else (n -a + b).\n\nSo, for each task, starting from the previous position, calculate the distance to the current task, and sum all these.\n\nWait, but the tasks are processed in order, so for each task i (from 1 to m), the current position is the previous task's position, and the next task is a_i. So the time taken is the distance from the current position to a_i.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Sort the list of tasks? No, because the tasks are given in order, and the i-th task must be done after the (i-1)-th. So we can't rearrange them.\n\nWait, no. The problem statement says that she has to complete all tasks with numbers less than i. So for the i-th task, she must have done all tasks j < i. But the order of processing is the order of the tasks as given. So for each task in the sequence, she must visit a_i in order.\n\nSo, the initial position is 1. Then, for each a_i in the list, she moves from the previous position to a_i, adding the distance.\n\nWait, but wait! For example, suppose the tasks are [3, 2, 3]. So:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst task: 3. Distance from 1 to 3 is 2 steps.\n\nSecond task: 2. Distance from 3 to 2 is (2-3 +4) = 3 steps.\n\nThird task:3. Distance from 2 to3 is 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 2+3+1=6. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo yes, this seems to be the correct approach.\n\nAnother sample: the second input is '4 3\\n2 3 3'. So the tasks are 2,3,3.\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task:2. Distance is 1 step (1→2).\n\nSecond task:3. From 2 to3: 1 step.\n\nThird task:3. From 3 to3: 0 steps.\n\nTotal steps:1+1+0=2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is to calculate, for each task in the list, the distance from the previous position to the current task, and sum all these distances.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Read the list of a_i's.\n\n- Initialize previous_position to 1.\n\n- Initialize total_time to 0.\n\n- For each a in the list:\n\n   - Compute the distance from previous_position to a.\n\n   - Add this distance to total_time.\n\n   - Update previous_position to a.\n\n- Output total_time.\n\nWait, but what if the list has duplicates? Like the second sample where the last two tasks are both 3. That's okay; each time, the distance is calculated from the current position to a_i.\n\nSo, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a_i's as integers.\n\nprev = 1\n\ntotal =0\n\nfor ai in a_list:\n\n    # compute distance from prev to ai\n\n    if ai >= prev:\n\n        dist = ai - prev\n\n    else:\n\n        dist = (n - prev) + ai\n\n    total += dist\n\n    prev = ai\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nn=4, m=3, a_list = [3,2,3]\n\nprev starts at 1.\n\nai=3: 3 >=1 → 3-1=2. total=2. prev=3.\n\nai=2: 2<3 → (4-3)+2= 3. total=5. prev=2.\n\nai=3:3>=2 →1. total=6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=4, m=3, a_list=[2,3,3].\n\nprev=1.\n\nai=2: 2-1=1. total=1.\n\nai=3:3-2=1. total=2.\n\nai=3:0. total remains 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: what if the list is [1,1,1], n=5.\n\nThen each step:\n\nprev=1.\n\nai=1: distance 0. total=0.\n\nai=1: 0. total=0.\n\nai=1: 0. total=0.\n\nSo output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=2, a_list = [5,4].\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst ai=5: distance 5-1=4. total=4.\n\nSecond ai=4: 4 is less than 5. So distance is (5-5) +4 =0+4=4. total=8.\n\nSo the total is 8.\n\nWhat's the path: 1→2→3→4→5→5→4. Wait, no. Wait, movement is only clockwise, so from 5, to go to 4, you have to go through 1→2→3→4? No, wait, no, the movement is along the ring in the clockwise direction, but from 5, the next house is 1.\n\nSo from 5 to4 is not possible directly; you have to go 5→1→2→3→4, which is 4 steps. So yes, 4 steps.\n\nSo the code correctly calculates 4+4=8.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, m=2, a_list = [2,1].\n\nFirst task:2. From 1 to 2 is 1 step. prev=2.\n\nSecond task:1. From 2, the next is 1, so distance is 1 step. Total 2.\n\nPath: 1→2→1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo now, to implement this in Python.\n\nThe code will read the inputs, process the a_i's, and compute the sum as described.\n\nHandling the input: the first line is two integers, n and m. Second line is m integers.\n\nIn Python, reading from stdin can be done via input().split().\n\nBut sometimes, for multiple test cases, but in this problem, it's a single test case.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and the input is given as ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3'], which suggests that perhaps there are multiple test cases. Or maybe that's just an example.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: the input is the first line with n and m, followed by a line with m integers. So it's a single test case.\n\nSo, the code can read the first line, then the second line.\n\nNow, coding:\n\nRead n, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen, process each element.\n\nInitialize prev =1, total=0.\n\nLoop through each ai in a_list:\n\ncompute the distance.\n\nAdd to total.\n\nUpdate prev.\n\nFinally, print(total).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing this code with the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput lines:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nCode computes 2+3+1=6.\n\nSample 2:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3 → 1+1+0=2.\n\nYes.\n\nEdge case where m=0? No, because m is at least 1 according to the problem statement (but looking back, the problem says m≥1? Wait, problem statement says 1 ≤ m ≤ 105. So m can be 1.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, m=1, a_list = [2]. So from 1→2, 1 step.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=1, a_list=[5]. Steps:4.\n\nSo code works.\n\nSo I think this solution is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks given that she starts at house number 1 and can only move clockwise around a ring of houses.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Understanding**: Xenia needs to complete tasks in the order they are given, each task requiring her to be at a specific house. The movement is restricted to a one-way clockwise direction along the ring.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance from house `a` to house `b` on a ring of `n` houses can be calculated as follows:\n   - If `b` is ahead of `a` in the clockwise direction, the distance is `(b - a)`.\n   - If `b` is behind `a`, the distance wraps around the ring, which is `(n - a + b)`.\n3. **Summing Distances**: Starting from house 1, for each task, compute the distance from the current position to the task's house and accumulate these distances to get the total time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprev = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor ai in a_list:\n    if ai >= prev:\n        dist = ai - prev\n    else:\n        dist = (n - prev) + ai\n    total_time += dist\n    prev = ai\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`, followed by the list of tasks.\n2. **Initialization**: We start at house 1 with `total_time` initialized to 0.\n3. **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the distance from the current position to the task's house. Update the total time and the current position.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, print the accumulated total time.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum time required by summing the necessary distances in a single pass through the task list, ensuring an optimal solution.",
