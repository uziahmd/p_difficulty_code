He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Rudolf and Snowflakes, hard version. Hmm. From the description, it's about determining whether a certain number of vertices can form a snowflake graph as defined.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step. \n\nThe snowflake is an undirected graph constructed in a specific way. Initially, there's one vertex. Then, each time, we add new vertices in a certain pattern. Each step involves taking a vertex that has only one edge (so degree 1) and connecting it to k new vertices. And this step must be done at least once. So the process goes like this:\n\n- Start with 1 node.\n- Add k children to it (so now total is 1 + k).\n- Then, for each of those k nodes, since each has degree 1, we add k children to each. So each of them becomes a parent to k new nodes. So the next step adds k*k nodes, making the total 1 +k +k^2.\n- This process can continue multiple times. So each iteration multiplies the number of nodes by k for each existing \"leaf\" node.\n\nWait, but the way it's described, each leaf (degree 1 node) gets expanded into k new nodes. So each expansion step increases the total nodes by k^m, where m is the number of leaves in the previous step.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The initial step after the first addition gives us 1 + k nodes. Then, each of the k nodes is expanded, adding k each, so total becomes 1 +k +k². Then, each of the k² nodes is expanded, adding k each, so total becomes 1 +k +k² +k³. And so on.\n\nSo the total number of nodes after m steps (including the initial step) is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m. Wait no, because each expansion is done on all current leaves, which are the ones added in the previous expansion. So the process is:\n\nStart: 1 node.\n\nStep 1: add k nodes → total 1 +k.\n\nStep 2: each of the k nodes adds k nodes → total 1 +k +k².\n\nStep 3: each of the k² nodes adds k nodes → total 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nAnd so on. So the sum is a geometric series.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the step should be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake is when k=4, which is the example. For k=4, the minimal is 1+4 =5 nodes? Or wait, looking at the figure, perhaps the minimal includes the initial expansion. Because the initial is 1, then add 4, making 5. But then each of those 4 must add 4, making 5+16=21. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example.\n\nWait, the example input includes n=6 and the output is YES. Let's see: 6 could be 1+5, but for k=5, the minimal would be 1+5=6, but does that satisfy the condition? Because the step of adding k nodes is done once, but the condition says that each vertex connected to only one edge must add k new nodes, and this step is done at least once. Wait, the initial step is adding k nodes to the root. That's the first step. Then, each of those k nodes must have their own k children added. So the minimal is 1 +k +k², right?\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nSo the initial step is creating the root and its k children. Then, each of those k children is a leaf, so they must each add k children. So the minimal is 1 +k +k². So for k=2, the minimal is 7 (1+2+4=7). But wait, the sample input includes n=6 and the output is YES. How is that possible?\n\nWait, the sample input shows that for n=6, the output is YES. So according to the sample, 6 is acceptable. Let me think: 6 can be written as 1 + 5, but that would be for k=5, but then each of the 5 nodes needs to add 5 children, leading to 5*5=25 added. So 1 +5 +25 =31. Which is larger than 6. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the expansion step doesn't have to be applied to all leaves every time. Or maybe the process can stop after any number of steps, not necessarily expanding all the way down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snowflake can be built in any number of steps, but each expansion step must be done at least once. Wait, the problem says that the step should be done at least once. So the initial expansion (adding k children to the root) is done, and then the step of expanding leaves is done at least once. So the minimal structure is:\n\nAfter initial expansion: 1 +k nodes.\n\nThen, each of the k nodes expands to add k children. So 1 +k +k².\n\nThat's the minimal, right? So for k=2, the minimal is 7 nodes. So how does 6 fit into the sample?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the process. Let's read the problem statement again.\n\nThe initial graph has one vertex. Then, it's connected to k new vertices. So that's step 1.\n\nEach vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo, after step 1, we have 1 +k nodes. Now, each of those k nodes is connected only to the root, so they each must connect to k new nodes. So step 2 is to add k² nodes. So total is 1 +k +k².\n\nBut the problem says that the step should be done at least once. So step 2 is required. So the minimal is 1 +k +k².\n\nWait, but then for n=6, can it be expressed as 1 +k +k² for some k>1?\n\nLet's see:\n\nWe need 1 +k +k² =6 → k² +k +1=6 → k² +k -5=0. Solving this quadratic equation: discriminant is 1 +20=21, sqrt(21) is ~4.58. So k = [-1 ± sqrt(21)]/2. Only positive solution is (sqrt(21)-1)/2 ≈ 1.79. Not an integer. So 6 cannot be achieved with this approach.\n\nBut in the sample, n=6 is 'YES'. So my understanding must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the step is done zero times? No, because the problem says it must be done at least once. So step 2 must be performed.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the process can have multiple steps beyond the second one. Like, after the second step, each of the k² nodes can also expand. So the total could be 1 +k +k² +k³ + ... up to some m steps.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is the sum from i=0 to m of k^i, except for the first term which is 1 (k^0). So the sum is S = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1).\n\nWait, but no. Because each step adds k^m nodes, but the sum is 1 +k +k² +k³ + ... +k^m. So yes, it's a geometric series.\n\nBut the problem requires that the step is done at least once. So the minimal is 1 +k +k², which is S when m=2.\n\nSo for the sample input, n=6, perhaps the sum is 1 +k +k² =6. But as before, that's not possible.\n\nWait, unless the initial step is considered as step 1, but then step 2 is optional? But no, the problem says the step must be done at least once.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the process. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: Initially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is just creating the k children. Then, the step of adding to the leaves is done once. So the minimal structure is 1 +k +k². So for n=6, that's not possible.\n\nBut the sample says n=6 is YES. So perhaps I'm missing another possibility. Maybe the process doesn't require all leaves to expand each time, but any subset of leaves can be expanded, but at least one must be expanded each time.\n\nNo, the problem says \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices.\" So if a vertex is a leaf (degree 1), it must be expanded. So all leaves must be expanded each time.\n\nSo, for the minimal case, after the initial step, all k leaves must be expanded, adding k² nodes, making the total 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for n=6, perhaps 6 can be written as 1 +k +k² +k³, etc., but that would require more steps.\n\nWait, let's see. If m is the number of steps beyond the initial. Wait, perhaps the process is:\n\n- Initial: 1 node.\n\n- Step 1: add k children → 1 +k.\n\n- Step 2: each of the k children adds k → 1 +k +k².\n\n- Step 3: each of the k² adds k → 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nBut the problem says that the step of adding k children to leaves must be done at least once. So step 2 must be done.\n\nThus, the minimal is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for n=6, it's impossible with this model.\n\nBut the sample says n=6 is YES. So perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, maybe the initial step is not required. Or perhaps the initial step is not part of the process. Wait, no: the initial step is part of the construction. The problem says the initial graph has one vertex. Then, the initial step is adding k children.\n\nSo perhaps the process can have more steps beyond the initial. Like, after step 2, you can choose to stop or continue.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the step of adding k children to the leaves must be done at least once. So step 2 must be done. So the minimal is 1 +k +k².\n\nBut again, for n=6, that's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe the process allows for the step to be done zero times, but the problem says it must be done at least once. So step 2 is mandatory.\n\nSo why is n=6 in the sample a 'YES'?\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscomputing something. Let me check the sample input and output.\n\nSample Input:\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\nSample Output:\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nSo for n=6, the output is YES.\n\nHmm. So according to the sample, n=6 is a valid snowflake. So perhaps my understanding is incorrect.\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps the process is that after each expansion, the leaves are allowed to not expand further. So the process can have any number of steps, but each expansion step must be done at least once. So for example, after step 2, you can choose to stop, resulting in 1 +k +k².\n\nWait, but that's the minimal. So for n=6, can 6 be written as 1 +k +k²? As earlier, that gives k² +k +1 =6 → k² +k -5=0. Discriminant 21, roots (−1 ±√21)/2. So no integer solution. So that's not possible.\n\nSo maybe there's another way to get n=6. Let's think about possible k values.\n\nWait, perhaps the process allows for the expansion step to be done multiple times, but not all leaves are expanded each time. But no, the problem says that each leaf must be expanded each time.\n\nWait, maybe the process isn't a full expansion each time. Like, perhaps after step 2, you can choose to expand some leaves and not others. But that seems unlikely; the problem says that each vertex connected to only one edge is connected to k new vertices. So all leaves must be expanded each time.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the problem allows for the process to have any number of steps beyond the initial, but not necessarily all the way. For example, after step 2, you can stop. Or, perhaps, after step 3, you can stop.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the step of expanding leaves must be done at least once. So the initial step is adding k children (step 1), then step 2 is adding k² children (each of the k nodes), and this is done at least once. So the minimal is 1 +k +k².\n\nBut then for n=6, it's not possible. So why is the sample saying 'YES' for 6?\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing a different way to construct the snowflake. Perhaps the process can be stopped before all leaves are fully expanded.\n\nWait, perhaps the step is optional. Like, after step 1, you can choose to stop, but the problem says that the step must be done at least once. So you can't stop before doing step 2.\n\nSo, for n=6, perhaps the structure is 1 +k +k², but 1 +k +k² =6. As before, no solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process can have the step done more than once. Like, after step 2, step 3 is done.\n\nSo 1 +k +k² +k³ =6. Let's see possible k:\n\nk=2: 1+2+4+8=15>6.\n\nk=1: invalid since k>1.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process is that the step is done once, but not all leaves are expanded.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the problem statement. It says each leaf is connected to k new nodes each time.\n\nSo I'm stuck. Let me think about another approach.\n\nPerhaps the problem allows for the snowflake to have any number of layers, but each layer must have at least depth 2.\n\nWait, maybe the total number of nodes is 1 +k*(something). Or perhaps it's a tree structure where each internal node has exactly k children, except the leaves.\n\nWait, perhaps the snowflake is a rooted tree where every non-leaf node has exactly k children, and the leaves are at least two layers deep.\n\nYes! That makes sense. So the tree has exactly one root, which has k children. Each of those children has k children, and so on. But the tree must have at least two layers beyond the root. So the minimal depth is 2.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k².\n\nThus, for n=6, 1 +k +k² =6 → k² +k +1 =6 →k² +k -5=0. Which has solutions, but non-integer. So 6 is not possible.\n\nBut the sample says 'YES' for 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the definition again.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is that each leaf must have k children, but after that, the process stops. So the minimal is 1 +k +k². But for the sample n=6, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process can have multiple steps of adding layers, but the tree doesn't have to be perfect.\n\nWait, maybe the tree can have some leaves at depth 2, and others deeper.\n\nBut then the problem says each leaf (each node with degree 1) must have k children added. So all leaves must have their children added.\n\nSo the tree is a complete k-ary tree of height m, where m≥2.\n\nSo the total nodes are sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nWait, for example, when m=2, sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for n=6, we have 1 +k +k² =6.\n\nWhich as before, has no integer solution for k>1.\n\nSo why is the sample output YES for 6?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that the process can have the step done zero times. But no, the problem says it must be done at least once.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem allows for the initial step (adding k children) without the step being done, but that's not possible because the problem says the step must be done at least once.\n\nI'm confused. Let me look for another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: find all n that can be represented as 1 +k*(s), where s is a sum of powers of k, and the sum is at least 1 +k.\n\nWait, no, because each expansion step adds k^m nodes, where m is the current level.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to a trie-like structure, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Let's think about the possible forms of n.\n\nFor a snowflake, n must be equal to (k^{m} -1)/(k-1) for some m ≥2 and k>1.\n\nBecause the sum 1 +k +k² +...+k^{m-1} is (k^m -1)/(k-1). Wait, no: sum from i=0 to m-1 of k^i is (k^m -1)/(k-1). So for m=2, sum is 1 +k = (k²-1)/(k-1). For m=3, sum is 1+k +k² = (k³ -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo n must be of the form (k^m -1)/(k-1), where m >=2.\n\nSo for the sample n=6: does 6 equal (k^m -1)/(k-1) for some m>=2 and k>1.\n\nLet's try m=3: 1 +k +k² =6 → k² +k +1=6 → k² +k -5=0 → no integer solution.\n\nm=2: 1 +k =6 →k=5. Then, the sum is 6, which is (5^2 -1)/(5-1)=24/4=6. So yes.\n\nWait, that works. So for m=2, k=5: 1+5=6. So n=6 is YES.\n\nAh! So perhaps the minimal step is the initial step (adding k children), and then the step is done zero times. But the problem says the step must be done at least once.\n\nWait, no. Because in this case, m=2 implies that the step is done once.\n\nWait, m represents the number of steps beyond the initial step. Or perhaps m represents the total number of layers beyond the root.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from how m is defined. Let's clarify:\n\nIn a tree where each non-leaf node has exactly k children, and each leaf is at least depth 2, the total number of nodes is S = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m}, where m is the maximum depth minus one.\n\nWait, no. For a tree of height h, the sum is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{h-1}.\n\nSo for m=2, the sum is 1 +k = (k² -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo when n=6, it's possible with k=5 and m=2.\n\nWait, but in this case, the step is done once. Because after the initial step, the step is done once (each of the k leaves is expanded).\n\nSo the minimal is 1 +k +k².\n\nWait, no. Wait, if m=2, the sum is 1 +k, which is for m=2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the definitions of m. Let me think clearly.\n\nIn the problem statement, the initial step is step 1: adding k children to the root. Then, the step is done at least once, which is step 2: adding k children to each of the k leaves, leading to 1 +k +k².\n\nSo the sum after two steps is 1 +k +k², which is for m=3 layers (root, layer 1, layer 2).\n\nBut according to the formula S = (k^m -1)/(k-1), for m=3, S is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for n=6, S=6 can be written as (k^3 -1)/(k-1). Let's compute this for various k:\n\nFor k=2: (8-1)/1=7≠6.\n\nk=3: (27-1)/2=26/2=13≠6.\n\nk=5: (125-1)/4=124/4=31≠6.\n\nWait, no. So 6 is (5^2 -1)/(5-1) =24/4=6. So m=2.\n\nBut in this case, the sum is 1 +5 =6, which is for m=2. So the tree has two layers beyond the root: the root and the 5 children. But according to the problem statement, the step of expanding leaves must be done at least once. So in this case, the step was done once (the initial step plus the expansion step?), or not?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is adding k children (layer 1), and then the step is done once, adding layer 2.\n\nSo for k=5, m=3 (layers 0,1,2). Sum is 1+5+25=31.\n\nWait, but for m=2, sum is 1+5=6. So the tree has only two layers beyond the root: the root and its 5 children. But then, each of those children is a leaf, which hasn't been expanded. So the step of expanding leaves hasn't been done.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the step must be done at least once. So in this case, the step wasn't done.\n\nSo why is n=6 considered a YES?\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe I need to find another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: For a given n, iterate over possible k and m to see if n can be expressed as (k^(m) -1)/(k-1), for m >=2 and k>1.\n\nWait, but for large n (up to 1e18), we need an efficient way to do this.\n\nWait, the problem is to determine whether n can be written as the sum of a geometric series starting at 1, ratio k, for m terms, where m >=2.\n\nSo for each n, check if there exists integers k>1 and m>=2 such that n = (k^m -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut checking for all possible m and k is computationally expensive. So we need a smarter way.\n\nFirst, note that for m=2, n must be equal to 1 +k → n-1 must be a perfect power (k) for some k>1.\n\nSo for each n, check if n-1 is a perfect power, and if so, whether k>1.\n\nSimilarly, for m=3, n = 1 +k +k². So n-1 = k(k+1). So for each n, we can factor n-1 and see if it's a product of two consecutive integers, both greater than 1.\n\nFor m=4, n =1 +k +k² +k³ = (k^4-1)/(k-1). So n-1 must be (k^4-1)/(k-1) =k^3 +k² +k +1.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAn alternative approach is to iterate m from 2 upwards, up to log_2(n), and for each m, check if (n*(k-1)+1) is a perfect m-th power for some k>1.\n\nBut even that could be computationally intensive for large n.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal m is 2, and higher m may not be necessary. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible m starting from 2 up to log_2(n), compute possible k and see if the equation holds.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, m can be up to 60 (since 2^60 is around 1e18). So per test case, checking m from 2 to 60 is manageable.\n\nFor each m, we can compute k using binary search.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFor a given n, for each m from 2 to 60:\n\n   Compute the minimal possible k such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\n   For each m, perform binary search on k, starting from 2 up to some upper limit (like sqrt(n) or higher).\n\n   If for any m and k, the equation holds, then return YES.\n\nIf none of the m's yield a solution, return NO.\n\nThis approach should work for n up to 1e18, as t is 1e4, and for each test case, it's O(60 * log n) operations.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample n=6:\n\nCheck m=2:\n\nEquation: 1 +k =6 → k=5.\n\nSo (5^2 -1)/(5-1) =24/4=6 → yes.\n\nSo return YES.\n\nSample n=13:\n\nCheck m=3:\n\nEquation: 1 +k +k²=13 → k² +k -12=0 →k=3 (since (-1 + sqrt(49))/2= (3)).\n\nSo 1+3+9=13 → yes.\n\nSample n=15:\n\nCheck m=2:\n\n1 +k=15 →k=14. So 14^2-1/(14-1) = (196-1)/13=195/13=15 → yes.\n\nSample n=255:\n\nCheck m=4: 1 +k +k² +k³=255.\n\nLet's try k=4: 1+4+16+64=85 <255.\n\nk=5: 1+5+25+125=156 <255.\n\nk=6: 1+6+36+216=259>255.\n\nk=5: 156. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps m=4 is not the case. Let's try m=3:\n\n1 +k +k²=255 →k² +k -254=0.\n\nDiscriminant: 1 +4*254=1017 → sqrt(1017)= approx 31.89 → no integer solution.\n\nWait, but 255 is 256-1, which is 2^8 -1. So for m=8, k=2: sum is 1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128=255. So yes.\n\nSo for m=8, k=2: 1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128=255. So yes.\n\nSo n=255 is YES.\n\nSample n=10101:\n\nCheck m=2: 1 +k =10101 →k=10100. Then (10100^2 -1)/(10100-1) = (102010000 -1)/10099 = 102009999 /10099 → let's compute 10099 × 10101 → 10099 *10101= (10100 -1)(10100 +1) = 10100² -1 = 102010000 -1 = 102009999 → so 10101 = 1 +10100 → yes.\n\nSo for m=2, k=10100, n=10101 is valid.\n\nWait, but wait: according to the formula, (k^2-1)/(k-1)=k+1=10101 → yes. So n=10101 is YES.\n\nWait, but the sample output for n=10101 is 'NO' according to the sample. Wait, no:\n\nLooking back, the sample input is:\n\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\nSample output:\n\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nWait, the fifth element is 10101, output is 'YES'.\n\nWait, but according to our calculation, for m=2, k=10100, sum is 1+10100=10101, which fits. So sample says 'YES' for 10101.\n\nSo why in the sample, for n=1e18, it's 'NO'? Because perhaps 1e18 cannot be expressed as (k^m -1)/(k-1) for some m>=2 and k>1.\n\nSo our approach should correctly handle these cases.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\nFor each n, check for m from 2 up to log2(n) (like 60), and for each m, perform binary search for k to see if (k^m -1)/(k-1) equals n.\n\nIf any pair (m, k) satisfies, return YES.\n\nElse, return NO.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this.\n\nImplementing the function for each m:\n\nFor a given m, we need to find k>1 such that n = (k^m -1)/(k-1).\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as:\n\nn = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1}.\n\nWhich is a sum of m terms.\n\nTo find k, we can binary search in the range [2, n-1], since k must be >1 and the sum must be at least 1 +2 =3 for m=2.\n\nBut for large m, the sum can quickly exceed n, so binary search can be optimized.\n\nBut for each m, we can compute the sum for a given k and see if it equals n.\n\nBut computing the sum directly for large m and large k can cause overflow, so we need to handle that.\n\nAlternatively, during the binary search, for each k, compute the sum incrementally and stop early if the sum exceeds n.\n\nWait, but for m up to 60, and k up to n, it's manageable.\n\nSo for each m from 2 to max_m (like 60):\n\n   low = 2\n\n   high = n-1\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n      mid = (low + high) //2\n\n      compute sum = 1 +mid + mid^2 + ... +mid^{m-1}\n\n      if sum ==n → return True.\n\n      elif sum <n → low = mid +1\n\n      else → high = mid -1\n\nIf any m returns True, then output YES.\n\nElse, after all m's, output NO.\n\nBut how to compute the sum without overflow?\n\nBecause for large m and large mid, mid^{m-1} can be huge, exceeding 1e18 quickly.\n\nSo during the computation of the sum, we can check at each step if the sum exceeds n, and break early.\n\nFor example, for m steps:\n\nsum =0\n\ncurrent_term =1\n\nfor i in 0..m-1:\n\n   sum += current_term\n\n   if sum >n → break\n\n   current_term *=mid\n\nBut for m=60, and mid=2, the current_term after 60 steps is 2^59, which is about 5e17, which is less than 1e18. So for mid=2, m=60, sum is about 2^60-1, which is around 1e18.\n\nBut for larger mid, the sum can quickly exceed 1e18, causing sum to go beyond.\n\nSo during the computation, after each addition, we can check if the sum exceeds n, and if so, break the loop and return that it's too big.\n\nSo in code, for a given mid and m:\n\ndef compute_sum(mid, m, n):\n    s =0\n    term =1\n    for _ in range(m):\n        s += term\n        if s >n:\n            return s\n        term *=mid\n    return s\n\nSo, for each mid, compute the sum in m steps. If any step the sum exceeds n, return early.\n\nNow, the binary search for each m.\n\nNow, let's think about handling the binary search:\n\nFor each m, the minimal possible k is 2, and the maximal possible k is such that 1 +k >=n →k >=n-1.\n\nBut for higher m, the sum grows rapidly, so the upper bound can be adjusted.\n\nWait, for a fixed m, the function f(k) = 1 +k + ... +k^{m-1} is strictly increasing for k>1.\n\nSo for a given m, the binary search will find a unique k if it exists.\n\nSo the binary search approach is correct.\n\nNow, implement this for each test case.\n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nTest case n=1: 1 node.\n\nFor m=2: sum=1 +k =1 →k=0, which is invalid.\n\nSo no solution.\n\nThus, output is NO.\n\nn=2: same as above.\n\nn=3: m=2: 1 +k=3 →k=2. So yes.\n\nWait, but 1 +2 =3, which is the sum for m=2, k=2. So n=3 is YES.\n\nBut according to the sample, n=3 is output as 'NO'. Wait, no. Looking back:\n\nSample Input: ['9','1','2','3','6','13','15','255','10101','1e18']\n\nSample Output: ['NO','NO','NO','NO','YES','YES','YES','YES','NO'].\n\nSo for n=3, output is 'NO'.\n\nWait, this suggests that my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, for n=3: according to the formula, it's 1 +k =3 →k=2.\n\nSo according to the formula, it should be YES.\n\nBut the sample output says 'NO' for n=3.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps my initial understanding of the problem is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the snowflake graph must have at least two layers beyond the root.\n\nMeaning that the root is connected to at least two nodes, which in turn are connected to their own children.\n\nSo for a snowflake, the minimal structure is the root (depth 0) connected to k nodes (depth 1), each of which is connected to k nodes (depth 2). So the minimal is 1 +k +k².\n\nThus, for n=3, 1 +k +k²=3.\n\nSolving: k² +k -2=0 →k=(−1±√(1+8))/2 →k=1 or k= -2. Only k=1 is possible, but k>1 is required. So no solution.\n\nThus, n=3 can't be formed.\n\nAh, so I see. So the minimal structure is 1 +k +k². Thus, for n=3, it's impossible.\n\nSo in the sample, n=3 is 'NO'.\n\nThus, my initial approach was wrong. I thought that for m=2, the sum is 1 +k, but actually, the minimal step requires that the expansion step is done at least once, which adds k² nodes.\n\nSo the sum must be 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m >=2.\n\nWait, no. Because for m=2, the sum is 1 +k, but the expansion step is done once, which requires that each of the k leaves is expanded, adding k children each, leading to 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nThus, for n=3, it's not possible.\n\nSo the correct approach is to find if n can be written as 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m >=1.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial step is adding k children, which is step 1. Then the expansion step is done at least once, which is step 2.\n\nThus, the minimal sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo the sum is for m=3 layers.\n\nThus, for n=3, the minimal sum is 1 +k +k²=3.\n\nBut solving k² +k +1=3 →k² +k -2=0 →k=1 or -2. So no solution.\n\nThus, n=3 is 'NO'.\n\nSo, the correct approach is that the sum is (k^{m} -1)/(k-1), where m is the number of layers beyond the root, and m >=2.\n\nBecause each expansion step adds a layer.\n\nWait, perhaps m is the number of layers including the root.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m-1}, where m is the number of layers beyond the root.\n\nNo, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me re-express the problem.\n\nThe snowflake is built as follows:\n\n- Root (layer 0): 1 node.\n\n- Layer 1: k nodes, each connected to the root.\n\n- Then, each node in layer ",
