Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, Morse code and some dynamic programming perhaps? The task is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nThe problem says that each time we add a character (0 or 1) to the string S, we need to find the number of non-empty substrings of S that correspond to a valid English letter in Morse code. And since the numbers can get really big, we have to output them modulo 1e9+7.\n\nFirst, let's understand the valid Morse code strings. Each English letter is represented by a string of 1-4 dots and dashes. But there are four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So any substring of S that translates to these should be excluded from our count.\n\nSo, for each step after adding a character, we need to consider all possible substrings ending at the current position and determine how many of them are valid Morse codes.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model this with dynamic programming. Like, for each position i in S, keep track of certain states that help us compute the number of valid substrings ending at i.\n\nLet me think about the possible states. Since the maximum length of a valid Morse code is 4, any substring longer than 4 can't be valid. So for each position, we can look back up to 4 characters and check if the substring of length 1,2,3,4 is valid.\n\nBut checking every possible substring each time would be O(n^2), which for m=3000 is manageable, but maybe we can find a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, for each new character added, we can update some counts based on previous states.\n\nLet's consider that for each position i, we can have some variables that represent the number of valid substrings ending at i with lengths 1,2,3,4. Or maybe the total up to that point.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model it with a DP array where dp[i] represents the number of valid substrings ending at position i. Then, for each new character, we can update these values.\n\nBut wait, how do we handle the fact that each substring must be exactly 1-4 characters long and not one of the invalid ones?\n\nHmm. Maybe for each position i, we can track the possible last few characters (like the last 1,2,3,4 characters) and whether they form a valid code. Then, when a new character comes, we can extend these sequences.\n\nAnother approach: For each possible length l (from 1 to 4), we can track how many valid sequences of length l end at the current position. Then, the total number of valid substrings is the sum over l=1 to 4 of the count for each l.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, for each new character c (0 or 1), we can process it and update the counts for l=1,2,3,4.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let's define a DP table where dp[l][k] represents the number of valid sequences of length l that end with the k-th character. Wait, maybe that's not the right structure.\n\nAlternatively, for each position i, we can have a dictionary or an array that keeps track of all possible suffixes of length 1 to 4. For example, when processing the i-th character, we can look back at the previous 3 characters (since a new character can extend sequences of length up to 4).\n\nWait, here's an idea: for each position i, we can have a list dp where dp[j] represents the number of valid substrings ending at i with length j, where j can be 1,2,3,4. So for each new character, we can calculate these values based on the previous state.\n\nHow? Let's say the new character is c. For each j from 1 to 4:\n\n- If j == 1, then the substring is just c. We need to check if 'c' is a valid Morse code (i.e., it's one of the 22 valid codes). If yes, then dp[1] += 1.\n- For j > 1, we look back j steps. The substring from i-j+1 to i must form a valid code. So for each j, we check if the substring s[i-j+1 ... i] is valid. If yes, then dp[j] += 1.\n\nWait, but for each j, we have to look back j steps. So for each new character, we can check all possible j's from 1 to min(4, i+1). Because for j=4, we need at least 4 characters before.\n\nBut doing this for each j would be O(1) per j, because j can be only up to 4. So for each new character, the processing is O(1) time, which is manageable for m=3000.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Maintain a list (or a variable) that tracks the last 4 characters.\n- For each new character, create a new list that appends this character to the previous list, keeping only the last 4 characters.\n- For each possible substring ending at this new character with length 1,2,3,4, check if it's a valid Morse code.\n- Sum all the valid substrings and add this to the total.\n\nWait, no. Because for each new character, the new possible substrings are those that end at it. So for each possible length l (1 to 4), we need to check if the substring of length l ending at the current character is valid.\n\nSo, for each new character c:\n\n- For l = 1: check if c is valid. If yes, add 1 to the total.\n- For l = 2: check if the last two characters form a valid code. If yes, add 1 to the total.\n- Similarly for l=3 and l=4.\n\nBut how do we efficiently check if a substring is a valid Morse code? We can precompute all valid codes and store them in a set for quick lookup.\n\nYes, that's a good idea. Precompute all valid Morse codes (excluding the four invalid ones), and store them in a set. Then, for any substring, we can quickly check if it's in the set.\n\nSo first, I need to generate all valid Morse codes. How?\n\nWe know that all possible strings of 0s and 1s of length 1-4, except the four invalid ones, are valid. So the total number of valid codes is 30 - 4 = 26, which matches the 26 letters.\n\nSo let's generate all possible strings of length 1, 2, 3, 4 made of 0 and 1, and exclude the four invalid ones.\n\nLet me write a small function to generate all valid Morse codes.\n\nOnce I have this set, for each new character, I can look back 1, 2, 3, 4 characters and check if the substring is in the set.\n\nWait, but looking back 4 characters for the first few steps may not be possible. For example, when the string has only 2 characters, looking back 4 isn't feasible. So for each l, I can only consider l up to the current length of the string.\n\nSo, for each new character, the current string is s[0...n], where n is the current length. When adding the (n+1)-th character, for l=1, we can check s[n]. For l=2, s[n-1..n], etc., as long as the substring exists.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize an empty set of valid codes.\n\nFor each step from 1 to m:\n\n1. Read the new character and append it to S.\n2. For l in 1 to 4:\n   a. Check if the last l characters form a valid Morse code.\n   b. If yes, add 1 to the total count.\n3. Output the total count modulo 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, this approach will miss some cases because when you add a new character, it can also combine with previous ones to form new substrings that end at this new position. For example, if the current string is '11', adding another '1' makes it '111'. Now, the new substrings are '1', '11', and '111'.\n\nBut the approach above will correctly capture all these because for each l from 1 to 3, we check the last l characters.\n\nYes, that's correct. So for each new character, for each possible l (1-4), we check if the substring of length l ending at the current position is a valid code.\n\nSo the main challenge is to efficiently check these substrings.\n\nNow, the issue is that for each new character, the string grows by one, and for each l in 1..4, we need to extract the last l characters and check if they are in the precomputed valid set.\n\nThis seems manageable because for each step, we perform 4 checks, each of which is O(1) if we have a hash set.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute all valid Morse codes and store them in a set.\n- Keep track of the current string S.\n- For each new character added to S:\n   - For l in 1 to 4:\n      - If l > len(S), skip (can't have a substring of length l)\n      - Else, take the last l characters of S.\n      - Check if it's in the valid set.\n      - If yes, add 1 to the total.\n   - Output the total mod 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but this approach would not account for overlapping substrings. For example, when S is '11', adding another '1' makes S '111'. The new substrings are '1', '11', '111'. The approach above would count all three, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, the approach is for each new character, check all possible l's (up to 4) and add 1 for each valid substring. So it's correct.\n\nBut wait, for l=2, when the current string is '111', the last two characters are '11', which is a valid code. So it adds 1 for l=2. But what about when the string was '11' before, and adding '1' makes it '111'? The new substrings are:\n\nl=1: '1' → valid.\nl=2: '11' → valid.\nl=3: '111' → valid.\nSo the approach correctly adds 3 to the total.\n\nSo yes, the approach is correct.\n\nBut wait, the initial problem statement requires the count of all non-empty substrings that represent a valid Morse code. So each time a new character is added, any new substring that ends at that character and is valid must be counted.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nBut the problem is that for each new character, we need to check all possible l's (1-4), and for each l, check the last l characters.\n\nBut for S being built step by step, the last l characters can be obtained by slicing the string.\n\nBut for m=3000, this is acceptable, because each step is O(1) (since l is up to 4, and each check is O(1)).\n\nSo now, the main steps are:\n\n1. Precompute all valid Morse codes into a set.\n2. Initialize S as an empty string.\n3. For each modification:\n   a. Append the new character to S.\n   b. For l from 1 to 4:\n      i. If l > len(S): continue\n      ii. Substring = S[-l:]\n      iii. If substring is in the set: add 1 to the current answer.\n   c. Output the current answer mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the sample input shows that for the third case, the output is 1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833.\n\nLooking at the first case:\n\nAfter 3 modifications, S is '111'. The valid substrings are '1', '11', '111', which correspond to 3 substrings. Wait, but according to the note, the sample output after all modifications is 3, but in the note, it says the answer is 3. Wait, no, the sample output for the first case is '1\\n3\\n7', which suggests that after each step, the counts are 1, 3, 7.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sample. Let me check.\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is 3, followed by 1, 1, 1. So S becomes '1' → then '11' → then '111'.\n\nAfter each step:\n\nStep 1: S is '1' → only one substring, '1' which is valid. So output 1.\n\nStep 2: S is '11' → substrings '1', '11' → both valid. So output 2? But according to the sample, the second output is 3. Oh wait, the sample output is ['1\\n3\\n7', ...]. Hmm, that suggests that after the first step, the count is 1, after the second step, 3, after the third step, 7.\n\nWait, that doesn't align with my previous understanding. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the sample. Let me look again.\n\nSample Input:\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\nSample Output:\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\nWait, the first output is 3 lines, which suggests that the first test case had 3 modifications, each producing a line.\n\nWait, the first test case input is '3\\n1\\n1\\n1' which is m=3, and the output is three lines: 1, 3, 7.\n\nSo after the first step (S='1'), the output is 1.\n\nAfter the second step (S='11'), the output is 3.\n\nAfter the third step (S='111'), the output is 7.\n\nHmm, why does the second step give 3? Let's see what substrings are present.\n\nIn S='11', the possible substrings are:\n\nLength 1: '1' (valid), '1' (valid) → total 2.\n\nLength 2: '11' (valid) → 1.\n\nSo total 3. That's correct.\n\nAh, right! So when we add the second '1', the substrings are:\n\nAt position 2, the new substrings added are:\n\n- l=1: '1' (counted)\n- l=2: '11' (counted)\n\nSo the total increases by 2, making the total 1 (from first step) + 2 = 3.\n\nWait, no. Because the first step's total is 1, the second step adds 2 more (the new substrings '1' and '11').\n\nSo the approach of adding 1 for each valid substring each step is correct.\n\nSo in the second step, the new substrings are '1' (from position 2) and '11' (positions 1-2). Both are valid, so 2 new substrings, leading to a total of 1+2=3.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nSo, the initial idea is correct. Now, the next step is to implement this.\n\nBut wait, the approach of adding 1 for each valid substring each time is correct, but the way we process each step is to look back 1,2,3,4 steps.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each new character:\n\n- For l in 1 to 4:\n\n   - If l <= current length:\n\n      - Take the last l characters.\n\n      - If it's in the valid set, add 1 to the answer.\n\nThus, for each step, the new answer is the previous answer plus the number of new valid substrings ending at the current position.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize S as empty.\n\nans = 0\n\nvalid_codes = {precomputed set}\n\nfor each step:\n\n   c = read character\n\n   S += c\n\n   temp = 0\n\n   for l in 1..4:\n\n      if len(S) >= l:\n\n          substr = S[-l:]\n\n          if substr in valid_codes:\n\n              temp +=1\n\n   ans += temp\n\n   print(ans mod MOD)\n\nWait, but this is incorrect. Because for the same substr, like when S is '11', adding another '1' makes S '111'. Now, the substrings ending at the third '1' are:\n\n- l=1: '1' → valid → count 1.\n\n- l=2: '11' → valid → count 1.\n\n- l=3: '111' → valid → count 1.\n\nSo the temp is 3, and ans increases by 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut wait, the approach is to, for each step, compute the number of new substrings ending at the new character, and add that to the total. So the total is the sum of all such additions.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- Precompute the valid codes.\n\n- For each new character, compute the number of valid substrings ending at this character, considering all possible l's (1-4). Add this to the total.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as:\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\nvalid_codes = {\"0000\", \"0001\", ..., \"1111\" excluding the four invalid ones}\n\nWait, but the four invalid ones are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n\nSo I'll generate all possible 1-4 length binary strings, remove these four, and put the rest in the valid set.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the first thing is to generate this set.\n\nGenerating all possible binary strings of length 1-4:\n\nWe can use itertools.product('01', repeat=r) where r is from 1 to 4.\n\nFor each r, generate all possible combinations.\n\nThen, for each string, if it's not one of the four invalid ones, add it to the valid set.\n\nOnce the set is built, proceed.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead m.\n\nRead m lines, each line is a single character.\n\nInitialize S as an empty string.\n\nans = 0\n\nvalid_codes = set()\n\nfor r in 1 to 4:\n\n   for bits in itertools.product('01', repeat=r):\n\n       s = ''.join(bits)\n\n       if s not in invalid_set:\n\n           valid_codes.add(s)\n\ninvalid_set = {'0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'}\n\nSo that's the setup.\n\nThen, for each character in the input:\n\n   S += c\n\n   temp = 0\n\n   for l in 1 to 4:\n\n       if len(S) >= l:\n\n           substr = S[-l:]\n\n           if substr in valid_codes:\n\n               temp +=1\n\n   ans += temp\n\n   print(ans % MOD)\n\nWait, but that would not work for the sample.\n\nWait, in the first sample:\n\nAfter first addition, S is '1', which is in the valid set, so temp is 1. ans is 1.\n\nSecond addition: '11' → substrings '1' (new) and '11' (new). So temp is 2, ans is 3.\n\nThird addition: '111' → substrings '1', '11', '111' → all valid. So temp is 3, ans becomes 6.\n\nBut according to the sample, the third output is 7.\n\nWait, that's a discrepancy. So what's wrong here.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the sample.\n\nIn the first sample, the input is '3\\n1\\n1\\n1' → S becomes '111'.\n\nWhat are the valid substrings:\n\nAll possible substrings of '111':\n\nLength 1: three '1's → all valid.\n\nLength 2: two '11's → both valid.\n\nLength 3: one '111' → valid.\n\nTotal: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.\n\nBut the sample output after third step is 7.\n\nWait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, no, the sample output shows the third line as 7. So something is wrong with my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample counts all possible substrings, including those that are part of longer ones.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read it.\n\nThe problem says: the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\n\nEach such sequence corresponds to a unique English letter, but a substring can correspond to multiple letters if their Morse codes are different. No, wait, no. Each Morse code string is unique to a letter. So each substring that is a valid Morse code represents exactly one letter. So the count is the number of substrings that are valid Morse codes.\n\nWait, in the note, the sample after S is '111' has substrings '1', '11', '111', 'TT', 'TM', 'MT', 'TTT', 'O', etc. Wait, no, the note says that the substrings are:\n\n\"T\" (1), \"M\" (11), \"O\" (111), \"TT\" (11), \"TM\" (111), \"MT\" (111), \"TTT\" (111). So total 7 substrings.\n\nAh! So my approach is missing something. It's not just the number of substrings, but the number of sequences of letters that are formed by the substrings. Wait, no. The problem asks for the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented by some substring of S in Morse code.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misunderstood. It's the number of substrings that are valid Morse codes, regardless of what letters they represent. Because each valid Morse code corresponds to exactly one letter, but the problem is counting the number of substrings that are valid Morse codes, not the number of distinct letters.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no: each substring is a Morse code which corresponds to exactly one English letter. So each valid substring contributes one to the count, regardless of how many times it appears.\n\nWait, but the note says that after S is '111', the valid substrings are 7 in number, as listed. So in that case, the approach of counting each valid substring once is correct.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier calculation, the substrings for '111' are 3 (length 1) + 2 (length 2) + 1 (length 3) = 6.\n\nBut the note says 7. So what's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the note again.\n\nIn the note, it says:\n\nAs you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code, therefore, are as follows. \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\").\n\nSo the count is 7. So how?\n\nBecause each occurrence of a valid substring is considered as a separate sequence. For example, the '11' occurs in positions 0-1 and 1-2, so each occurrence is a separate sequence.\n\nSo in the '111' case, the valid substrings are:\n\nIndices 0-0: 1 → T.\n\n0-1: 11 → M.\n\n0-2: 111 → O.\n\n1-1: 1 → T.\n\n1-2: 11 → M.\n\n2-2: 1 → T.\n\nSo that's 7 substrings. So each occurrence of a valid substring is counted as a separate occurrence.\n\nAh! So the problem is to count all possible substrings that form a valid Morse code, regardless of whether they're the same Morse code or not. So in the '111' case, there are 7 valid substrings, each of which is a valid Morse code.\n\nSo my initial approach is wrong because it counts each unique Morse code once, but the problem requires counting each occurrence as a separate substring.\n\nOh no! So that's a big mistake. So the approach I thought of is incorrect.\n\nSo the problem is not about counting unique Morse codes, but the number of substrings that are valid Morse codes, even if they are the same as others.\n\nThis changes everything.\n\nSo for example, in the '111' case, the substrings are:\n\nPositions 0-0: '1' → valid.\n\n0-1: '11' → valid.\n\n0-2: '111' → valid.\n\n1-1: '1' → valid.\n\n1-2: '11' → valid.\n\n2-2: '1' → valid.\n\nThat's 7 substrings.\n\nSo for each new character, the number of new valid substrings added is the number of substrings ending at that character that are valid.\n\nThus, the approach needs to be modified.\n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\nFor each new character, for each possible l (1 to 4), check if the last l characters form a valid Morse code. For each such l, if yes, add 1 to the total.\n\nThus, the initial approach is correct.\n\nBut in the '111' case:\n\nWhen adding the third '1', we have l=1,2,3,4.\n\nBut for l=4, the string is only 3 characters, so it's skipped.\n\nSo l=1: '1' → valid → +1.\n\nl=2: '11' → valid → +1.\n\nl=3: '111' → valid → +1.\n\nSo the temp is 3, and ans increases by 3, making the total 1 (first step) + 2 (second step) + 3 (third step) = 6.\n\nBut according to the sample, it's 7.\n\nSo where's the mistake?\n\nAh, wait, in the third step, the new substrings are:\n\nThe new character is the third '1'.\n\nThe substrings ending at this position are:\n\nlength 1: '1' → valid.\n\nlength 2: '11' → valid.\n\nlength 3: '111' → valid.\n\nSo that's 3 new substrings, adding to the previous total of 3 (from first two steps). So the total is 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nBut the sample expects 7.\n\nSo clearly, there's a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the sample counts is that when the string is '111', the substrings are:\n\npositions 0-0: '1' → count 1.\n\n0-1: '11' → count 1.\n\n0-2: '111' → count 1.\n\n1-1: '1' → count 1.\n\n1-2: '11' → count 1.\n\n2-2: '1' → count 1.\n\nTotal 7.\n\nAh! So the new step adds 3 substrings, but the previous steps already had 4 substrings.\n\nWait, let's re-calculate:\n\nAfter first step (S='1'):\n\nsubstrings: 1.\n\nTotal:1.\n\nAfter second step (S='11'):\n\nsubstrings:\n\npositions 0-0:1.\n\n0-1:11.\n\n1-1:1.\n\nTotal:3.\n\nAfter third step (S='111'):\n\nsubstrings:\n\n0-0:1.\n\n0-1:11.\n\n0-2:111.\n\n1-1:1.\n\n1-2:11.\n\n2-2:1.\n\nTotal:7.\n\nSo the correct approach is to, for each step, consider all possible substrings that end at the new character, of lengths 1 to 4, and count each of them as a separate substring.\n\nSo, the initial approach of adding 1 for each valid substring is correct.\n\nBut then, why in the sample, after the third step, the count is 7, but according to the initial approach, the third step would add 3, making the total 1+2+3=6.\n\nHmm, that's the confusion.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is wrong, and instead, for each step, the number of new valid substrings is the sum of all valid substrings that end at the current position, regardless of their length.\n\nSo, for the first step:\n\nOnly '1' is added → count 1.\n\nSecond step:\n\nSubstrings ending at position 1: '1' (position 1) and '11' (positions 0-1) → count 2.\n\nThird step:\n\nSubstrings ending at position 2: '1' (pos2), '11' (pos1-2), '111' (pos0-2) → count 3.\n\nSo the total is 1+2+3=6.\n\nBut the sample shows 7.\n\nSo this suggests that the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial approach doesn't account for the fact that a new character can create new substrings of all possible lengths, not just up to 4.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each Morse code is at most 4 characters. So any substring longer than 4 is invalid.\n\nWait, but in the '111' example, the substrings are of lengths 1, 2, 3, which are all valid.\n\nSo the sample expects 7 substrings, but according to the initial approach, the third step adds 3, making the total 6.\n\nSo why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh! Because the problem is not about the count of substrings, but the count of sequences of letters. Wait, no. The problem says \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So each substring corresponds to one letter, but the same letter can appear multiple times.\n\nWait, no, the problem is not about the letters; it's about the substrings. So the problem is simply the count of all substrings of S that are valid Morse codes.\n\nSo in the '111' case, the valid substrings are 7.\n\nSo why does the initial approach count 6?\n\nBecause the initial approach is adding 1 for each l from 1 to 4, but in the third step, the current S is '111' which is length 3.\n\nSo for l=1: substr '1' → valid → count 1.\n\nl=2: substr '11' → valid → count 1.\n\nl=3: substr '111' → valid → count 1.\n\nBut in reality, there are 3 substrings ending at position 2, but in the initial approach, for each step, it's adding 3, making the total 1+2+3=6.\n\nBut the sample expects 7.\n\nSo this suggests that the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is missing that for each step, the new substrings are not only the ones ending at the current character, but also include the substrings that start earlier.\n\nNo, because each step is adding a single character, and the new substrings are those that end at this character.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the sample is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample is not matching because the problem is asking for the number of distinct Morse code strings that can be found in S, not the count of all possible substrings.\n\nBut the sample's note clearly lists 7 substrings, which implies that each occurrence is counted.\n\nSo, the problem is to count all possible substrings of S that are valid Morse codes.\n\nThus, the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, what's the correct approach?\n\nWe need to, for each new character, count all substrings ending at this character that are valid Morse codes, of lengths 1 to 4.\n\nEach such substring is a new occurrence, regardless of its content.\n\nSo for each new character, the number of new valid substrings is equal to the number of valid Morse codes of length 1, 2, 3, 4 that end at this character.\n\nThus, the initial approach is correct.\n\nBut in the '111' case, the third step would add 3 substrings, making the total 6, but the sample expects 7.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is incorrect, and I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering all possible substrings, including those of length 1, 2, 3, 4, but the initial approach only considers substrings of length 1 to 4, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample's note is incorrect, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is missing some cases.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the problem differently. Instead of checking the last l characters, perhaps for each new character, we can look back up to 3 steps, and for each possible starting position, check if the substring is valid.\n\nBut that would be O(m*4) time, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but for each new character, the number of possible substrings added is up to 4 (for l=1 to 4). So the initial approach is correct.\n\nBut why is the sample expecting 7 for '111' when according to the initial approach, the count is 6.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial approach is not considering all possible substrings, but only those that are exactly 1, 2, 3, or 4 characters. So, for example, in the '111' case, the substrings are:\n\n'1' (three times), '11' (two times), '111' (once). Total 7.\n\nBut according to the initial approach, for each step:\n\nStep 1: 1 → count 1.\n\nStep 2: two substrings → count 2.\n\nStep 3: three substrings → count 3.\n\nTotal 1+2+3=6.\n\nBut the sample expects 7.\n\nSo there's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, step 1: '1' → count 1.\n\nStep 2: '1' (position 1) and '11' → count 2. Total 1+2=3.\n\nStep 3: '1' (position 2), '11' (positions 1-2), '111' → count 3. Total 3+3=6.\n\nBut the sample expects 7.\n\nSo what's wrong here.\n\nAh! Wait, the problem is that the initial approach is only considering the last l characters, but in reality, for a given new character, there are more substrings that end at it beyond the last 4.\n\nNo, because a valid Morse code can't be longer than 4. So any substring longer than 4 is invalid.\n\nSo the initial approach is correct.\n\nBut why is the sample expecting 7.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way the sample is computed.\n\nIn the sample, after the third step, the total is 7, which includes all the substrings:\n\n1, 1, 1, 11, 11, 111.\n\nWait, that's 6 substrings. Or am I missing something.\n\nWait, let's list them:\n\nIndices (0-based):\n\n0-0: 1 → valid.\n\n0-1: 11 → valid.\n\n0-2: 111 → valid.\n\n1-1: 1 → valid.\n\n1-2: 11 → valid.\n\n2-2: 1 → valid.\n\nTotal 7 substrings.\n\nAh! So each occurrence of the same Morse code is counted as a separate substring.\n\nSo the count is 7, which is the sum of 3 substrings added in the third step and 4 from previous steps.\n\nWait, no. Because the first step added 1, second step added 2, third step added 3 → total 6.\n\nBut the actual count is 7.\n\nSo this suggests that the initial approach is undercounting.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is missing that for each step, the new character can form substrings of length 1, 2, 3, 4, but the initial approach only checks for the last l characters.\n\nBut wait, for l=4, the substring would require that the string has at least 4 characters. So for the third step, the string is '111' (length 3), so l=4 is not considered.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is correct, but the sample is considering other factors.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in the sample, the fourth step is not included, but the sample is considering all substrings.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the step count and the string length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the sample is not matching because of a miscalculation on my part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample is correct, and my approach is wrong, and I need to find another way to model the problem.\n\nAnother approach: For each position i, track the number of valid substrings ending at i for each possible length (1-4). Then, the total is the sum of all these counts.\n\nSo, for each new character c:\n\nFor l in 1 to 4:\n\n   if l > len(S): continue.\n\n   substr = S[-l:]\n\n   if substr in valid_codes: dp_i[l] += 1.\n\nThen, the total is the sum of dp_i[1] + dp_i[2] + dp_i[3} + dp_i[4}.\n\nSo, for each step, we can track these counts.\n\nIn the '111' case:\n\nAfter step 1 (S='1'):\n\ndp_1 = {1:1, 2:0, 3:0, 4:0}.\n\ntotal = 1.\n\nAfter step 2 (S='11'):\n\nCheck l=1: substr '1' → valid →",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty substrings of a given string `S` that correspond to valid Morse code representations of English letters after each modification to `S`.
