They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Mushroom Strife. Hmm. So the setup is that Pasha and Akim made a forest map where lawns are vertices and roads are edges. Each road has two numbers: GCD and LCM of the mushrooms on the connected lawns. But now, some of the map is torn, leaving only m roads. My task is to help restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn based on the given roads. If it's not possible, output NO; else, output any valid arrangement.\n\nThe input gives n and m, followed by m lines each with four numbers: the two lawns connected by the road, the GCD, and the LCM of their mushroom counts.\n\nHmm. So, how do I model this? It seems like a graph problem where each edge imposes constraints on the values of the nodes (lawns). Each node must have a value (number of mushrooms), and each edge enforces that for the two nodes u and v, the GCD of their values is g, and the LCM is l.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, GCD(u, v) = g and LCM(u, v) = l. Also, since GCD and LCM are related to two numbers, we know that the product of GCD and LCM equals the product of the two numbers. So u * v = g * l. Because GCD(u, v) * LCM(u, v) = u*v. So that's an important relation.\n\nSo for each edge, the pair of nodes u and v must satisfy u * v = g * l, and also GCD(u, v) must be g, and LCM must be l.\n\nSo, for each edge, we can express the constraints as:\n\nu * v = g * l,\n\nand\n\ng = GCD(u, v),\n\nl = LCM(u, v).\n\nSo how can I model this in code?\n\nThis sounds like a system of equations that needs to be satisfied across all edges. So each edge adds two constraints: one multiplicative (u*v=gl) and others about GCD and LCM.\n\nBut solving such a system might be tricky. Especially because the variables are integers, and the constraints could form cycles which may or may not be consistent.\n\nAn approach that comes to mind is to model this as a graph where each node's value is a variable, and each edge represents the constraints. Then, perhaps using a Union-Find data structure with additional information, or maybe building a system of equations and solving them.\n\nWait, but the variables are the node values. So perhaps we can model this as a constraint satisfaction problem, where for each edge, the constraints must hold between the two nodes.\n\nBut considering that the graph can have cycles, we need to make sure that all constraints along a cycle are compatible.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem allows any valid assignment, perhaps we can assign values step by step, ensuring that all constraints are met. But that's probably not feasible for large graphs, but given the constraints on the input (like GCD and LCM up to 106), maybe it's manageable.\n\nAnother idea is to model this as a system of equations where each equation is u * v = g * l, and then use BFS or DFS to assign values, checking for consistency.\n\nWait, but the problem isn't just about the product. The GCD and LCM also impose that certain conditions on u and v beyond just their product. For example, if the GCD is g, then both u and v must be multiples of g, and their quotient after dividing by g must be coprime.\n\nSo, let's think about each edge: u and v must satisfy u = g * a, v = g * b, where a and b are coprime (since GCD(u, v) = g). Also, LCM(u, v) = g * a * b, because LCM(g*a, g*b) = g * LCM(a, b) = g * a*b since a and b are coprimes.\n\nSo for each edge, the product u*v = g*l, and substituting u = g*a and v = g*b, we get g^2 * a*b = g*l → g*a*b = l. So l must be divisible by g, because a*b is integer.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says that the initial roads have GCD and LCM at least 1 and at most 106. So for each edge, the given g and l must satisfy that l is a multiple of g. Because from the above, l = g * a*b, and a and b are positive integers.\n\nWait, no. Because for any two numbers, GCD(u, v) divides both u and v, and LCM(u, v) is a multiple of both. So u and v are multiples of g, and l must be a multiple of g. So yes, for each edge, l mod g must be zero. Otherwise, the given edge is invalid, meaning no solution exists.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the initial map's roads had GCD and LCM >=1 and <=106. So in the input, for each edge, GCD and LCM are within that range. But that doesn't necessarily mean that for that edge, LCM is a multiple of GCD. So in our code, we need to check whether for each edge, l % g == 0. If any edge doesn't satisfy this, then the answer is NO.\n\nBecause if g doesn't divide l, then it's impossible to have u and v such that their GCD is g and LCM is l.\n\nSo the first thing to do is check all edges: for each, compute l % g. If any is not zero, output NO.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nSo step 1: For each edge, compute g and l. Check if l mod g == 0. If any fails, output NO.\n\nThen, for each edge, set l = g * k, where k is l/g.\n\nNow, each edge can be represented as:\n\nu = g * a,\n\nv = g * b,\n\nwhere a and b are coprime, and a * b = k.\n\nBut a and b must be coprimes.\n\nSo for each edge, we can represent the possible factors a and b as divisors of k, with a and b being coprimes.\n\nBut since a and b are positive integers, we can factor k into its possible pairs (a, b) where a*b=k and GCD(a,b)=1.\n\nWait, but since a and b can be swapped, but the direction matters in the graph. So perhaps for each edge, there are multiple possibilities for a and b, which affect the assignments of u and v.\n\nThis seems complicated. How can we model this?\n\nPerhaps, for each node, we can keep track of possible values it can take, based on the constraints from the edges connected to it.\n\nBut for a graph with n nodes and m edges, this could be computationally intensive, especially if n is large. But considering that the maximum n is 10^5 or something? No, wait, the problem statement doesn't specify the constraints on n and m. So perhaps n can be up to 1e5, making a brute-force approach impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartitioning graph, where each edge enforces a relationship between the nodes, and we can find a way to assign variables such that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nAnother approach: model this as a system of equations. For each edge, u * v = g * l.\n\nEach edge adds an equation: u * v = C (where C is g * l). So this is a nonlinear equation, which is difficult to solve directly.\n\nBut perhaps, for each connected component in the graph, we can assign a value to one node (like setting it to 1), and then compute the rest of the nodes' values based on the edges.\n\nBut wait, if a connected component is a tree, then this is possible. However, if it's a cycle, we need to ensure that the equations are consistent around the cycle.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each connected component in the graph:\n\n   a. Choose a root node, say node 1, and assign it a value (like 1).\n\n   b. Traverse the graph, assigning values to other nodes based on the edges, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.\n\n   c. If during this process, a contradiction is found (i.e., a node is assigned conflicting values), output NO.\n\n2. After processing all components, check whether the assignments satisfy all the edges' constraints. If yes, output YES and the values; else, NO.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nI think we can model this using BFS or DFS, keeping track of the values as we go, and checking for consistency.\n\nLet me think about how this would work. Suppose we have a node u with value x. An edge connects u to v, with GCD g and LCM l. As before, l must be a multiple of g. So l = g * k.\n\nThen, u * v = g * l → x * v = g * (g * k) → v = (g² k) / x.\n\nBut wait, v must be an integer. So x must divide g² k.\n\nAlso, since GCD(x, v) must be g, and LCM(x, v) must be l.\n\nWait, let me re-express this. Since u = x, and v = (g^2 k)/x, then:\n\nGCD(x, v) = g.\n\nWhich implies that x is a multiple of g, and v is a multiple of g.\n\nSo x = g * a, v = g * b.\n\nThen, a and b must be coprimes.\n\nAnd x * v = g² a b = g l → g a b = l → a b = l / g = k.\n\nSo a and b are coprimes, and a*b = k.\n\nThus, for each edge, the possible a and b pairs are the factorizations of k into coprimes.\n\nSo for each edge, once x is known, v can be determined as (g^2 k) / x.\n\nBut when x is known, v is determined. So during traversal, for each neighbor, we can calculate the required value and check if it's consistent with existing assignments.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\n- For each connected component, perform BFS/DFS.\n\n- Assign a starting node a value, say 1 (but wait, why 1? Because any other value could be chosen, but choosing 1 simplifies things.)\n\n- Then, for each adjacent edge, compute the required value for the next node.\n\n- If the next node hasn't been assigned yet, assign it and proceed.\n\n- If the next node is already assigned, check if the computed value matches. If not, return NO.\n\nBut the starting value is arbitrary. Choosing 1 might not always work, because perhaps the constraints require a different initial value.\n\nWait, but perhaps each connected component can be considered as a system where all variables are determined relative to the starting node. So the choice of the starting value (like 1) affects the entire component.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, no. Because the variables are linked via multiplicative constraints. So choosing the starting value as 1 might fix the entire component's values, but the component may not have a solution unless the constraints are consistent.\n\nBut perhaps the starting node can be assigned a variable value, say x, and then propagate the constraints.\n\nBut that's more complex, as we'd have to manage variables that can take any value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each connected component can be checked for consistency by trying all possible assignments, but that's impractical for large components.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should model the problem using a Union-Find data structure with additional information, but I'm not sure how to handle the multiplicative constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node, we can track its value in terms of a base variable. Like, each node's value is a multiple of some base, and the edges define how these multiples relate.\n\nBut I'm not exactly sure how to model this.\n\nAnother approach: for each connected component, pick a root node and assign it a value of 1. Then, for each edge connected to it, compute the required value of the connected node. Then, proceed recursively or iteratively, checking for conflicts.\n\nBut wait, this approach might not work because the starting node's value can't always be 1. For example, if the component has a cycle, the constraints must loop back correctly.\n\nWait, but perhaps if the component is a tree, it's possible, but for cycles, it's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each connected component can be represented as a system of equations, and we can check for consistency.\n\nBut solving such systems is non-trivial, especially with multiplicative equations.\n\nWait, perhaps I can represent each node's value as a variable, and each edge as an equation u*v = C (C is g*l). Then, for each connected component, the system must be consistent.\n\nBut solving such a system is difficult because it's a nonlinear system.\n\nSo, perhaps the only way is to model this with BFS, assigning values as we go and checking for consistency.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. For each node, if it's unvisited, start BFS.\n\n2. Assign the starting node a value (say, 1), but later, this might not be correct, but let's see.\n\n3. For each edge from the current node, compute the required value of the neighbor.\n\n4. If the neighbor hasn't been visited, assign it the computed value and proceed.\n\n5. If the neighbor has been visited, check if the computed value matches the existing value. If not, return NO.\n\n6. Continue until all nodes are processed.\n\n7. After processing all components, verify that all edges' constraints are satisfied. Because sometimes, the BFS might have assigned values in a way that satisfies the BFS steps but misses some constraints elsewhere.\n\nWait, but wait. Because the BFS assigns the value based on the starting node's value, which is fixed as 1. So if the component's constraints allow for another starting value, this method might fail.\n\nBut perhaps the starting node's value can be determined based on the constraints.\n\nWait, for example, suppose the component is a single node with no edges. Then, it can have any value, but in our case, the problem requires us to choose any valid arrangement. So in that case, we can assign 1.\n\nBut for a component with edges, the starting node's value is determined by the constraints.\n\nHmm, perhaps the starting node's value is not arbitrary but must be determined based on the constraints. That complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps each connected component can be considered a tree, and thus, the starting node's value can be chosen as 1, and then the rest can be determined accordingly. But if the component has cycles, this might cause inconsistencies unless the constraints are satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the component can be treated as a directed graph where each edge enforces a certain relationship, and we can model the dependencies between the nodes.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: since the product of u and v is fixed (u*v = g*l), perhaps the value of u can be expressed as (g*l)/v. So, for each edge, u and v are dependent on each other.\n\nBut again, how to model this in a way that can be solved.\n\nWait, perhaps for each connected component, we can choose one node to be the 'root', and assign it a variable x. Then, for each edge, express other nodes in terms of x.\n\nFor example, if the root is u, and an edge connects u to v, then v = (g*l)/u. Similarly, if v is connected to w, then w = (g'*l')/v = (g'*l')/(g*l/u) = (g' * l' * u)/(g*l).\n\nContinuing this way, each node's value can be expressed in terms of the root's value x.\n\nOnce all nodes are expressed in terms of x, we can substitute back into the equations and see if the constraints are satisfied for any x.\n\nBut since x must be a positive integer, we can look for x that makes all node values integers.\n\nMoreover, for the component, after substituting all nodes in terms of x, any edges in the component must satisfy the original constraints.\n\nWait, but how to represent this substitution?\n\nIt's getting complicated. Maybe I can model the component as a graph where each node's value is a function of x. Then, for each edge, the function must satisfy the constraints.\n\nBut this seems abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each connected component, the possible values of x (the root's value) must be a divisor of a certain product, and all other nodes' values are determined from x.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about a simple example. Suppose we have a component with three nodes: A, B, C.\n\nEdges:\n\nA-B: GCD=2, LCM=6 → g=2, l=6 → product is 12. So u*v=12.\n\nSo u = 2a, v=2b, a*b=3, and a and b are coprimes.\n\nPossible (a, b) pairs: (1,3) and (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, another edge: B-C with GCD=3, LCM=15 → product is 45.\n\nSo u=3c, v=3d, c*d=5, c and d coprimes.\n\nPossible (c,d): (1,5), (5,1).\n\nAnother edge: A-C with GCD=1, LCM=30 → product 30.\n\nSo u=1*e, v=1*f, e*f=30, and GCD(e,f)=1.\n\nPossible (e,f) pairs: many.\n\nNow, if A is the root, and we assign A= x.\n\nThen B = (g*l)/x = (2*6)/x = 12/x.\n\nBut B must be 2b, so 12/x = 2b → b = 6/x.\n\nBut since b must be an integer, x must divide 6.\n\nSimilarly, B is connected to C via GCD=3, LCM=15.\n\nSo for B and C: B * C = 3*15=45.\n\nBut B is 12/x, so C = 45/(12/x) ) = (45x)/12 = (15x)/4.\n\nBut C must be 3d, so (15x)/4 =3d → d=5x/(4).\n\nSince d must be integer, 4 must divide 5x. But 5 and 4 are coprime, so 4 must divide x.\n\nBut earlier, x must divide 6. So x must be a common divisor of 6 and 4.\n\nThe common divisors are 1, 2.\n\nSo x can be 1 or 2.\n\nCase 1: x=1.\n\nThen, B=12/1=12.\n\nBut B is 2b → 12=2b → b=6.\n\nBut for the first edge, a*b=3 → a=3/b=3/6=0.5 → not integer. So invalid.\n\nThus, x=1 is invalid.\n\nCase 2: x=2.\n\nThen, B=12/2=6.\n\nB is 2b → 6=2b → b=3.\n\nCheck a*b=3 → a=1.\n\nSo a=1, b=3.\n\nThen, for the B-C edge: B=6, so C=45/6=7.5 → not integer. So invalid.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the B-C edge, the GCD is 3, LCM is 15.\n\nSo B=6, C must be such that GCD(6, C)=3 and LCM(6, C)=15.\n\nBut wait, 15 is the LCM of 6 and C. What is the LCM of 6 and C?\n\nIf C is 7.5, then the LCM of 6 and 7.5 is 30, because 7.5 is 15/2, 6 is 6/1. The LCM is (6*7.5)/gcd(6,7.5) = (45)/ (3) =15. Oh, wait, no. Wait, 6 is 2*3, 7.5 is 15/2. So the LCM is 2*3*5 =30.\n\nBut the edge says the LCM must be 15. So that's a conflict. Thus, x=2 is invalid.\n\nHmm. So in this case, the component has no solution, so the overall answer is NO.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the way I chose the root and the edges. Or maybe the initial setup was incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the way I'm choosing the root and assigning x=1 is causing issues. Maybe I should allow the root to be assigned a variable that can be determined based on the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach of fixing the root's value is flawed.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to proceed is to model each node's value as a variable, and for each edge, express the relationship between the variables.\n\nBut how to find a solution for this system of equations.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a system where each node's value is a multiple of a base value, and the edges define how these multiples relate.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Since each edge enforces u*v = g*l, perhaps for each connected component, the product of all the node values in the component is equal to the product of all the g*l for the edges in the component.\n\nWait, because each edge contributes a multiplicative factor of g*l. So for a component with k edges, the product of all node values would be the product of (g*l) for each edge.\n\nBut wait, that depends on the structure of the component.\n\nNo, that's not correct because each node is involved in multiple edges, so the same node appears in multiple products.\n\nSo that approach isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product of all node values in the component is the product of all (g*l) for the edges, but considering that each edge is part of a tree structure.\n\nWait, perhaps for a tree, the product of all node values is the product of the (g*l) for each edge.\n\nBut in a cyclic component, this may not hold.\n\nHmm. Not sure.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to model the problem as a system where each node's value is determined by the root, and for each edge, the root's value is a divisor of certain values.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. For each edge, check that l is divisible by g. If any edge fails this, output NO.\n\n2. For each connected component:\n\n   a. Choose a root node. Let's call it r.\n\n   b. Assign r a variable x (the value of r).\n\n   c. For each node in the component, express its value in terms of x.\n\n      i. For each edge from r to its neighbor u, express u's value as (g*l)/r_value.\n\n      ii. Then, for each neighbor of u, express their value similarly, and so on.\n\n   d. Once all nodes are expressed in terms of x, for each edge in the component, substitute the expressions and check if the resulting equation is satisfied for some x.\n\n3. If any component has no solution, output NO.\n\n4. Otherwise, assign x to r, and compute the values for all nodes.\n\nBut implementing this requires a way to represent each node's value as a function of x and track the constraints on x.\n\nBut this seems quite involved.\n\nAnother Idea: Since each edge enforces u * v = g * l, perhaps the values of u and v can be represented as multiples of their GCD. So, for each edge, u = g * a, v = g * b, where a and b are coprimes and a * b = l/g.\n\nThen, the problem reduces to ensuring that for each edge, a and b are coprimes, and a * b = k (where k = l/g).\n\nThis way, the problem becomes assigning a and b to each edge such that all the constraints are satisfied across the entire graph.\n\nBut how to model this in a way that can be efficiently computed.\n\nPerhaps, for each node, we can track the possible factors a and b, but that's getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each edge represents a possible a and b pair, and we need to assign a and b such that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut again, this seems unclear.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps the best approach is to model this with BFS, assigning values as we go, and handling any inconsistencies.\n\nSo, let's try to outline the BFS approach:\n\n- For each node, keep a dictionary of possible values. Initially, all are unassigned.\n\n- For each connected component, pick a starting node and assign it a value (say 1), then explore its neighbors.\n\n- For each edge from u to v, compute the required value of v as (g*l)/u's current value.\n\n- If v is unassigned, assign it and proceed.\n\n- If v is already assigned, check if it matches the computed value. If not, return NO.\n\n- Continue this process for all nodes.\n\nBut the problem is that the starting value (like 1) might not be correct. So perhaps the component's constraints may require a different initial value.\n\nWait, but perhaps the starting node's value can be determined based on the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the starting node can have any value, and the BFS will assign the rest accordingly.\n\nBut in practice, this may not work because the initial assignment could lock the component into an invalid state.\n\nHmm. Perhaps the only way to proceed is to try all possible values for the starting node, but that's not feasible for large n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the starting node's value is determined by the constraints.\n\nWait, for each edge, the product u*v is fixed. So, in a connected component, the product of all node values is equal to the product of (g*l) for all edges, multiplied by some factors based on the structure of the component.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because each edge is part of a tree-like structure, but cycles complicate things.\n\nHmm. Another Idea: Since each edge's u*v = g*l, perhaps the values of the nodes can be determined in a way that all edges are satisfied.\n\nSo, for each connected component:\n\n- Choose a root node, assign it a value x.\n\n- For each edge, compute the required value of the connected node.\n\n- If during this process, a node is encountered that has already been assigned, check if the new value matches. If not, it's impossible.\n\nBut how to choose x.\n\nWait, perhaps x can be any value that satisfies the constraints for the component.\n\nBut how to find x.\n\nWait, perhaps x must be a divisor of the product of certain values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the component's constraints can be reduced to x must be a divisor of a particular value.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for the root node, the value x is determined by the constraints of the edges connected to it.\n\nFor example, if the root has edges that connect it to nodes u1, u2, etc., then x must be such that each u_i is (g_i * l_i)/x, and these u_i must be integers.\n\nSo, x must be a common divisor of all (g_i * l_i) for the edges connected to the root.\n\nMoreover, the values of the u_i must be consistent with their own edges.\n\nBut this seems manageable.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n   Find all the edges connected to the root.\n\n   Compute the product of (g_i * l_i) for these edges.\n\n   x must be a common divisor of all these products.\n\n   Then, for each edge connected to the root, compute u_i = (g_i * l_i) / x.\n\n   Then, for each u_i, check if it's possible to assign their connected edges, and so on.\n\nBut this is still quite involved.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps the BFS approach is manageable, but with a caveat: the starting node's value is not fixed to 1, but instead, it's determined by the constraints of the edges.\n\nWait, perhaps the starting node's value can be determined as the greatest common divisor of all the (g_i * l_i) for the edges connected to it.\n\nBecause x must divide each (g_i * l_i), so the maximum possible x is the GCD of all these products.\n\nBut perhaps that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal possible x is 1.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the starting node's value can be set to the product of certain primes, but that's not helpful.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: For each connected component, the product of all node values must be equal to the product of (g_i * l_i) for all edges in the component, divided by the product of the roots.\n\nWait, that might not hold due to the structure of the component.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each connected component, the product of all node values is equal to the product of (g_i * l_i) for all edges in the component.\n\nBecause each edge contributes a multiplicative factor of g*l, and each node is involved in multiple edges.\n\nBut that's not accurate because each node is counted multiple times in the product.\n\nSo, perhaps it's not the right path.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps I should proceed with the BFS approach, even if it's not perfect, and see.\n\nSo, here's how the code can be structured:\n\n- Read the input.\n\n- For each edge, check if l % g != 0. If any, output NO.\n\n- Build the graph as an adjacency list. Each entry contains the connected node, g, l.\n\n- For each node, if not visited, perform BFS.\n\n- Assign the starting node a value, say 1.\n\n- For each edge from the current node, compute the required value of the neighbor.\n\n- If the neighbor is unvisited, assign it and proceed.\n\n- If the neighbor is visited, check if the assigned value matches. If not, output NO.\n\n- Proceed until all nodes are processed.\n\n- After processing all components, output YES and the node values.\n\nBut wait, the starting node's value is 1. What if the constraints require a different value?\n\nIn the sample input provided, let's see:\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n3 3\n\n3 2 1 2\n\n3 1 1 10\n\n2 1 1 3\n\nWait, the output is 5 1 2.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nEdge 1: 3 and 2. GCD 2, LCM 2.\n\nSo u=3, v=2.\n\nu*v=6 = 2*3 → 2*3=6.\n\nSo, yes.\n\nEdge 2: 3 and 3. Wait, no, the input line is 3 1 1 10.\n\nWait, no, the input line is: 3 2\\n3 2 1 2 → that's probably a typo in the problem statement.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to refer to the actual input as per the problem statement.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nIn any case, the BFS approach may work for the sample.\n\nBut the sample input 3's output is 5 1 2.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nLawns 3, 2, 1.\n\nEdges:\n\n3-2: GCD 2, LCM 1 → product 2*1=2.\n\n3-3: No, perhaps it's a typo. Or perhaps the edges are:\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\nThe third test case input is:\n\n3 3\n\n3 2 1 2 → connects 3 and 2, g=2, l=1.\n\n3 1 1 10 → connects 3 and 1, g=1, l=10.\n\n2 1 3 7 → connects 2 and 1, g=1, l=7.\n\nWait, no, the input lines are:\n\nAfter the first line, each line is four numbers: u, v, g, l.\n\nSo for the third test case, the three edges are:\n\n3 2 2 1 → u=3, v=2, g=2, l=1.\n\n3 1 1 10 → u=3, v=1, g=1, l=10.\n\n2 1 1 3 → u=2, v=1, g=1, l=3.\n\nSo, the BFS starts at node 3.\n\nAssign 3 a value of 1.\n\nThen, process edge 3-2: g=2, l=1.\n\nCompute 2's value as (2*1)/3's value = 2*1/1 = 2. Assign 2.\n\nThen, process edge 3-1: g=1, l=10 → 1's value is (1*10)/3's value = 10/1 =10. Assign 1=10.\n\nThen, process edge 2-1: g=1, l=3 → 1's value is (1*3)/2's value → 3/2 → 1.5, which is not integer. So inconsistency detected. Thus, the component is invalid.\n\nBut the sample output for this case is YES with 5 1 2.\n\nSo, the BFS approach with starting node 3 as 1 is invalid, but there's a valid assignment.\n\nSo, perhaps the BFS approach is not sufficient, as it's starting with an arbitrary value that may not lead to a valid solution.\n\nThus, the problem is that the BFS approach with a fixed starting value may not capture all possible valid assignments, leading to false negatives.\n\nTherefore, the BFS approach may not work, as it can miss possible solutions by choosing an invalid starting value.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as a system where each node's value is a variable, and each edge imposes constraints between the variables. Then, the problem reduces to solving a system of equations where each equation is u * v = g * l.\n\nBut solving such a system is challenging, especially for larger n and m.\n\nAlternative Idea: Use a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure with additional information to track the product relationships.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps each node can be part of a DSU structure, and for each set, we can track the product of variables in terms of the root.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea: Represent the problem as a bipartite graph, but I don't see how that applies here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a system of equations where each equation is u_i * u_j = k_ij, and we need to find a solution for all u_i variables.\n\nThis is a system of nonlinear equations, which is difficult to solve.\n\nBut perhaps, for small components, we can try all possible values for the root, and see if any leads to a solution.\n\nBut for larger components, this would be computationally expensive.\n\nBut given the constraints on g and l (up to 106), perhaps the components are manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n   Try all possible divisors of the product of all edges' (g*l) for the component.\n\n   For each possible divisor x:\n\n      Assign the root node as x.\n\n      Propagate the constraints to other nodes.\n\n      Check for consistency.\n\n      If any x leads to a valid assignment, proceed.\n\n   If no x leads to a valid assignment, output NO.\n\nBut how to find the possible x values.\n\nWait, the x must be a divisor of all (g*l) for edges connected to the root.\n\nSo, for the root node, collect all edges connected to it.\n\nCompute the product of (g*l) for these edges.\n\nFind all possible divisors of this product.\n\nThese are the possible x values for the root.\n\nFor each x, attempt to assign it to the root, and then propagate the constraints.\n\nIf any x results in a valid assignment, proceed.\n\nElse, the component is invalid.\n\nThis seems manageable, but computationally heavy for components with many edges.\n\nBut given that the maximum g and l are 106, the product for each edge is up to 106*106=11236. So for a component with 10 edges, the product is 11236^10, which is way beyond manageable. So this approach is not feasible.\n\nThus, alternative Idea: Since each edge in the component contributes a multiplicative factor of (g*l), but the component is connected, perhaps the root's value x must be a divisor of the product of all (g*l) in the component, divided by the product of the other edges.\n\nBut this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps I should proceed with the BFS approach, even though it may not cover all cases, but see if it passes the sample test cases.\n\nBut in the sample test case, the BFS approach would fail because the starting node is assigned 1, leading to an inconsistency, but a valid assignment exists with the root assigned 5.\n\nSo, the BFS approach would incorrectly output NO, while the correct output is YES.\n\nThus, the BFS approach is insufficient.\n\nThus, I need a different approach.\n\nAlternative Idea: Model each node's value as a variable, and for each edge, add the equation u * v = g * l.\n\nThen, for each connected component, check if this system of equations has a solution.\n\nBut solving this system is non-trivial.\n\nBut perhaps, for each connected component, we can find the product of all edges' (g*l) and see if it's possible to distribute the factors among the nodes.\n\nWait, but again, not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the problem differently.\n\nEach edge enforces that u * v = g * l.\n\nSuppose we have a connected component where all the edges form a tree.\n\nThen, the product of all the node values can be determined as the product of all (g*l) for the edges.\n\nBut in a",
