Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Lanterns.\" Hmm.\n\nSo, the setup is that Vanya is walking along a straight street of length l. There are n lanterns placed along this street. Each lantern can light all points within a distance d from it. The goal is to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nWait, right. So, the street goes from 0 to l on a number line. Each lantern is at some position ai, and when they light up with radius d, their coverage is [ai - d, ai + d]. But since the street is from 0 to l, any part beyond 0 or l isn't part of the street. So, for each lantern, the effective coverage is the intersection of [ai -d, ai +d] with [0, l].\n\nThe task is to find the smallest possible d such that the union of all these covered intervals covers the entire [0, l] interval.\n\nHmm. How do I model this? Well, the minimal d would be determined by the gaps between the covered areas of the lanterns. So, perhaps we can think of the maximum gap between consecutive points where the coverage ends and the next begins. That maximum gap divided by two (since each lantern contributes to covering from both sides) would give the required d.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think more carefully. The street needs to be fully covered. So, the combined effect of all lanterns must cover every point from 0 to l.\n\nOne approach is to sort the lantern positions and then compute the intervals they cover, considering their d. Then find the minimal d such that all the gaps between adjacent intervals are covered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the problem as finding the minimal d such that the leftmost point is covered from the left side, the rightmost from the right side, and any middle points are covered by overlapping regions.\n\nWait, but that might not capture all cases, especially when multiple lanterns are involved.\n\nAnother approach: Sort the lantern positions in increasing order. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, determine the required overlap between their coverage areas to eliminate any gaps.\n\nLet me try to outline steps:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions in non-decreasing order.\n2. Consider the street as being divided into segments by the lanterns' positions. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, ai and ai+1, compute the necessary d such that their coverage overlaps enough to cover the entire segment between them.\n3. Additionally, consider the beginning (before the first lantern) and the end (after the last lantern). For the beginning, the first lantern must cover from 0 up to some point. Similarly, the last lantern must cover from its position back to l.\n\nSo, the minimal d is the maximum of two values:\n- The required d to cover the area between two consecutive lanterns.\n- The required d to cover the start or end of the street.\n\nWait, let's formalize this.\n\nAfter sorting the lanterns, let's add 0 and l as virtual lanterns at the ends. Or perhaps, just handle the ends separately.\n\nFor each i from 0 to n-1:\n   The current lantern is at position a[i], and the next is at a[i+1].\n   The distance between a[i] and a[i+1] is delta = a[i+1] - a[i].\n   The minimal required coverage between them is delta. But how does d affect this?\n\nWait, each lantern's coverage is a circle of radius d, so the coverage on the line is from a[i]-d to a[i]+d. But for two consecutive lanterns, their coverages must overlap enough to cover the entire delta distance.\n\nSo, for the two lanterns at x and y (x < y), the maximum coverage between them is when the rightmost point of the left lantern (y) and the leftmost point of the right lantern (x) meet or exceed y.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if the rightmost point of the left lantern is x + d, and the leftmost point of the right lantern is y - d. For their coverages to overlap, x + d >= y - d, which implies that d >= (y - x)/2.\n\nBut wait, that's only for their coverage to touch. To have the coverage completely cover the interval [x, y], the union of their coverage must include [x, y]. So the minimal d is such that the rightmost point of the left lantern plus d is at least y, and the leftmost point of the right lantern minus d is at least x.\n\nWait, no. Because if the left lantern is at x, its coverage is [x-d, x+d]. The right lantern is at y, coverage [y-d, y+d]. The union of these two must cover the interval [x, y].\n\nWait, so the union must include all points from x to y.\n\nWhat's the condition for that? The right end of the left coverage (x+d) must be >= y, and the left end of the right coverage (y -d) must be <=x. But wait, no, because if x +d >= y, then [x, y] is covered by the left lantern's right end. Similarly, if y -d <=x, then [x, y] is covered by the right lantern's left end. But perhaps one of them is sufficient.\n\nWait, actually, if the right end of the left lantern's coverage is >= y, then the entire [x, y] is covered by the left lantern's right coverage, because [x, y] is between x and y, and x+d >= y.\n\nSimilarly, if the left end of the right lantern's coverage is <=x, then [x, y] is covered by the right's left coverage.\n\nSo, the condition is that either x +d >= y OR y -d <=x. But to cover [x,y], the union must include all of [x,y]. So, the minimal d is such that x +d >= y, because that's a sufficient condition. Alternatively, if y -d <=x, that also works.\n\nWait, but if x +d >= y, then the left lantern's coverage reaches y, so the entire [x,y] is covered by the left lantern. Similarly, if y -d <=x, then the right lantern covers x, so entire [x,y] is covered.\n\nWait, but what if neither of those conditions holds? Then, there's a gap between the two lanterns' coverage areas. For example, suppose x=2, y=5. If d is 1, then x+d=3 <5, and y-d=4>2. So the coverage is [1,3] and [4,6]. The union is [1,3] U [4,6], which leaves a gap from 3 to4. So, the entire [2,5] is not covered.\n\nSo, to have the entire [x,y] covered, the sum of the left lantern's right coverage and the right lantern's left coverage must cover the entire interval.\n\nWait, that is: x +d >= y AND y -d <=x. Because then the left lantern's coverage starts before x and ends after y, and the right's starts before x and ends after y. Wait, no, perhaps that's overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: the minimal d required for two consecutive lanterns at x and y (x < y) is such that the maximum of (y - x) / 2, 0) is needed. Because the minimal d is half the distance between them.\n\nWait, let's see: if the two lanterns are at x and y, with y =x + delta. Then, to cover the entire [x, y], each must contribute. The left lantern's right coverage is x +d, and the right's left coverage is y -d. To cover the entire [x, y], we need x +d >= y and y -d <=x.\n\nBut substituting y =x + delta, the first condition becomes x +d >=x + delta → d >= delta.\n\nThe second condition becomes (x + delta) -d <=x → delta -d <=0 → d >=delta.\n\nSo both conditions require d >=delta. So, the minimal d is delta.\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be right. For example, in the sample input 2: 2 lanterns at 2 and5. The distance between them is 3. So d has to be 3/2=1.5? But according to the sample output, d is 2. So that suggests my reasoning is wrong.\n\nWait, let's look at the sample input 2:\n\nInput:\n7 15\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nWait, wait no. Oh no, the second sample in the problem statement is:\n\nInput:\n2 5\n2 5\n\nSo, the lanterns are at 2 and 5. The street is 5 units long.\n\nWait, in this case, each lantern has to cover certain parts. The first lantern at 2, with d=2, covers from 0 to4. The second at5, with d=2, covers from3 to7. So together, they cover 0-4 and3-7. So the entire 0-5 is covered. So d=2 is sufficient.\n\nBut according to my previous calculation, the distance between 2 and5 is3, so d should be 1.5. But why is d 2 needed?\n\nAh, because the initial approach was wrong. It's not enough to have d >=delta/2. Because in this case, delta is3, delta/2 is1.5, but d=1.5 would make the first lantern cover up to 3.5, and the second cover down to3.5. So the coverage would be 2-3.5 (from first) and5-3.5 (which doesn't make sense because 5>3.5). Wait, no, 5-1.5 is3.5. So the second lantern's coverage is3.5 to5+1.5=6.5. So the union is2-3.5 and3.5-6.5. But the street is up to5, so the union covers 2-6.5, but the street is 0-5. So from0-2, the first lantern's coverage is 0-3.5, which covers 0-5, but wait, 2-3.5 is covered by first, and 3.5-5 is covered by the second. So wait, perhaps d=1.5 is sufficient.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, the correct answer is 2. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the sample. Let me recheck.\n\nIn the note, it says that with d=2, the first lantern covers [0,4], the second covers [3,5]. So 0-4 and3-5, which together cover 0-5.\n\nWait, but if d=1.5, then the first lantern covers 0.5 to3.5, and the second covers3.5 to6.5. So the union would be0.5-6.5, which covers the entire street 0-5. So why is the sample answer 2 instead of 1.5?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sample input. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\n['2 5\\n2 5']\n\nSo n=2, l=5. The lanterns are at2 and5.\n\nWait, wait, the street is from0 to5. So the first lantern is at2, the second at5.\n\nWith d=2, first covers0-4, second covers3-7. So the street from0-5 is covered.\n\nIf d=1.5, first covers0-3.5, second covers3.5-6.5. So the union is0-6.5, which covers 0-5. So why is the sample output 2.0?\n\nHmm, that suggests that my initial understanding of the problem is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the coverage. Maybe the lanterns' coverage is from ai -d to ai +d, but if ai -d is less than 0, it starts at 0, and ai +d cannot exceed l, it ends at l.\n\nNo, that's not correct. The lantern's coverage is from max(0, ai -d) to min(l, ai +d).\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because the street is from0 to l. So the coverage of a lantern is the intersection of [ai -d, ai +d] with [0, l]. So, the actual coverage is [max(0, ai -d), min(l, ai +d)].\n\nSo for the sample input 2:\n\nFirst lantern at2, d=1.5: coverage is [2-1.5, 2+1.5] = [0.5, 3.5]. Intersection with [0,5] is 0.5-3.5.\n\nSecond lantern at5, d=1.5: coverage is [5-1.5,5+1.5] = [3.5,6.5]. Intersection with [0,5] is3.5-5.\n\nSo the union is0.5-3.5 U 3.5-5 → 0.5-5, which covers the entire street. So with d=1.5, the street is fully covered.\n\nBut according to the sample, the correct answer is2.0.\n\nHmm, this is conflicting. So something is wrong here.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: the output for the second sample is '2.0000000000'.\n\nSo the correct answer is2. But according to my calculation, d=1.5 would suffice.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says that the lanterns may be located at the ends of the street. So the coverage is the entire street if the lantern is at0 or l, regardless of d.\n\nWait, no, because for a lantern at0, the coverage would be [0 -d, 0 +d], but the street starts at0, so the coverage is [0, d]. Similarly, a lantern at l would cover [l -d, l], which is [l -d, l].\n\nSo in the sample input 2, the first lantern is at2, the second at5.\n\nIf d=1.5, then the first covers0.5-3.5, the second covers3.5-6.5, which on the street is3.5-5.\n\nSo the union is0.5-5, which covers the entire street.\n\nSo why is the sample output 2?\n\nWait, perhaps the lanterns' coverage is not limited by the street. So a lantern at5 with d=1.5 covers from3.5 to6.5, but since the street is only up to5, the coverage is3.5-5.\n\nBut according to the sample note, when d=2, the first covers0-4, the second covers3-5, which together cover0-5.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, with d=1.5, the coverage is already sufficient.\n\nIs there a misunderstanding about the problem?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the coverage for the second lantern when d=1.5. Let's compute it again.\n\nLantern at5, d=1.5: coverage is5-1.5=3.5 to5+1.5=6.5. But since the street is up to5, the coverage is3.5 to5.\n\nSo the first lantern covers0.5 to3.5, and the second covers3.5 to5. So the union is0.5 to5, which covers the entire street.\n\nSo why is the sample output 2?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that all lanterns must have the same radius d, but perhaps my earlier approach is missing something else.\n\nWait, maybe the initial approach is incorrect because the problem is more about ensuring that the entire street is covered, not just the points between the lanterns.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to model the problem as follows: after sorting the lanterns, the required d is the maximum of:\n\n- The distance from the first lantern to 0, divided by 2 (since the first lantern must cover from 0 to its position +d).\n\nWait, no. Let's think again.\n\nAfter sorting, the first lantern is at a[0], and the last at a[-1].\n\nThe first lantern must cover from0 up to a[0] +d >=0.\n\nWait, no. The first lantern's coverage is [a[0]-d, a[0]+d]. But the street starts at0, so the effective coverage is max(0, a[0]-d) to min(l, a[0]+d). For the entire street to be covered, the first lantern's coverage must extend to 0 on the left, and possibly beyond, but at least up to some point.\n\nWait, no. The first lantern must cover 0, which requires that a[0] -d <=0 → d >=a[0]. But wait, no: the coverage is from a[0]-d to a[0]+d. So, to cover 0, we must have a[0] -d <=0 → d >=a[0].\n\nSimilarly, the last lantern must cover l, so a[-1] +d >= l →d >= l -a[-1].\n\nWait, no, because the coverage is up to a[-1]+d, which must be >=l.\n\nSo for the first lantern, the required d is at least a[0], because otherwise, the coverage starts after0.\n\nSimilarly, the last lantern must have a[-1] +d >=l →d >= l -a[-1].\n\nAdditionally, for the middle parts, the required d is such that for each consecutive pair a[i], a[i+1], the distance between them is covered by the two lanterns.\n\nSo for each pair, the required d is (a[i+1] -a[i])/2. Because the left lantern's coverage extends to a[i]+d, and the right's coverage starts at a[i+1]-d. For these to meet, a[i]+d >=a[i+1]-d →d >= (a[i+1] -a[i])/2.\n\nSo the overall required d is the maximum of all these values: the maximum of a[0], (a[i+1] -a[i])/2 for all i, and (l - a[-1]).\n\nWait, wait. Let's test this with the sample input 2.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nn=2, l=5.\n\nLanterns at2 and5.\n\nSort them: 2,5.\n\nCompute:\n\na[0]=2 →d >=2.\n\na[-1]=5 →d >=5-5=0.\n\nBetween the two lanterns: (5-2)/2=1.5.\n\nSo the maximum is 2.\n\nAh! So that's why the sample output is 2. Because the first lantern's position is2, requiring d>=2.\n\nSo that's the key point I was missing. So the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- a[0], \n\n- l - a[-1], \n\n- and the maximum of (a[i+1] -a[i])/2 for all i.\n\nBecause the first lantern must cover from0 to a[0]+d, which must be >=0 (so d >=a[0]), and the last lantern must cover up to l, which requires d >=l -a[-1].\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions in non-decreasing order.\n\n2. Compute the required d for the first lantern: d1 = a[0].\n\n3. Compute the required d for the last lantern: d2 = l - a[-1].\n\n4. Compute the required d for the middle pairs: for each i from 0 to n-2, compute di = (a[i+1] - a[i])/2, and take the maximum of these.\n\n5. The minimal d is the maximum of d1, d2, and the maximum di from step4.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo in the sample input2, d1 is2, d2 is0, and the middle di is1.5. So maximum is2, hence the output is2.\n\nIn the first sample, let's see:\n\nSample Input1:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', ...]\n\nWait, the input is 7 lanterns at positions15,5,3,7,9,14,0.\n\nSorting them gives 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nCompute d1 =0 (since a[0]=0 →d >=0).\n\nd2 =15-15=0.\n\nCompute the middle pairs:\n\n0 and3: (3-0)/2=1.5.\n\n3 and5: (5-3)/2=1.\n\n5 and7: (7-5)/2=1.\n\n7 and9: (9-7)/2=1.\n\n9 and14: (14-9)/2=2.5.\n\n14 and15: (15-14)/2=0.5.\n\nSo the maximum of these is2.5.\n\nThus, the overall d is max(0, 0, 2.5)=2.5, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\n- Read n and l.\n\n- Read the list of a_i, convert to integers.\n\n- Sort the list.\n\n- Compute d1 = a[0].\n\n- Compute d2 = l - a[-1].\n\n- Compute the maximum of the differences between consecutive a_i, divide by 2.\n\n- The minimal d is the maximum of d1, d2, and the maximum of the differences.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward.\n\nNow, code-wise:\n\nWe can proceed as:\n\nRead the inputs.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the required variables.\n\nThen, print the maximum with sufficient precision.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n- Only one lantern. Then, d must be max(a[0], l -a[0]).\n\nWait, no, if there's only one lantern, then d must be at least a[0] (to cover 0) and l -a[0] (to cover l). So d is the maximum of those two.\n\nWait, for example, if the single lantern is at position5, l=10. Then d must be at least5 (to cover0) and5 (to cover10). So d=5.\n\nAnother edge case: when all lanterns are at the same point. Then, d must be at least that point, but also ensure that the coverage extends to l. For example, if all are at0, l=10. Then d must be10, to cover0-10.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if all lanterns are at0, then their coverage is [0 -d, 0 +d]. So to cover the entire street [0, l], d must be at least l, because the coverage is 0 to d. So to cover up to l, d must be >=l.\n\nSo code-wise, in the case where a[0] is0, but l is larger, d must be at least l.\n\nBut in our current approach, when there's only one lantern, a[0] is0, so d1=0, d2=l -0 =l. The maximum is l, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: when lanterns are at0 andl. Then d1=0, d2=0. Middle differences are (l -0)/2 = l/2. So d is max(0, 0, l/2) → l/2.\n\nBut for example, l=10: d=5. The first lantern covers 0-5, the second covers5-15. So the street is covered.\n\nWait, but if l=10, the second lantern is at10. So its coverage is5 to15, but the street ends at10. So the coverage is5-10. So the first covers0-5, the second covers5-10. Together, they cover0-10.\n\nSo yes, d=5 is sufficient.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, a=[0], l=5. Then d must be5, because the lantern covers0-5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nImplementation Steps:\n\n1. Read n and l from input.\n\n2. Read the next line as the list of lantern positions.\n\n3. Convert the list to integers.\n\n4. Sort the list.\n\n5. If n==0: impossible, but n is at least1.\n\n6. Compute d1 = a[0].\n\n7. Compute d2 = l - a[-1].\n\n8. Compute the max_gap_between_consecutive = 0.\n\n   For each i from0 to n-2:\n\n      gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n      current_gap_d = gap / 2\n\n      if current_gap_d > max_gap_between_consecutive:\n\n          update.\n\n9. Now, the minimal d is the maximum of d1, d2, and max_gap_between_consecutive.\n\n10. Print d with 10 decimal places.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nImplementing this:\n\nRead the first line: n, l.\n\nThen read the next line, split into integers, and sort.\n\nCompute the required values.\n\nPrint with 10 decimal places.\n\nTesting with sample input2:\n\nn=2, l=5.\n\na = [2,5]\n\nd1=2.\n\nd2=5-5=0.\n\nmax_gap_between_consecutive is (5-2)/2=1.5.\n\nSo d=2.\n\nSample input1:\n\nn=7, l=15.\n\na after sorting: 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nd1=0.\n\nd2=15-15=0.\n\nmax_gap_between_consecutive is max( (3-0)/2=1.5, (5-3)/2=1, (7-5)/2=1, (9-7)/2=1, (14-9)/2=2.5, (15-14)/2=0.5 ) → 2.5.\n\nSo d=2.5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, a=[0], l=5.\n\nd1=0.\n\nd2=5-0=5.\n\nmax_gap is 0 (no pairs).\n\nd is5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a=[0,5,10], l=10.\n\nd1=0.\n\nd2=10-10=0.\n\nmax_gap is (5-0)/2=2.5, (10-5)/2=2.5. So max_gap is2.5.\n\nd=2.5.\n\nEach lantern covers:\n\n0-2.5, 2.5-7.5, 7.5-12.5. But l is10, so coverage is up to10.\n\nSo the union is0-12.5, but the street is0-10. So yes, covered.\n\nWait, but wait, the first lantern covers0-2.5, the second covers2.5-7.5, third covers7.5-12.5. So the street is covered.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=2, a=[0,10], l=10.\n\nd1=0, d2=0.\n\nmax_gap is (10-0)/2=5.\n\nd=5.\n\nFirst lantern covers0-5, second covers5-15. Street is0-10, covered.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=3, a=[1,3,6], l=6.\n\nd1=1 →d>=1.\n\nd2=6-6=0.\n\nmax_gap between 1 and3 is1, between3 and6 is1.5.\n\nSo d is max(1, 1.5) →1.5.\n\nCheck coverage:\n\n1+1.5=2.5 <3 → so first lantern covers1-2.5.\n\nSecond lantern covers3-8.5, but street is up to6, so covers3-6.\n\nThird lantern covers5.5-11.5, but street ends at6.\n\nSo the union is1-2.5, 3-6, 5.5-6 → which covers 1-6.\n\nWait, but what about 2.5 to3? Is that covered?\n\nNo, because the first lantern ends at2.5, the second starts at3. So there's a gap between2.5 and3.\n\nSo why is d=1.5 considered sufficient?\n\nAh, because according to the code, the required d is1.5, which is the maximum of d1=1, d2=0, and max_gap=1.5.\n\nBut in reality, the coverage is not complete.\n\nWait, that suggests a flaw in the approach.\n\nWait, what's happening here. Let's compute the required d correctly.\n\nWait, the sorted a is [1,3,6].\n\nd1=1 → ensures 0 is covered (1-1=0, so coverage is0-2).\n\nWait, no. Wait, a[0] is1. So d1=1.\n\nCoverage of first lantern is1-1=0 to1+1=2. So the coverage is0-2.\n\nSecond lantern is3, d=1.5. Coverage is3-1.5=1.5 to3+1.5=4.5.\n\nThird lantern is6, d=1.5. Coverage is6-1.5=4.5 to6+1.5=7.5, but street is up to6.\n\nSo the union is0-2, 1.5-4.5, 4.5-6.\n\nSo 0-2 is covered, 1.5-4.5 covers from1.5 onwards, and 4.5-6 covers the rest.\n\nWait, but the first and second lantern's coverage overlaps at1.5 and2.\n\nSo the entire street is covered.\n\nWait, but when d=1.5, the first lantern covers0-2, the second covers1.5-4.5, the third covers4.5-6.\n\nSo 0-2 is covered by the first, 1.5-4.5 covers 1.5-4.5, and 4.5-6 is covered by the third.\n\nWait, the entire street is0-6. So yes, it's covered.\n\nAh, because the first and second lanterns overlap between1.5 and2.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nWait, but the initial approach thought that the maximum of d1, d2, and the maximum gap between consecutive points is sufficient. But in this case, the maximum gap is (6-3)/2=1.5, which is exactly the d used.\n\nSo the code correctly returns d=1.5.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, a=[0,4,8], l=8.\n\nd1=0.\n\nd2=8-8=0.\n\nmax_gap is (4-0)/2=2, (8-4)/2=2.\n\nSo d=2.\n\nCoverage:\n\n0-2, 2-6, 6-10. But street is0-8.\n\nSo 0-2 covered, 2-6, 6-8.\n\nSo 0-8 is covered.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list, split into integers.\n\nSort.\n\nCompute d1 = a[0].\n\nd2 = l - a[-1].\n\nCompute max_mid = 0.\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n    mid = gap / 2\n\n    if mid > max_mid:\n\n        max_mid = mid\n\nd = max(d1, d2, max_mid)\n\nprint d with 10 decimal places.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, implementing this in Python.\n\nTesting with sample input2:\n\nn=2, l=5.\n\na = [2,5]\n\nd1=2.\n\nd2=0.\n\nmax_mid=1.5.\n\nd=2.\n\nSample1:\n\na = [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nd1=0.\n\nd2=0.\n\nmax_mid= (14-9)/2=2.5.\n\nd=2.5.\n\nSample with n=3, a=[1,3,6], l=6.\n\nd1=1.\n\nd2=0.\n\nmax_mid=1.5.\n\nd=1.5.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input lines.\n\nHandle the case when the list is empty (but n>=1).\n\nSo code:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nd1 = a[0]\nd2 = l - a[-1]\nmax_mid = 0\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    mid = gap / 2\n    if mid > max_mid:\n        max_mid = mid\nd = max(d1, d2, max_mid)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns on a street can light the entire street from 0 to \\( l \\). Each lantern lights a segment of the street within a radius \\( d \\), and our goal is to find the smallest \\( d \\) that ensures the entire street is illuminated.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns in non-decreasing order.\n2. **Calculate Coverage for Endpoints**: The first lantern must cover from 0 to its position plus \\( d \\), and the last lantern must cover up to \\( l \\) from its position. This gives us two potential values for \\( d \\): the position of the first lantern and the distance from the last lantern to \\( l \\).\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, we calculate the maximum gap between their coverage areas. The required \\( d \\) must be at least half of this gap to ensure no part of the street is left unlit.\n4. **Determine Minimum \\( d \\)**: The minimum \\( d \\) is the maximum value obtained from the three considerations mentioned above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nd1 = a[0]\nd2 = l - a[-1]\nmax_mid = 0\n\nfor i in range(n - 1):\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    mid = gap / 2\n    if mid > max_mid:\n        max_mid = mid\n\nd = max(d1, d2, max_mid)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions helps in efficiently calculating the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **End Coverage**: The first lantern's position determines how far it can reach towards the start of the street, and the last lantern's position determines how far it can reach towards the end.\n- **Gap Calculation**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the required \\( d \\) must be sufficient to cover the gap between them. This is computed as half the distance between the lanterns.\n- **Combining Results**: The minimum \\( d \\) is the largest value among the start coverage, end coverage, and the maximum gap coverage.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the smallest radius needed to illuminate the entire street, considering both the endpoints and the gaps between lanterns.",
