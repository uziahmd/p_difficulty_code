            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about converting a number from one base to another, but with some Roman numeral rules involved. Oh right, and the bases can be up to 25, which is manageable.\n\nThe input gives me two integers a and b. Wait, but b could be 'R', which indicates that the target base uses Roman numerals. Interesting. Then, there's a string c which is in base a. My task is to convert this into base b, but using Roman numerals if needed.\n\nLet me break this down. So first, I need to parse the input correctly. The first line has a and b, but b might be R. The second line is the number c in base a.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Read a and b. If b is R, then the output should be in Roman numerals. Otherwise, it's in base b as a decimal string.\n\n2. Convert the number c from base a to an integer (in base 10).\n\n3. Then, convert that integer to the target base (either as a decimal string or as Roman numerals if b is R).\n\nWait, but wait—no, because for cases where b is not R, the output is just the number in base b as a string without leading zeros. For example, if a is 10, b is 2, and c is 5, then 5 in base 2 is 101, so the output is '101'.\n\nBut when b is R, the output is the Roman numeral equivalent of the number.\n\nSo the main steps are:\n\n- Parse a and b. Determine if we're dealing with a Roman conversion.\n- Convert c from base a to a decimal integer.\n- Convert the decimal integer to the target base, which could be either a numeric string or a Roman numeral string.\n\nNow, let's think about each part.\n\nFirst, parsing a and b. For example, in the sample input, the first line is '10 2' meaning a=10, b=2. But sometimes, the second line could have '16 R', indicating that b is R. So I need to read the lines correctly.\n\nIn Python, I can read the first line, split into a and the rest. Wait, no: the first line has two parts, a and b. But wait, the first line is something like 'a b\\n...' So for the first line, perhaps it's better to split into two parts, the first being a, the second being b (which could be R). For example, in the sample input, the first line is '10 2', so a=10, b=2.\n\nWait, no—the sample input shows the first line as ['10 2\\n1', ...], but perhaps in the actual code, it's a single string per line. So, for each test case, the first line is a and b, the second is c.\n\nSo, code-wise, I can read the first line, split into a and b. But a and b are strings, so I need to convert them to integers. Except when b is 'R', in which case I leave it as 'R' to indicate Roman numerals.\n\nThen, the second line is the number c in base a. So, c is a string of digits (or letters?), but in base a. Wait, but a is between 2 and 25. So the digits allowed in base a are 0 to a-1. But since the problem says c may contain leading zeros, but is non-zero otherwise.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, one of the test cases is '5 R\\n4'. So a is 5, b is R, and c is '4'. So 4 in base 5 is 4, which is converted to IV in Roman.\n\nHmm, okay. So the plan is:\n\n1. Read a and b. a is an integer, b can be integer or 'R'.\n2. Read c as a string.\n3. Convert c from base a to a decimal integer.\n4. Convert the decimal integer to base b, but according to the rules:\n   a. If b is not R, output the number in base b as a string, omitting leading zeros.\n   b. If b is R, output the Roman numeral representation of the number.\n\nNow, the next thing is to implement functions for these steps.\n\nFirst, function to convert a string in base a to a decimal integer. That's straightforward: iterate through each character, multiply current total by a, add the value of the current digit.\n\nWait, but digits in base a can be 0 to a-1. So, for each character in c, get its value. For example, in base 10, '1' is 1, 'A' would be 10 if a is greater than or equal to ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from one base to another, taking into account the unique rules of Roman numerals when the target base is 'R'. The solution involves parsing the input, converting the number from the given base to a decimal integer, and then converting that integer to the target base or to Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Parse Input**: Read the first line to get the source base `a` and the target base `b`. The target base can be an integer or 'R' indicating Roman numerals.\n2. **Convert to Decimal**: Convert the given number `c` from base `a` to a decimal integer. This involves iterating through each digit of `c` and computing its value in base 10.\n3. **Convert to Target Base**: Depending on whether the target base `b` is 'R' or an integer:\n   - If `b` is an integer, convert the decimal integer to the target base as a string.\n   - If `b` is 'R', convert the decimal integer to a Roman numeral string using the rules for Roman numerals, including handling subtractive notation and symbols for values greater than 9.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    \n    # Parse input\n    first_line = input[0].split()\n    a = int(first_line[0])\n    b_str = first_line[1]\n    \n    c = input[1].strip()\n    \n    # Function to convert a string in base a to decimal\n    def str_to_decimal(s, base):\n        total = 0\n        for ch in s:\n            if ch == '_':\n                continue  # Skip underscores for some cases, though not sure if needed\n            val = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else (10 + ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A')) if ch.upper() >= 'A' else (ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 1)\n            total = total * base + val\n        return total\n    \n    # Convert c to decimal\n    decimal = str_to_decimal(c, a)\n    \n    # Function to convert decimal to base b\n    def decimal_to_base(n, base):\n        if base < 2 or base > 36:\n            return ''\n        if n == 0:\n            return '0'\n        digits = []\n        while n > 0:\n            rem = n % base\n            if rem < 10:\n                digits.append(str(rem))\n            else:\n                digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n            n = n // base\n        # Reverse and join\n        return ''.join(reversed(digits)) if digits else '0'\n    \n    # Function to convert decimal to Roman\n    def decimal_to_roman(n):\n        val = [\n            (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'),\n            (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n            (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'),\n            (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n            (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'),\n            (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n            (1, 'I')\n        ]\n        res = []\n        for (i, r) in val:\n            while n >= i:\n                res.append(r)\n                n -= i\n        return ''.join(res)\n    \n    # Determine the target type\n    if b_str == 'R':\n        result = decimal_to_roman(decimal)\n    else:\n        result = decimal_to_base(decimal, int(b_str))\n    \n    # Output without leading zeros\n    print(result if result else '0')\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into lines. The first line contains the source base `a` and the target base `b`, which can be 'R'.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `str_to_decimal` converts the string `c` from base `a` to a decimal integer by iterating through each character and computing its value in base 10.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**: The function `decimal_to_base` converts the decimal integer to the target base. It uses a loop to repeatedly divide the number by the base and collects remainders, which form the digits of the result.\n4. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: The function `decimal_to_roman` converts the decimal integer to a Roman numeral string by iterating through a list of value-symbol pairs and appending symbols until the number is reduced to zero.\n\nThis approach ensures that the number is correctly converted from any base to either a numeric string or a Roman numeral string, adhering to the rules specified.",
