He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about finding the number of positive integers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeros. And then I have to output all those n's in increasing order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n, because there are usually more 2s than 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is sum of n divided by 5, plus n divided by 25, and so on until n divided by 5^k is zero.\n\nSo, for example, for n=5: 5//5 =1, 5//25=0. So total 1 zero. For n=6, same as 5, since 6//5 is 1, 6//25 is 0. So 1 zero. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 5! is 120, which has one zero. 6! is 720, which also has one zero. So that's correct.\n\nBut the problem is, given m, find all n where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m.\n\nSo first, I need to find the minimal n such that n! has at least m zeros, and then check if adding 1, 2, etc., also gives m zeros. Because the trailing zero count increases in jumps. Like, once you hit a multiple of 5, the count increases, but sometimes it increases by more than one.\n\nWait, no. For example, when n is 24, 24//5 is 4, 24//25 is 0. So 4 zeros. Then 25: 25//5=5, 25//25=1, so total 6 zeros. So between 24 and 25, the count goes from 4 to 6, skipping 5. So for m=5, there's no n where n! has exactly 5 zeros. So the output would be 0.\n\nSo the approach is: find all n where the count of trailing zeros equals m.\n\nHow can I find these n's?\n\nI think the way is to find the lower bound and upper bound where the count is m.\n\nWait, perhaps using binary search to find the minimal n where the count is >= m. But wait, not exactly. Because if the count is exactly m, we need to find all n where the count is m.\n\nWait, perhaps we can find the first n where the count is m, then see how many consecutive n's have the same count.\n\nWait, for example, let's say m=5. The count for 25 is 6, 24 is 4. So no n exists with exactly 5 zeros. So the answer is zero.\n\nIn the sample input, m=1, the possible n's are 5,6,7,8,9. Because 5! has one zero, 6! same, etc., until 9!, which still has one zero before 10! which adds another zero (since 10 is a multiple of 5).\n\nSo for m=1, the range starts at 5 and ends at 9, giving 5 numbers.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the smallest n where the count of trailing zeros is equal to m.\n2. If no such n exists (i.e., the count skips m), then output 0.\n3. Otherwise, find the largest n where the count is m. The number of such n's is (max_n - min_n +1).\n4. Then collect all n's from min_n to max_n inclusive.\n\nBut how to find min_n and max_n?\n\nWell, the count function is non-decreasing as n increases. Because each step either keeps the count the same or increases it.\n\nSo, to find the minimal n where count(n) == m, we can perform a binary search. Similarly, find the maximal n where count(n) == m.\n\nBut wait, how do we know whether m is present in the count sequence?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the steps are:\n\n- Find the smallest n where count(n) >=m. Then, if count(n) is larger than m, then there's no solution. Because maybe m was skipped.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for a given m, the possible n's form a contiguous range. So, the first step is to find the starting point (the minimal n where count(n) = m) and then find the ending point (the maximal n where count(n) = m). The number of n's is then end - start +1.\n\nBut how to find these two points.\n\nLet me think about the binary search approach.\n\nFor the minimal n:\n\nWe can perform a binary search from low=0 to high= some upper limit. For each mid, compute the count of trailing zeros",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list all such integers \\( n \\) in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{count} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division results in zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To find the smallest \\( n \\) where the count of trailing zeros is exactly \\( m \\), we use binary search. Similarly, we find the largest \\( n \\) where the count is exactly \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Check for Validity**: If the smallest \\( n \\) found has a count greater than \\( m \\), it means there are no valid \\( n \\) values, and we return 0.\n\n4. **Generate Results**: If valid \\( n \\) values exist, generate all integers between the smallest and largest \\( n \\) inclusive and print them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m  # Initial estimate, may need to increase if not found\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt == m:\n            return mid\n        elif cnt < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return None  # Not found, though theoretically shouldn't happen\n\ndef find_max_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m  # Initial estimate, may need to increase if not found\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt == m:\n            return mid\n        elif cnt > m:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return None  # Not found, though theoretically shouldn't happen\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m = int(input_line)\n    \n    min_n = find_min_n(m)\n    max_n = find_max_n(m)\n    \n    if min_n is None or max_n is None:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    if count_trailing_zeros(min_n) != m:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    result = list(range(min_n, max_n + 1))\n    k = len(result)\n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **count_trailing_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by 5, 25, 125, etc., until the division result is zero.\n- **find_min_n Function**: Uses binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros.\n- **find_max_n Function**: Similarly uses binary search to find the largest \\( n \\) with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros.\n- **main Function**: Reads input, finds the bounds using the helper functions, checks if the result is valid, and prints the count and values of \\( n \\) if they exist.",
