Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nThe input is a single string consisting of lowercase letters. The output should be the maximum length of such a substring. Oh right, and the occurrences can overlap. So for example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears starting at index 0 and then again at index 2, which overlaps.\n\nFirst, I should consider all possible substrings and check if any of them appear more than once. But wait, checking every possible substring might be time-consuming, but since the maximum string length is 100, it's manageable.\n\nWhat's a substring? A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string. For a string of length n, the number of possible substrings is O(n^2), which for n=100 is 10,000. That's manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Generate all possible substrings of the string.\n2. For each substring, check if it occurs more than once (at least two times) in the string.\n3. Keep track of the maximum length found.\n\nBut wait, generating all substrings and checking their occurrence could be optimized. How?\n\nAn alternative approach is to slide a window of varying lengths over the string and see if the same substring appears again later in the string.\n\nLet me outline the steps more clearly:\n\n- For each possible length L, starting from the largest possible down to 1:\n   - For each possible starting index i in 0 to (n-L):\n      - Extract the substring s = string[i:i+L]\n      - Check if this substring appears again in the string, either before or after, but not necessarily immediately after.\n   - If any such substring exists for a given L, then return L as the answer.\n- If no such substring exists for any L, return 0.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible L is the length of the string minus one, because you need at least two occurrences. Wait no, for example, in a string of length 2, both characters are the same, then the substring of length 2 appears once. Wait, no, the problem says \"at least twice\". So for the string \"aa\", the substring \"a\" appears twice. So the maximum would be 1.\n\nWait, let's think about the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: Input is 'abcd'. All substrings are unique, so the output is 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' has substrings of length 3 like 'aba' appearing at positions 0 and 2. So the output is 3.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz' has substrings of length 2, 'zz' appears twice (positions 0-1 and 1-2). So the output is 2.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, loop L from len(s)-1 down to 1. Because we want the maximum possible L.\n\nFor each L, iterate through all possible starting indices i, where i ranges from 0 to len(s)-L.\n\nFor each i, extract s[i:i+L], and then check if this substring appears again in the string, possibly overlapping.\n\nHow to check for duplicates? One way is to create a set of all substrings of length L, and see if adding a new substring causes a duplicate. But since the same substring can appear multiple times, maybe using a dictionary to count occurrences.\n\nAlternatively, for a given substring, check if it appears anywhere else in the string beyond position i.\n\nWait, perhaps for each substring s[i:i+L], we can look for another occurrence in the string that starts at j >=i+1 and ends at j+L <= len(s)-1.\n\nWait, but the substring can start at any position except i, as long as it's the same.\n\nSo for a given L, for each i, generate the substring, then check whether it exists in the string starting at any j !=i.\n\nWait, but for j, j can be from 0 to len(s)-L, as long as j is not equal to i.\n\nSo, for each L, for each i, create the substring, then for j from 0 to len(s)-L, if j !=i, check if s[j:j+L] == current substring.\n\nIf any such pair is found, then this L is possible, so return it.\n\nSo the algorithm can be structured as follows:\n\nmax_len = 0\nfor L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n    for i in range(len(s) - L +1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        # check if substr appears again in s, at a different position\n        for j in range(len(s) - L +1):\n            if j == i:\n                continue\n            if",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Generate Substrings**: For each possible length `L` starting from the largest possible down to 1, generate all possible substrings of that length.\n2. **Check for Duplicates**: For each generated substring, check if it appears again in the string at a different position. If it does, record the length `L` as the result since we are checking from the largest possible `L` downwards.\n3. **Return Result**: Once the longest valid substring is found, return its length. If no such substring exists, return 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nmax_len = 0\nn = len(s)\nif n < 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        # Check all substrings of length L\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            # Look for the same substring elsewhere\n            for j in range(n - L + 1):\n                if j == i:\n                    continue\n                if s[j:j+L] == substr:\n                    print(L)\n                    exit()\n    print(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the input string and handle edge cases where the string length is less than 2.\n2. **Loop Over Lengths**: Iterate over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (length of the string minus 1) down to 1.\n3. **Generate Substrings**: For each length `L`, generate all substrings starting from each possible index.\n4. **Check for Duplicate Occurrences**: For each generated substring, check if it appears again in the string starting from any index other than the current one.\n5. **Early Termination**: As soon as a valid substring of the current length `L` is found, print `L` and terminate the program to optimize performance.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring by leveraging nested loops and early termination, making it suitable for the given constraints.",
