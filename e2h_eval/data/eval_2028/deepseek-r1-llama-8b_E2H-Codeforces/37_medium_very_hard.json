    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Gluttony,\" and the goal is to construct a permutation of a given array such that for every non-empty subset of indices (excluding the empty set and the entire set), the sum of elements in a at those positions is different from the sum in b.\n\nHmm. So, let's break it down. We have an array 'a' with 'n' distinct integers. We need to permute it into array 'b' such that for any non-empty proper subset S of the indices, the sum of a's elements in S is different from the sum of b's elements in S.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, the subsets are defined based on their positions in the arrays. So for each subset S, which is a collection of some indices, when we look at a, the sum of the elements at those indices must be different from the sum in b's corresponding positions.\n\nSo, for example, if S is {1,3}, then a[1] + a[3] should not equal b[1] + b[3], and same for any other subset.\n\nThe challenge is to find such a permutation 'b'. If it's impossible, output -1.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since n can be up to 22, trying all permutations isn't feasible because 22! is way too big. So we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a pattern or a specific way to arrange the elements so that all subset sums are unique. Maybe something like a Gray code ordering or a certain permutation that ensures no two subsets have the same sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to ensure that the permutation is such that for any two distinct subsets S and T, the sum of their elements in a and b differ. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into ensuring that for any pair of distinct subsets S and T, the difference between the sum of their elements in 'a' is not equal to the same difference in 'b'.\n\nWait, that might not directly help. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose that for every possible subset S (non-empty and not full), the sum of the elements in 'b' for S is different from the sum in 'a' for S. Or wait, no: the condition is that the sum in 'b' is different from the sum in 'a' for the same subset.\n\nWait, no. For a subset S, the sum in 'a' is the sum of the elements in S in the original array. The sum in 'b' is the sum of the elements in S in the permuted array. These two must be different for every non-empty proper subset S.\n\nAh, right. So for every S where 0 < |S| < n, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a permutation 'b' such that for all these subsets S, the sum in 'b' is different from that in 'a'.\n\nHmm. How can we achieve this? One idea is to arrange 'b' in such a way that the sum of any two different subsets in 'b' is different. But that's a lot to manage.\n\nWait, but perhaps the key is that the arrangement of 'b' is such that the sum of any subset S in 'b' is unique compared to all other subsets, including those in 'a'. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the simplest way is to arrange 'b' such that it's a linear extension where each element is placed in a way that the cumulative sums are all unique in some way. But I'm not sure how.\n\nWait, another thought: since all elements are distinct, perhaps arranging 'b' in a certain order will ensure that for any subset S, the sum in 'b' is unique. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is related to the concept of a \"superincreasing\" sequence. In a superincreasing sequence, each term is greater than the sum of all previous terms. This property ensures that each subset has a unique sum. But in our case, we're dealing with permutations, so that's not directly applicable.\n\nBut perhaps, if we arrange 'b' in a way similar to a superincreasing sequence, we can minimize the possibility of two subsets having the same sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the differences between the elements. Since all elements are distinct, perhaps some arrangement allows for unique subset sums.\n\nWait, but given that n is up to 22, trying all possible permutations is impossible. So we need an efficient way to determine if a permutation exists and construct it.\n\nAnother angle: for 'b' to satisfy the condition, the multiset of subset sums of 'b' (excluding the empty set and the full set) must have no overlaps with the multiset of subset sums of 'a' (excluding the same subsets). So, the union of the subset sums of 'a' and 'b' for the non-empty, non-full subsets must be completely disjoint.\n\nHmm. That seems complex.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a graph problem. Each node represents a state of the permutation being built step by step. The edges represent adding an element to the permutation. Then, we can check for conflicts as we build the permutation.\n\nBut even that approach might be too slow for n=22.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the condition must hold for all subsets, perhaps the only way this can happen is if the permutation 'b' is such that all subset sums are unique. Because otherwise, two different subsets could end up having the same sum in 'b' as well as in 'a', thus violating the condition.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. It's possible that a subset S in 'a' has a sum that doesn't appear as a subset sum in 'b', and vice versa. So, the condition is that the two sets of subset sums (for non-empty, non-full subsets) are completely disjoint.\n\nHmm. So, the problem reduces to checking if there's a permutation 'b' such that the subset sums of 'b' (excluding empty and full) do not intersect with the subset sums of 'a' (again, excluding empty and full).\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nThis seems computationally intensive, especially since for each possible permutation, we'd need to compute all possible subset sums and compare them. But with n=22, it's impossible to generate all permutations.\n\nSo, perhaps we need a heuristic or a way to construct 'b' that ensures that the subset sums don't overlap.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal way is to construct 'b' such that it's a derangement of 'a', meaning that no element is in its original position. But I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the permutation 'b' is such that the first occurrence of each element is arranged in a way that the prefix sums are all unique. But again, I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: since the subset sums for 'a' and 'b' must be disjoint, perhaps the sum of any non-empty, non-full subset in 'a' cannot be equal to any such subset sum in 'b'. So, perhaps the way to arrange 'b' is to have each element as large as possible, ensuring that when added to the permutation, the new subset sums don't collide with those of 'a'.\n\nWait, but this is vague. Let's think about the example given.\n\nIn the example, the input is ['2\\n1 2'] and the output is ['2 1']. So, 'a' is [1,2], 'b' is [2,1].\n\nNow, the non-empty subsets of size 1: {1} sum is 1 vs 2. {2} sum is 2 vs 1. So, they are different. The non-empty subset of size 2 (the entire array) is excluded. So, for n=2, the condition is satisfied.\n\nAnother example: input is ['4\\n1000 100 10 1'], output is ['100 1 1000 10'].\n\nWait, let's compute the subset sums for 'a' and 'b' and see if they are all different.\n\nOriginal array 'a': [1000, 100, 10, 1]\n\nSubset sums for 'a':\n\nSingle elements: 1000, 100, 10, 1.\n\nAll pairs:\n\n1000+100 = 1100\n\n1000+10=1010\n\n1000+1=1001\n\n100+10=110\n\n100+1=101\n\n10+1=11\n\nTriplets:\n\n1000+100+10=1110\n\n1000+100+1=1101\n\n1000+10+1=1011\n\n100+10+1=111\n\nAll four elements: 1111.\n\nThen, in 'b', the array is [100, 1, 1000, 10]. So, let's compute the subset sums for 'b' as well.\n\nSingle elements: 100, 1, 1000, 10.\n\nPairs:\n\n100+1=101\n\n100+1000=1100\n\n100+10=110\n\n1+1000=1001\n\n1+10=11\n\n1000+10=1010.\n\nTriplets:\n\n100+1+1000=1101\n\n100+1+10=111\n\n100+1000+10=1110\n\n1+1000+10=1011.\n\nAll four: 100+1+1000+10=1111.\n\nWait, comparing the subset sums of 'a' and 'b':\n\nLooking for any subset S where sum_a(S) == sum_b(S).\n\nLooking at single elements: in 'a' we have 1000, 100, 10, 1. In 'b' we have 100, 1, 1000, 10. So the individual elements are the same, but in different orders. So for each singleton subset, the sum is present in both 'a' and 'b', but just in different positions. So, for example, the subset {1000} in 'a' is 1000, and in 'b' it's also 1000. So, this would violate the condition, right?\n\nWait, wait. That's a problem. Because in the sample input, the output is [100, 1, 1000, 10], which is the same as the original array but reordered. So the single-element subsets in 'a' and 'b' would have the same sums. So why is this considered a valid solution?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem statement. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says that for every non-empty subset S of indices, the sum in a and b must be different. Oh! So, for S being any subset, including single elements, the sum in a and the sum in b must be different.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the single-element subsets have the same sums. So why is that a valid solution?\n\nWait, that suggests that my initial understanding was wrong. Perhaps the problem statement is different. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the problem says: for every non-empty subset S = {x1, x2, ..., xk} (1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 0 < k < n), the sums of elements on that positions in a and b are different.\n\nWait, perhaps the subset S refers to the positions in the array, regardless of the elements. So, for example, in 'a' and 'b', the subset S is the same set of indices. So, the sum of a's elements at S and the sum of b's elements at S must be different.\n\nAh, that's different. So, for each subset S (size 1 ≤ k < n), sum_a(S) ≠ sum_b(S).\n\nSo, the subsets are the same in both arrays, but the sums must differ.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, for each S (subset of size 1 to n-1), the sum of a's elements in S is different from the sum of b's elements in S.\n\nSo, in the sample input, for S={1}, sum_a is 1, sum_b is 100, which are different. For S={2}, sum_a is 2, sum_b is 1, which are different. For S={1,2}, sum_a is 3, sum_b is 101. So, yes, they are different.\n\nWait, so in the sample, all subsets of size 1 and 2 (since n=2) have different sums. Hence, the condition is satisfied.\n\nSo, that explains why the sample is correct.\n\nSo, the problem is to permute 'a' into 'b' such that for every subset S (with 1 ≤ |S| < n), the sum of elements in S in 'a' is different from the sum in 'b'.\n\nSo, the condition is on the subset sums, not on the permutation itself.\n\nThat changes everything. Now, the problem is about ensuring that for every S, sum_b(S) ≠ sum_a(S).\n\nSo, how can we construct such a permutation 'b'?\n\nAn initial thought: perhaps the sum of each subset in 'b' must not match the sum in 'a'. So, we need to arrange the elements in 'b' such that for any subset S, the sum of the elements in 'b' at S is different from the sum in 'a' at S.\n\nBut how?\n\nGiven that n is up to 22, trying all permutations is impossible. So, we need an efficient way.\n\nPerhaps the key is to find a permutation where the sum of any subset S is different from the sum in 'a' for the same S.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to achieve this is to have 'b' be a derangement where the arrangement of elements is such that each element is in a position that changes the subset sums in a way that avoids collisions.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: For each element in 'a', try to place it in a position in 'b' such that it doesn't create any subset sum collision.\n\nWait, but that's still vague.\n\nLet me think about the subset sums. Suppose that for each subset S, sum_b(S) must not equal sum_a(S). So, for each S, the sum in 'b' must be different from the sum in 'a'.\n\nOne possible way is to make sure that for each S, the sum in 'b' is either larger or smaller than the sum in 'a'. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can construct 'b' in such a way that the sum of each subset in 'b' is unique across all subsets, and also doesn't match any subset sum in 'a'.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a constraint satisfaction problem. Each element in 'b' can be placed in any position, subject to the constraints that for every subset S, the sum of the elements in S in 'b' is not equal to the sum in 'a'.\n\nBut with n=22, even this approach may not be feasible due to computational constraints.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the problem is similar to the concept of a \"Sidon sequence,\" where all pairwise sums are unique. But this is for pairwise sums, not for all subset sums.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use dynamic programming to track the possible subset sums as we build the permutation.\n\nWait, but for each step, adding a new element, the number of possible subsets increases exponentially. So, it's not feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the problem can be solved by arranging the elements in such a way that the sum of any two elements in 'b' is different from any sum in 'a'.\n\nBut again, that's not sufficient for all subsets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by considering the binary representation of the elements. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: the problem requires that for every non-empty proper subset S, the sum in 'a' and 'b' are different. So, the difference between the sum in 'b' and 'a' for each subset S is not zero.\n\nIn other words, for every S, sum_b(S) - sum_a(S) ≠ 0.\n\nThis can be rewritten as sum_b(S) = sum_a(S) + delta_S, where delta_S is not zero.\n\nBut how to ensure this for all S.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps if we can arrange the permutation such that the sum of any subset in 'b' is different from the sum in 'a' for the same subset. So, for each subset S, the sum of the elements in S in 'b' is different from the sum in 'a'.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the way is to arrange the permutation such that for each position i, the element in 'b' at i is different from the element in 'a' at i. Because if for some i, b[i] = a[i], then the subset S = {i} would have sum_a(S) = sum_b(S) = a[i], which violates the condition.\n\nAh! That's a crucial observation. So, the first condition is that 'b' must be a derangement of 'a'—no element can remain in its original position.\n\nBecause if any element is in the same position in 'b' as in 'a', then the subset consisting of just that index will have the same sum in both arrays, which violates the condition.\n\nSo, the permutation 'b' must be a derangement of 'a'. That's a necessary condition, but is it sufficient?\n\nNo. Because even if 'b' is a derangement, there could be other subsets S (with |S| ≥ 2) where sum_b(S) equals sum_a(S).\n\nSo, the derangement is a necessary condition, but not sufficient.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a derangement of 'a' such that for every non-empty proper subset S, sum_b(S) ≠ sum_a(S).\n\nSo, the steps to solve the problem would be:\n\n1. Check if a derangement exists. If not, output -1.\n\n2. Among the possible derangements, find one that satisfies the subset sum condition.\n\nBut how?\n\nGiven that n is up to 22, trying all derangements is impractical. So, we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by greedily swapping elements such that the subset sums are changed as much as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using bitmask DP, where each state represents a partial permutation, and the transitions add elements, ensuring that no subset sum conflict arises.\n\nBut with n=22, even a bitmask of 22 bits is manageable, but the state space would be 2^22, which is about 4 million. Hmm, that might be manageable, but the transitions would be expensive.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because for each state, adding a new element would involve checking all possible subsets that include that element and see if any of them causes a conflict with 'a's subset sums.\n\nThis seems computationally heavy, but perhaps for small n (like up to 15), it's manageable. But for n=22, it's probably not.\n\nSo, perhaps a different approach is needed.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps if 'b' is a derangement, and in addition, the sum of all elements except one is unique in a way that avoids the conflicts.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think about the necessary conditions beyond the derangement.\n\nFor any subset S, sum_b(S) ≠ sum_a(S).\n\nSuppose that for a particular subset S, sum_a(S) is equal to sum_b(S). Then, the permutation 'b' is invalid.\n\nSo, our aim is to construct 'b' such that none of the subset sums of 'b' for any non-empty, non-full S equal the subset sums of 'a' for the same S.\n\nThus, the problem is equivalent to finding a derangement 'b' such that the subset sums of 'b' (excluding empty and full) do not overlap with those of 'a'.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the way to proceed is to find a derangement 'b' where the sum of any subset S in 'b' is not equal to the sum in 'a' for S.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach: for each element in 'a', try placing it in a position such that the sum of any subset that includes that position in 'b' does not match the sum in 'a'.\n\nBut this is still vague.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to assigning each element to a new position in a way that affects all subset sums that include that position.\n\nBut again, I'm not seeing a clear path.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the problem.\n\nAssume that 'b' is a derangement, i.e., b_i ≠ a_i for all i.\n\nThen, for any subset S containing a single element i, sum_b(S) = b_i, which is not equal to a_i (since b_i != a_i). So, for all single-element subsets, the condition is satisfied.\n\nSo, after ensuring that 'b' is a derangement, we only need to worry about subsets with two or more elements.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a derangement 'b' such that for any subset S with |S| ≥ 2, sum_b(S) ≠ sum_a(S).\n\nSo, perhaps the way to proceed is to find a derangement, and then check whether the subset sums for larger S are also different.\n\nBut for n=22, this approach would require checking each possible derangement, which is impractical.\n\nThus, we need a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be addressed by considering the linear algebra perspective. The condition can be seen as a set of equations where sum_b(S) - sum_a(S) ≠ 0 for all S with |S| ≥ 2.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a graph where each node represents a possible assignment of elements to positions, and edges represent transitions that avoid subset sum conflicts. Then, we can perform a BFS to find a valid permutation.\n\nBut again, with n=22, this is impractical.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the problem can be solved by considering the following.\n\nFor 'b' to satisfy the condition, for any two subsets S and T of size ≥2, the sum of 'b' for S must differ from the sum of 'b' for T, and also differ from all the sums of 'a' for any subset.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by using inclusion-exclusion principles or combinatorial mathematics, but I'm not seeing the connection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a kind of exact cover problem, where we need to cover all possible subset sums without overlap.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is impossible for certain cases. For example, if the sum of any two elements in 'a' is the same as the sum of two elements in 'b', even though 'b' is a derangement.\n\nBut it's hard to say.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to proceed is to try to find a derangement 'b' and then check for any subset S of size ≥2 whether sum_b(S) == sum_a(S). If such a subset exists, then the permutation is invalid.\n\nBut for n=22, this would be too slow because for each derangement, we need to check O(2^22) subsets.\n\nWait, but n=22 is manageable for certain optimizations.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached with memoization or pruning techniques.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be simplified by noting that if the derangement 'b' is such that the sum of any two elements is unique and doesn't match any sum in 'a', then it might satisfy the condition.\n\nBut again, this is not sufficient.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: Since the problem requires that for every subset S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S), perhaps the way to ensure this is to have the sum of all elements in 'b' be different from the sum in 'a', but that's not directly helpful.\n\nWait, the sum of all elements in 'a' is fixed. Let's denote it as total_a. Similarly, the sum of 'b' is the same as 'a', since it's a permutation.\n\nBut for any proper subset S, sum_b(S) can vary.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by trying to find a derangement where for every element in 'a', its new position in 'b' is such that for any subset that includes it, the sum doesn't match.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be addressed by ensuring that the sum of any two elements in 'b' is different from the sum of any two elements in 'a', but that's not enough for all subsets.\n\nWait, but perhaps if the pairwise sums are all unique and different from 'a's, then higher subset sums would automatically be unique as well.\n\nBut I don't think that's the case.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother approach: Since the problem requires that for any subset S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S), perhaps the way is to assign each element in 'b' such that the sum of any subset S in 'b' is not equal to the sum in 'a' for the same S.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to construct 'b' such that for each element, it's placed in a position where it contributes to making the subset sums unique and different.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by trying to construct 'b' in a way that each element is as far away as possible from its original position, and that the new position's contribution to subset sums doesn't cause any conflicts.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by considering each element and trying to swap it with another in a way that the subset sums are altered sufficiently.\n\nBut again, without a clear algorithm, this is difficult.\n\nSo, perhaps it's time to think about what the code structure would look like.\n\nFirst, we need to read the input. Then, generate all possible derangements of 'a' and for each, check whether the subset sums of 'b' don't overlap with those of 'a'.\n\nBut for n=22, this is impossible.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by noting that the only way to satisfy the condition is to have 'b' be a derangement where the sum of any subset is unique and different from 'a's subset sums.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is always solvable for n >=2 except for some cases.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input where n=2, the output is a derangement.\n\nAnother test case: n=3.\n\nSuppose a = [1,2,3].\n\nWe need to find a derangement where for any subset S (size 1 or 2), sum_b(S) != sum_a(S).\n\nFor example, if 'b' is [2,3,1].\n\nCheck subset sums:\n\nSingle elements:\n\nsum_b({1}) = 2 != 1.\n\nsum_b({2}) = 3 != 2.\n\nsum_b({3}) = 1 != 3.\n\nSubsets of size 2:\n\n{1,2}: 2+3=5; sum_a is 1+2=3 → different.\n\n{1,3}: 2+1=3; sum_a is 1+3=4 → different.\n\n{2,3}:3+1=4; sum_a is 2+3=5 → different.\n\nSo, this permutation works.\n\nSo, it's possible for n=3.\n\nAnother test case: n=1.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, n can be 1, but then there are no non-empty proper subsets. So, any permutation is acceptable. But since n=1, the only permutation is the same as the original, but the condition is vacuously true. So, output 'a' itself.\n\nBut wait, for n=1, the output must be a permutation of 'a', which is just the same array. So, output 'a'.\n\nBut the problem statement says that n can be 1.\n\nSo, for n=1, output the same array.\n\nNow, another test case: n=4.\n\nSuppose a = [1, 2, 3, 4].\n\nWe need to find a derangement 'b' such that for any subset S (size 1, 2, 3), sum_b(S) != sum_a(S).\n\nLet's try 'b' = [2,4,1,3].\n\nCheck subsets:\n\nSingle elements:\n\n2 != 1.\n\n4 != 2.\n\n1 !=3.\n\n3 !=4.\n\nSubsets of size 2:\n\n2+4=6; a's subsets of size 2:\n\n1+2=3, 1+3=4, 1+4=5, 2+3=5, 2+4=6, 3+4=7.\n\nWait, sum_b({1,2}) is 2+4=6. In 'a', subset {2,4} has sum 6. So, sum_b(S) equals sum_a(S), which is a violation.\n\nSo, this permutation is invalid.\n\nThus, we need to find another derangement.\n\nMaybe try 'b' = [3,4,1,2].\n\nCheck single elements:\n\n3 !=1, 4!=2, 1!=3, 2!=4.\n\nGood.\n\nSubsets of size 2:\n\n3+4=7; in 'a', 3+4=7 → same sum. So, this is invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother attempt: 'b' = [4,1,2,3].\n\nCheck subsets:\n\nSingle elements: 4 !=1, 1!=2, 2!=3, 3!=4.\n\nGood.\n\nSubsets of size 2:\n\n4+1=5 → in 'a', 1+4=5. So, same sum. Invalid.\n\nAnother permutation: 'b' = [2,3,4,1].\n\nCheck single elements: 2≠1, 3≠2,4≠3,1≠4.\n\nSubsets of size 2:\n\n2+3=5 → in 'a', 1+4=5. So, same sum. Invalid.\n\nHmm. It's challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps for some cases, it's impossible. For example, if the sum of any two elements in 'a' is unique, and any derangement would cause a subset sum to collide.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by trying to find a derangement where for every possible subset S, sum_b(S) is unique and doesn't match sum_a(S).\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is always solvable except when the sum of any two elements in 'a' is unique and any derangement would cause a collision.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to implement a backtracking solution that tries to construct 'b' as a derangement, and for each step, checks whether adding the current element doesn't cause any subset sum conflict.\n\nBut even this might be too slow for n=22.\n\nWait, but perhaps with some pruning, it's manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Generate all possible derangements of 'a' (permutations where no element is in its original position).\n\n2. For each derangement, check whether for every non-empty subset S (size 1 to n-1), sum_b(S) != sum_a(S).\n\n3. If any such permutation is found, output it.\n\n4. If none found, output -1.\n\nBut for n=22, this approach is impossible, as the number of derangements is way too high.\n\nThus, for n=22, this approach won't work.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem requires a different insight.\n\nWait, another thought: the problem requires that for every subset S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S). So, for any subset S, the sum of the elements in 'b' at positions S must not equal the sum of the elements in 'a' at the same positions.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to achieve this is to have 'b' be such that the sum of any subset S in 'b' is not equal to the sum in 'a' for S.\n\nWhich implies that for any subset S, sum_b(S) - sum_a(S) ≠ 0.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a system of equations where for each subset S, sum_b(S) - sum_a(S) ≠ 0.\n\nBut solving such a system is impractical for n=22.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is to find a derangement where the sum of any subset S in 'b' is not equal to the sum in 'a' for S.\n\nBut again, without a clear way to construct such a permutation, it's difficult.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the problem as a binary matrix where each row represents a subset S and each column represents an element. The entry is 1 if the element is included in S, 0 otherwise. Then, the condition is that for each row S, the dot product of the row with 'a' and 'b' vectors must differ.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to use this for solving the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a problem of linear algebra over GF(2), but that's probably not applicable here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be simplified by noting that the sum of any subset in 'b' must be different from the sum in 'a' for the same subset. So, for each subset S, the difference between the two sums must not be zero.\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that the vector 'b' is not in the same affine space as 'a' for any of these subset sums.\n\nBut again, this is abstract.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, perhaps it's time to look for hints or patterns that might lead to a solution.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the following:\n\nFor any permutation 'b' that is a derangement, the sum of any subset S (size ≥2) in 'b' must not equal the sum in 'a' for S.\n\nIf we can find such a permutation, output it; else, output -1.\n\nBut how to find it efficiently.\n\nAnother thought: since the problem allows any permutation, perhaps the way is to arrange the elements in 'b' in such a way that the sum of any two elements is unique and different from the sum of any two elements in 'a'. But this is insufficient for higher subsets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps arranging 'b' as a permutation where the sum of any three elements is unique and different from 'a's sums. But again, this is not sufficient.\n\nWait, perhaps for the problem to be solvable, it's sufficient to arrange 'b' as a derangement where for each element, it's placed in a position such that for any subset S that includes that position, the sum is different.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the problem can be solved by swapping adjacent elements in 'a' to form 'b', ensuring that the sum of any subset S in 'b' is different from that in 'a'.\n\nBut this might not work for all cases.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps it's best to consider that for the problem, the solution is to output a derangement 'b' and check for the subset sum condition.\n\nBut for n=22, this is impractical.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm. For each position i, choose an element from 'a' that is not in position i, and hasn't been used yet, and ensure that the choice doesn't cause any subset sum conflict.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by considering the following:\n\nArrange the elements in 'b' in a way that each element is placed such that the sum of any subset that includes it is different from the sum in 'a'.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nHmm.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for some patterns or properties that can be used to construct 'b'.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be solved by permuting the elements such that the sum of any two elements in 'b' is unique and doesn't match any sum in 'a'.\n\nBut this is insufficient for higher subsets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by ensuring that the sum of any subset in 'b' is unique across all subsets, and also doesn't match any subset sum in 'a'.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the problem can be solved by ensuring that the difference between 'b' and 'a' for any subset S is unique and non-zero.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only solvable when the sum of any subset S in 'a' is unique. Because then, 'b' can be arranged such that the sum of any subset S in 'b' is different from all sums in 'a'.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is always solvable except when the sum of any two elements in 'a' is equal to the sum of another two elements, etc.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to find some code structure that can handle small cases, and see if it can be generalized.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read 'n' and 'a'.\n\n- If n=1, output 'a'.\n\n- Else, generate all possible derangements of 'a'.\n\n- For each derangement 'b':\n\n   - Compute all subset sums for 'b' and 'a'.\n\n   - Check if for any subset S (non-empty, non-full), sum_b(S) == sum_a(S).\n\n   - If none found, output 'b'.\n\n- If no derangement satisfies the condition, output -1.\n\nBut for n=22, this approach is impossible.\n\nThus, the code would only work for small n, which is not the case here.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem requires a different approach.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the problem requires that for every subset S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S), perhaps the sum of any subset in 'b' must be different from the sum in 'a' for the same subset.\n\nThus, for 'b' to be valid, the sum of any subset S in 'b' must not equal the sum in 'a' for S.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a permutation 'b' which is a derangement and for which the sum of any subset S (size ≥2) in 'b' is different from the sum in 'a' for S.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait,",
