Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem statement says that Andrew and Eugene are playing a game where they manipulate a string of digits through a series of substitution queries. After processing all the queries, we need to compute the resulting number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nHmm. So the initial string is s, and each query is of the form di → ti. This means that every occurrence of digit di in the current string is replaced by ti. For example, if s is '123123' and the query is '2→00', then replacing '2's with '00' gives '10031003'. Another example: if the query is '3→', then all '3's are removed, turning '123123' into '1212'.\n\nOur task is to process all these substitutions in the given order and then compute the numerical value of the resulting string modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but how do we handle the substitutions efficiently? Since each substitution could potentially change multiple digits, and the order matters because each substitution affects the next. We can't just apply them in any arbitrary order.\n\nLet me think about the approach here. One way is to model the substitutions as a transformation on the string step by step. However, for large strings, this might be inefficient, but given the constraints (s up to length 105 and n up to 105), it should be manageable.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that each substitution could refer to other digits that have been transformed. So, perhaps we should process the substitutions in reverse order. Because, when a substitution is done, it changes some digits, which may later be substituted again. So, if we process them in reverse, earlier substitutions would not have affected the later ones. Hmm, that makes sense.\n\nFor example, suppose we have two substitutions: first replace '2's with '00', then replace '0's with '7's. Processing in the original order, the '2's become '00', which are then turned into '77's. But if we process them in reverse, the second substitution (0→7) would be applied first, but since before that substitution, there were no '0's, it doesn't do anything. Then the first substitution replaces '2's with '00', which are then processed by the second substitution. Wait, no—that's not correct because the second substitution is after the first.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to process the substitutions in reverse order so that when we substitute, any subsequent substitutions (which were earlier in time) haven't been applied yet. Because, for instance, if a substitution A is followed by substitution B, applying B first would change the string, making substitution A affect more digits than it should. By processing B first, substitution A will work on the original string without B's changes.\n\nSo, the idea is to process the substitutions in reverse order. That way, each substitution only deals with the original or substitutions made after it (since earlier substitutions are processed last).\n\nLet me take an example:\n\nSuppose the substitutions are:\n1. Replace '2' with '00'\n2. Replace '0' with '7'\n\nProcessing in reverse order:\n\nFirst, process substitution 2: replace '0's with '7's. But initially, there are no '0's, so nothing happens.\nThen, process substitution 1: replace '2's with '00'. Now, any '2's become '00's. Then, substitution 2 is applied again (since we're in reverse order?), but wait, substitution 2 was already processed. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to represent each substitution as a mapping, but since substitutions can overwrite previous mappings, we need to process them in reverse order to prevent overwriting the earlier mappings.\n\nWait, another thought: Each substitution is a function that maps certain digits to others. When you process a substitution, it's possible that it affects the digits that were previously mapped. So, if substitution A is processed before substitution B, and substitution B's rule includes a digit that substitution A also rules over, substitution B's effect may have been nullified by substitution A.\n\nTherefore, to correctly apply all substitutions, we need to process them in reverse order. That way, substitution B is applied first, then substitution A, and any digits that substitution B would have modified are not affected by substitution A, because substitution A hasn't been processed yet.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Start with the initial string s.\n2. Iterate through each substitution in reverse order.\n3. For each substitution (di → ti), replace all occurrences of di in the current string with ti.\n\nThis way, any substitution that comes later in the list (and thus earlier in processing) doesn't get overwritten by the earlier substitutions.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read all the queries and store them in a list.\n- Reverse the list so",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on an initial string of digits and then compute the resulting number modulo 1e9+7. The substitutions must be applied in reverse order to ensure that each substitution affects the string correctly without being overwritten by subsequent substitutions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Start by reading the initial string `s` and the list of substitution queries.\n2. **Reverse Queries**: Process the substitution queries in reverse order. This ensures that each substitution affects the string correctly without being overwritten by earlier substitutions.\n3. **Apply Substitutions**: For each substitution, replace all occurrences of the specified digit in the current string with the given substring.\n4. **Compute Result**: After processing all substitutions, compute the numerical value of the resulting string, ignoring leading zeros, and return the result modulo 1e9+7.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\nqueries = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    parts = input().split('->')\n    di = parts[0]\n    ti = parts[1]\n    queries.append((di, ti))\n\n# Reverse the queries to process them in reverse order\nqueries = queries[::-1]\n\nfor di, ti in queries:\n    s = s.replace(di, ti)\n\n# Now compute the number modulo MOD\nif not s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    num = 0\n    for c in s:\n        num = (num * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n    print(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read first. Each query is then read and stored as a tuple of the digit to replace and the replacement string.\n- **Reversing Queries**: By reversing the list of queries, we ensure that each substitution is applied in the correct order, starting from the last substitution to the first. This prevents earlier substitutions from overwriting the effects of later ones.\n- **Applying Substitutions**: For each query, every occurrence of the specified digit in the string is replaced with the corresponding substring.\n- **Computing the Result**: After all substitutions are applied, the resulting string is converted into a number. Leading zeros are ignored, and the result is computed modulo 1e9+7 to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that each substitution is applied correctly and efficiently, even when substitutions refer to digits that have been transformed by previous substitutions.",
