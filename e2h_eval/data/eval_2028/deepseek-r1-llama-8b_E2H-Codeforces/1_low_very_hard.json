    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Golden Plate,\" and from the description, I need to calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding k rings of gilding.\n\nHmm, let me try to understand the problem step by step. So the plate is divided into w rows and h columns of cells. Each ring is like a border around the plate, getting smaller each time. The first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells inward, and so on. Each ring is 1 cell thick.\n\nWait, the i-th ring is formed by the border of an inner rectangle. The size of that rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). Oh right, because for each ring, we subtract 2 from each side (top, bottom, left, right), so total 4 per dimension, hence multiplied by (i-1). \n\nSo for each ring i from 1 to k, I need to calculate the perimeter of that rectangle. But wait, the perimeter for a rectangle with width W and height H is 2*(W + H) - 4, because the four corners are counted twice when you do 2W + 2H.\n\nWait, let me think again. For a rectangle that's W cells wide and H cells tall, the perimeter is 2*(W + H - 2)*1, but that might not be accurate. Wait no, for example, a 3x3 square has perimeter 8 (each side is 3, so 4*3=12, but subtract 4 because the four corners are counted twice). So yes, 2*(W + H) -4 is correct.\n\nSo for each ring i, the current width is w_i = w - 4*(i-1), and height h_i = h -4*(i-1). Then the perimeter is 2*(w_i + h_i) -4. And then the number of cells in that ring is that perimeter. We sum this for all i from 1 to k.\n\nBut wait, what if for some i, either w_i or h_i is less than 3? Because each ring requires at least 3 cells in each dimension to form a valid perimeter. Otherwise, that ring can't exist.\n\nSo the first thing is to check whether for each i up to k, the corresponding w_i and h_i are at least 3. Because if not, perhaps that ring isn't possible. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's at most floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). So for example, if w is 3 and h is 3, min is 3, so (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. So the code doesn't have to handle cases where k is beyond what's possible.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each ring from 1 to k:\n   a. Calculate the current width and height.\n   b. Compute the perimeter as 2*(w_i + h_i) -4.\n   c. Add this to the total.\n\n2. Sum all these perimeters for each ring, and output the total.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples provided.\n\nFirst example input: '3 3 1'\n\nFor i=1, w_i=3, h_i=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3)-4= 8. So output is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example: '7 9 1'\n\ni=1: 7 and 9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 32-4=28. So output is 28.\n\nThird example: '7 9 2'\n\ni=1: 7+9=16, *2=32-4=28.\n\ni=2: w_i =7-4=3, h_i=9-4=5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4=16-4=12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe code needs to read the input, which is a single line with three integers: w, h, k.\n\nCompute the sum for i from 1 to k:\n\nsum += 2*( (w -4*(i-1)) + (h -4*(i-1)) ) -4\n\nWe can loop from 1 to k, compute each term, add to the total.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal =0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    w_i = w -4*(i-1)\n    h_i = h -4*(",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding k rings of gilding. Each ring is a border around the plate, with each subsequent ring being 2 cells inward from the previous one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is a border around a rectangle. The first ring is along the edge, the second ring is two cells inward, and so on. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, we need to calculate the perimeter of the corresponding rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle with width `W` and height `H` is given by `2 * (W + H) - 4`, which accounts for the four corners being counted twice if we simply sum the sides.\n3. **Iterate Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the current width and height of the rectangle, then calculate the perimeter and sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    width = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    height = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (width + height) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n- **Loop Through Each Ring**: For each ring from 1 to k, adjust the width and height of the rectangle by subtracting 4*(i-1) from both dimensions. This adjustment accounts for the fact that each ring is 2 cells inward from the previous one on both sides.\n- **Calculate Perimeter**: For each adjusted rectangle, compute the perimeter and add it to the total count of gilded cells.\n- **Output the Result**: After processing all rings, print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and calculating the perimeter for each step, ensuring that all edge cases are handled as per the problem constraints.",
