Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Guard Duty,\" and from the description, I understand that we need to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases in such a way that each base has exactly one guardian, each spaceship also has exactly one assigned base (so it's a perfect matching), and importantly, no two paths between a base and its spaceship intersect.\n\nHmm, so the key constraint here is that any two paths shouldn't intersect. Since all the points are in 2D space, the paths are straight lines. So, how do we ensure that none of these lines cross each other?\n\nLet me think about the problem step by step. We have R spaceships and B bases. Wait, wait, no—wait, the input says R is the number of spaceships, and B is the number of bases. But then the problem says it's a perfect matching, which implies that R must equal B, right? Because each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base and vice versa. Oh right, because R and B are given, but the output is based on whether a perfect matching exists. Wait, but in the input example, for instance, the first line is '3 3', so R equals B. If R doesn't equal B, then it's impossible, so we can immediately return 'No' in that case.\n\nWait, wait—the problem says R is the number of Rebel spaceships and B is the number of bases. We need to assign each spaceship to exactly one base, and each base to exactly one spaceship. So R must equal B, otherwise it's impossible. So the first thing I should check is if R != B. If they aren't equal, output 'No'.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input constraints say 1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10. So perhaps it's possible that R != B, but the code needs to handle that.\n\nSo step one: Check if R != B. If yes, output 'No'.\n\nIf R equals B, then proceed.\n\nNow, the main challenge is to determine if there's a perfect matching where all the connecting lines don't intersect.\n\nHow do we model this?\n\nHmm, thinking of it as a graph problem. Each spaceship is a node, each base is another set of nodes. We need to connect each spaceship to exactly one base, ensuring that the lines don't cross.\n\nWait, but how to represent the constraints between the assignments. Maybe we can model this as finding a permutation of the bases that corresponds to the spaceship order in such a way that the lines don't cross.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to checking whether the points can be matched in such a way that the lines form non-intersecting when ordered correctly.\n\nWait, maybe if we sort both the spaceships and the bases in some way, and then match them in order. But what's the correct order?\n\nAnother thought: For a set of points (spaceships and bases), if you can find a bijection (matching) between them such that when the points are sorted by their x-coordinate (or y), the corresponding lines don't cross.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if sorting is sufficient. Because even if the points are sorted, the lines could still cross if the order of the assignments isn't done properly.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to the concept of a non-crossing perfect matching between two sets of points. So, the question is whether such a matching exists.\n\nBut how do I model this? It feels like a problem that can be solved with backtracking or permutation checks, but given that R and B are up to 10, that's manageable.\n\nWait, but trying all permutations would be O(R!) which for R=10 is about 3.6 million. That's feasible.\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\n1. Check if R != B. If not, output 'No'.\n2. Generate all possible permutations of B bases (since each base must be assigned to exactly one spaceship).\n3. For each permutation, check if all the lines connecting the spaceships to the bases in the order of the permutation are non-crossing.\n4. If any permutation satisfies this condition, output 'Yes'; else, 'No'.\n\nBut wait, the spaceships and bases can be in any order. So perhaps for each possible permutation of the bases, assign the i-th spaceship to the j-th base in the permutation, and then check if the lines are non-crossing.\n\nWait, but the permutation represents the assignment of spaceships to bases. For example, if the permutation is [base1, base2, base3], then spaceship1 is assigned to base1, spaceship2 to base2, etc. Then, the lines are from spaceship1 to base1, spaceship2 to base2, etc. We need to ensure that these lines do not cross each other.\n\nBut how do I check if any two lines cross each other in the permutation's assignment?\n\nEach line is from a spaceship point to a base point. So for each pair of lines (s_i -> b_p[i], s_j -> b_p[j]), I need to check if they intersect.\n\nBut that might be computationally expensive for each permutation. Let's think about how to optimize this.\n\nAn alternative idea: for a given permutation, after assigning each spaceship to a base, the lines must be non-crossing. So the order in which the lines are drawn must be such that their connecting lines don't cross.\n\nWait, but the lines are between different points. How can we efficiently check if any two lines cross?\n\nI remember that two line segments (from s_i to b_p[i] and s_j to b_p[j]) will cross if and only if the points are arranged in a certain way.\n\nWait, but each line is a straight line between two points. So for any two lines, we can determine if they intersect. However, since each line is a connection between a spaceship and a base, the lines may cross each other even if they are not overlapping in the same segment.\n\nSo for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of lines (i,j) where i < j, and see if their lines cross.\n\nWait, but for each permutation, this is O(R^2) operations, which for R=10 is 100 steps per permutation. And with 10! = 3.6 million permutations, that's 3.6e8 operations. Hmm, that's 360 million operations. That might be a bit slow, but perhaps manageable in Python with optimizations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this problem as a bipartite graph where one partition is the spaceships and the other is the bases. An edge exists between a spaceship and a base if the line connecting them doesn't cross any other line that would be present in a particular matching. But I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into checking whether the points can be ordered in a way that allows for a non-crossing matching.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to arrange the spaceships and bases in a certain order and then find a non-crossing bipartite matching.\n\nAnother approach: The problem is similar to finding a non-crossing bipartite matching between two sets of points. So, perhaps the solution involves sorting the points and then checking for a non-crossing matching.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, suppose we sort the spaceships and the bases in a particular order, say, by their x-coordinates. Then, for each spaceship, connect it to the next available base in the sorted list. If this leads to a non-crossing matching, then it's possible. Otherwise, perhaps another arrangement is needed.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this approach always works.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a planar graph problem, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think differently. For the lines not to cross, perhaps the order in which the spaceships and bases are connected must be such that the lines are either nested or non-overlapping.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is that for any two lines s_i → b_p[i] and s_j → b_p[j], the order of the points along their respective paths must not cause the lines to cross.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this condition.\n\nAnother idea: For a given permutation of the bases, the lines are s_1 → b_1, s_2 → b_2, etc. To ensure that these lines do not cross, perhaps the following condition must hold: for any i < j, the line s_i→b_i must not cross s_j→b_j.\n\nBut how can we check this efficiently?\n\nTo check if two lines cross, perhaps we can compute the intersection point and see if it lies on both segments.\n\nSo, for two lines, defined by points a1, a2 and b1, b2, we can compute the intersection and determine if it's within the segments.\n\nBut implementing this for each pair of lines in each permutation might be computationally intensive, but manageable for R=10.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps again:\n\n1. Read R and B. If R != B, output 'No'.\n\n2. Read R spaceship coordinates into a list S.\n\n3. Read B base coordinates into a list Bases.\n\n4. Generate all possible permutations of the Bases list.\n\n5. For each permutation P:\n\n   a. Assign each spaceship i to base P[i].\n\n   b. For every pair (i, j) where i < j, check if the line from S[i] to P[i] intersects with the line from S[j] to P[j]. \n\n   c. If any pair of lines in this permutation's assignment intersect, mark the permutation as invalid.\n\n   d. If all pairs are non-crossing, then this permutation is valid, and the answer is 'Yes'.\n\n6. If any permutation is valid, output 'Yes'. Else, output 'No'.\n\nBut wait, for each permutation, step 5b requires checking all pairs of lines. For R=10, that's 45 pairs per permutation.\n\nBut generating all 3.6 million permutations and checking each one may take too long in Python, especially considering that for each permutation, we have to perform 45 line segment intersection checks.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can find a way to optimize this.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem can be approached differently. Instead of checking all permutations, perhaps we can model this as a bipartite graph where edges exist only if two points can be connected without causing a crossing with any other edges.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure how to model the bipartite edges in this case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is equivalent to finding a non-crossing perfect matching between the two sets of points. So, the question reduces to whether such a matching exists.\n\nIn computational geometry, there's an algorithm for finding non-crossing bipartite matchings, but I'm not familiar with the specifics. But perhaps, given the small size of R and B, a brute-force approach is feasible.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each permutation of the bases, assign each spaceship to the corresponding base in the permutation.\n\n- Then, for each pair of assignments (i, j), check if the lines S[i]-P[i] and S[j]-P[j] cross.\n\nIf for any permutation, none of the pairs cross, then output 'Yes'.\n\nElse, 'No'.\n\nSo, the crux is implementing the line segment intersection check efficiently.\n\nSo, let's think about how to implement that.\n\nGiven two line segments AB and CD, we need to determine if they intersect.\n\nThe standard approach is to compute the intersection of the lines AB and CD. Then, check if the intersection point lies on both segments.\n\nBut in practice, this can be done using the cross product to determine if the segments intersect.\n\nWait, here's a method:\n\nCompute the orientation of four points A, B, C, D.\n\nSegments AB and CD intersect if and only if:\n\n- The orientations of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) are different, and\n\n- The orientations of (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) are different.\n\nOr, if one of the endpoints lies on the other segment.\n\nWait, I think the correct condition is:\n\nSegments AB and CD intersect if and only if:\n\n- Points A and B are on opposite sides of CD, and points C and D are on opposite sides of AB.\n\nOR\n\n- One of the endpoints is on the other segment.\n\nBut perhaps the standard way to implement this is to use the cross product to find the orientation.\n\nSo, let's write a helper function to determine if two line segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nImplementing this function is crucial.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the helper function:\n\nFunction: segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2)\n\nWhere a1, a2 are endpoints of segment AB, and b1, b2 are endpoints of segment CD.\n\nWe can compute the orientation of three points to determine the relative position.\n\nCompute the orientation of a1, a2, b1.\n\nCompute the orientation of a1, a2, b2.\n\nSimilarly, compute the orientation of b1, b2, a1.\n\nAnd the orientation of b1, b2, a2.\n\nSegments AB and CD intersect if:\n\n- The general case: (a1 and a2 are on opposite sides of CD) AND (b1 and b2 are on opposite sides of AB).\n\nOR\n\n- One of the endpoints lies on the other segment.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to handle all cases using the orientation.\n\nSo, for two line segments AB and CD:\n\nIf any of the following is true, the segments intersect:\n\n1. Point C lies on segment AB, or\n\n2. Point D lies on segment AB,\n\n3. Point A lies on segment CD, or\n\n4. Point B lies on segment CD,\n\n5. General case where the segments cross each other.\n\nBut for our purposes, since the points are in general position (no three colinear), the last case can be checked via the orientation method.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model the general case.\n\nSo, the code for the helper function can be as follows.\n\nBut for now, perhaps I can find a standard implementation of line segment intersection using the orientation method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a way to compute the intersection.\n\nAnother approach is to parameterize the lines and find if they intersect within the segments.\n\nBut perhaps using the cross product is more efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the following steps:\n\nCheck if the bounding boxes of the two segments intersect. If not, return False.\n\nIf the bounding boxes do intersect, then proceed to check if the segments cross.\n\nTo compute the orientation, we can use the cross product.\n\nSo, the helper function can be structured as:\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0])*(C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1])*(C[0] - A[0])\n\nThis returns:\n- Positive if C is counterclockwise from AB,\n- Negative if clockwise,\n- Zero if collinear.\n\nThen, the segments_intersect function can be written as:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    # Check if a-b and c-d intersect\n    ccw1 = ccw(a, b, c)\n    ccw2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n    ccw3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n    ccw4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n\n    # General case: segments intersect if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0)\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n\n    # Special cases: one endpoint is on the other segment\n    # Check if c is on ab\n    if ccw(a, b, c) == 0 and on_segment(a, b, c):\n        return True\n    # Check if d is on ab\n    if ccw(a, b, d) == 0 and on_segment(a, b, d):\n        return True\n    # Check if a is on cd\n    if ccw(c, d, a) == 0 and on_segment(c, d, a):\n        return True\n    # Check if b is on cd\n    if ccw(c, d, b) == 0 and on_segment(c, d, b):\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\nAnd a helper function to check if a point is on a segment:\n\ndef on_segment(a, b, c):\n    # Check if c is on the line segment ab\n    return (min(a[0], b[0]) <= c[0] <= max(a[0], b[0])) and \\\n           (min(a[1], b[1]) <= c[1] <= max(a[1], b[1]))\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to just use the ccw function and the previous conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can avoid the on_segment function by modifying the general case.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the helper function can be implemented as above.\n\nOnce I have this helper function, I can proceed.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each permutation of the bases:\n\n   For each i from 0 to R-1:\n\n      spaceship = S[i]\n\n      base = P[i]\n\n      create a line from spaceship to base\n\n   Then, for all pairs (i, j) where i < j:\n\n      check if line i and line j intersect.\n\n      if any pair does, this permutation is invalid.\n\n   if no intersections, then return 'Yes'\n\nIf any permutation is valid, output 'Yes'; else, 'No'.\n\nBut the problem is that for R=10, the number of permutations is 3.6 million, and for each permutation, checking 45 pairs is 162 million operations. That's a lot for Python, which can handle about 1e6 operations per second, so 1e8 would take about 100 seconds, which is over the time limit.\n\nWait, but 3.6 million permutations multiplied by 45 pairs each is about 162 million segment checks. That's a lot.\n\nSo, this approach may be too slow for R=10.\n\nHmm, is there a smarter way?\n\nPerhaps we can model this as a bipartite graph where edges are allowed only if the lines don't cross, and then find a perfect matching. But how to model the edges.\n\nWait, perhaps each spaceship can be connected to any base, but with the condition that when they are connected, the line between them doesn't cross any other line in the matching.\n\nBut building such a graph is tricky because the edges depend on the other edges in the matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph where edges are only allowed if the two points are in a certain order, like sorted in a way that avoids crossings.\n\nWait, another idea: Sort the spaceships and the bases in a certain order (like x-coordinate), and then find a non-crossing bipartite matching.\n\nWait, here's an approach inspired by the problem of matching points in a plane without crossings.\n\nSort the spaceships and the bases in the same order, say, by their x-coordinate (or y-coordinate). Then, for each spaceship, connect to the earliest possible base in the sorted list that hasn't been used yet and doesn't cause a crossing.\n\nThis is similar to the greedy algorithm used in the problem of finding a non-crossing matching.\n\nWait, but this might not always find a solution if one exists, but perhaps in this problem, due to the small constraints, we can try this approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a bipartite graph where edges are only allowed if the two points are in a certain order, allowing us to model it as a bipartite graph and find a maximum matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to a bipartition where the two sets are the spaceships and the bases, and an edge exists between a spaceship and a base if the line connecting them doesn't cross any other line in the matching. But this seems circular.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to look for another approach.\n\nWait, another idea: Since the problem requires that all lines do not cross each other, perhaps the order in which the lines are drawn is such that the slopes are monotonic, or something similar.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for a perfect matching to be non-crossing, the sequence of connections must form a structure where the lines are either nested or non-overlapping.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be considered as a problem of finding a permutation of the bases such that when the lines are drawn from spaceships to the bases in that permutation order, the lines do not cross.\n\nWhich brings us back to the initial approach of trying all permutations.\n\nBut with R=10, it's computationally heavy.\n\nHmm, perhaps in practice, the test cases are small, and the code can pass within the time constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to optimize the code.\n\nFor example, in Python, using itertools.permutations is efficient, but for 10 elements, it's manageable.\n\nBut 3.6 million permutations, each requiring 45 checks, each involving four points and some calculations—perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think about the time.\n\nAssuming each permutation check takes about 1e-6 seconds (which is very optimistic), 3.6 million permutations would take about 3.6 seconds. But each permutation's check requires 45 segment checks, each involving several calculations. So in reality, each permutation check would take longer.\n\nWait, but perhaps the code can be optimized further.\n\nWait, perhaps pre-sorting the spaceships and bases in a certain way can reduce the number of permutations we need to check.\n\nFor example, if the spaceships and bases are sorted, then perhaps any valid permutation is a supersequence of this sorted order. Or perhaps the permutation must follow a certain order based on the sorted lists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to matching the spaceships and bases in the same order after sorting.\n\nWait, perhaps if we sort the spaceships and bases in a certain way (like sorted by x-coordinate), and then match them in this order, the lines won't cross. But that's not necessarily the case.\n\nBut perhaps if the permutation is in the same order as the sorted list, the lines won't cross. So perhaps the first thing to do is to sort both the spaceships and bases, and see if that permutation works.\n\nBut perhaps not all cases can be handled this way.\n\nWait, for example, consider the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\nSpaceships:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nBases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWhen we sort the spaceships by x-coordinate, they are already in order.\n\nBases sorted by x-coordinate:\n\n-2 1, 0 3, 2 2.\n\nSo the permutation would be [base1, base2, base3], but in the sample, the assignment is [base1, base2, base3], but perhaps that leads to a crossing.\n\nWait, no— in the sample, the output is 'Yes', so that particular permutation is valid.\n\nSo perhaps, in that case, the sorted permutation is acceptable.\n\nAnother test case: sample input 2:\n\nR=2, B=2.\n\nSpaceships:\n\n(1,0), (2,2)\n\nBases:\n\n(2,1), (3,1)\n\nSo the sorted bases are (2,1) and (3,1).\n\nIf we match the first spaceship to the first base, and the second spaceship to the second base, the lines are from (1,0) to (2,1) and (2,2) to (3,1).\n\nDo these lines cross?\n\nLet's compute.\n\nLine 1: from (1,0) to (2,1). The slope is (1-0)/(2-1) = 1.\n\nEquation: y = x -1.\n\nLine 2: from (2,2) to (3,1). Slope is (1-2)/(3-2) = -1.\n\nEquation: y = -x + 3.\n\nFind intersection: x-1 = -x +3 → 2x=4 → x=2, y=1.\n\nSo the lines cross at (2,1), which is the base point of the first line and a point on the second line. So the lines cross, hence this permutation is invalid.\n\nHence, the output is 'No' as in the sample.\n\nSo, the approach of checking all permutations is correct, but the problem is the time.\n\nSo, perhaps in the code, we can pre-sort the spaceships and bases in some way to reduce the number of permutations we need to check.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternative Idea: The problem can be viewed as a bipartite graph where edges exist only if the line between a spaceship and a base does not cross any line that would be formed by any other assignment.\n\nBut this is difficult to model, as edges are dependent on other edges.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to proceed with the initial approach, despite the computational cost, given that R and B are small.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B, output 'No' and exit.\n\nRead R spaceship points into a list S.\n\nRead B base points into a list Bases.\n\nGenerate all possible permutations of the Bases list.\n\nFor each permutation P:\n\n   Create a list of tuples (S[i], P[i]) for i in 0..R-1.\n\n   For each pair (i, j) where i < j:\n\n      Check if the line from S[i] to P[i] intersects with the line from S[j] to P[j].\n\n      If any pair intersects, break and mark permutation as invalid.\n\n   If all pairs are non-crossing, then output 'Yes' and exit.\n\nIf no permutation is valid, output 'No'.\n\nSo, the code will involve:\n\n- Reading the input.\n\n- Generating all permutations of the bases.\n\n- Checking each permutation for validity.\n\nNow, in Python, the itertools.permutations function can generate the required permutations.\n\nBut for each permutation, we have to process all pairs.\n\nBut with R=10, it's 3.6 million permutations, each requiring 45 checks. That's 162 million checks. Each check involves four points and some calculations.\n\nBut perhaps with Python's speed, this is manageable, especially since the problem constraints are small.\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nImport necessary modules: itertools.\n\nRead R and B.\n\nRead R spaceship coordinates.\n\nRead B base coordinates.\n\nIf R != B, print 'No' and exit.\n\nElse, generate all permutations of the bases.\n\nFor each permutation in permutations(Bases):\n\n   current_matching = list(zip(S, permutation))\n\n   is_valid = True\n\n   for i in range(R):\n\n       for j in range(i+1, R):\n\n           a = current_matching[i][0]\n\n           b = current_matching[j][0]\n\n           c = current_matching[i][1]\n\n           d = current_matching[j][1]\n\n           if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n\n               is_valid = False\n\n               break\n\n       if not is_valid:\n\n           break\n\n   if is_valid:\n\n       print(\"Yes\")\n\n       exit()\n\nAfter all permutations, print \"No\".\n\nWait, but the zip is between S and the permutation. So S is a list of R points, and the permutation is a list of B points (but since R=B, it's a permutation of all B points). So, for each i, current_matching[i] is (S[i], perm[i]).\n\nThen, for each pair i < j, we check the lines between (S[i], perm[i]) and (S[j], perm[j]).\n\nWait, but in the code, the permutation is of the Bases list. So for each i, perm[i] is the i-th base in the permutation.\n\nSo, current_matching[i] is (S[i], perm[i]).\n\nBut in the code, for each permutation, we create a list of tuples by zipping S and the permutation.\n\nWait, but S is a list of R points, and the permutation is a list of B points. Since R = B, this is okay.\n\nSo, for each permutation P in itertools.permutations(Bases):\n\n   assign each spaceship S[i] to base P[i].\n\n   Then, for each pair i < j, check if the line S[i]P[i] and S[j]P[j] intersect.\n\nThus, the code structure is correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement the segments_intersect function.\n\nWait, but in the code, the points are stored as tuples (x, y). So, the function can take four tuples as arguments.\n\nSo, the helper functions:\n\nImplement the ccw function.\n\nImplement the on_segment function.\n\nImplement the segments_intersect function.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the on_segment function can be incorporated into the segments_intersect function.\n\nBut for the purposes of code, perhaps it's better to have a helper function for segments_intersect that uses the ccw function.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nImplement the ccw function as:\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\nThen, the segments_intersect function:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    # Check if line segment ab intersects with line segment cd.\n    # a, b: endpoints of first segment.\n    # c, d: endpoints of second segment.\n\n    ccw1 = ccw(a, b, c)\n    ccw2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n    ccw3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n    ccw4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n\n    # General case: the segments cross each other.\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n\n    # Check if any endpoint lies on the other segment.\n    # Check if c is on ab.\n    if ccw(a, b, c) == 0 and on_segment(a, b, c):\n        return True\n    # Check if d is on ab.\n    if ccw(a, b, d) == 0 and on_segment(a, b, d):\n        return True\n    # Check if a is on cd.\n    if ccw(c, d, a) == 0 and on_segment(c, d, a):\n        return True\n    # Check if b is on cd.\n    if ccw(c, d, b) == 0 and on_segment(c, d, b):\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\nAnd on_segment function:\n\ndef on_segment(a, b, c):\n    # Check if point c is on segment ab.\n    # First, check if c is between a and b.\n    if min(a[0], b[0]) <= c[0] <= max(a[0], b[0]) and \\\n       min(a[1], b[1]) <= c[1] <= max(a[1], b[1]):\n        # Then, check if the area is zero (collinear) and c is between a and b.\n        if ccw(a, b, c) == 0:\n            return True\n    return False\n\nWait, but wait— the on_segment function is supposed to return True only if c is on the line segment ab.\n\nSo, the function first checks if c is within the bounding box of a and b. Then, it checks if c is collinear with a and b.\n\nBut perhaps it's redundant to call ccw again, because if c is collinear and within the bounding box, it's on the segment.\n\nWait, but the on_segment function is called only when the ccw is zero in the segments_intersect function.\n\nSo, perhaps in the on_segment function, it's sufficient to just check the bounding box.\n\nWait, perhaps the on_segment function can be simplified.\n\nBecause, if c is collinear with a and b (ccw is zero), and lies within the bounding box, then it's on the segment.\n\nSo, the on_segment function can be:\n\ndef on_segment(a, b, c):\n    # Check if c is on the line segment ab.\n    return (min(a[0], b[0]) <= c[0] <= max(a[0], b[0]) and\n            min(a[1], b[1]) <= c[1] <= max(a[1], b[1]))\n\nBecause if c is collinear, and within the bounding box, it's on the segment.\n\nSo, in the segments_intersect function, when checking for endpoints on the other segment, it can be done as:\n\nif ccw(a, b, c) == 0 and on_segment(a, b, c):\n\nBut perhaps it's better to compute the on_segment as a helper function.\n\nSo, with this setup, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, testing this code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\nSpaceships:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nBases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSample Output: Yes.\n\nIn this case, the permutation that assigns the first spaceship to the first base, second to second, third to third would produce lines that do not cross.\n\nSo, the code should find at least one permutation that satisfies the condition.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 2\n\nSpaceships:\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\nBases:\n\n2 1\n\n3 1\n\nSample Output: No.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the only permutation is [(2,1), (3,1)], which connects the spaceships in order. The lines between (1,0)-(2,1) and (2,2)-(3,1) cross at (2,1), so the code will detect this and output 'No'.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the permutation is generated as a tuple from itertools.permutations(Bases). So, each permutation is a tuple of the Bases, which are in the same order as the input. So, for each permutation P, the assignment is S[i] to P[i].\n\nBut the code must read the input correctly.\n\nWait, the input has R lines of spaceship coordinates, followed by B lines of base coordinates.\n\nSo, the code will read R and B, then read R spaceship points, then read B base points.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef on_segment(a, b, c):\n    return (min(a[0], b[0]) <= c[0] <= max(a[0], b[0]) and\n            min(a[1], b[1]) <= c[1] <= max(a[1], b[1]))\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    # a and b are endpoints of the first segment, c and d of the second.\n    ccw1 = ccw(a, b, c)\n    ccw2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n    ccw3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n    ccw4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n\n    # General case: lines cross.\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n\n    # Check if c is on ab.\n    if ccw1 == 0 and on_segment(a, b, c):\n        return True\n    # Check if d is on ab.\n    if ccw2 == 0 and on_segment(a, b, d):\n        return True\n    # Check if a is on cd.\n    if ccw3 == 0 and on_segment(c, d, a):\n        return True\n    # Check if b is on cd.\n    if ccw4 == 0 and on_segment(c, d, b):\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    data = []\n    R, B = map(int, data.readline().split())\n    data.readline()  # skip empty line?\n    # Read R spaceship coordinates.\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, data.readline().split())\n        data.append( (x, y) )\n    # Read B base coordinates.\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, data.readline().split())\n        data.append( (x, y) )\n    # Now, data has R + B points.

So, the code reads R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases.\n\nBut in the code above, after reading R and B, the code reads R lines, appending to data, then reads B lines, appending to data. So, data contains R + B points.\n\nBut for the code, the first R points are spaceships, the next B are bases.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, the code will read R=3, B=3.\n\nThen read 3 spaceship",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. Additionally, the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect in 2D space.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We need a perfect matching between R spaceships and B bases such that the lines connecting each spaceship to its assigned base do not intersect. This requires checking all possible permutations of assignments to ensure non-crossing paths.\n2. **Sorting and Permutations**: Given the small constraints (R and B up to 10), we can generate all permutations of the bases and check each permutation for validity.\n3. **Line Segment Intersection Check**: For each permutation, we check if any two lines connecting spaceships to bases intersect using the cross product to determine orientation and on-segment checks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef on_segment(a, b, c):\n    return (min(a[0], b[0]) <= c[0] <= max(a[0], b[0]) and\n            min(a[1], b[1]) <= c[1] <= max(a[1], b[1]))\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    ccw1 = ccw(a, b, c)\n    ccw2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n    ccw3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n    ccw4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n\n    if ccw1 == 0 and on_segment(a, b, c):\n        return True\n    if ccw2 == 0 and on_segment(a, b, d):\n        return True\n    if ccw3 == 0 and on_segment(c, d, a):\n        return True\n    if ccw4 == 0 and on_segment(c, d, b):\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    data = []\n    R, B = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        data.append((x, y))\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        data.append((x, y))\n\n    S = data[:R]\n    Bases = data[R:]\n\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(Bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                a = S[i]\n                b = perm[i]\n                c = S[j]\n                d = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B), followed by their coordinates.\n2. **Generating Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, the code generates all possible ways to assign bases to spaceships.\n3. **Checking Segments**: For each permutation, the code checks if any two lines (segments) connecting spaceships to bases intersect using the `segments_intersect` function.\n4. **Output Result**: If a valid permutation is found where no segments intersect, the code prints \"Yes\".
