The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem is called \"The Number Games.\" Hmm. The setup is that there are n districts connected in such a way that each pair of districts has exactly one path between them. So the districts form a tree structure. Each district has a certain number of fans equal to 2^i, where i is the district number. The president wants to remove k contestants, but when he does that, the districts of these removed contestants will block all paths through them. So the remaining contestants must be able to reach each other via some path. He also wants to maximize the total number of fans of the remaining contestants.\n\nWait, so the goal is to select which k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^d for each d in the remaining is as large as possible.\n\nSo the task is to find which k districts to remove to keep a connected subtree (since the original graph is a tree) with maximum possible sum of 2^d for each node d in the subtree. And then output those k removed districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. So how do we approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about the properties of the nodes. Each node contributes 2^d to the sum. So higher-numbered nodes contribute exponentially more. Therefore, it's better to keep higher-numbered nodes if possible because their contribution is much larger.\n\nBut the problem is that removing a node disconnects its subtree. So the optimal solution likely involves finding a subtree where the sum is maximized, possibly by selecting a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible while being connected.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this as finding a subtree where the sum of 2^d is as large as possible, and then remove the nodes not in this subtree.\n\nBut since it's a tree, any subtree is connected. So the question reduces to finding a subtree of size (n - k) nodes (since we're removing k) that has the maximum possible sum of 2^d.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it: after removing k nodes, the remaining nodes form a connected subgraph. We want to choose which k nodes to remove so that the sum of 2^d for the remaining nodes is as large as possible.\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to choosing a subset S of the nodes, with |S| = n - k, such that S is connected, and the sum of 2^d for d in S is maximized.\n\nWait, but wait. The initial arrangement is a tree, so the connected components after removing any set of nodes are determined by the tree structure. So the remaining nodes must form a connected subtree.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to find a subtree T of the original tree, such that the number of nodes in T is (n - k), and the sum of 2^d for d in T is as large as possible. Then, we need to remove the nodes not in T.\n\nSo the key is to find such a subtree T with the maximum sum, and then output the nodes not in T.\n\nNow, how to find T.\n\nSince 2^d grows exponentially, the optimal strategy is to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. But the challenge is that including a high-numbered node may require including some lower-numbered nodes to maintain connectivity.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal T is a subtree consisting of the highest possible nodes. For example, if we can find a chain where each node is connected to the next higher node, then including those would maximize the sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes the last k+1 nodes in some chain. Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, let's think about the example given.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nn=6, k=3.\n\nThe tree is as follows:\n\nLooking at the input lines:\n\n2-1\n\n2-6\n\n4-2\n\n5-6\n\n2-3\n\nWait, so the tree is built as:\n\n1 is connected to 2.\n\n2 is connected to 3, 4, 6.\n\n6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo the structure is like:\n\n1\n\n|\n2\n\n/ | \\\n\n3 4 6\n\n   |\n\n   5\n\nSo the numbers of the nodes are 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nThe sample removes 1,3,4. So the remaining nodes are 2,5,6.\n\nWait, no. Because 2 is connected to 6, which is connected to 5. So the remaining nodes form a connected subtree. The sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 +32 +64=100.\n\nBut why not, for example, include 2,6,5,3? That would give a sum of 4+64+32 +8= 108, which is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component with the maximum possible total number of fans. The number of fans of a contestant from district \\(i\\) is \\(2^i\\), which grows exponentially with \\(i\\). Therefore, to maximize the total number of fans, we should aim to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring they remain connected.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure Insight**: The districts form a tree structure, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts. Removing a district will disconnect its subtree.\n2. **Exponential Contribution**: Higher-numbered districts contribute significantly more to the total number of fans due to the exponential growth of \\(2^i\\).\n3. **Greedy Strategy**: We should focus on keeping the highest possible districts connected. This involves identifying a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes while maintaining connectivity.\n4. **Optimal Subtree Selection**: The optimal subtree will be the one that includes the last \\(n - k\\) districts in a chain, ensuring they are connected and thus maximizing the sum of \\(2^i\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nsys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n    \n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    order = []\n    \n    def dfs(u):\n        visited[u] = True\n        order.append(u)\n        for v in edges[u]:\n            if not visited[v]:\n                dfs(v)\n    \n    dfs(n)\n    \n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(order)):\n        if i >= len(order) - (n - k):\n            result.append(order[i])\n    result.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of districts \\(n\\) and the number of districts to remove \\(k\\). It then reads the edges of the tree structure.\n2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: A DFS is performed starting from the highest-numbered district \\(n\\). This traversal helps determine the order of visiting nodes, which is crucial for selecting the optimal subtree.\n3. **Selecting Nodes to Remove**: After determining the order of node visits, the code selects the last \\(n - k\\) nodes from this order. These nodes form the optimal connected subtree, ensuring maximum fan count.\n4. **Output**: The nodes to be removed are printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the optimal districts to remove by leveraging the properties of tree structures and the exponential contribution of higher-numbered districts.",
