Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about finding two vouchers that don't overlap, their durations add up exactly to x, and the total cost is as minimal as possible. If no such pair exists, we return -1.\n\nLet me break down the problem. We have n vouchers. Each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost costi. The duration of each voucher is ri - li + 1. We need to choose two different vouchers i and j. These two must not intersect, meaning either the first ends before the second starts (ri < lj) or the second ends before the first starts (rj < li). Also, the sum of their durations should be exactly x. And among all such possible pairs, we need the one with the smallest total cost.\n\nHmm, okay. So first, I need to find all possible pairs of vouchers where the sum of their durations is x. For each such pair, check if they don't overlap, and keep track of the minimum cost.\n\nBut wait, considering the constraints: n can be up to 2e5. So a brute-force approach checking all possible pairs would be O(n^2), which for 2e5 is way too big—like 4e10 operations. That's definitely not going to work. So I need a smarter way.\n\nSo I need an efficient way to find for each voucher, another voucher whose duration is x minus its own duration, and doesn't overlap.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can group the vouchers by their duration. For each voucher, I can look for vouchers of duration d = x - current duration, and then find the cheapest non-overlapping one.\n\nBut even that might be tricky because for each voucher, we have to consider both possibilities: whether it comes before or after the other voucher.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can pre-process the vouchers in a certain way. Like, for each duration d, store the list of vouchers sorted by their end times, so that for a given voucher, we can quickly find the earliest possible non-overlapping voucher of duration x-d.\n\nHmm, but how do I efficiently find, for a given voucher, the best possible voucher of duration d that doesn't overlap and has the minimal cost?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the data. Maybe for each possible duration, I can keep a list of vouchers sorted by their end times, along with some information to allow quick querying.\n\nSo the plan could be:\n\n1. Precompute for each voucher its duration. So for each i, duration_i = ri - li + 1.\n\n2. For each voucher, compute the required duration of the other voucher as x - duration_i. Let's call this required_d.\n\n3. Now, for each voucher, we need to find another voucher j with duration_j = required_d, and either j ends before i starts (rj < li) or j starts after i ends (lj > ri).\n\n4. Among these, find the one with the minimal cost.\n\nBut since n is large, we can't process each voucher naively. So we need a way to, for each voucher, quickly find the best possible j.\n\nIdea: for each possible duration d, keep a list of all vouchers with duration d, sorted by their end time. Then, for a given voucher i with duration d_i, we can look for required_d = x - d_i. We need to find vouchers j in the list for required_d that either end before i starts (rj < li) or start after i ends (lj > ri).\n\nSo for each d, have a list of vouchers of that duration, sorted by their end time. Also, perhaps, for each d, maintain a prefix minimum cost array, so that for any query range, we can quickly find the minimal cost.\n\nAlternatively, for each required_d, when looking for a voucher j that ends before i starts, we can perform a binary search on the sorted end times of j's. Similarly, for j's that start after i ends, we can binary search on their start times.\n\nWait, let's outline the steps:\n\n- Preprocess: group vouchers by their duration. For each d, create a list of all vouchers with duration d, and sort them by their end time.\n\n- Also, for each d, create a list of vouchers sorted by their start time, perhaps, but not sure if that's needed.\n\nThen, for each voucher i:\n\n   a. Compute required_d = x - duration_i.\n\n   b. If required_d is negative, skip (since durations are positive).\n\n   c. Check if there are vouchers in required_d.\n\n   d. For each voucher j in required_d:\n\n      i. Check if j doesn't overlap with i. This can be done in two cases: j ends before i starts (rj < li) or j starts after i ends (lj > ri).\n\n      ii. Among all such j's, find the one with the minimal cost.\n\nBut even this is O(n^2) in the worst case. Because for each i, you might have to scan through a lot of j's.\n\nSo perhaps, for each required_d, we can build a structure that allows us to quickly find the minimal cost j that doesn't overlap with i.\n\nHmm. So for each d, we can have a list of vouchers sorted by their end time. Then, for a given i, to find j's that end before i starts, we can binary search the maximum j.end <= (li - 1). Once we have that index, we can look for the minimal cost in the prefix up to that point.\n\nSimilarly, for j's that start after i ends, we can binary search for j.start >= ri + 1, and then look for the minimal cost in the suffix from that index.\n\nBut how do we get the minimal cost in those ranges quickly?\n\nIdea: for each d, keep track of two arrays:\n\n- A sorted list of end times, along with a prefix minimum cost array. So for any position in the sorted end times, the prefix min gives the minimal cost up to that point.\n\nSimilarly, for the start times, perhaps, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for the sorted end times, we can also have a prefix min.\n\nWait, maybe for each d, we can sort the vouchers by their end time and also compute a prefix min array of cost. Then, for a given i, to find all j's with end time <= li -1, we can find the last such j in the sorted list. Then, the minimal cost in this subset can be found via the prefix min array.\n\nSimilarly, for j's that start after i ends, we can sort the vouchers by their start time, and find the first j.start >= ri +1, and then in the suffix, find the minimal cost.\n\nWait, but the same vouchers can be in both lists. Because a voucher j can be considered both as ending before i and starting after i, depending on i.\n\nSo for each d, perhaps we can create two separate sorted lists:\n\n1. Sorted by end time. For this list, for a given i, we can find the latest j that ends before i starts. The minimal cost up to that point is known.\n\n2. Sorted by start time. For this list, we can find the earliest j that starts after i ends. The minimal cost from that point onward is known.\n\nBut how to represent the minimal costs in these subsets.\n\nAlternatively, for each d, have two structures:\n\n- A list sorted by end time, with a prefix min array.\n\n- A list sorted by start time, with a suffix min array.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nFor the end-sorted list:\n\nEach element is a voucher j, sorted by j.ri.\n\nWe can create a prefix_min array where prefix_min[k] is the minimal cost among the first k+1 elements (0-based).\n\nSimilarly, for the start-sorted list:\n\nEach element is a voucher j, sorted by j.li.\n\nWe can create a suffix_min array where suffix_min[k] is the minimal cost from element k to the end.\n\nSo, for a given i, required_d is x - duration_i.\n\nIf required_d is not present in our groups, continue.\n\nElse:\n\nCase 1: j ends before i starts.\n\nWe can use the end-sorted list for required_d. Binary search to find the largest j.ri <= (li -1). Let's say this is index k. Then, if k >=0, the minimal cost in the first k+1 elements is prefix_min[k]. Compare this with the current minimal cost.\n\nCase 2: j starts after i ends.\n\nWe can use the start-sorted list for required_d. Binary search to find the first j.li >= (ri +1). Let's say this is index m. Then, if m < len(start_list), the minimal cost in elements from m onwards is suffix_min[m]. Compare this with current minimal.\n\nThis way, for each i, we can efficiently find the minimal cost j that satisfies the conditions.\n\nYes, this seems manageable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read all vouchers.\n\n2. For each voucher, compute its duration and group them into a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration.\n\n3. For each duration d in the dictionary, process the two sorted lists and their corresponding prefix/suffix min arrays.\n\n   a. For the end-sorted list: sort the vouchers by their end time (ri). Create a prefix min array.\n\n   b. For the start-sorted list: sort the vouchers by their start time (li). Create a suffix min array.\n\n4. Initialize the minimal cost as infinity.\n\n5. Iterate over each voucher i:\n\n   a. Compute d_i = ri - li +1.\n\n   b. required_d = x - d_i.\n\n   c. If required_d is not in the dictionary, continue.\n\n   d. Else:\n\n      i. Get the end-sorted list for required_d. Binary search for the largest j.ri <= (i.li -1). Find the index k. If k >=0, take the prefix_min[k], add to i's cost, and see if it's smaller than the current minimal.\n\n      ii. Get the start-sorted list for required_d. Binary search for the smallest j.li >= (i.ri +1). Find the index m. If m < len(start_list), take the suffix_min[m], add to i's cost, and see if it's smaller.\n\n6. After processing all i, if minimal cost is still infinity, output -1. Else, output the minimal cost.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, data structures:\n\n- A dictionary, duration_map, where each key is a duration d, and the value is a tuple of two lists: end_sorted and start_sorted. Or perhaps, for each d, have a list sorted by end time, and another sorted by start time.\n\nWait, more precisely, for each d, we'll have:\n\n- end_list: list of vouchers, sorted by ri.\n\n- prefix_min_end: list where prefix_min_end[k] is the minimal cost in end_list[0..k].\n\n- start_list: list of vouchers, sorted by li.\n\n- suffix_min_start: list where suffix_min_start[k] is the minimal cost in start_list[k..end].\n\nSo, for each d in duration_map:\n\n   sort the vouchers in end_list by ri.\n\n   compute prefix_min_end: for each position k, it's min(end_list[0...k].cost)\n\n   sort the vouchers in start_list by li.\n\n   compute suffix_min_start: for each position k, it's min(start_list[k ... end].cost)\n\nOnce this is done, for any voucher i, we can process required_d and check both cases.\n\nNow, let's think about the binary search parts.\n\nIn Python, the bisect module can help. For the end_list, sorted by ri, to find the largest j where j.ri <= (i.li -1), we can use bisect_right. For example:\n\nimport bisect\n\ntarget = i.li -1\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(end_list, target, key=lambda x: x.ri) -1\n\nWait, no. Because the end_list is a list of objects, each with li, ri, cost. So perhaps, when we create end_list, we can extract the ri values into a separate list for bisect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when creating end_list, we can have a list of tuples (ri, cost, voucher object), so that we can extract the ri values for bisect.\n\nWait, perhaps for each d, end_list is a list of vouchers sorted by their ri. So, to create a list of just the ri values for bisect, we can precompute a list like [v.ri for v in end_list]. Similarly for start_list.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because for each d, end_list is a list of vouchers sorted by ri. So for the end_list, the key for bisect is the ri. So, for the binary search, we can pass a key function.\n\nWait, but in Python, the bisect module functions don't accept a key parameter. So we need to create a helper function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps create a list of just the ri values, and a list of the vouchers. Then, for each binary search, we can use the indices on the ri list.\n\nSo for end_list:\n\nri_values = [v.ri for v in end_list]\n\nstart_list_ri = [v.ri for v in start_list]\n\nWait, no. Wait, for end_list, we're sorting by ri, so the list is ordered by increasing ri. So for the end_list, the ri_values will be in order.\n\nSo, for a given target, like i.li -1, we can use bisect.bisect_right on ri_values to find the insertion point, then subtract 1 to get the last index where ri <= target.\n\nSimilarly, for the start_list, we need to find the first j where li >= (i.ri +1). So, we can create a list of li_values from the start_list, which is sorted in increasing order.\n\nSo, for the start_list, li_values = [v.li for v in start_list]\n\nThen, using bisect_left, find the first index where li >= (i.ri +1). That index is m. All vouchers from m onwards in start_list have li >= (i.ri +1).\n\nSo, for each i, the process is:\n\nrequired_d = x - d_i\n\nif required_d not in duration_map: continue\n\nelse:\n\n   end_list = duration_map[required_d].end_list\n\n   ri_values = [v.ri for v in end_list]\n\n   target_end = i.li -1\n\n   idx = bisect.bisect_right(ri_values, target_end) -1\n\n   if idx >=0:\n\n       current_min = end_list[idx].cost\n\n       if current_min + i.cost < global_min:\n\n           global_min = current_min + i.cost\n\n   # Now check the other case\n\n   start_list = duration_map[required_d].start_list\n\n   li_values = [v.li for v in start_list]\n\n   target_start = i.ri +1\n\n   m = bisect.bisect_left(li_values, target_start)\n\n   if m < len(li_values):\n\n       current_min = start_list[m].cost\n\n       if current_min + i.cost < global_min:\n\n           global_min = current_min + i.cost\n\nWait, but wait: the start_list is sorted by li, so for m, all start_list[m], start_list[m+1], ... have li >= target_start.\n\nBut to find the minimal cost among them, we need to find the suffix min starting at m.\n\nWhich brings me back to the suffix_min_start array for each d.\n\nSo for the start_list, we have a suffix_min_start array, where suffix_min_start[m] is the minimal cost from m to end.\n\nSo for the start case, after finding m, if m is within bounds, the minimal cost is suffix_min_start[m].\n\nSo, for each required_d, we need to have the suffix_min_start array.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFor each d in duration_map:\n\n   end_list = sorted by ri\n\n   compute prefix_min_end: for each position, the min cost up to that point.\n\n   start_list = sorted by li\n\n   compute suffix_min_start: for each position, the min cost from that point onwards.\n\nSo during preprocessing:\n\nfor d in duration_map:\n    end_list = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x.ri)\n    ri_values = [v.ri for v in end_list]\n    prefix_min_end = []\n    current_min = float('inf')\n    for v in end_list:\n        current_min = min(current_min, v.cost)\n        prefix_min_end.append(current_min)\n    \n    start_list = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x.li)\n    li_values = [v.li for v in start_list]\n    suffix_min_start = [0]*len(start_list)\n    current_min = float('inf')\n    for i in reversed(range(len(start_list))):\n        current_min = min(current_min, start_list[i].cost)\n        suffix_min_start[i] = current_min\n    \n    duration_map[d] = {\n        'end_list': end_list,\n        'prefix_min_end': prefix_min_end,\n        'start_list': start_list,\n        'suffix_min_start': suffix_min_start,\n        'ri_values': ri_values,\n        'li_values': li_values\n    }\n\nWait, but for each d, the start_list is sorted by li. So when building the suffix_min_start, we loop from the end to the beginning.\n\nSo, the code for preprocessing each d is something like:\n\nstart_list = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x.li)\nli_values = [x.li for x in start_list]\nsuffix_min_start = [0]*len(start_list)\ncurrent_min = float('inf')\nfor i in range(len(start_list)-1, -1, -1):\n    current_min = min(current_min, start_list[i].cost)\n    suffix_min_start[i] = current_min\n\nSo for each i in the start_list, suffix_min_start[i] is the minimal cost from i onwards.\n\nThus, for the start case:\n\nm = bisect.bisect_left(li_values, target_start)\nif m < len(li_values):\n    min_cost = suffix_min_start[m]\n    total = min_cost + i.cost\n    if total < current_min:\n        current_min = total\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nFirst, read n and x.\n\nThen, read n vouchers, each as a list or a class. Probably, create a Voucher class with li, ri, cost, duration.\n\nThen, for each voucher, compute its duration and add it to the duration_map.\n\nOnce all vouchers are processed, for each d in duration_map, process the end_list and start_list, and compute the prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nThen, iterate over each voucher i:\n\nCompute required_d = x - i.duration.\n\nIf required_d is not in duration_map, skip.\n\nElse:\n\nGet the end_list and start_list for required_d.\n\nFor the end case:\n\nFind the largest j where j.ri <= i.li -1.\n\nIf such j exists, get the minimal cost from prefix_min_end up to that index.\n\nAdd i's cost to this minimal cost and update the global_min.\n\nFor the start case:\n\nFind the first j where j.li >= i.ri +1.\n\nIf such j exists, get the minimal cost from suffix_min_start starting at that index.\n\nAdd i's cost to this minimal cost and update the global_min.\n\nSo, now, implementing this in code.\n\nBut wait, the initial step of grouping by duration.\n\nWait, perhaps, the duration_map is a dictionary where each key is a duration, and the value is a structure containing the end_list, start_list, etc.\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nIn code:\n\nimport bisect\n\nclass Voucher:\n    def __init__(self, li, ri, cost):\n        self.li = li\n        self.ri = ri\n        self.cost = cost\n        self.duration = ri - li +1\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nvouchers = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    li, ri, cost = map(int, input().split())\n    vouchers.append(Voucher(li, ri, cost))\n\nduration_map = {}\n\nfor voucher in vouchers:\n    d = voucher.duration\n    if d not in duration_map:\n        duration_map[d] = {\n            'end_list': [],\n            'start_list': [],\n            'prefix_min_end': [],\n            'suffix_min_start': [],\n            'ri_values': [],\n            'li_values': []\n        }\n    duration_map[d]['end_list'].append(voucher)\n    duration_map[d]['start_list'].append(voucher)\n\n# Now preprocess each duration\nfor d in duration_map:\n    # Process end_list\n    end_list = sorted(duration_map[d]['end_list'], key=lambda x: x.ri)\n    ri_values = [v.ri for v in end_list]\n    prefix_min_end = []\n    current_min = float('inf')\n    for v in end_list:\n        current_min = min(current_min, v.cost)\n        prefix_min_end.append(current_min)\n    duration_map[d]['end_list'] = end_list\n    duration_map[d]['ri_values'] = ri_values\n    duration_map[d]['prefix_min_end'] = prefix_min_end\n    \n    # Process start_list\n    start_list = sorted(duration_map[d]['start_list'], key=lambda x: x.li)\n    li_values = [v.li for v in start_list]\n    suffix_min_start = [0]*len(start_list)\n    current_min = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(start_list)-1, -1, -1):\n        current_min = min(current_min, start_list[i].cost)\n        suffix_min_start[i] = current_min\n    duration_map[d]['start_list'] = start_list\n    duration_map[d]['li_values'] = li_values\n    duration_map[d]['suffix_min_start'] = suffix_min_start\n\nmin_total = float('inf')\n\nfor voucher in vouchers:\n    required_d = x - voucher.duration\n    if required_d not in duration_map:\n        continue\n    info = duration_map[required_d]\n    # Case 1: j ends before i starts\n    # find j.ri <= voucher.li -1\n    ri_values = info['ri_values']\n    target_end = voucher.li -1\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(ri_values, target_end) -1\n    if idx >=0:\n        current_min = info['prefix_min_end'][idx]\n        total = current_min + voucher.cost\n        if total < min_total:\n            min_total = total\n    # Case 2: j starts after i ends\n    # find j.li >= voucher.ri +1\n    li_values = info['li_values']\n    target_start = voucher.ri +1\n    m = bisect.bisect_left(li_values, target_start)\n    if m < len(li_values):\n        current_min = info['suffix_min_start'][m]\n        total = current_min + voucher.cost\n        if total < min_total:\n            min_total = total\n\nif min_total != float('inf'):\n    print(min_total)\nelse:\n    print(-1)\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the code.\n\nBecause when we process each voucher, we are adding it to the end_list and start_list of its duration. But when we process each voucher, for the required_d, which is x - duration, the j's are from the required_d's end_list and start_list.\n\nBut when processing voucher i, j can't be the same as i. So in the code above, when we process voucher i, it's added to the end_list and start_list of its duration. So when we look for j in required_d's end_list, which may include i itself if required_d == i.duration.\n\nWait, no. Because required_d is x - i.duration. So unless x is 2 * i.duration, j could be i. But in that case, j is i, which is invalid since i and j must be different.\n\nSo in the code, when checking for j, we need to make sure that j is not the same voucher as i.\n\nBut how? Because in the preprocessing, j can be any voucher in the required_d's list, including i itself.\n\nSo, how to handle this?\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Because for each i, when required_d is x - d_i, and if d_i is x/2, then i is in the list. So when we look for j in the required_d's list, j could be i, which is invalid.\n\nSo, how to avoid selecting i as j?\n\nAlternative idea: when processing each i, during the checks for j, make sure that j is not i.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, when building the end_list and start_list for each d, we can include a flag to indicate whether a voucher is the same as i.\n\nBut that's probably not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: when processing each i, when checking the end_list for required_d, after finding the minimal cost, ensure that j is not i.\n\nBut how? Because the end_list includes all vouchers with required_d, including i.\n\nSo, for example, in the end_list, i could be in the list, and when we find the prefix_min_end up to some index, that index could be i's position.\n\nSo, in that case, the minimal cost is i's cost. Adding i's cost to i's cost would be 2*i.cost, but j and i are the same voucher, which is invalid.\n\nSo, how to prevent this?\n\nWe need to ensure that when j is i, we ignore it.\n\nSo, perhaps, during the binary search step, after getting the index, we need to check whether the voucher at that index is the same as i.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, in the end_list and start_list, each voucher is stored as a Voucher object. So, for each voucher in the list, we can compare their li and ri to i's li and ri.\n\nSo, during the end case:\n\nif idx >=0:\n\n    j = end_list[idx]\n\n    if j is not i:\n\n        current_min = info['prefix_min_end'][idx]\n\n        total = current_min + voucher.cost\n\n        if total < min_total:\n\n            min_total = total\n\nSimilarly, during the start case:\n\nif m < len(li_values):\n\n    j = start_list[m]\n\n    if j is not i:\n\n        current_min = info['suffix_min_start'][m]\n\n        total = current_min + voucher.cost\n\n        if total < min_total:\n\n            min_total = total\n\nYes, this way, we avoid considering j being i.\n\nBut comparing j to i could be expensive if done every time. But given that the number of vouchers is 2e5, and for each voucher we do this twice (once for end, once for start), each with a binary search, which is O(log n), it's manageable.\n\nSo, in code, we can modify the steps as follows:\n\nAfter getting idx in the end case:\n\nif idx >=0:\n\n    j = info['end_list'][idx]\n\n    if j != i:\n\n        current_min = info['prefix_min_end'][idx]\n\n        total = current_min + voucher.cost\n\n        if total < min_total:\n\n            min_total = total\n\nSimilarly for the start case.\n\nBut in Python, comparing objects (Voucher instances) for equality is straightforward as long as they have the same li, ri, and cost. So, the code can be written as:\n\nif j != voucher:\n\nSo, the code needs to be adjusted.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for each i, during the iteration, we have a voucher variable pointing to the current voucher. When we look up j in the end_list or start_list, j is a different object, but if j has the same li, ri, and cost as i, j == voucher would be True.\n\nSo, the condition j != voucher is correct.\n\nThus, the code should include this check.\n\nSo, modifying the code accordingly.\n\nAnother edge case: when x is zero? But according to the problem statement, x is at least 2, since n >=2 and x >=2.\n\nNo, the problem statement says x can be up to 2e5, but n can be 2, x can be 2.\n\nWait, no, the problem statement says x is the vacation duration, but the sum of two durations is x. So if x is zero, it's impossible. But according to the input constraints, x is 2 ≤ x ≤ 2e5, no, wait the input says 2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2e5. So x can be 2, 3, etc., but not zero.\n\nWait, no, the input says 2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105. So x is at least 2. So no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: when required_d is zero. But since each voucher has a duration of at least 1 (since li ≤ ri), required_d can only be zero if x is equal to the duration of the voucher. But then, required_d is zero, which is not possible, because no voucher can have duration zero.\n\nSo, required_d must be at least 1.\n\nSo, in the code, when required_d is less than 1, we can skip.\n\nBut in our code, when required_d is not in the duration_map, we skip.\n\nWhich handles the case when required_d is zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when the same voucher appears multiple times. But since the problem says i and j must be different, but vouchers are considered different based on their identity. So if a voucher is in the required_d's list, but is the same as i, it's skipped.\n\nSo, the code should now correctly handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2\n\nWait, no, wait the sample input as per the user's message is:\n\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4']\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the input earlier.\n\nWait, the first line is '4 5', meaning n=4, x=5.\n\nThen, four vouchers:\n\n1st: 1 3 4 → duration 3 (3-1+1=3)\n\n2nd: 1 2 5 → duration 2 (2-1+1=2)\n\n3rd:5 6 1 → duration 2 (6-5+1=2)\n\n4th: 1 2 4 → duration 2.\n\nSo, the required_d for each voucher:\n\nvoucher 1: duration 3. required_d =5-3=2.\n\nLooking for vouchers with duration 2.\n\nThese are vouchers 2,3,4.\n\nFor each j in these, check if j does not overlap with i.\n\ni is voucher 1: li=1, ri=3.\n\nCase 1: j ends before i starts (which is 1). Since j's end is <= 0? No, because j's end is at least 1 (since li >=1, ri >=li).\n\nWait, voucher 2: li=1, ri=2. So j.ri=2. i's li=1. So j ends at 2, which is after i's li=1. So j ends after i starts. So j and i overlap, so it's invalid.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for case 1, j must end before i starts. So j.ri < i.li.\n\ni's li is 1. j.ri must be <1. But j's ri is at least 1 (since li >=1, ri >=li). So for voucher 1, in case 1, there's no j.\n\nCase 2: j starts after i ends.\n\ni ends at 3. j's li must be >=4.\n\nLooking for j's in duration 2.\n\nWhich vouchers have li >=4?\n\nLooking at the vouchers 2,3,4: all have li=1,5,1.\n\nSo voucher 3 has li=5, which is >=4.\n\nSo j is voucher 3.\n\nj's cost is 1. i's cost is4. Total 5.\n\nWhich is the sample's correct answer.\n\nSimilarly, voucher 3's required_d is 5-2=3. Looking for duration 3, which is voucher1.\n\nCheck if voucher1 ends before voucher3 starts.\n\nVoucher1's ri=3. Voucher3's li=5. So yes.\n\nSo j is voucher1, cost 4. Voucher3's cost is1. Total 5.\n\nSo in the code, both i=1 and i=3 would contribute to the minimal total of 5.\n\nThus, the code would correctly output 5.\n\nIn the second sample, the input is:\n\n3 2\n\neach voucher has duration 3.\n\nSo required_d for each is 2-3=-1, which is invalid. So no possible pairs. Output is -1.\n\nThus, the code should handle these cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Time constraints: For 2e5 vouchers, each with two binary searches, and each binary search is O(log n), it's manageable.\n\n- Memory constraints: Storing the prefix and suffix min arrays for each d may require some memory, but 2e5 is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nAnother test case: when x is 4, and two vouchers of duration 2 each, non-overlapping.\n\nLike:\n\nn=2, x=4.\n\nvoucher1: 1-2, cost 1.\n\nvoucher2: 3-4, cost 1.\n\nThey don't overlap. Their sum is 4.\n\nTotal cost is 2.\n\nThe code should find this.\n\nAnother case: same as above but with three vouchers, and required_d is 2.\n\nBut in any case, the code should work.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when x is even, and a voucher's duration is x/2. So for each i, j could be the same as i, but the code skips it.\n\nThus, the code should correctly find the minimal cost, ignoring j=i.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers such that their combined duration equals the total vacation duration and their total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently searching for the optimal pairs using preprocessing and binary search techniques.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Data Structure Setup**: We use a dictionary to group vouchers by their duration. Each entry in the dictionary contains two lists: one sorted by the end day of the voucher and another sorted by the start day, along with prefix and suffix minimum cost arrays for efficient querying.\n\n2. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, we preprocess the vouchers to create:\n   - A list sorted by the end day, with a prefix minimum cost array.\n   - A list sorted by the start day, with a suffix minimum cost array.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Non-Overlapping Vouchers**: For each voucher, we compute the required duration for the second voucher to sum up to the total vacation duration. Using binary search, we efficiently find the minimal cost voucher that either ends before the current voucher starts or starts after the current voucher ends.\n\n4. **Edge Cases Handling**: Ensure that the same voucher is not considered as both parts of the pair, and handle cases where the required duration does not exist.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\nclass Voucher:\n    def __init__(self, li, ri, cost):\n        self.li = li\n        self.ri = ri\n        self.cost = cost\n        self.duration = ri - li + 1\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    idx = 0\n    n = int(data[idx])\n    x = int(data[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(data[idx])\n        ri = int(data[idx+1])\n        cost = int(data[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n        vouchers.append(Voucher(li, ri, cost))\n    \n    duration_map = {}\n    for voucher in vouchers:\n        d = voucher.duration\n        if d not in duration_map:\n            duration_map[d] = {\n                'end_list': [],\n                'start_list': [],\n                'prefix_min_end': [],\n                'suffix_min_start': [],\n                'ri_values': [],\n                'li_values': []\n            }\n        duration_map[d]['end_list'].append(voucher)\n        duration_map[d]['start_list'].append(voucher)\n    \n    for d in duration_map:\n        end_list = sorted(duration_map[d]['end_list'], key=lambda x: x.ri)\n        ri_values = [v.ri for v in end_list]\n        prefix_min_end = []\n        current_min = float('inf')\n        for v in end_list:\n            current_min = min(current_min, v.cost)\n            prefix_min_end.append(current_min)\n        duration_map[d]['end_list'] = end_list\n        duration_map[d]['ri_values'] = ri_values\n        duration_map[d]['prefix_min_end'] = prefix_min_end\n        \n        start_list = sorted(duration_map[d]['start_list'], key=lambda x: x.li)\n        li_values = [v.li for v in start_list]\n        suffix_min_start = [0] * len(start_list)\n        current_min = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(start_list)-1, -1, -1):\n            current_min = min(current_min, start_list[i].cost)\n            suffix_min_start[i] = current_min\n        duration_map[d]['start_list'] = start_list\n        duration_map[d]['li_values'] = li_values\n        duration_map[d]['suffix_min_start'] = suffix_min_start\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for voucher in vouchers:\n        required_d = x - voucher.duration\n        if required_d <= 0:\n            continue\n        if required_d not in duration_map:\n            continue\n        \n        info = duration_map[required_d]\n        # Case 1: j ends before i starts\n        ri_values = info['ri_values']\n        target_end = voucher.li - 1\n        idx_end = bisect.bisect_right(ri_values, target_end) - 1\n        if idx_end >= 0:\n            j = info['end_list'][idx_end]\n            if j != voucher:\n                current_cost = info['prefix_min_end'][idx_end] + voucher.cost\n                if current_cost < min_total:\n                    min_total = current_cost\n        \n        # Case 2: j starts after i ends\n        li_values = info['li_values']\n        target_start = voucher.ri + 1\n        m = bisect.bisect_left(li_values, target_start)\n        if m < len(li_values):\n            j = info['start_list'][m]\n            if j != voucher:\n                current_cost = info['suffix_min_start'][m] + voucher.cost\n                if current_cost < min_total:\n                    min_total = current_cost\n    \n    if min_total != float('inf'):\n        print(min_total)\n    else:\n        print(-1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution efficiently handles the problem by grouping vouchers by their duration and preprocessing them to allow quick lookups.
