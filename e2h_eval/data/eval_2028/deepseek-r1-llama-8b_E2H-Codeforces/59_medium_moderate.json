    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Happy Sets,\" and from the description, I need to find the number of different arrays of sets that satisfy certain conditions. \n\nHmm, let me try to parse the problem statement step by step.\n\nFirst, the definition: A set A is a child of set B if for every x in A, there's an x+1 in B. So, for example, if A has {1}, then B must have at least 2. If A is empty, then any B is a parent since the condition is vacuously true. Also, if A has elements up to x, then B must have all those elements plus x+1.\n\nThe task is, given N and K, to count the number of arrays of N sets [S_1, S_2, ..., S_N] such that:\n\n1. Each set can contain zero or more distinct integers from 1 to K.\n2. There exists a rearrangement of the array into [S'_1, S'_2, ..., S'_N] where each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}.\n\nAnd we have to output the count modulo 998244353.\n\nTwo arrays are considered different if any index has a different set. And two sets are different if they differ in at least one element.\n\nSo, the key here is to model the problem in terms of the properties that these sets must satisfy when arranged in some order. \n\nLet me think about the constraints on the sequence of sets after rearrangement. For each i, S'_i must be a subset of the next set's elements in a way that each element in S'_i is present as x+1 in S'_{i+1}.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the condition is that for every x in S'_i, S'_{i+1} contains x+1. So, for example, if S'_i is {1}, then S'_{i+1} must contain 2. If S'_i is {2}, then S'_{i+1} must contain 3, but wait, only if K is >=3. But since K can be up to 2e5, we need to handle that.\n\nWait, but each set is a subset of {1,2,...,K}. So for K=2, the maximum element is 2. So, for S'_i={2}, S'_{i+1} must contain 3, which is outside the allowed values. So in that case, S'_i can't be {2}, because there's no 3 in the universe. Therefore, for K=2, any set containing 2 can't have a parent, because 2+1=3 is beyond K. So in that case, if a set contains 2, it can only appear as the last set in the sequence.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So, the presence of higher numbers restricts how they can be used in the sequence. So, for a set S, the maximum element in S determines the possible next sets.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem can be modeled by considering the maximal elements of the sets. Because, for a set S, the maximal element m in S requires that the next set in the sequence must have m+1. If the next set doesn't have m+1, then S cannot be followed by that set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model each set in terms of the maximal element it has. Because for a set to be followed by another, all its elements must be covered by the next set's elements. So, the maximal element of the current set must be strictly less than the maximal element of the next set.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, consider S1 = {1,3}, and S2 = {2,4}. Then S1 is a child of S2 because 1 is in S1, and 2 is in S2; 3 is in S1, and 4 is in S2. So S2's maximal element is 4, which is higher than S1's 3. So, in general, the maximal element of the next set must be at least the maximal element of the current set plus one?\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think: for S_i's maximal element being m, then the next set S_{i+1} must have a maximal element of at least m+1. Because for S_i's elements, each x must be present in S_{i+1} as x+1. So, the maximal element m in S_i must have m+1 in S_{i+1}, which means that the maximal element of S_{i+1} is at least m+1. So yes, the maximal element of S_{i+1} must be greater than the maximal element of S_i.\n\nWait, but the maximal element of S_{i+1} could be greater than m+1. For example, if S_i's max is m, then S_{i+1}'s max is m+2. That's acceptable because S_{i+1} includes m+1, which is required by S_i.\n\nSo, the key insight is that the sequence of sets must be such that their maximal elements form a strictly increasing sequence. Because each next set must have a maximal element larger than the previous.\n\nBut wait, wait. Suppose S_i has a max of m, then S_{i+1} must have a max of at least m+1. So the sequence of maxima is non-decreasing? No, because m+1 could be equal to the next max, but that's only if the next set has exactly m+1 as its max.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me clarify. Suppose S_i has max m, then S_{i+1} must have m+1 as an element (because m is in S_i, so S_{i+1} must have m+1). So S_{i+1}'s max could be m+1 or higher. For example, S_i's max is 2, S_{i+1} could have max 3 or 4, etc.\n\nBut the point is, the sequence of maxima must be strictly increasing. Because each next set's max is at least the previous's max plus one. So the maxima form a strictly increasing sequence.\n\nSo, the entire array of sets must be such that when rearranged, their maxima form a strictly increasing sequence. Moreover, the order of the sets in the array must allow such a rearrangement. So, the original array can be any permutation of the sets that satisfies this condition.\n\nWait, no. Because the array can be any arrangement where such a permutation exists. So the array is allowed to have any order of the sets, as long as there exists some ordering where each consecutive pair meets the child condition.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all possible arrays of N sets, each of which can be represented by their elements (which are subsets of {1, ..., K}), such that the array can be rearranged into a sequence where each set is a child of the next.\n\nNow, how can we model this? It seems complex, but perhaps we can find a way to represent the sets in terms of their maximal elements.\n\nEach set S can be characterized by its maximal element m. The maximal element m determines which sets can come after S. Specifically, the next set must have a maximal element m+1, or higher.\n\nMoreover, for a set with max m, it can include any subset of the elements from 1 to m, as long as for every x in the subset, x+1 is included in the next set's elements.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the set S has elements, and the next set must include x+1 for every x in S. So, for example, if S has {1,2}, then the next set must have at least 2 (from 1+1) and 3 (from 2+1). So the next set's max must be >=3.\n\nSo the next set's max is at least m+1, where m is the max of S.\n\nWait, but S can have a max m, and the next set's max can be m+1, which implies that the next set must include m+1. Then, the next next set must have max >= (m+1)+1 = m+2.\n\nThis suggests that the maximal elements along the sequence must form a strictly increasing sequence.\n\nThus, the array can be reordered such that the maxima are strictly increasing. So, the multiset of maxima must be such that they can be arranged in an increasing order.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting all possible arrays of N sets where each set has a maximum, and when the array is reordered, the maxima are in strictly increasing order.\n\nFurthermore, the sets themselves must satisfy that for each set, all the elements x in the set have x+1 present in the next set in the ordered sequence.\n\nSo, the key is to model the problem in terms of the maxima of the sets.\n\nSo, for each set, let's denote its maximum as m. Then, the next set in the ordered sequence must have a maximum of at least m+1.\n\nNow, to count the number of valid arrays, perhaps we can model this as a dynamic programming problem where we track the current maximum and the counts.\n\nBut given that N and K can be up to 2e5, we need an O(N*K) solution or better.\n\nLet me think about the structure. For each position in the array, the set can have any maximum m, but once chosen, the next set's maximum must be >= m+1.\n\nWait, but the array can be any permutation as long as such a chain exists. So, the problem is similar to counting the number of sequences where the maxima are strictly increasing, but also considering the number of ways to choose the sets for each maximum.\n\nBut each set is determined not just by its maximum but also by the elements it contains, as long as all x in the set have x+1 in the next set.\n\nWait, but in the ordered sequence, for each set S_i, all elements x in S_i must be present in S_{i+1} as x+1. So, for example, if S_i contains x, then S_{i+1} must contain x+1.\n\nBut how does this affect the elements of S_i? Well, for each x in S_i, S_{i+1} must contain x+1. So, S_i can't have any x such that x+1 is not present in S_{i+1}.\n\nWait, but the next set in the ordered sequence is determined by the permutation. So, in the original array, the sets can be in any order, but when we arrange them in a particular order, say S_1, S_2, ..., S_N, each S_i must be a child of S_{i+1}.\n\nWait, but the problem allows us to permute the array as needed. So the array can be any collection of sets, as long as their multiset allows for such a permutation.\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to finding all possible multisets of N sets, such that when sorted in some order, the maxima are strictly increasing, and for each consecutive pair in this order, the next set contains all x+1 for x in the current set.\n\nSo, the first thing to note is that the maximum elements in the array must be a strictly increasing sequence. Because each step requires the next maximum to be at least one higher.\n\nTherefore, for any array to be valid, the maximum elements of the sets must be a strictly increasing sequence. So, the multisets of maxima must consist of a sequence m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N, where each m_i is between 0 and K (since the maximum can be zero if the set is empty).\n\nWait, wait. What is the maximum of an empty set? Since the set is empty, there are no elements, so the maximum is undefined. Or perhaps, by convention, the maximum is considered as -infinity or 0. But in our problem, the elements are from 1 to K. So, an empty set has no elements, so any set can be a parent of it.\n\nWait, no. Wait, according to the problem statement, a set is a child of another if for each x in the set, x+1 is present in the other. So, if the set is empty, then it's a child of any set, including the empty set. Because there are no elements to check.\n\nSo, in the sequence, the empty set can be followed by any set, including itself. So, for example, a sequence like [empty, empty, ...] is allowed.\n\nBut when considering the maxima, the empty set's maximum is something that doesn't affect the next set's maximum. So, for the purposes of building a chain of maxima, perhaps the empty set's maximum can be considered as 0, since it's the smallest possible.\n\nSo, the process is to assign each set in the array a maximum m_i, such that m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N, where m_1 can be 0, m_2 >= m_1 +1, etc., up to m_N <= K.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the maxima in the sequence must be strictly increasing, regardless of the order of the sets. So, when you reorder the sets, their maxima must form a strictly increasing sequence.\n\nBut the original array is a collection of sets, and the problem allows any permutation of this array that forms such a sequence.\n\nSo, the problem is to count all possible multisets of N sets, each of which is a subset of {1..K}, such that the multiset can be ordered in a way where the maxima are strictly increasing, and for each consecutive pair in that order, the next set contains all x+1 for x in the current set.\n\nHmm, but this seems quite abstract. Let's try to model the problem differently.\n\nPerhaps each set S can be uniquely determined by its maximum m. Because, for any set S, the maximum m is the largest element in S. Then, the next set in the ordered sequence must have a maximum of at least m+1.\n\nMoreover, for each x in S, x+1 must be present in the next set. So, the next set must contain all elements x+1 for x in S. This implies that the next set's elements are at least the elements of S shifted by 1.\n\nWait, but the next set can have additional elements. For example, if S has {1,2}, then the next set must have {2,3}, but can also have 4,5, etc., as long as they don't interfere with the previous conditions.\n\nWait, no. Because the next set must have 2 and 3. If the next set's maximum is 3, then it's okay. If it's 4, then it's also okay. So, the next set can have any elements, as long as it includes all x+1 for x in S.\n\nBut, for the next set, any elements beyond that are allowed. So, the next set can have any subset that includes all x+1 for x in S, plus any other elements. So, the next set must include x+1 for each x in S, but can have additional elements as well.\n\nSo, for a given S with maximum m, the next set must have a maximum >= m+1, and must include all elements x+1 for x in S.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely correct. Because the next set's elements could include x+1 for x in S, but also include other elements beyond that, as long as they are within 1..K.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose S is {1,2}, so the next set must have 2 and 3. So, the next set could be {2,3}, {2,3,4}, etc. Each of these is acceptable as the next set.\n\nSo, for a given S, the next set must include all x+1 for x in S, but can have any other elements as well, provided they are within 1..K.\n\nBut the next set's maximum must be at least the maximum of the required elements. For example, in S = {1,2}, the next set must have 2 and 3. So the next set's maximum is at least 3.\n\nSo, the maximum of the next set must be >= the maximum of (x+1 for x in S) union the elements of S.\n\nWait, no. Because S's maximum is m, then the next set's maximum is at least m+1. Because for x = m, x+1 must be in the next set.\n\nSo, regardless of other elements in S, the next set must have m+1, which implies that the next set's maximum is at least m+1.\n\nSo, the key is that for a set S with maximum m, the next set in the ordered sequence must have a maximum >= m+1.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to selecting N sets S_1, S_2, ..., S_N such that their maxima can be arranged in a strictly increasing order, and for each S_i in this order, S_{i} has a maximum m_i, and S_{i+1} has a maximum m_{i+1} >= m_i + 1.\n\nBut each S can be any subset of {1..K}, as long as the above conditions are met.\n\nWait, but the condition is that when the array is arranged in an order where the maxima are strictly increasing, each S_i must be a child of S_{i+1}.\n\nSo, for each i, S_i's maximum is m_i, and S_{i+1}'s maximum is m_{i+1} >= m_i +1.\n\nSo, the problem now is to count all possible sequences of N sets, where each set has a maximum m, and the sequence of maxima is strictly increasing, and for each consecutive pair, m_{i+1} >= m_i +1.\n\nBut each set is a subset of {1..K}, and the way the sets are chosen is such that for each consecutive pair in the ordered sequence, the next set contains all x+1 for x in the previous set.\n\nWait, but how does that affect the choices of the sets? For example, if S has maximum m, then S can include any subset of {1..m}, as long as all x in S have x+1 in the next set.\n\nSo, for each set S with maximum m, the next set in the ordered sequence must have a maximum >= m+1 and must include all x+1 for x in S.\n\nBut when building the array, the next set's maximum is determined by its own elements.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe we can model this using DP, where dp[i][m] represents the number of ways to choose the first i sets, ending with a set of maximum m.\n\nBut with N up to 2e5, a standard O(N*K) DP might be manageable, but we need to find a way to compute transitions efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the transitions. For the i-th set, its maximum is m. The (i-1)-th set's maximum must be less than m. So, for each possible m, we can sum over all m' < m the number of ways to have the first i-1 sets end with m', and then multiply by the number of sets S that have maximum m and can follow a set with maximum m'.\n\nWait, but what determines whether a set S with maximum m can follow a set S' with maximum m'?\n\nIt depends on whether S' is a subset of S's required elements. Because S' must contain all x+1 for x in S, which may impose additional constraints.\n\nWait, no. Because in the ordered sequence, S' comes before S. So S' must be a child of S. Which means that for every x in S', x+1 is in S.\n\nSo, S' can't have any x that isn't followed by x+1 in S.\n\nIn other words, S' can't contain any x that isn't present in S as x+1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S' is a child of S, so for every x in S', S must contain x+1.\n\nSo, for a set S' with maximum m', and a set S with maximum m, S' can precede S if and only if for every x in S', x+1 is present in S.\n\nWhich implies that m >= x+1 for all x in S'.\n\nWhich is equivalent to m >= max(S') + 1.\n\nBecause if S' has maximum m', then all x in S' are <= m'. So x+1 <= m' + 1. So, if m >= m' +1, then S will contain x+1 for all x in S'.\n\nSo, the condition is that m >= m' + 1.\n\nWait, yes! Because S must contain x+1 for all x in S', which implies that S's maximum is at least (max(S')) +1.\n\nSo, for any two sets S' (with maximum m') and S (with maximum m), S' can precede S in the ordered sequence if and only if m >= m' +1.\n\nTherefore, the condition for the DP transition is simply m >= m' +1.\n\nThis simplifies the problem.\n\nSo, the problem is now to count the number of ways to select N sets, each with a maximum m_i, such that m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N, and for each i, the set with maximum m_i can follow the set with maximum m_{i-1}.\n\nWait, no. Because the selection is of any array of N sets, which can be permuted into a sequence where the maxima are strictly increasing and each next maximum is at least one more than the previous.\n\nBut when building the array, the sets can be in any order, as long as there exists a permutation where the maxima are strictly increasing and satisfy the condition that each next maximum is >= previous +1.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting all possible multisets of N sets, each with a maximum m_i, such that the multiset can be ordered in a way where m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N, and for each i, the set with maximum m_i can be followed by the set with maximum m_{i+1}.\n\nBut since the condition for the sets to follow each other is that m_{i+1} >= m_i +1, the ordered sequence is a strictly increasing sequence of maxima.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to choosing N elements m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N, where each m_i is in [0, K], and for each i, the set with maximum m_i can be followed by the set with maximum m_{i+1}.\n\nBut how do we count the number of ways for each such sequence of maxima?\n\nFor each such sequence, the number of ways is the product, for each i from 1 to N, of the number of sets with maximum m_i that can be followed by any set with maximum >= m_i +1.\n\nWait, no. Because each set in the array can be any set with maximum m, provided that it can be followed by a set with a higher maximum.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because the next set in the ordered sequence must have a maximum >= m_i +1.\n\nBut when building the array, the sets can be in any order. So, the problem is to count all possible multisets of N sets where the multiset can be ordered into a sequence where the maxima are strictly increasing, and for each consecutive pair in this sequence, the next set's maximum is at least the current's maximum plus one.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the problem is equivalent to selecting a sequence of maxima m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N, where m_1 can be 0, and each m_{i} can be up to K, and for each i, the number of sets with maximum m_i is f(m_i). Then, the total number of ways is the sum over all possible m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N of the product f(m_1) * f(m_2) * ... * f(m_N), multiplied by the number of interleavings that allow such a sequence.\n\nWait, no. Because the sets can be arranged in any order, as long as the maxima can be arranged in a strictly increasing sequence. So, the order of the sets in the array is irrelevant as long as their maxima can be arranged in such a way.\n\nWait, but the array is a sequence of sets, and the problem allows any permutation of the array that satisfies the condition. So, for the array to be valid, the multiset of sets must allow such a permutation.\n\nBut perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the multiset can be partitioned into a strictly increasing sequence of maxima, and each set in the multiset must be compatible with being placed in the sequence.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into counting the number of valid sequences of maxima, multiplied by the number of ways to choose the sets for each maximum in the sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible sequence of maxima m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N, the number of ways to choose the sets is the product over each m_i of the number of sets with maximum m_i that can be part of the sequence.\n\nBut then, for each such sequence, the total number of arrays would be the product of the counts for each m_i multiplied by the number of ways to interleave the sets in the array.\n\nWait, no. Because the array can be any permutation of the sets, as long as their maxima can be ordered in a strictly increasing sequence. So, for a given multiset of sets, the number of valid arrays is equal to the number of permutations of the multiset that can be arranged into such a sequence.\n\nWait, but the array is considered different if any of the sets in any position differ. So, for example, if the multiset has multiple sets with the same maximum, swapping them in the array would result in a different array.\n\nSo, the problem is to count all possible multisets of N sets, each with a maximum m_i, such that the multiset can be ordered into a sequence where the maxima are strictly increasing, and for each consecutive pair, the next maximum is at least one more than the previous.\n\nBut how do we count the number of such multisets, multiplied by the number of ways to arrange them in the array?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the problem by considering that the array can be any sequence of N sets, and for each possible sequence of maxima m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N, the number of ways is the product of the number of sets with maximum m_i that can follow the previous set.\n\nWait, but this seems circular.\n\nAnother approach: For each possible m, let’s define f(m) as the number of sets S where the maximum is m. Then, for each i, the number of ways to choose the i-th set in the sequence is f(m_i), where m_i >= m_{i-1} +1.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem using dynamic programming where dp[i][m] is the number of ways to choose the first i sets, with the i-th set having maximum m.\n\nThe recurrence would then be:\n\ndp[i][m] = sum_{m' < m} dp[i-1][m'] * g(m, m')\n\nwhere g(m, m') is the number of sets with maximum m that can follow a set with maximum m'.\n\nBut what is g(m, m')?\n\ng(m, m') is the number of sets S with maximum m that can be placed after a set S' with maximum m'. As established earlier, this is possible if and only if m >= m' + 1.\n\nWait, no. Because for S' to be a child of S, S must contain all x+1 for x in S'. But since S' has maximum m', then S must contain m' +1. So, S's maximum must be >= m' +1. Thus, for a set S with maximum m, to follow S', m must be >= m' +1.\n\nSo, g(m, m') is the number of sets S with maximum m, which is equal to the number of subsets of {1..m} that include m (since the maximum is m), multiplied by the condition that m >= m' +1.\n\nWait, no. The number of sets S with maximum m is the number of subsets of {1..m} that include m. Because the maximum is m. So, the number of such sets is 2^{m-1}, since each element less than m can be either included or excluded.\n\nYes, because for each element less than m, you can choose to include it or not. But the element m must be included. So, 2^{m-1} options.\n\nSo, for each m, the number of sets with maximum m is 2^{m-1} if m >=1. For m=0, it's 1 (only the empty set).\n\nSo, f(m) = 2^{m-1} for m >=1, and f(0)=1.\n\nBut wait, the empty set has no elements, so its maximum is 0. So, f(0)=1.\n\nSo, for any m >=1, the number of sets with maximum m is 2^{m-1}.\n\nSo, for the transition in the DP, when we are adding a new set with maximum m, the previous set must have a maximum m' < m, and for each such m', the number of ways is the product of the number of sets for m' and the number of sets for m that can follow m'.\n\nWait, but the number of ways for a transition from m' to m is f(m), because each set with maximum m can follow any set with maximum m' < m.\n\nNo, wait. Because the condition is that m >= m' +1. So, for a transition from m' to m, m must be >= m' +1. So, for each m', the number of sets S with maximum m that can follow S' is f(m) if m >= m' +1, else zero.\n\nWait, but f(m) is the number of sets with maximum m. So, for a given m and m', the transition is allowed if m >= m' +1, and the number of ways is f(m) multiplied by the number of ways to choose the previous sets.\n\nSo, the DP transition is:\n\ndp[i][m] = sum_{m' < m} dp[i-1][m'] * f(m)\n\nWait, no. Because for each m' < m, the number of ways to add a set with maximum m is f(m) multiplied by the number of ways to have i-1 sets ending with m'.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because for each i-1, the number of ways to have a set ending with m' is dp[i-1][m']. Then, for the i-th set, we can choose any set with maximum m that can follow m', which is all m' < m. So, for each m, dp[i][m] is the sum over m' < m of dp[i-1][m'] multiplied by f(m).\n\nWait, no. Because f(m) is the number of sets with maximum m, and each such set can follow any set with maximum m' < m. So, for each m, the number of ways to choose the i-th set is f(m) multiplied by the sum of dp[i-1][m'] for m' < m.\n\nWait, yes! Because for each i-1, you have a sum over all possible m' < m of the number of ways to have a sequence of i-1 sets ending with m'. Then, for the i-th set, you choose any of the f(m) sets with maximum m.\n\nSo, the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i][m] = (sum_{m' < m} dp[i-1][m']) * f(m)\n\nBut since m can be up to K, and N is up to 2e5, we need an efficient way to compute this.\n\nThis looks like a prefix sum problem. Because for each i, and for each m, the sum of dp[i-1][m'] for m' < m is the prefix sum up to m-1.\n\nSo, let's define for each i, a prefix sum array pre_sum[i][m], which is the sum of dp[i][m'] for m' <= m.\n\nThen, for dp[i][m], it's pre_sum[i-1][m-1] * f(m).\n\nWait, no. Because pre_sum[i-1][m-1] is the sum of dp[i-1][m'] for m' <= m-1. So, the sum for m' < m is exactly pre_sum[i-1][m-1].\n\nSo, the recurrence becomes:\n\ndp[i][m] = pre_sum[i-1][m-1] * f(m)\n\nAnd pre_sum[i][m] = pre_sum[i][m-1] + dp[i][m]\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nNow, the base case is for i=1. dp[1][m] is f(m), because for the first set, it can be any set with maximum m.\n\nSo, for i=1, dp[1][m] = f(m), and pre_sum[1][m] is the sum of f(m') for m' <= m.\n\nOnce we have computed dp[N][m] for all m, the total number of arrays is the sum of dp[N][m] for m from 0 to K.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the array can be any permutation of the sets, as long as the maxima can be ordered into a strictly increasing sequence.\n\nWait, but the DP approach counts the number of sequences where the sets are added in order of increasing maxima. However, the array can have any order as long as such a sequence exists.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the DP approach. Because the DP[i][m] represents the number of ways to choose i sets where the last set has maximum m, and the previous sets are arranged in a way that their maxima are strictly increasing.\n\nBut the array can be any permutation of the selected sets as long as their maxima can be arranged in a strictly increasing sequence. So, the DP approach is counting the number of possible multisets of sets that can form such a sequence, but not the permutations.\n\nWait, no. Because the array is considered different based on the order of the sets, but the problem allows any permutation as long as there exists a valid ordering.\n\nSo, perhaps the DP approach is not directly applicable.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to count all possible sequences of N sets, regardless of their order, such that there exists an ordering where the maxima are strictly increasing and each next set's maximum is at least one higher than the previous.\n\nSo, each array is a sequence of N sets, which can be reordered into a strictly increasing sequence of maxima.\n\nBut the problem is to count the number of such arrays, considering that two arrays are different if any position differs.\n\nBut this seems difficult to model.\n\nAlternative approach: Think of the problem in terms of inclusion-exclusion. We need to count all possible arrays of N sets, each of which is a subset of {1..K}, and for which there exists a permutation of the array such that the sequence of maxima is strictly increasing and each next maximum is at least one higher.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother idea: For the array to be valid, it's necessary and sufficient that the multiset of sets can be ordered into a sequence where the maxima are strictly increasing, and each next maximum is at least one higher than the previous.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of such multisets.\n\nBut how do we count the number of multisets of N sets, each with a maximum m_i, such that the maxima can be arranged in a strictly increasing sequence.\n\nMoreover, for each such multiset, the number of possible arrays is equal to the multinomial coefficient based on the counts of each maximum.\n\nWait, perhaps. Because for each group of sets with the same maximum m, the number of ways to arrange them among themselves is determined by their multiplicities.\n\nWait, let's think: Suppose we have a multiset where there are c_0 sets with maximum 0, c_1 sets with maximum 1, ..., c_k sets with maximum k. Then, the number of ways to arrange these into a sequence where the maxima are strictly increasing is the product of factorials of the c_i's, multiplied by the number of ways to interleave the groups.\n\nWait, no. Because the sequence must have the maxima in strictly increasing order. So, the order of the sets is determined by their maxima. Within each group of sets with the same maximum, their order doesn't matter because they can't be followed by a set with a lower maximum.\n\nWait, no, because once the sequence is arranged in order of increasing maxima, the sets within each maximum group can be in any order relative to each other. Because their maxima are the same, but the condition is that each set's maximum is at least one higher than the previous. So, sets with the same maximum cannot be adjacent in the sequence.\n\nWait, no. Because if two sets have the same maximum m, then the next set must have a maximum >= m+1. So, sets with the same maximum cannot be consecutive in the sequence.\n\nSo, for the sequence to be valid, the sets must be ordered such that their maxima are strictly increasing, and each next maximum is at least one higher.\n\nSo, the multiset must consist of sets whose maxima form a collection of integers where each is >= the previous plus one.\n\nTherefore, the multiset can be grouped by their maxima, and the sequence must arrange these groups in order of increasing maxima.\n\nWithin each group, the sets can be arranged in any order because their maxima are the same, and they can't be followed by another set with the same maximum. So, within each group, the order of the sets doesn't affect the validity of the sequence.\n\nSo, for each group of sets with maximum m, the order of the sets in the array doesn't matter as long as they are placed in",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid arrays of sets such that there exists a permutation where each set in the sequence is a child of the next. This involves understanding the constraints on the maximum elements of the sets and using dynamic programming to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key insight is that for a set to be a child of another, the maximum element of the next set must be at least one more than the current set's maximum. This leads us to model the problem using dynamic programming (DP) where we track the number of ways to form sequences of sets ending with a specific maximum value.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We define `dp[i][m]` as the number of ways to form a sequence of `i` sets ending with a set whose maximum element is `m`. We also use prefix sums to efficiently compute the transitions between states.\n\n3. **Transition Function**: For each possible maximum value `m`, the number of ways to form a sequence ending with `m` is derived from the sum of all valid previous states multiplied by the number of sets with maximum `m`.\n\n4. **Prefix Sums**: To efficiently compute the transitions, we maintain prefix sums of the DP array, allowing us to quickly sum over all valid previous states.\n\n5. **Base Case**: For the first set, the number of ways to end with a maximum value `m` is simply the number of sets with that maximum value.\n\n6. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, we take results modulo `998244353` at each step to prevent overflow and ensure the solution fits within standard integer limits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    N, K = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    if K == 0:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # Precompute f(m) = number of sets with max m\n    f = [0] * (K + 2)\n    f[0] = 1\n    for m in range(1, K+1):\n        f[m] = pow(2, m-1, MOD)\n    \n    # Initialize DP\n    dp_prev = [0] * (K + 2)\n    for m in range(K + 1):\n        dp_prev[m] = f[m]\n    \n    for i in range(2, N + 1):\n        dp_current = [0] * (K + 2)\n        pre_sum = [0] * (K + 2)\n        for m in range(K + 1):\n            if m == 0:\n                pre_sum[m] = dp_prev[m]\n            else:\n                pre_sum[m] = (pre_sum[m - 1] + dp_prev[m]) % MOD\n            if m > 0:\n                sum_before = pre_sum[m - 1]\n                dp_current[m] = (sum_before * f[m]) % MOD\n        dp_prev = dp_current\n    \n    total = sum(dp_prev) % MOD\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start by computing the number of sets with each possible maximum value. This is done using the formula `f(m) = 2^(m-1)` for `m >= 1` and `f(0) = 1` for the empty set.\n- **Dynamic Programming Transition**: For each position `i` and each possible maximum value `m`, we compute the number of valid sequences ending with `m` using the prefix sums of the previous state.\n- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: This helps in efficiently summing up all valid previous states for each transition, ensuring the solution remains efficient even for large values of `N` and `K`.\n- **Result Calculation**: After processing all positions, the result is the sum of all valid sequences of length `N`, taken modulo `998244353`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all valid arrays of sets while adhering to the problem constraints.",
