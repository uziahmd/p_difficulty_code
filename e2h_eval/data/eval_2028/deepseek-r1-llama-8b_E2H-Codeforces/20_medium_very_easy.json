For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about finding the number of ways to choose c_s for each binary string s such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nWait, let me read the problem statement again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nWe are given n, k, and f. We consider all binary strings of length from 1 to n. For each string s, we choose a c_s between 0 and k. A multiset is beautiful if, for every string s (from length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix doesn't exceed c_s. Our goal is to find the number of ways to choose these c_s such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nOh right, and the answer needs to be modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm, okay. So the task is to count the number of assignments of c_s's that allow the largest beautiful multiset to have size exactly f.\n\nI think the key here is to model this as a problem where we need to assign c_s's in such a way that when we compute the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset, it's exactly f.\n\nLet me think about how the maximum size is determined. The maximum size is achieved by including as many strings as possible without violating any c_s constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum size can be thought of as the sum over all strings s of their 'allowed' counts, which depends on the c_s and their prefixes.\n\nWait, no. Because for a string s, the number of times it appears in the multiset (including longer strings that start with s) must not exceed c_s.\n\nSo, for each string t that is a superstring of s, the count of t in the multiset contributes to the constraint on s.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible size of the multiset is determined by ensuring that for every s, the sum of the counts of all its supersets (including itself) is <= c_s.\n\nBut wait, the multiset consists of strings of exactly length n. Oh, wait no. Wait, the problem says that the multiset is of binary strings of length exactly n. So all the strings in the multiset are length n, but when considering their prefixes, those prefixes could be of any length up to n.\n\nSo, for each s (of any length from 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is the sum of the counts of all t in the multiset where t starts with s.\n\nWait, but the multiset is of length exactly n. So for example, if s is \"00\", then any string in the multiset that starts with \"00\" would be either \"00\" or \"000...0\" with length n, but since the multiset is of length exactly n, that's only \"00\" if n=2, or \"00...0\" of length n otherwise.\n\nWait, no. Because the multiset consists of strings of exactly length n. So for any s of length m (m <=n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the number of strings t in the multiset where t starts with s and |t|=n.\n\nAh, right. So for example, s could be \"01\", and t is \"01xx...\" up to length n. So the count for s is the number of t's in the multiset that start with s.\n\nSo the condition is that for every s, the number of t in the multiset that start with s is <= c_s.\n\nNow, the maximum possible size of such a multiset is determined by choosing the counts for each t (the number of times t appears in the multiset) such that for every s, the sum of the counts of t's that start with s is <= c_s.\n\nAnd our goal is to count the number of assignments of c_s's where the maximum possible size is exactly f.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible size is the maximum possible sum of counts over all t of length n, subject to the constraints that for each s, the sum of counts for t's that are extensions of s is <= c_s.\n\nSo for each assignment of c_s's, the maximum possible size is the maximum sum of counts of t's (each t has some non-negative integer count, but the sum is maximized under the constraints).\n\nBut the problem is to count the number of c assignments such that this maximum is exactly f.\n\nHmm, this seems complex. Let's try to model this.\n\nPerhaps we can model this as a tree structure, where each node represents a string s, and its children are the strings formed by adding a bit (0 or 1) to the end.\n\nThe constraints form a hierarchy: for a parent s, the sum of the counts of its children plus the count of s itself must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, yes. Because the sum for s is the number of t's that have s as a prefix. That includes s itself and all its descendants in the binary tree.\n\nSo the problem reduces to assigning for each node s a capacity c_s, and then computing the maximum flow possible through this tree, which is constrained by the c_s's.\n\nBut wait, the maximum size is the sum of all counts of leaves in the tree (since the multiset consists of strings of exactly length n, which are leaves in this binary tree). Each leaf corresponds to a string of length n.\n\nWait, no. Because for a binary tree of height n, each node at depth d corresponds to a string of length d. The leaves are the nodes at depth n. So each t in the multiset is a leaf.\n\nSo the count for a node s is the number of times its corresponding string is present in the multiset. Then, the sum of counts for all leaves is the size of the multiset.\n\nThe constraints are that for each node s, the sum of counts of all its descendants (including itself) must be <= c_s.\n\nSo the maximum possible size is the sum of the counts of the leaves, subject to these constraints.\n\nOur goal is to find the number of c assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this as a system of inequalities and find the number of c assignments that lead to the maximum being f.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this using dynamic programming, considering the constraints in a hierarchical manner.\n\nLet me think about the structure. Since the binary tree is a perfect binary tree of height n (each level has 2^d nodes at depth d), perhaps we can process the nodes in order from the root down to the leaves.\n\nWait, but the root is the empty string, but in our problem, the strings considered are of lengths from 1 to n. So the root isn't part of the problem. Instead, the root's children are the two single-character strings (\"0\" and \"1\").\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to model the constraints starting from the deepest levels (length n) upwards.\n\nBecause, for a string s of length m, the constraints depend on the sum of counts of its children (which are of length m+1) plus its own count.\n\nWait, but the leaves are the strings of length n. So for each node s of length m <n, its children are two nodes of length m+1. But for m =n-1, their children are leaves (strings of length n).\n\nSo perhaps we can model the constraints in a bottom-up manner, starting from the leaves and moving up.\n\nEach node s of length m will have two children (if m <n). The constraints for s are that the sum of counts for s and its children (and possibly deeper descendants) is <= c_s.\n\nWait, but for a node s of length m, its subtree consists of s itself and all its descendants. For the purposes of the constraints, the sum of counts for all nodes in the subtree of s (including s) must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, no. Because for each s, the sum is the number of t's that have s as a prefix. So for s, the sum is the count of s plus the counts of all its children, their children, etc., up to the leaves.\n\nSo the sum for s is the total number of t's in the multiset that have s as a prefix. So the constraint is that for each s, sum_{t in subtree of s} count(t) <= c_s.\n\nSo the maximum sum is the sum of the counts of the leaves. How do the constraints propagate?\n\nFor example, for a node s of length m, its two children are s0 and s1. The sum for s is count(s) + count(s0) + count(s1) + ... (all descendants). But wait, the sum for s is the same as the sum for the root of s's subtree.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a directed acyclic graph where each node's sum is bounded by its own c_s, and the sum of its children.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible size is determined by the minimum possible sum along the path from the root to the leaves, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given c assignment, the maximum possible size is the sum of the counts of the leaves, which is constrained by the c's of all the ancestors.\n\nSo to find the maximum size, we can think of it as the sum of all the counts of the leaves, which is the sum of the counts of all the nodes in the multiset. Each node's count is limited by the c of its ancestors.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps there's a way to model it using inclusion-exclusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size can be found by considering that for each node s, the sum of counts of its subtree is at most c_s. So the maximum possible size is the sum of all leaves, which is the sum of their counts, and each of their ancestors imposes a constraint.\n\nHmm, but how does that translate into an equation? Maybe the maximum size is the minimum, along the path from each leaf to the root, of certain values related to the c's.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum size is the sum of the counts of the leaves, but each of these counts is constrained by all the c's of their ancestors.\n\nWait, for a leaf t of length n, its contribution to the sum is the count of t. Now, for each ancestor s of t, the sum of the counts of t and all its descendants (but t is a leaf, so only itself) must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum for s is the sum of counts of all t's in its subtree, which includes s itself and all its descendants (which are leaves in this case for s of length n-1).\n\nSo for s of length m, the sum is count(s) + count(s0) + count(s1) + ... which must be <= c_s.\n\nBut for s of length n, it's just count(s), since it has no children.\n\nSo, for the leaves (strings of length n), their count is added to the sum for their parent s of length n-1, and so on up to the root.\n\nWait, but the root is the empty string, which is not considered because our strings start from length 1.\n\nSo, for each node s, the sum of counts in its subtree is <= c_s. Therefore, the maximum possible size is the sum of the counts of all leaves, which are the t's of length n.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to assigning c_s for each s (strings of length 1 to n), such that for each s, the sum of counts of all t in the subtree rooted at s is <= c_s.\n\nThe goal is to count the number of c assignments where the sum of counts of leaves is exactly f.\n\nHmm. So the maximum size is the sum of counts of the leaves, which is also the sum of counts of all t's of length n.\n\nEach c_s constrains the sum of the subtree rooted at s. So for s of length m, the sum of counts of all t's in the subtree of s (which includes s and all its descendants) must be <= c_s.\n\nBut wait, for s of length m, the sum is count(s) plus the sum of counts of s's children, their children, etc., down to the leaves.\n\nSo, for each s, sum_{t in subtree of s} count(t) <= c_s.\n\nNow, the maximum possible sum of the leaves is the sum of all count(t) for t in leaves.\n\nBut how does this relate to the c_s's?\n\nIt seems that for each node s, the sum of the counts of its subtree must be <= c_s. Therefore, the maximum sum of the leaves is constrained by all the c_s's along the path from the leaves to the root.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the minimum of certain products. Or maybe it's a matter of considering all the c_s's along the path and finding some relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is the minimum of c_s along the path from the root to each leaf.\n\nWait, let's think about a simple case. Suppose n=1. Then, the multiset can only contain \"0\" and \"1\".\n\nEach of their c's is the count allowed for them. The maximum size is min(c_0, c_1) + min(c_0, c_1)?\n\nWait, no. Because for each string s, the sum of the counts of all t that have s as a prefix.\n\nIn the case of n=1, for s=\"0\", the sum is count(\"0\"). For s=\"1\", the sum is count(\"1\"). So the constraints are:\n\ncount(\"0\") <= c_0\n\ncount(\"1\") <= c_1\n\nThe maximum sum is count(\"0\") + count(\"1\"), which is the sum of the c's if both are >= their respective counts.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum is count(\"0\") + count(\"1\") and the constraints are count(\"0\") <= c_0 and count(\"1\") <= c_1.\n\nSo the maximum sum is min(c_0, c_1 + count(\"1\"))? No, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. Because count(\"0\") can be any value up to c_0, and count(\"1\") up to c_1. So the maximum possible sum is c_0 + c_1, provided that c_0 and c_1 are large enough.\n\nWait, yes. Because you can set count(\"0\")=c_0 and count(\"1\")=c_1, as long as c_0 and c_1 are each at least their respective counts.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the maximum possible sum. So for n=1, the maximum sum is c_0 + c_1, but that's only if both are chosen as their maximum possible.\n\nWait, no. Because the multiset can have any number of \"0\" and \"1\" as long as the count of \"0\" is <= c_0 and the count of \"1\" is <= c_1.\n\nSo the maximum sum is min(c_0, ...) + min(c_1, ...). Wait, no. It's simply c_0 + c_1, but wait, no. Because if c_0 is 3 and c_1 is 2, then the maximum sum is 3 + 2 =5.\n\nWait, no. Because you can choose count(\"0\")=3 and count(\"1\")=2, giving a total of 5. So the maximum sum is c_0 + c_1.\n\nWait, but that's only if the sum is allowed. So for n=1, the maximum sum is c_0 + c_1.\n\nWait, but wait, the sum of counts is the sum of the two leaves, and each is constrained by their c_s. So the maximum sum is indeed the sum of the c_s's, provided that each c_s is >= the count assigned.\n\nWait, but that's only if the counts are allowed. So for n=1, the maximum sum is c_0 + c_1.\n\nSo for the general case, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of the c_s's for all s in the multiset.\n\nBut wait, that can't be. Because for higher n, the constraints may limit the sum more than the sum of c_s's.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because for each node s, the sum of its subtree is <= c_s. So for the root (empty string), the sum of all t's is the sum of all leaves, which is <= c_root.\n\nBut the root's c_root is not part of our c assignments because the problem states that s is from length 1 to n.\n\nWait, the problem defines c_s for each s of length 1 to n. So the root is not considered, but the constraints for all the other nodes include their subtrees.\n\nWait, this complicates things. So, for the root's subtree, which is all the strings, the sum of the counts is the sum of all the leaves, which is the size of the multiset. But the root's c_root is not part of the c assignments because s starts from length 1.\n\nSo the root's c_root is not part of the input. So for the root, the sum of all leaves is not constrained by any c_s because the root's c isn't considered. Wait, that can't be right because the root's subtree includes all nodes, and the sum is the size of the multiset. So the sum is the size of the multiset, but the root's c_root is not part of the c assignments. So perhaps the root's c_root is considered as infinity, allowing any sum.\n\nBut that's not the case because the root's c is not part of the c_s's we're choosing. So the root's subtree sum is not constrained by any c_s.\n\nWait, that's a problem because the root's subtree sum is the size of the multiset, but the root's c is not in our c_s's. So the sum is unconstrained, but that can't be because the root's subtree is all the strings, and the sum must be <= c_root, but since c_root is not part of our choices, the sum can be as large as possible.\n\nWait, no. Because the root's c is not part of the c_s's. So the root's subtree sum is unconstrained, which means the size of the multiset can be as large as possible. But that's impossible because the multiset is of size exactly f.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that the multiset is considered beautiful if for every binary string s of length from 1 to n, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is not exceeding c_s.\n\nWait, so for the root (empty string), it's not considered as s because it's of length 0. So the root's subtree sum is the size of the multiset, but it's not constrained by any c_s. So the size of the multiset can be as large as possible, but that's not possible because the problem wants the maximum size to be exactly f.\n\nWait, this suggests that the root's subtree sum (the size of the multiset) is not constrained by any c_s, meaning that the size can be as large as possible, regardless of the c_s's. But that contradicts the problem statement, so I must be misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem's definition of the root is different. Maybe the root is the empty string, which is the prefix of all strings. So for the empty string s (root), the number of t's in the multiset that have s as a prefix is the entire multiset. But the problem says that the multiset is beautiful if for every s of length from 1 to n, the number of t's that have s as a prefix is <= c_s. So the empty string s is not considered because it's of length 0. So the sum of the multiset is not constrained by any c_s, implying that the maximum possible size is unbounded. But that's impossible because the problem requires the maximum size to be exactly f.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me read the note again.\n\nIn the example given, the c_s's are defined for all binary strings of length 1 to 2. So for each s of length 1 or 2, c_s is assigned. The multiset is of length exactly 2, and the constraints are that for each s, the count of t's that have s as a prefix is <= c_s.\n\nWait, the root is the empty string, but since it's not considered, the sum of the multiset is not constrained by any c_s. So the sum can be as large as possible, but that's not possible because the problem requires the maximum size to be exactly f.\n\nSo perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, and the root is considered in the constraints. Wait, but according to the problem statement, s ranges from 1 to n. So the root is not included.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me try to re-express the problem.\n\nThe problem is to choose c_s for all s of length 1 to n, and then compute the maximum possible size of a multiset of binary strings of length exactly n. The multiset is beautiful if for every s of length 1 to n, the number of t's in the multiset that have s as a prefix is <= c_s.\n\nSo the maximum size is the maximum possible sum of counts of t's (each t is a string of length n) such that for each s (length 1 to n), the sum of counts of t's that have s as a prefix is <= c_s.\n\nThe question is to count the number of c assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nSo the maximum size is the sum of the counts of the t's (each is a string of length n), and for each s, the sum of counts of t's that have s as a prefix is <= c_s.\n\nSo the maximum size is determined by the constraints imposed by the c_s's.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the number of c assignments where the maximum possible sum is exactly f.\n\nNow, the key is to model this in a way that allows us to compute the number of valid c assignments.\n\nI think this can be approached using inclusion-exclusion and combinatorics, but it's unclear how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a product of possibilities for each node, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: For each node s, the sum of the counts in its subtree (including s) must be <= c_s.\n\nThe maximum possible sum is the sum of the counts of the leaves, which is the sum of all t's in the multiset.\n\nSo for each s, sum_{t in subtree of s} count(t) <= c_s.\n\nWe can model this as a system where each node's sum is constrained by its c_s.\n\nThe maximum sum is the sum of the leaves, which is the sum of all t's.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to determining the number of c assignments such that the maximum sum is exactly f.\n\nHmm. Now, to model this, perhaps we can think recursively. For each node, the sum of its subtree is the sum of its own count plus the sums of its children's subtrees. This sum must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, but the sum of a node's subtree is the sum of all t's in the subtree, which includes the node itself and all its descendants.\n\nSo for node s, sum_children(s) + count(s) <= c_s.\n\nBut count(s) is the number of times s appears in the multiset. Wait, no—count(s) is the count of s in the multiset. So the sum of the subtree of s is count(s) plus the sum of the subtrees of its children.\n\nBut for the leaves, their sum is just count(s), since they have no children.\n\nSo for the leaves, the sum is count(s) <= c_s.\n\nFor their parents, the sum is count(s_parent) + count(s_parent's children) + ... <= c_s_parent.\n\nWait, but the leaves' sum is count(s_leaf) <= c_leaf, and for their parent, it's count(s_parent) + count(s_leaf) <= c_parent.\n\nSo, the maximum sum is the sum of the counts of all leaves. To find the maximum sum, we need to maximize the sum of the leaves, subject to these constraints.\n\nSo, the problem is to assign c_s's such that for each node s, the sum of counts in its subtree is <= c_s, and the sum of the leaves is exactly f.\n\nNow, how can we model this as a mathematical problem?\n\nPerhaps it's helpful to model the problem as a tree, where each node has two children (for 0 and 1), and each node's sum is constrained by its c_s.\n\nThe maximum sum is the sum of the leaves, which is the sum of their counts. Each count is constrained by their parent's c_s.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum can be represented as the product of certain terms. Or maybe each node contributes a factor based on how much it can contribute to the sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a system where the maximum sum is determined by the minimal c_s along each path from the leaves to the root.\n\nWait, for a path from a leaf to the root, each node on the path has a c_s. The maximum sum is constrained by the minimal c_s along this path.\n\nWait, no. Because for each node, the sum of its subtree is constrained by its c_s. So the sum of the leaves is the sum of the counts of the leaves, which is the sum of all their counts. But each leaf's count is constrained by its parent's c_s, which is the sum of the parent's count plus the leaf's count.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should try to model it with a small example.\n\nTake n=2. The strings are \"0\", \"1\", \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\". But the multiset consists of strings of length 2. So the leaves are \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\".\n\nEach of these leaves has a count, say x1, x2, x3, x4.\n\nThe constraints are:\n\nFor \"00\": x3 <= c[\"00\"]\n\nFor \"01\": x4 <= c[\"01\"]\n\nFor \"10\": x2 <= c[\"10\"]\n\nFor \"11\": x4 <= c[\"11\"]\n\nWait, no. Wait, for s=\"00\", the sum of counts of its subtree is x3 (count of \"00\") plus any counts of its children, but \"00\" has no children (since it's a leaf). So x3 <= c[\"00\"].\n\nSimilarly, for s=\"01\", x4 <= c[\"01\"].\n\nFor s=\"0\", which is not a leaf, the sum is x3 + x4 (counts of \"00\" and \"01\") <= c[\"0\"].\n\nFor s=\"1\", sum is x2 + x4 <= c[\"1\"].\n\nFor s=\"00\", sum is x3 <= c[\"00\"].\n\nFor s=\"01\", sum is x4 <= c[\"01\"].\n\nFor s=\"10\", sum is x2 <= c[\"10\"].\n\nFor s=\"11\", sum is x4 <= c[\"11\"].\n\nWait, but wait: s can be any string of length 1 or 2. So for s=\"0\", which is a string of length 1, the sum is the number of t's in the multiset that have \"0\" as a prefix. Those t's are \"00\", \"01\", \"0\", \"000...\", but in our case, the multiset contains only length 2 strings. So the t's are \"00\" and \"01\", which are the length 2 strings starting with \"0\". So for s=\"0\", the sum is x3 + x4.\n\nSimilarly, for s=\"1\", the sum is x2 + x4.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nx3 <= c[\"00\"]\n\nx4 <= c[\"01\"]\n\nx3 + x4 <= c[\"0\"]\n\nx2 <= c[\"10\"]\n\nx4 <= c[\"11\"]\n\nx2 + x4 <= c[\"1\"]\n\nAdditionally, the sum of all leaves is x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = f.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the leaves are \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\". So their counts are x3, x4, x2, x4. Wait, no: wait, in n=2, the leaves are four strings: \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\". So their counts are x3, x4, x2, x4? No, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index the counts differently. Let me denote:\n\ncount(\"00\") = a\n\ncount(\"01\") = b\n\ncount(\"10\") = c\n\ncount(\"11\") = d\n\nThen, the sum of the leaves is a + b + c + d = f.\n\nThe constraints are:\n\na <= c[\"00\"]\n\nb <= c[\"01\"]\n\na + b <= c[\"0\"]\n\nc <= c[\"10\"]\n\nd <= c[\"11\"]\n\na + b + c + d <= c[\"0\"] + c[\"1\"] ?\n\nWait, no. Because for s=\"0\", the sum is a + b (since \"00\" and \"01\" are the only t's of length 2 starting with \"0\"). For s=\"1\", the sum is c + d.\n\nBut the constraints for s=\"0\" and s=\"1\" are a + b <= c[\"0\"] and c + d <= c[\"1\"].\n\nAlso, the constraints for s=\"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\" are a <= c[\"00\"], b <= c[\"01\"], c <= c[\"10\"], d <= c[\"11\"].\n\nSo the maximum possible sum is a + b + c + d, subject to:\n\na <= C[\"00\"]\n\nb <= C[\"01\"]\n\nc <= C[\"10\"]\n\nd <= C[\"11\"]\n\na + b <= C[\"0\"]\n\nc + d <= C[\"1\"]\n\nSo, the problem is to count the number of assignments to C[\"0\"], C[\"00\"], C[\"01\"], C[\"10\"], C[\"11\"] such that the maximum a + b + c + d under these constraints is exactly f.\n\nHmm, so for this n=2 case, the constraints are a bit more manageable. But for larger n, the tree becomes deeper, and the constraints become more complex.\n\nBut for n up to 15, it's manageable with dynamic programming, but perhaps the solution involves some clever combinatorial approach.\n\nAnother thought: For each node s, the sum of its subtree is constrained by c_s. So the maximum possible sum is the minimum over all paths from the root to the leaves of certain functions of the c's along the path.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is the product of certain terms, but that's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of all c_s's for s in the multiset. But no, that's not the case because the constraints are hierarchical.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the minimum of the sum of c_s's for certain subsets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is determined by the sum of the c_s's for the nodes along a particular path. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: For each string s, the sum of counts in its subtree is the sum of counts of s plus the sum of the subtrees of its children. This sum must be <= c_s.\n\nSo, for a leaf s, sum_subtree(s) = count(s) <= c_s.\n\nFor its parent p, sum_subtree(p) = count(p) + sum_subtree(child1) + sum_subtree(child2) <= c_p.\n\nBut this is recursive.\n\nHmm. So for the entire tree, the sum of the leaves is the sum of all count(s) for s in leaves.\n\nThe maximum sum is the sum of the leaves, which is constrained by all the c_s's along their paths to the root.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of the c_s's for all the leaves, but that can't be right because the c_s's of their ancestors also impose constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of the c_s's for the leaves, but each c_s can be as high as possible. But that's not necessarily the case because the ancestors impose higher constraints.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of the problem in terms of flows.\n\nEach node s has a capacity c_s, and the sum of the subtree is the flow through it. The maximum flow through the root (sum of leaves) is the maximum possible sum, which is constrained by all c_s's along the paths.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of the leaves, which is the sum of their counts. Each count is constrained by their parent's c_s, which in turn is constrained by their grandparent's c_s, etc., up to the root.\n\nBut the root's c is not part of the c_s's, so the sum is not directly constrained by the root.\n\nWait, but the root's subtree is the entire tree, and the sum is the size of the multiset. Since the root's c is not part of the c_s's, the sum can be as large as possible, but that's not possible because the problem requires the maximum size to be exactly f.\n\nThis suggests that the root's subtree sum is not constrained by any c_s, so the maximum sum is not bounded by anything except the constraints of the c_s's along the paths from the leaves to the root.\n\nWait, but the sum of the leaves is the sum of all the t's, which is the sum of all the counts of the leaves. Each of these counts is constrained by their ancestors.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum sum is the minimum of the sum of the c_s's along all possible paths from the leaves to the root.\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the problem using the concept of prefix sums.\n\nFor each node s, the sum of its subtree is the sum of all counts of its descendants plus its own count. This sum must be <= c_s.\n\nThe maximum sum is the sum of the leaves, which is constrained by all the c_s's along their paths to the root.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother angle: The maximum sum is the sum of all the leaves' counts. Each leaf's count is constrained by the sum of the c_s's along the path from the leaf to the root.\n\nWait, perhaps for each leaf t, the count(t) can be as high as c_t, but also, for each ancestor s of t, the sum of counts in s's subtree is <= c_s. So the count(t) can't exceed c_t, but also, for each ancestor s, the sum of t's count plus the sum of the counts of its siblings in s's subtree must be <= c_s.\n\nThis seems like a system of inequalities, but solving it directly seems difficult.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the maximum sum is the sum of the c_s's for the leaves, but this isn't necessarily true because the c_s's of their ancestors can limit the sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of the c_s's for all nodes s, but that doesn't align with the earlier example.\n\nIn the first sample input, n=1, k=42, f=2.\n\nThe three ways correspond to c_0=0, c_1=2; c_0=1, c_1=1; c_0=2, c_1=0.\n\nWait, for c_0=0, c_1=2, the maximum sum is 0 + 2 =2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nIn this case, the sum is indeed the sum of c_0 and c_1.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of the c_s's for all s in the multiset.\n\nWait, but in the case of n=2, the sum is a + b + c + d, but the constraints include a + b <= c_0, c + d <= c_1, etc.\n\nSo the maximum sum can't exceed c_0 + c_1, but it's possible that a + b + c + d is less than c_0 + c_1.\n\nWait, but in that case, the maximum sum is the minimum of c_0 + c_1 and the sum of the c_s's of the leaves.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of the c_s's for all s in the multiset, but each c_s can be as high as k.\n\nBut in the first sample, the sum is indeed the sum of c_0 and c_1.\n\nSo perhaps, for each s in the multiset, the maximum sum is the sum of the c_s's for all s in the multiset.\n\nIf that's the case, then the problem reduces to counting the number of assignments of c_s's such that the sum of c_s's is exactly f, and for each s, c_s <=k.\n\nWait, but that can't be the case because in the n=2 example, the sum of c_s's is c_00 + c_01 + c_10 + c_11, but the constraints are a + b <= c_0, c + d <= c_1, a <= c_00, b <= c_01, c <= c_10, d <= c_11.\n\nSo the maximum sum is a + b + c + d, which is constrained by c_0 + c_1.\n\nBut if the sum of the c_s's is c_00 + c_01 + c_10 + c_11, then the maximum sum could be as high as that sum, but it's also constrained by c_0 + c_1.\n\nSo in that case, the maximum sum is the minimum between c_0 + c_1 and c_00 + c_01 + c_10 + c_11.\n\nWait, that's an interesting thought. So for the n=2 case, the maximum sum is the minimum of (c_0 + c_1) and (c_00 + c_01 + c_10 + c_11).\n\nBut how does that fit into the overall problem?\n\nWait, perhaps for each node s,",
