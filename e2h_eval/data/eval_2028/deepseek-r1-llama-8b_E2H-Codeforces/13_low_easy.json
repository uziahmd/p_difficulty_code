For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem defines a major triad as having two intervals: 4 semitones and 3 semitones when the notes are ordered in a specific way. The minor triad is similar but with the intervals reversed—3 semitones first, then 4. Also, the order of the notes matters because we can arrange them in any order to find if either condition holds.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. **Understand the note order**: The notes are cyclically ordered as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So each note has a position in this list, which can be used to calculate the distances between them.\n\n2. **Convert each note to its position index**: For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, and so on up to H being 11.\n\n3. **Generate all possible permutations of the three notes**: Since the triad can be arranged in any order, I need to check all possible orderings of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\n4. **Check for major and minor conditions**: For each permutation (X, Y, Z), calculate the distances between X-Y and Y-Z. If the distances are 4 and 3 (in that order) for a major triad, or 3 and 4 for a minor, then it's classified accordingly.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says that the triad is unordered, so the same set of notes might form both a major and minor triad? No, the problem states that the answer will always be unambiguous, so no such cases exist.\n\nSo, for each possible ordering of the three notes, I'll compute the semitone distances between consecutive notes in that order. Then, I'll see if any permutation leads to the major or minor condition.\n\nBut considering all possible permutations might be computationally feasible since there are only 6 permutations for three elements. So that's manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\n- **Note to index mapping**: Create a dictionary to map each note name to its index. Like {'C':0, 'C#':1, ... , 'H':11}.\n\n- **Input processing**: Read the input line, split into three note strings.\n\n- **Generate all permutations**: Use itertools.permutations to get all possible orderings of the three notes.\n\n- **For each permutation, check major/minor**:\n   - Compute the indexes of X, Y, Z.\n   - Calculate distance from X to Y: (Y_index - X_index) mod 12.\n     Wait, but the problem says the distance is measured from lower to higher, which is (Y_index - X_index) * 1 semitone. But since the scale is cyclic, perhaps the actual distance is the minimal way, but according to the problem statement, the distance is taken from the lowest to the highest. Hmm, wait no: the problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppermost one.\" So, for example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones (C to C# is 1, C# to D is another, etc., up to E which is 4 semitones away). But if the distance is from E to C, it's 8 semitones. So, the distance is calculated as (y - x) mod 12, but only in the direction where y is after x.\n\nWait, no. Because the distance is always from lower to higher. So, for two notes, the distance is the number of semitones from the lower one to the higher one, considering the cyclic nature. So, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) % 12 if Y >= X, else (Y + 12 - X) % 12? Or more accurately, the distance is (Y - X) mod 12, but since the scale is cyclic, it's correct to just compute (Y - X) % 12.\n\nWait, for example, the distance between C (0) and E (4) is 4 semitones. Between E and C: if you go from E to C, that's a larger loop around the scale, which would be (0 -4 +12) mod 12 = 8 semitones. So yes, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12. Because when Y is after X, it's positive, otherwise wraps around.\n\nSo, for a permutation (X, Y, Z), the distances are:\n\ndXY = (Y - X) % 12\n\ndYZ = (Z - Y)",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of the notes to see if they fit the criteria for either a major or minor triad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note to Index Mapping**: Convert each note into its corresponding index in the musical scale. This helps in calculating the distances between notes.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: Since the order of notes matters for determining the intervals, generate all possible permutations of the three notes.\n3. **Check Triad Conditions**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes and check if they fit the intervals required for a major or minor triad.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Create a mapping from note names to their indices\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\n# Read input\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\n# Generate all possible permutations of the three notes\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(input_notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    \n    # Get their indices\n    idx_x = note_to_index[x]\n    idx_y = note_to_index[y]\n    idx_z = note_to_index[z]\n    \n    # Calculate distances\n    d_xy = (idx_y - idx_x) % 12\n    d_yz = (idx_z - idx_y) % 12\n    \n    # Check for major triad condition (4,3)\n    if d_xy == 4 and d_yz == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        break\n    # Check for minor triad condition (3,4)\n    elif d_xy == 3 and d_yz == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        break\nelse:\n    # If none found, it's strange\n    print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note to Index Mapping**: Each note is mapped to an index based on its position in the musical scale. This allows us to calculate the distances between notes numerically.\n2. **Permutations Generation**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible orderings of the three notes to ensure we check every potential arrangement.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, we compute the distances between consecutive notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n4. **Condition Checking**: We check if the computed distances match the intervals required for a major or minor triad. If neither condition is met, the result is classified as \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and accurately determine the type of triad, if any, by exhaustively checking all possible note arrangements.",
