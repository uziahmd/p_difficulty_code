The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the frog starts at position 0 on the number line. It can jump either a or -b each time. We need to find f(x), which is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach without going outside [0, x]. Then, sum all f(i) from i=0 to m.\n\nHmm, first, I think I should understand what f(x) represents. For each x, f(x) counts all the positions the frog can reach without stepping beyond x. So for each x, we're looking for the size of the set of reachable positions within [0, x].\n\nWait, but how does the frog move? Each jump is either +a or -b. So it's like moving in steps of a and b, but sometimes subtracting b could take it backward. But since the frog can't go below 0, that might affect the possible positions.\n\nI remember something about BFS here. Like, for each x, perform BFS starting from 0, adding a and subtracting b each step, but not going below 0. But doing this for every x up to m would be too slow, especially since m can be up to 1e9.\n\nSo, we need a smarter way. Maybe find a pattern or mathematical formula for f(x).\n\nLet me think about the possible reachable positions. The frog's position after some jumps can be written as 0 + k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. But this must be ≥0. So, any position s such that s = ka - lb, s ≥0, and s ≤x.\n\nWait, but when a and b are coprime, maybe there's a certain periodicity or maximum reachable position. Oh right, because if a and b are coprime, then using the Chicken McNugget theorem, the largest number that can't be expressed as ka - lb is (a-1)(b-1) -1. Wait, no, that's for the non-negative combinations. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps to reach certain points can be determined. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's consider the case when a and b are such that a > b. Or when they are equal, etc. Also, when a + b is larger than x, perhaps the frog can't make many jumps.\n\nBut thinking differently, maybe for each x, the reachable positions form some kind of interval. Like, once x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions from 0 up to some maximum, but before that, certain gaps exist.\n\nWait, let's think about the maximum reachable position. For a given x, the maximum position the frog can reach is the largest s such that s = k*a - l*b, s ≥0, and s ≤x.\n\nBut how do we compute this s for each x?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(x) can be broken down into two parts: the initial range where the frog can't reach all positions, and the later range where it can. Once x is beyond a certain point, all positions from 0 to some maximum M are reachable.\n\nSo, for x less than M, f(x) increases as x increases, but once x is >= M, f(x) becomes M+1 (since all positions up to M are covered). Or wait, maybe M is the maximum reachable position, so f(M) would be M+1, assuming all positions up to M are reachable.\n\nWait, let's think about an example. Like the sample input where a=5, b=3, m=7.\n\nThe output says f(7) is 8. So, the maximum reachable is 7, and all positions from 0 to 7 are reachable. Wait, but 0,5,8 would be reachable. Wait, but 8 is beyond 7, so it's not counted. So, the frog can reach 0,5,2 (from 5-3), 7 (from 5+2*1?), but wait, how?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's re-calculate for the sample:\n\nIn the first sample, m=7, a=5, b=3.\n\nf(0)=1 (only 0)\nf(1)=1 (can't jump)\nf(2)=1\n...\nf(4)=1\nf(5)=3: positions 0,5,2 (0+5, 0-3 is invalid, but wait, maybe from 5 you can jump back? Or wait, the frog starts at 0, can jump to 5, then from 5 can jump back to 2, then from 2 can jump back to -1, which is invalid, so no. Wait, perhaps the reachable positions are 0,5,2, etc., but without going below 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the reachable positions are all numbers that can be expressed as ka - lb, with k and l non-negative integers, and the result is >=0.\n\nSo for a=5, b=3:\n\nPossible steps:\n\n0 → 5 → 5-3=2 → 2+5=7 → 7-3=4 → 4+5=9 (but 9>7, so for x=7, 9 isn't counted. So for x=7, the reachable positions are 0,5,2,7,4.\n\nWait, 0,5,2,7,4. That's 5 positions. But the sample says f(7) is 8. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sample. Let me recheck:\n\nSample Input: 7 5 3.\n\nSample Output: 19.\n\nExplanation: f(0)=1, f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=1, f(4)=1, f(5)=3, f(6)=3, f(7)=8.\n\nWait, for x=5, f(x)=3. So, the reachable positions are 0,5,2. How?\n\nWait, 0: yes.\n\nFrom 0, can jump +5 to 5.\n\nFrom 5, can jump -3 to 2.\n\nFrom 2, can jump +5 to 7, but 7 is >5, so for x=5, 7 isn't considered. So for x=5, the frog can reach 0,5,2. So f(5) is 3.\n\nSimilarly, for x=6, the same applies, so f(6)=3.\n\nFor x=7, the frog can now reach 0,5,2,7,4 (from 7-3=4). From 4, can it jump further? 4+5=9>7, but 4-3=1, which is allowed. So from 4, we can reach 1. Then from 1, can't jump further because 1+5=6 ≤7, and 1-3=-2 invalid. So 1 can lead to 6, but 6 is within x=7.\n\nWait, so the positions are 0,5,2,7,4,1,6. That's 7 positions. But the sample says f(7) is 8. Hmm, maybe I'm missing one.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let's list all possible positions for x=7:\n\nWe can have 0,5,2,7,4,1,6, and possibly 3?\n\nWait, how to get 3.\n\nWait, 5-3=2, 2+5=7, 7-3=4, 4-3=1, 1+5=6, 6-3=3. Ah! So 3 is reachable via 6-3.\n\nSo the positions are 0,5,2,7,4,1,6,3. That's 8 positions, which matches the sample.\n\nSo, for x=7, the frog can reach 8 positions. So the problem is to find for each x, the count of such positions.\n\nBut computing this for each x up to 1e9 is impossible. So we need a way to model f(x) as a function that can be computed efficiently, perhaps by finding ranges where f(x) is constant, and then compute the sum over those ranges.\n\nHmm, so the key idea is to find for which x values f(x) changes, and then calculate the sum accordingly.\n\nSo, perhaps f(x) increases until it reaches a certain maximum M, beyond which f(x) remains M+1 for all x >= M.\n\nWait, but how to determine M?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum reachable position is when the frog can't reach any higher positions without exceeding x.\n\nWait, perhaps M is the minimal x where the frog can reach x, and all positions up to M are reachable. So, for x >= M, f(x) = M+1.\n\nBut how to find M?\n\nAnother approach: For each x, the reachable positions are all numbers that can be written as s = k*a - l*b, s >=0, s <=x.\n\nSo, for x < M, f(x) is the number of such s's, and for x >= M, f(x) is M+1.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding M, then summing up f(x) for x from 0 to M, and then for x from M+1 to m, add (M+1) per x.\n\nWait, but what is M? It's the maximum s that can be reached, given x >= s.\n\nWait, perhaps M is the maximal s such that s can be expressed as ka - lb, and s >=0. So, M is the Frobenius number for a and b, but modified since we can have negative coefficients in the linear combination.\n\nWait, no, because in our case, the coefficients k and l are non-negative. So, it's the maximal s where s = ka - lb >=0.\n\nThe maximum s is unbounded unless there's some constraint, but in our case, x is bounded.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum reachable s is (k_max * a) - (l_max * b), where k_max is as large as possible such that ka - lb >=0.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal step between reachable positions is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. Because any position that can be reached must differ by multiples of d = gcd(a, b).\n\nWait, right! Because a and b share a common divisor d. So, any reachable position s must satisfy s mod d = 0 mod d. Wait, no, because the frog can only make jumps of a and -b. So the difference between two reachable positions is a multiple of d = gcd(a, b). Therefore, all reachable positions are congruent to 0 mod d.\n\nWait, no. Because a and b are steps. So, the frog can only reach positions s where s is a multiple of d. Because each step is a multiple of d.\n\nYes, so for any x, the reachable positions s must satisfy s ≡ 0 mod d.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be simplified by scaling down a and b by d.\n\nLet me denote a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Now, a' and b' are coprime.\n\nThen, the problem becomes: the frog can reach positions s = k*(d a') - l*(d b') = d*(k a' - l b').\n\nSince a' and b' are coprime, the maximal reachable s is when k a' - l b' is as large as possible, but still non-negative.\n\nWait, but in the scaled-down problem, the reachable s is s' = k a' - l b', s' >=0.\n\nSo, the maximum s' is the largest integer such that s' can be expressed as k a' - l b', with k, l non-negative integers.\n\nHmm, but for a' and b' coprime, the maximum s' is not bounded, because you can keep increasing k and decreasing l as needed, leading to s' being unbounded. Wait, no, because l has to be non-negative. So, for example, if a' > b', then increasing k and keeping l as 0 gives s' = k a', which goes to infinity as k increases.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the frog can't make jumps that take it beyond x. So, for a given x, the maximum s is min(k_max a, x), where k_max is chosen such that k_max a - l b >=0, but s <=x.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the problem differently.\n\nLet me think about when the frog can reach all positions in [0, x]. Once x is large enough, perhaps all positions that are multiples of d are reachable, and their count is (x//d) +1.\n\nWait, because the frog can reach 0, d, 2d, ..., up to x, provided that x is a multiple of d. Otherwise, the count is floor(x/d)+1.\n\nWait, but that's only true if the frog can reach every multiple of d up to x. So, the question is: for x >= M, can the frog reach all multiples of d up to x?\n\nIf yes, then f(x) = (x//d) +1.\n\nBut when is that the case?\n\nWell, in the case where a and b are such that the frog can make steps that allow it to fill in all the gaps between the multiples of d.\n\nWait, perhaps when a and b are such that a' and b' are coprimes and a' >=1 and b' >=1.\n\nWait, maybe the condition is that a' + b' >= 2, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when a and b are coprimes, then the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x, as long as x >= some value.\n\nWait, let's take a simple example.\n\nSuppose a=3, b=2, d=1.\n\nSo a'=3, b'=2.\n\nThe frog can reach positions 0, 3, 5 (3+2), 3+2*2=7, etc.\n\nWait, but 1 isn't reachable. Because the frog can't make a step that gets it to 1.\n\nWait, but 1 is not a multiple of d=1, so according to earlier idea, it's reachable. Wait, no, 1 is a multiple of 1, but in this case, the frog can't reach it.\n\nHmm, so that suggests that the earlier idea is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the condition is that a' + b' > something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach all positions >= some s_min, but that's not necessarily true.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern.\n\nLet me think about the sample where a=5, b=3, d=1.\n\nSo, a' =5, b'=3.\n\nThe reachable positions are 0,5,2,7,4,1,6,3, etc.\n\nSo, for x=7, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 7 except perhaps none. But according to the sample, it can reach 8 positions, which includes all 0-7, except 8 is beyond x.\n\nWait, no, 0,5,2,7,4,1,6,3: that's 8 positions, covering all integers from 0 to 7.\n\nSo, for x=7, f(x)=8, which is (7//1)+1 =8. So yes, in this case, for x=7, f(x)=x+1.\n\nBut for x=6, the sample says f(6)=3.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit. So perhaps the condition is that x is greater than or equal to a certain threshold.\n\nWait, perhaps M is the minimal x where f(x) =x+1. So, for x >= M, f(x) =x+1.\n\nBut in the sample, M is 7, because for x=7, f(x)=8.\n\nBut for x=6, it's 3, which is much less than 6+1=7.\n\nSo, perhaps M is the minimal x where the frog can reach all positions up to x.\n\nWait, how to compute M.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Find all x where f(x) is equal to (x//d + 1). Then, for x >= M, f(x) = x//d +1.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample, d=1, and for x=7, f(x)=8=7+1.\n\nBut for x=6, f(x)=3 which is 6//1 +1=7, but 3 is less than 7.\n\nSo that approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps M is the minimal x such that the frog can reach x, and all positions up to x are reachable.\n\nWait, but how to find M.\n\nAnother thought: The maximum position the frog can reach is when it keeps jumping forward as much as possible. So, the maximum is the largest s where s =k*a, and s <=x.\n\nBut that's just for moving forward, but the frog can also move backward.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum s is the maximal s such that s =k*a - l*b, s >=0, s <=x.\n\nBut again, solving for s is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum s is (k_max)*a, where k_max is the maximum such that (k_max)*a <=x + l*b for some l.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach is to model f(x) as follows:\n\nFor each x, f(x) is the number of reachable positions s where 0 ≤s ≤x.\n\nEach reachable s is of the form ka - lb, s ≥0, s ≤x.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of integers s in [0, x] that can be expressed as ka - lb with k, l ≥0.\n\nSo, the sum over x from 0 to m is the sum of the count of such s for each x.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nPerhaps, instead of considering each x, we can find all the possible s and see for which x they are included in the sum.\n\nWait, for each s, find the minimal x such that s ≤x. Then, for all x >= s, s contributes 1 to f(x). So, the total contribution of s is the number of x's where x >= s.\n\nBut this is only if s is reachable.\n\nSo, the sum we need is the number of reachable s multiplied by (m - s + 1), but only for s ≤m.\n\nWait, that's a clever approach. So, for each reachable s, the number of times it contributes to the sum is the number of x in [s, m], which is (m -s +1). So, the total sum is the sum over all reachable s ≤m of (m -s +1).\n\nSo, our task reduces to finding all reachable s, count them, multiply each by (m -s +1), and sum.\n\nBut how to find all reachable s up to m.\n\nBut even that seems difficult, since s can be up to m, which is 1e9.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find the minimal and maximal s, and the pattern of reachable s.\n\nWait, but perhaps the reachable s's form a certain structure.\n\nLet me think about when a and b are coprime. So, a' =a/d, b' =b/d, and a' and b' are coprime.\n\nIn this case, the frog can reach any s that is a multiple of d, and satisfies s >=0 and s =k a' - l b'.\n\nBecause a' and b' are coprime, the equation s =k a' - l b' can generate all integers congruent to s mod (a' + b')? Or perhaps not. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the reachable s's form an arithmetic progression with a certain step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable s's are all the multiples of d that are >=0 and can be expressed as s =k a' - l b'.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, but in the case where a' and b' are coprime, the set of reachable s's is the set of all integers s such that s ≡0 mod d, and s >=0, and s can be expressed as k a' - l b'.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable s's are all the multiples of d that are >=0 and can be written as s = t, where t >=0 and t can be expressed as t = k a' - l b'.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nBut let's proceed under the assumption that for a' and b' coprime, the reachable s's are all multiples of d that are >=0.\n\nWait, but that's not the case in the first sample. Because a=5, b=3, d=1. So, a' and b' are 5 and 3, which are coprime.\n\nBut in the sample, f(7) is 8, which is 7+1. So all positions 0-7 are reachable.\n\nWait, but in this case, yes, all s's are reachable. So, for x=7, all s's are counted.\n\nBut for x=6, some s's are not.\n\nHmm, perhaps when a' and b' are coprime, the reachable s's are all the multiples of d up to some maximum.\n\nWait, perhaps M is the minimal s where s can be expressed as k a' - l b' for some k, l >=0, and s >=0.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's try to model the reachable s's as a graph. Each node is a position, and edges are the possible jumps (a and -b). Then, the reachable s's are the nodes that can be reached starting from 0, without ever going below 0, and without exceeding x.\n\nBut again, for each x, this is a different graph.\n\nWait, but perhaps for all x >= some value, the reachable s's are all the multiples of d up to x. So, for x >= M, f(x) = (x // d) + 1.\n\nBut how to find M.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps M is the minimal x such that x is reachable, and x + a is reachable, etc. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal M is the smallest s where s can be written as k a - l b >=0, and s is as small as possible. But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps M is the maximum s that can be reached for x approaching infinity. But again, that may not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed by considering that the reachable positions form a set S, and for any x >= max(S), f(x) is |S|. But that's probably not the case, because for a=3, b=2, the reachable positions are 0,3,5, etc., but 1 is not reachable.\n\nWait, but in that case, the maximum s is unbounded, so for x approaching infinity, the number of reachable s's is infinite, which is impossible. So, perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of the sum.\n\nWe need to compute the sum for x from 0 to m of f(x).\n\nBut f(x) is the count of reachable s's for each x.\n\nBut each s contributes to the sum for all x >= s.\n\nSo, the total sum is the sum over all reachable s's of (m - s + 1), but only for s <= m.\n\nSo, the sum is the sum for s in S and s <=m of (m - s + 1), where S is the set of reachable s's.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all s in S that are <=m, and compute the sum.\n\nBut how to find all s in S up to m.\n\nWait, but S is potentially very large. So, perhaps we can find a mathematical way to represent S.\n\nSo, the key is to find all s that can be written as s =k a - l b >=0, and then sum (m - s +1) for each such s <=m.\n\nBut how to find all such s's up to m.\n\nBut again, with a and b up to 1e5 and m up to 1e9, enumerating all s's is impossible.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model the problem in terms of the possible s's.\n\nLet me consider the equation s = k a - l b.\n\nWe can rewrite this as k a = s + l b.\n\nSince k and l are non-negative integers, for a fixed s, we can find if there exists k and l such that this holds.\n\nRearranged, we get k = (s + l b)/a.\n\nSo, for k to be an integer, (s + l b) must be divisible by a.\n\nBut l can vary, so for a given s, does there exist l >=0 such that (s + l b) mod a ==0?\n\nHmm, but this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a fixed s, the equation k a - l b = s can be rearranged as k a + (-l) b = s.\n\nWhich is a linear Diophantine equation in variables k and l, but with constraints that k and l are non-negative.\n\nThe existence of solutions depends on whether s is expressible as a combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients.\n\nWait, but the standard theory says that for two integers a and b, the equation a*k - b*l = s has non-negative solutions (k, l) iff s is in the semigroup generated by a and -b.\n\nBut I'm not familiar with the exact conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a coin problem, but with subtraction allowed.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal positive s that can be reached is the minimal solution to a*k - b*l = s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable s's form a certain arithmetic progression.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nLet me try to think about the problem in terms of generating functions.\n\nThe generating function for the reachable s's is G(x) = sum_{s} x^s, where s is reachable.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding the number of s's that can be expressed as s =k a - l b, and s >=0.\n\nBut again, for large m, enumerating all such s's is impossible.\n\nSo, perhaps we need a mathematical approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the reachable s's are all the numbers that are >=0 and can be expressed as s =k a - l b, and s is non-negative.\n\nBut how to count them efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal s is 0, and the maximal s is some value, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as follows:\n\nThe frog can reach a certain set of positions, and for each x, f(x) is the number of these positions that are <=x.\n\nThus, the sum over x from 0 to m of f(x) is equal to the sum over all s in S of the number of x's >=s and <=m.\n\nWhich is the same as summing (m - s +1) for each s in S where s <=m.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all s in S (reachable positions) up to m, and compute the sum of (m - s +1) for each such s.\n\nThus, the sum is Σ (m -s +1) for s in S and s <=m.\n\nSo, the question is: how to compute the sum of (m -s +1) for all s in S and s <=m.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find all s in S and s <=m, but without enumerating each s.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model S as a set of intervals or find a mathematical formula for the sum.\n\nLet me think about the structure of S.\n\nEach s in S can be written as s =k a - l b, with k, l >=0.\n\nWe can rewrite this as s =k a - l b => l = (k a - s)/b.\n\nSince l must be non-negative, (k a - s) must be >=0 and divisible by b.\n\nSo, for a fixed s, k must be such that (k a - s) is divisible by b and >=0.\n\nBut this approach may not directly help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reachable s's can be represented as s = t * g, where g is the gcd of a and b.\n\nBecause, since a and b are steps, any s must be a multiple of g.\n\nSo, let g = gcd(a, b).\n\nThen, s can be written as s = g * s', where s' is an integer >=0.\n\nAlso, a = g * a', b = g * b', with a' and b' coprime.\n\nSo, substituting, s =g (k a' - l b').\n\nThus, s' =k a' - l b'.\n\nSince a' and b' are coprime, the equation s' =k a' - l b' has solutions for s' in certain ranges.\n\nWait, but in the case where a' and b' are coprime, any s' can be expressed as k a' - l b' for some k, l >=0, provided that s' is >=0.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, if a'=3, b'=2, then s'=1 cannot be expressed as 3k -2l, since 3k -2l=1 has no non-negative solutions.\n\nSo, the reachable s' are those that can be expressed as 3k -2l, and s' >=0.\n\nBut for a'=3, b'=2, the minimal s' is 1 (if possible), but wait, 3*1 - 2*0 =3, which is s'=3. Hmm, so perhaps s' can be zero.\n\nWait, s' =0 is always reachable by setting k=0, l=0.\n\nThen, s' can be 3, 5, etc. But not 1.\n\nSo, the reachable s' are 0,3,5,7,9, etc.\n\nWait, but for a'=3, b'=2, what is the minimal s' that can be expressed as 3k -2l.\n\nLooking for s' >=0.\n\nLet me see:\n\nk=0, l=0: s'=0.\n\nk=1, l=0: s'=3.\n\nk=1, l=1: s'=1.\n\nAh! So s'=1 is reachable.\n\nWait, so for a'=3, b'=2, the reachable s' include 0,1,3,5, etc.\n\nWait, then for s'=1, l=(3k -1)/2.\n\nFor k=1, 3*1 -1=2, which is 2/2=1. So l=1.\n\nThus, s' can be 1.\n\nSo, the reachable s' are all non-negative integers.\n\nWait, that's possible?\n\nWait, for a' and b' coprime, can every non-negative integer be expressed as s' =k a' - l b' ?\n\nNo, that's not true. For example, a'=2, b'=3.\n\nWait, for s'=1: 2k -3l =1.\n\nTrying k=2, l=1: 4-3=1. Yes, s'=1 is reachable.\n\nSimilarly, for s'=4: 2k -3l =4.\n\nk=4, l=2: 8-6=2. No. Wait, maybe other options.\n\nk=5, l=3: 10-9=1. No.\n\nWait, perhaps 2k -3l=4.\n\nTry l=0: 2k=4 →k=2. So yes, s'=4 is reachable.\n\nSo, perhaps for a' and b' coprime, every s' >=0 is reachable.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nWait, let's test a'=2, b'=3.\n\nCan we reach s'=1,2,3,4, etc.?\n\nYes:\n\ns'=0: k=0, l=0.\n\ns'=1: k=2, l=1 → 4-3=1.\n\ns'=2: k=2, l=0 →4.\n\ns'=3: k=3, l=0 →6.\n\ns'=4: k=2, l=1 →4-3=1. Wait, no, 4 is achieved by k=2, l=0.\n\nWait, no, 2*2 -3*0=4.\n\nSo, s'=4 is reachable.\n\nWhat about s'=5: 2*4 -3*1=8-3=5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, it seems that for a' and b' coprime, every s' >=0 is reachable.\n\nSo, the reachable s' are all non-negative integers.\n\nThus, the reachable s is s =g*s', where s' can be any non-negative integer.\n\nThus, the reachable s's are all multiples of g: 0, g, 2g, 3g, etc.\n\nBut wait, earlier example with a=3, b=2, g=1.\n\ns can be any non-negative integer.\n\nBut in the first sample, a=5, b=3, g=1.\n\nSo, all s's from 0 upwards are reachable.\n\nBut according to the sample, for x=7, f(x)=8, which is 0..7 inclusive, which are 8 positions.\n\nWhich fits with all s's being reachable.\n\nThus, the conclusion is that for a and b coprime, all s's are reachable.\n\nWait, but what about a=4 and b=6, which are not coprime. g=2.\n\na'=2, b'=3.\n\nAre all s's multiples of 2 reachable?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\ns=0: yes.\n\ns=2: yes.\n\ns=4: yes.\n\ns=6: yes.\n\ns=8: yes.\n\nWhat about s=1: not reachable.\n\ns=3: not reachable.\n\nSo, in this case, not all s's are reachable.\n\nThus, the earlier conclusion only holds when a' and b' are coprime.\n\nThus, the problem can be split into two cases:\n\nCase 1: a' and b' are coprime. Then, all s's are reachable, so the sum is sum_{s=0}^{m} (m -s +1), but only for s being multiples of g.\n\nWait, no. Because in this case, all s's are multiples of g, but they are all reachable. So, for x >=s, s contributes (x -s +1) to the sum.\n\nWait, but in the case where a' and b' are coprime, the reachable s's are all multiples of g, because s =g s', and s' can be any non-negative integer.\n\nSo, in that case, the reachable s's are 0, g, 2g, 3g, etc.\n\nThus, for x >= s, s contributes (x -s +1) to the sum.\n\nSo, the sum becomes the sum over all s in {0, g, 2g, ... , kg}, where kg <=m}, of (m -s +1).\n\nSo, the sum can be computed as the sum of (m - s +1) for each s in the reachable set and s<=m.\n\nBut when a' and b' are coprime, the reachable s's are all multiples of g up to m.\n\nThus, the sum is the sum for each multiple of g up to m of (m - s +1).\n\nCase 2: a' and b' are not coprime. Then, the reachable s's are multiples of g, but not all are reachable.\n\nIn this case, the reachable s's are a subset of the multiples of g.\n\nSo, the sum is more complex.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute g = gcd(a, b).\n\n2. Compute a' =a/g, b' =b/g.\n\n3. Check if a' and b' are coprime.\n\n   a. If yes, then all multiples of g are reachable. So, the sum is sum_{k=0}^{k_max} (m - k*g +1), where k_max is floor(m/g).\n\n   b. If no, then the reachable s's are a subset of the multiples of g. So, we need to find the reachable s's and compute the sum.\n\nBut how to compute the sum when a' and b' are not coprime.\n\nHmm, this seems challenging.\n\nAlternative approach: When a' and b' are coprime, then the reachable s's are all multiples of g, and their count is floor((m - s)/g) +1.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. For each s =k*g, the contribution is (m - s +1) as long as s <=m.\n\nSo, for each k, s=k*g, and if k*g <=m, then the contribution is (m -k*g +1).\n\nThus, the total sum is the sum of (m -k*g +1) for k=0 to k_max, where k_max = floor(m/g).\n\nBut when a' and b' are not coprime, this approach is incorrect because not all multiples of g are reachable.\n\nSo, for the general case, perhaps the reachable s's are the multiples of g, but only those that can be expressed as s =g*(k a' - l b').\n\nBut even then, finding all such s's is difficult.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is manageable only when a' and b' are coprime.\n\nIn code, perhaps the first thing to check is whether a' and b' are coprime.\n\nIf they are, then the sum is easy to compute.\n\nElse, the problem becomes more complex.\n\nBut given that the problem's constraints are tight, perhaps",
