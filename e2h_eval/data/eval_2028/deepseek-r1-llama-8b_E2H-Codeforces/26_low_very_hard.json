Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles that satisfy certain conditions based on given integers A, B, C, D.\n\nHmm, the problem says that the triangle has sides x, y, z such that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And also, the triangle must be non-degenerate, which means that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. So, x + y > z must hold because x is the smallest and z is the largest.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x ≤ y ≤ z, it's sufficient to check if x + y > z. Because if x + y > z, then automatically, the other conditions (like x + z > y and y + z > x) will be satisfied since z is the largest.\n\nSo the main condition we need to enforce is x + y > z.\n\nBut wait, the constraints are that x is between A and B, inclusive. y is between B and C, inclusive, but also y must be at least x, right? Because B is between x and y, but according to the problem statement, A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be equal to B, but y has to be at least B. So for each x, y starts from max(B, x) up to C. Similarly, z starts from max(C, y) up to D, but wait, no—because C is the upper bound for y, so z can't be less than C, right? Or wait, the condition is y ≤ C and z ≥ C. Because the problem says y ≤ C and z ≥ C? No, wait, the condition is C ≤ z. So z starts from C, right?\n\nWait, let me restate the problem: the variables are x, y, z with A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, x ≤ y and y ≤ z.\n\nSo, for each possible x in [A, B], y in [max(x, B), C], and z in [max(y, C), D], but wait, no—z starts at C, because C ≤ z, so z is at least C. Because the problem says C ≤ z ≤ D. So y can be up to C, and z can be from C to D.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Iterate through all possible x in [A, B].\n2. For each x, iterate through all possible y in [B, C], but y must be ≥ x (since B is ≥x and y ≥ B).\n   Wait, wait. Since x can be up to B, and y starts from B, but also y must be ≥ x. Because if x is B, then y can only start from B. If x is less than B, say x is A, then y can be from B onwards. So y ranges from max(x, B) to C.\n3. For each (x, y), find the number of z's such that z is ≥ C, ≤ D, and z < x + y.\n   Because the triangle condition is x + y > z → z < x + y.\n\nSo, for each (x, y), the z's must satisfy C ≤ z ≤ min(D, x+y-1). The count is max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1).\n\nWait, but if x + y -1 < C, then there are no valid z's. So the count is zero in that case.\n\nSo the approach is to compute for each (x, y) pair whether x + y > C, because if x + y ≤ C, then z has to be ≥ C, but x+y must be > z. So if x + y <= C, then z cannot satisfy both z >= C and z < x + y. Hence, no solutions for that (x, y) pair.\n\nThus, the first thing to check is whether x + y > C. If not, move on.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop over x from A to B.\n\nFor each x, loop y from max(x, B) to C.\n\nFor each (x, y), if x + y <= C: skip.\n\nElse, compute the lower and upper bounds for z:\n\nz must be >= C, and <= min(D, x+y -1).\n\nThe number of z's is max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1).\n\nSum all these counts across all (x, y) pairs.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute this efficiently, because the constraints are up to 5e5, and the straightforward approach would",
