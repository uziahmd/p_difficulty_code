The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, Xenia is in a city with houses arranged in a ring, right? She needs to do some tasks, and each task requires her to be at a specific house. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks.\n\nWait, the problem says that each task i must be done after all tasks j where j < i. So, for example, if her tasks are in the order a1, a2, ..., am, she has to handle them in that exact sequence. Or wait, no. Wait, the description says: \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" Oh, right, so she needs to process them in the order of their indices. So the first task is a1, then a2, etc., but each ai is the target house for task i. So the sequence is fixed as a1, a2, ..., am.\n\nBut wait, the input gives m integers a1, a2,...,am. So the tasks are to be done in the order they appear, but the same house can appear multiple times. So for each task i, she must be at ai, and all previous tasks (1 to i-1) have already been done.\n\nSo the initial position is house 1. She starts there, then for each task in order, she needs to move from wherever she is to the current ai, but also considering that she might have to loop around the ring.\n\nHmm, how to model this? Let's think about the positions and the movement.\n\nThe ring has n houses arranged in a circle. Moving clockwise takes one unit per step. So the distance from house x to y is min( (y -x) % n, (x - y) % n )? No, wait. Because moving clockwise from x to y could be (y -x) steps if y >x, or (n - (x - y)) steps otherwise. Or maybe it's better to compute it as (y - x) % n, which would give the minimal steps in the clockwise direction. Because for example, if x=4, y=1, n=4, then (1-4) is -3 mod 4 is 1. But that's not correct because moving clockwise from 4 to 1 is just 1 step (since the ring is circular). Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, the ring is numbered 1 through n in clockwise order. So moving from 4 to 1 is one step. So the distance is (1 -4 +n) %n = (n-3) mod n = n-3. But for n=4, that's 1, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, the clockwise distance from x to y is (y -x) if y >=x, else (y -x +n). Or more generally, (y -x) %n, but that gives the minimal steps when you can go either way. Wait no, because the problem states that the traffic is one way, clockwise. So you can't move counter-clockwise. So movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction. So the path from x to y must be along the ring, moving in the increasing order direction, possibly wrapping around.\n\nSo the distance from x to y is the number of steps required to go clockwise from x to y. So for example, if x is 1 and y is 3, and n=4, it's 2 steps. If x is 3 and y is 1, you have to go 3→4→1, which is 2 steps again. Wait, no, wait, from 3 to 1 in a 4-house ring: 3→4 is one step, 4→1 is another. So total 2 steps. Alternatively, moving the other way (counter-clockwise) would be 2 steps, but since movement is only allowed clockwise, you have to take the 2 steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the movement as always going the shortest possible clockwise path. So the distance between two points is the minimal steps when moving only clockwise.\n\nSo for any two points x and y, the distance is (y -x) mod n. But wait, if y >=x, that's straightforward. For example, x=1, y=3: 2 steps. If x=3, y=1: (1 -3) mod 4 is (-2) mod4 = 2. So that's correct.\n\nYes, that formula gives the correct number of steps when moving clockwise.\n\nSo now, the problem is to find the minimal total time to complete all the tasks, given that she starts at house 1, and for each task in order, she must be present at the corresponding ai.\n\nLet's model the problem step by step.\n\nInitially, she is at position 1.\n\nFor each task i (from 1 to m), she must move from her current position to ai, adding the distance to the total time. However, after each task, she stays at ai until the next task.\n\nBut wait, the order is that for task i, she must be at ai after handling all j <i. So the sequence is:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFor i=1: move to a1, time += distance from current pos to a1.\n\nThen, for i=2: move from a1 to a2, time += distance.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the total time is the sum of the distances between consecutive positions, starting from 1 and then each ai in order.\n\nWait, but what about the fact that sometimes, you can optimize by looping around the ring. Like, in the sample input, the first test case has n=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3].\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nMove to 3: distance is (3-1)=2 steps.\n\nThen from 3 to 2: since moving clockwise from 3 to 2 is impossible, because the next house is 4, then 1, then 2. So the distance is (2-3 +4) mod4 = (1+4-3) = 2 steps? Wait, no.\n\nWait, wait, the distance from 3 to 2 is (2-3) mod4 is (-1 mod4) = 3. So she moves 3 →4 →1 →2: 3 steps.\n\nThen from 2 to 3: distance is (3-2)=1 step.\n\nSo total steps: 2 + 3 +1 =6.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach is: the total time is the sum of the distances between each consecutive pair of positions in the sequence [1, a1, a2, ..., am], where each step is moving clockwise.\n\nWait, but wait: the initial position is 1, and the first task is to go to a1. Then from a1 to a2, etc. So yes, it's the sum of the distances between each consecutive pair.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing the sum of the distances between the current position and the next required position, considering that the positions form a sequence starting at 1 and followed by the a_i's in order.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Read the list of a_i's.\n\n3. Compute the list of positions as [1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_m].\n\n4. For each consecutive pair (pos_prev, pos_current), compute the distance, which is (pos_current - pos_prev) mod n.\n\n5. Sum all these distances, and that's the answer.\n\nWait, that's it? Because in the sample input, the first test case gives a list [1,3,2,3]. The consecutive pairs are (1,3): (3-1)=2; (3,2): (2-3) mod4=3; (2,3): 1. Sum is 6.\n\nIn the second sample input, the a array is [2,3,3], so the positions are [1,2,3,3]. Consecutive pairs: (1,2) →1 step; (2,3) →1 step; (3,3) →0. Sum is 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nWait, but the second sample input's output is 2, right?\n\nSo yes, that seems to work.\n\nWait, but wait: the a array may have duplicate entries. So, for example, if the a array is [3,3,3], the positions are [1,3,3,3]. The distances are (3-1)=2, (3-3)=0, (3-3)=0. Sum is 2.\n\nSo, the plan is correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Create a list that starts with 1, followed by all a_i's.\n\n- For each pair in this list, compute (current - previous) mod n, and sum all these mod results.\n\nSo, now, the code.\n\nIn Python, we can read the inputs, process them, and compute the sum.\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nThen, read the next line, split into m integers, convert to a list.\n\nThen, create the positions list as [1] + a_list.\n\nThen, for i from 1 to len(positions)-1:\n\n   prev = positions[i-1]\n\n   current = positions[i]\n\n   distance = (current - prev) % n\n\n   add to sum.\n\nFinally, print the sum.\n\nThat's it?\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this logic against the samples:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3]\n\npositions = [1,3,2,3]\n\nsum of (3-1)=2, (2-3)= -1 → mod4 is 3, (3-2)=1 → sum 2+3+1=6.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[2,3,3]\n\npositions = [1,2,3,3]\n\nsum is 1 (2-1) +1 (3-2) +0 (3-3) =2.\n\nSo both samples are covered.\n\nAnother test case: suppose n=5, m=2, a=[5,1]. positions [1,5,1]. Distances: 4 (5-1=4 mod5) and 1 (1-5 mod5= 1? Wait, 1-5 is -4 mod5 is 1.\n\nSo sum is 4 +1=5.\n\nWhat's the movement:\n\n1→5: 4 steps (5 is 4 steps ahead).\n\n5→1: move to 5→1, which is 1 step (since 5+1 is 6 mod5 is 1). So yes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead n, m.\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\npositions = [1] + a\n\ntotal =0\n\nfor i in range(1, len(positions)):\n\n    prev = positions[i-1]\n\n    curr = positions[i]\n\n    diff = (curr - prev) % n\n\n    total += diff\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but wait: in the sample input, the input is given as '4 3\\n3 2 3', so the code will read a as [3,2,3], which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Positions [1,1]. Distance is 0. Sum is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,2]. positions [1,2,2]. Distances: (2-1)=1, (2-2)=0. Sum is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=1, a=[5]. positions [1,5]. Distance is 4. So sum 4.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=3, a=[3,4,5]. positions [1,3,4,5]. Distances: 2, 1, 1. Sum 4.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nThus, the final code is as described.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks while moving clockwise around a ring of houses.
