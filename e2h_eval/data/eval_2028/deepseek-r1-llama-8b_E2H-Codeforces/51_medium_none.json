Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Amusing Joke\" and from the description, it sounds like we need to determine if a pile of letters can be rearranged to form the guest's name and the host's name without any extra letters.\n\nHmm, the input consists of three lines: the first is the guest's name, the second is the host's name, and the third is the pile of letters found. We need to check if the pile has exactly the right letters in the correct counts to form both names combined, nothing more, nothing less.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Well, I think the steps are:\n\n1. Combine the guest and host names into a single string.\n2. Count the frequency of each letter in this combined string.\n3. Do the same for the pile of letters.\n4. Compare the two frequency dictionaries. If they match exactly, output YES; otherwise, NO.\n\nWait, but wait. Oh right, because the pile has to be exactly equal to the sum of the guest and host letters. So, any discrepancy, like an extra letter or missing one, would result in a NO.\n\nSo, let's think about the steps in code terms.\n\nFirst, I need to read the three lines of input. In Python, I can read them using input().strip() for each line. But wait, sometimes when you have multiple lines, using splitlines() might be better, especially if there are newlines or something. Or perhaps just read each line as separate variables.\n\nSo, I'll get guest = input().strip(), host = input().strip(), pile = input().strip().\n\nThen, I'll concatenate guest and host into one string, say combined = guest + host.\n\nNext, I need to count the letters in combined and in pile. For that, I can use a dictionary or the Counter class from the collections module in Python. Using Counter seems efficient here.\n\nSo, import Counter from collections.\n\nThen, create a counter for combined and another for pile.\n\nIf these two counters are equal, then output YES; else, NO.\n\nThat's the basic idea. Now, some edge cases to consider.\n\nWhat if the total length of guest and host is different from the pile's length? Then immediately, it's a NO. So maybe adding a check for len(combined) == len(pile) could save some time, but since Counter already handles that (if the lengths are different, the counts will differ), perhaps it's redundant.\n\nBut including it might make the code faster, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to rely on the Counter to handle it.\n\nAnother edge case is when either guest or host is empty, but according to the problem statement, all lines are non-empty, so that's covered.\n\nWhat about letters that appear in one name but not the other? Like, guest has 'A', host doesn't, but pile has 'A'—that's okay. As long as the total counts match.\n\nSo, the plan is solid.\n\nLet me think about the example given.\n\nSample Input:\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, no, actually the sample input is three lines. Wait, the user probably made a mistake in formatting. But regardless, in the sample, the pile letters should combine exactly to form the guest and host names.\n\nIn the first sample, the pile letters can be used to form the names with no leftovers, so output YES.\n\nIn the second sample, there's a missing 'P' and an extra 'L', so output NO.\n\nThird sample has an extra 'L', so NO.\n\nSo, the code needs to correctly count all letters.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nI'll write code like this:\n\nRead the three lines as guest, host, pile.\n\nCombine guest and host into combined_str.\n\nCreate counters: from collections import Counter\n\nguest_counter = Counter(guest)\nhost_counter = Counter(host)\ncombined_counter = guest_counter + host_counter  # Or, combined_str = guest + host, then Counter(combined_str)\n\nAlternatively, combined_str = guest + host, then combined_counter = Counter(combined_str)\n\nSimilarly, pile_counter = Counter(pile)\n\nThen, compare if combined_counter == pile_counter. If yes, print YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but adding two Counters isn't straightforward. Oh right, because guest_counter + host_counter gives a Counter where the counts are the sum of each letter.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ng = input().strip()\nh = input().strip()\np = input().strip()\n\ncombined = g + h\ncount_g = Counter(g)\ncount_h = Counter(h)\ncombined_count = count_g + count_h\n\npile_count = Counter(p)\n\nif combined_count == pile_count:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but wait! Because when you add two Counters, it adds their counts. So, for each character, the total is the sum of its occurrences in g and h.\n\nYes, that's exactly what we need.\n\nTesting this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\n\nHost: DEDMOROZ\n\nCombined: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\n\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nWait, no, the combined length is len(g) + len(h). Let's see: len(g) is 10, len(h) is 8, so combined is 18. The pile's letters should also sum to 18.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS—let's count the letters. Hmm, but regardless, when combining guest and host, the code counts all letters, and if the pile's count matches, it's YES.\n\nSo, in code, the solution is correct.\n\nAnother test case: if guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AA\". Then combined is \"AA\", which is same as pile, so YES.\n\nIf guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\"—then YES.\n\nIf guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AAA\"—then combined is \"AA\", which is two As, but pile has three. So combined_count will have A:2, pile_count has A:3. They don't match, so output NO.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"ABC\", host is \"DEF\", pile is \"ABDEF\". Combined is ABCDEF, which is six letters. Pile is ABDEF (5 letters)—so counts won't match.\n\nSo, code works.\n\nI think this approach covers all cases. So, the code should be as follows.\n\nWait, but in the sample input provided, the first input line is in quotes, but that's probably a formatting error. The actual input would be three lines, each line being the guest, host, and pile.\n\nSo, the code should read three lines, process each as above.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the three lines, process as described.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe code:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the input lines\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Combine guest and host into one string\ncombined = guest + host\n\n# Create counters\ncombined_counts = Counter(combined)\npile_counts = Counter(pile)\n\nif combined_counts == pile_counts:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but wait: the Counter objects are compared by their elements. So, yes, if all counts match, it returns True.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nTesting this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nguest: SANTACLAUS\nhost: DEDMOROZ\npile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ → which is length 10+8=18.\n\nPile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS → let's see if it's 18 letters. Let's count: S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → that's 18 letters.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's the same as the combined. So, the code would return YES.\n\nSample Output is YES.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nguest: PAPAINOEL\nhost: JOULUPUKKI\npile: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nCombined length is len(PAPAINOEL) = 9, len(JOULUPUKKI)=10 → 19.\n\nPile: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → let's see, perhaps the counts don't match.\n\nBut according to the note, the pile is missing 'P' and has an extra 'L'. So, the code would detect that.\n\nIn the code, the combined_counts will have, for example, P:1, L:1, etc., while the pile_counts may have L:2 and P:0. So, the counters would differ.\n\nThus, code correctly outputs NO.\n\nSo, I think this code should pass all test cases.\n",
