    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The task is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about the examples they gave. For 'abcd', the output is 0 because all substrings are unique. For 'ababa', the output is 3. Oh right, because 'aba' appears twice, overlapping in the middle. And for 'zzz', the output is 2 because 'zz' occurs twice, but not 'zzz'.\n\nSo how do I approach this? I need to check all possible substrings and find the maximum length where at least two occurrences exist.\n\nFirst, I should consider all possible substring lengths starting from the largest possible down to 1. For each length l, I check every possible substring of that length and see if it appears more than once. If I find any such substring, I return l as the answer.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Iterate over possible substring lengths from (n-1) down to 1, where n is the length of the string.\n2. For each length l, generate all possible substrings of length l.\n3. Check if any of these substrings appear more than once in the string.\n4. The first l for which this is true is the maximum possible, so return it.\n\nYes, that seems manageable. Now, how do I implement this efficiently?\n\nHmm, for the string length up to 100, even a brute-force approach should be acceptable. Because 100 is small, so the nested loops won't be too bad.\n\nSo let's outline the steps in code:\n\n- Get the input string s.\n- For l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n   - Create a set to track seen substrings.\n   - Loop through i from 0 to len(s) - l:\n      - current_sub = s[i:i+l]\n      - If current_sub is already in the set, return l.\n      - Else, add it to the set.\n- If no duplicates found for any l, return 0.\n\nWait, but wait: For each l, we check all possible substrings. Once we find a duplicate, we can immediately return l as the answer since we're checking from largest to smallest.\n\nYes, that's efficient because as soon as we find the maximum possible l, we stop.\n\nSo let's test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 'abcd'\nCheck l=3. Substrings: 'abc', 'bcd'. No duplicates. Then l=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'. No duplicates. l=1: 'a','b','c','d'. All unique. So return 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa'\nl=4: substrings 'abab', 'baba' → no duplicates.\nl=3: 'aba' (i=0), then 'bab' (i=1), then 'aba' (i=2). So when i=2, 'aba' is already in the set. So return 3.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz'\nl=2: substrings 'zz' (i=0), then 'zz' (i=1). So when i=1, 'zz' is in the set. Return 2.\n\nGreat, so the logic works for the samples.\n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nCase where the entire string is the same character, like 'aaaaa'. The maximum l is 4, because the substring 'aaaa' appears at positions 0 and 1, and also at other positions.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for 'aaaaa', the maximum l would be 4. Because the substring 'aaaa' appears starting at 0 and 1. So yes.\n\nAnother case: string of length 1, like 'a'. Then the output is 0 since there's only one occurrence.\n\nWhat about a string where all possible substrings of a certain length are unique except for some longer ones? Like 'abacab'. Maybe 'aba' occurs twice.\n\nWait, I think the approach handles that correctly.\n\nSo now, coding this in Python.\n\nThe code structure will be:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nFor l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n    create a set to track seen substrings.\n    for i in 0 to len(s) - l:\n        current_sub = s[i:i+l]\n        if current_sub in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit\n        else:\n            add to seen\nIf after all l's, nothing found, print 0.\n\nBut wait, what about when the entire string is duplicated, like 'abab'? Then for l=2, 'ab' appears twice. So the code will catch that.\n\nWait, let's see: 'abab' has substrings 'ab' (i=0), 'ba' (i=1), 'ab' (i=2). So when i=2, 'ab' is already in the set, so return 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: 'abba'. The substrings of length 2 are 'ab', 'bb', 'ba'. 'bb' appears once. So the code returns 0? Or wait, no. Because 'ab' occurs at 0 and 3? Wait no, 'ab' is at 0, and 'ba' is at 2. So no, 'ab' doesn't appear again. So the code would return 0.\n\nWait, but 'bb' occurs once, so no duplicates. So the maximum is 0.\n\nWait, another case: 'ababab'. Then for l=3, substrings 'aba', 'bab', 'aba' → 'aba' is duplicated. So the code returns 3.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nIn Python, reading the input is straightforward. The input is given as a single line, but in the sample input, it's shown as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but probably the actual input is just a single string.\n\nSo, read the string using input().strip().\n\nThen, for l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\nWait, wait. The maximum possible l is len(s)-1, because the minimum is that the substring appears at least twice, so the substring needs to have at least two characters. But wait, for example, if the string is length 2, like 'aa', then l=1 is acceptable.\n\nWait, the maximum possible l is len(s) - 1, because the substring can be the entire string minus one character. Because, for example, in 'aaaaa', the substring 'aaaa' (length 4) appears multiple times.\n\nSo the loop for l starts from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n\nFor each l, we loop i from 0 to len(s) - l, inclusive.\n\nWait, in Python, the range is up to but not including the end. So for i in 0 to (len(s) - l), the upper limit is len(s) - l + 1? Or is it len(s) - l? Wait, the substring s[i:i+l] requires that i + l <= len(s), so i can be from 0 to len(s) - l, inclusive. So in code:\n\nfor i in range(0, len(s) - l + 1):\n\nBecause, for example, if len(s) is 5 and l is 2, then i can be 0,1,2,3. So len(s) - l +1 is 5-2+1=4, so i ranges from 0 to 3, which is correct.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(0, n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but wait: what if the entire string is the same, like 'aaaaa'? Then, for l=4, the substrings are 'aaaa' (i=0), 'aaaa' (i=1). So when i=1, substr is 'aaaa' which is in seen. So it returns 4.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcdeabcde'. The maximum l is 5, because the entire substring 'abcde' appears twice.\n\nSo the code would check l=5 first. It adds 'abcde' to the set. Then, when i=5, substr is 'abcde' again. So it returns 5.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, what about when the string has a substring that appears more than twice, like 'aaaabaaaab'? The maximum l would be 6, as 'aaaaab' is not repeated, but perhaps the maximum is 5 or something. Or maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nNo, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the code correctly handling all possibilities.\n\nI think the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's write this as a Python script.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input is given as the first line, which is the string. So in code, we'll read it as s = input().strip()\n\nThen, for each l from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n\nWait, but what if the string is of length 1? Then, len(s)-1 is 0, so the loop doesn't run, and it returns 0, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: 'abcd'\n\nLoop l from 3 down to 1.\n\nFor l=3, substrings 'abc', 'bcd' → no duplicates.\n\nl=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' → no.\n\nl=1: 'a','b','c','d' → no. So output 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa'\n\nl=4: substrings 'abab', 'baba' → no.\n\nl=3: substrings 'aba' (i=0), 'bab' (i=1), 'aba' (i=2). So when i=2, 'aba' is already in the set. So return 3.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz'\n\nl=2: substrings 'zz' (i=0), 'zz' (i=1). So when i=1, 'zz' is in the set. Return 2.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'a' → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: 'aa' → l=1: 'a' appears twice. So output 1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the code for l=1: i runs from 0 to 2-1=1 (since len(s)-l is 1). So i=0: substr 'a' → add. i=1: substr 'a' → found, so return 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'ababab' → l=5: no. l=4: no. l=3: 'aba' (i=0), 'bab' (i=1), 'aba' (i=2). So return 3.\n\nYes.\n\nI think this should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We need to check all possible substrings of the given string and determine the maximum length of a substring that appears more than once. Given the constraints (string length up to 100), a brute-force approach is feasible.\n\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating over possible substring lengths from the largest possible down to the smallest, we can efficiently find the longest repeating substring. For each length, we generate all possible substrings and check for duplicates.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Iterate over possible substring lengths starting from the largest (length of string - 1) down to 1.\n   - For each length, generate all possible substrings and use a set to track seen substrings.\n   - If a duplicate substring is found, return the current length as the result.\n   - If no duplicates are found for any length, return 0.\n\n4. **Complexity**: The approach involves nested loops where the outer loop runs in O(n) time (n being the length of the string) and the inner loop also runs in O(n) time for each substring length. This results in an overall complexity of O(n^2), which is efficient for the given constraint.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(0, n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n- **Loop Over Lengths**: We start checking from the largest possible substring length down to 1.\n- **Track Substrings**: For each length, we use a set to keep track of substrings we have seen so far.\n- **Check for Duplicates**: If a substring is found in the set, it means we have seen it before, so we print the current length and exit.\n- **No Duplicates Found**: If no duplicates are found for any length, we print 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring by leveraging nested loops and a set for quick lookups.",
