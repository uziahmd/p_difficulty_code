Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X'. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe grid is n x n, where n is odd. The conditions for it being an 'X' are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same character.\n2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same character, which is different from the diagonal ones.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to check the two main diagonals. Both should consist of the same character. Then, all non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Read the input correctly. The first line is n, followed by n lines each containing n characters. But wait, in the example given, the input is presented as a list of strings, but each string ends with '\\n'. Oh right, because in Python, when you split the input, each line includes the newline. So I'll need to process each line to extract just the letters.\n\nWait, the way the input is given: each of the next n lines is n characters followed by a newline. So for each line after the first, we can take the string and strip any leading/trailing whitespace, then take the first n characters? Or perhaps, since the input is correct, each line has exactly n letters, including the newline. Hmm, maybe I can process each line by taking the entire line except the trailing newline.\n\nSo for each line after the first, I'll read it, remove the newline, and then take the first n characters. Or perhaps, just process each line as is, because the length is n.\n\nWait, no. For example, in the sample input, the first case is a 5x5 grid, but the second is 3x3, etc. So for each line, after reading, I can take the entire string, ignoring the newline, but ensuring that it's exactly n characters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can read each line, strip the trailing newline, and then ensure that the length is n. Because sometimes, when pasting, people might include extra newlines or something.\n\nBut for now, let's proceed.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n- Read n.\n- Read n lines, each line represents a row.\n- For each row, process it into a list of characters.\n\nOnce I have the grid, I need to:\n\nCheck the two main diagonals. So for a grid, the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1), and the other diagonal is from (0,n-1) to (n-1,0).\n\nFirst condition: both diagonals must be the same character.\n\nSo, get the diagonal1 and diagonal2, check if they are all the same.\n\nIf not, it's a 'NO'.\n\nIf they are the same, then check the other condition: all other cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nWait, but what about the cases where the diagonals have more than one unique character? Like, if some cells on the diagonal are different from others. So the first step is to check if all diagonal cells are the same.\n\nSo, how to do that:\n\nFor the main diagonal, collect all elements and see if they are all the same. Similarly for the anti-diagonal.\n\nThen, if both are same, proceed.\n\nThen, for all other cells (i.e., not on either diagonal), check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Check the main diagonal:\n   - Iterate over each cell (i, j) where i == j.\n   - Collect all these values into a set.\n   - If the size of the set is more than 1, then the diagonal is invalid. So overall answer is NO.\n\n2. Similarly, check the anti-diagonal (i + j = n-1):\n   - Iterate over each cell (i, j) where i + j == n-1.\n   - Collect into a set. If size >1, invalid.\n\n3. If both diagonals are valid (all same), then proceed.\n\n4. Now, check the other cells. They must all be the same, and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo, collect all the non-diagonal cells into a set. If the set has more than one unique character, then it's invalid.\n\nAlso, check that this collected set's character is different from the diagonal's.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nLet's think about the code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()  # removes the trailing newline\n    # assuming that each line is exactly n characters.\n    grid.append(list(line))\n\nThen, check the diagonals.\n\ndiag_char = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    j = i\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given n x n grid of characters forms the letter 'X'. The conditions for the grid to form an 'X' are:\n1. Both main diagonals must consist of the same character.\n2. All other cells (not on the diagonals) must be the same character, which is different from the diagonal's character.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the integer `n` and then read the next `n` lines to form the grid.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: \n   - Extract the characters along both main diagonals and check if they are all the same.\n3. **Check Other Cells**: Ensure that all cells not on the diagonals have the same character, which must be different from the diagonal's character.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [list(input().strip()) for _ in range(n)]\n\ndef is_x(grid, n):\n    # Check main diagonal\n    diag1 = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        diag1.append(grid[i][i])\n    if len(set(diag1)) != 1:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check anti-diagonal\n    diag2 = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        diag2.append(grid[i][n-1 - i])\n    if len(set(diag2)) != 1:\n        return False\n    \n    # Get the diagonal character\n    d_char = diag1[0]\n    \n    # Check all other cells\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n                continue  # skip diagonal cells\n            if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n                return False\n    \n    return True\n\nif is_x(grid, n):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The grid is read as a list of lists where each sublist represents a row of the grid.\n2. **Checking Diagonals**: We iterate through both diagonals to ensure all characters are the same. If any diagonal has more than one unique character, the function returns `False`.\n3. **Checking Other Cells**: After confirming the diagonals are valid, we check that all non-diagonal cells have the same character, which must be different from the diagonal's character. If any cell fails this check, the function returns `False`.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine if the grid forms the letter 'X', ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
