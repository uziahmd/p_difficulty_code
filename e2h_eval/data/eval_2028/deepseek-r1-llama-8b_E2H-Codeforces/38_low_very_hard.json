    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about directed graphs and something called p-reachable graphs. Oh right, and we need to find the minimum number of nodes required to create such a graph for a given p, and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs with that minimum.\n\nLet me try to break down the problem. So, a p-reachable directed graph has exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v, and they are reachable from each other. Wait, but wait—those are undirected edges because u can reach v and v can reach u? Or no, because the graph is directed. Oh, but the definition says it's a directed graph, but the pairs (u, v) are such that u and v are reachable from each other, regardless of direction. So it's like an undirected edge between u and v.\n\nWait, no. Because in a directed graph, reachability isn't symmetric. But the definition says p is the count of ordered pairs where u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. So that would mean that both u can reach v and v can reach u. So the pair (u, v) is counted only if u < v and there's a mutual path. So these are like bidirectional edges.\n\nSo the problem is about creating a directed graph where the number of such bidirectional edges (where u < v) is exactly p. And we need to find the minimal number of nodes to achieve this, and then among all such minimal graphs, find the one with the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nWait, unidirectional pairs are ordered pairs (u, v) where u != v, there's a path from u to v, and no path from v to u. So those are asymmetric edges.\n\nHmm, okay. So the first part is to find the minimal n (number of nodes) such that the graph has exactly p such bidirectional edges.\n\nI think I should model this as a graph where the edges are arranged in a way that the number of such bidirectional pairs is p. The minimal n would probably be determined by how many such edges we can fit into the graph structure.\n\nLet me think about how the bidirectional edges can be formed. Each such edge corresponds to two directed edges in opposite directions. So for each such pair (u, v), u can reach v and v can reach u.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal graph is a collection of strongly connected components. Because within a strongly connected component, every node can reach every other node. So the number of such bidirectional pairs is the number of edges in the undirected sense within each component.\n\nWait, but in a strongly connected component of size k, the number of such pairs (u, v) where u < v is k choose 2, which is k*(k-1)/2. Because for every pair, since they are mutually reachable, they contribute to p.\n\nSo if the entire graph is a single strongly connected component, then the number of such pairs is C(n, 2), which is n*(n-1)/2. So if p is equal to C(n, 2), then n is the minimal possible. But wait, that's not necessarily the case because maybe you can split the graph into multiple components to get a lower n.\n\nWait, no. Because if you split into components, each component contributes C(k_i, 2) to p. So the total p is the sum of C(k_i, 2) for each component. So if you have multiple components, the sum of their C(k_i, 2) must be equal to p. To minimize the total number of nodes n = sum(k_i), we need to maximize each C(k_i, 2). Wait, no: because for a given sum of C(k_i, 2), how do we arrange the k_i's to minimize the total n?\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase: the sum of C(k_i, 2) over all components equals p. We want to find the minimal n = sum(k_i) such that this holds.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible sum of C(k_i, 2) for a given n? It's when all k_i are as equal as possible. Because C(k, 2) is maximized when the numbers are as large as possible. Wait, no: for a fixed sum, the sum of squares is maximized when one term is as large as possible. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, no. Suppose I have two variables a and b, with a + b = s. Then a² + b² is maximized when one is s and the other is 0. So for our problem, to maximize the sum of C(k_i, 2), which is the same as summing k_i*(k_i-1)/2, we need",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a directed graph that is p-reachable and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs with that minimum number of nodes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: A p-reachable directed graph has exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and both can reach each other. These are bidirectional edges. We need to find the smallest number of nodes (n) that can form such a graph and then maximize the number of unidirectional pairs among these graphs.\n\n2. **Graph Structure Insight**: The number of bidirectional edges in a strongly connected component (SCC) of size k is C(k, 2) = k*(k-1)/2. To achieve exactly p such edges, we can consider the sum of C(k_i, 2) over all SCCs.\n\n3. **Minimizing Nodes**: For a given p, the minimal number of nodes n is determined by how we distribute the bidirectional edges across SCCs. The minimal n occurs when the edges are as concentrated as possible, typically in one SCC if possible.\n\n4. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: After determining the minimal n, we need to structure the graph to maximize unidirectional pairs. This involves creating a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) with as many edges as possible without forming cycles, ensuring each edge is unidirectional.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n    \n    # Find minimal n\n    if p <= 1:\n        n = 2 if p == 1 else 1\n    else:\n        n = 0\n        while True:\n            C = n * (n - 1) // 2\n            if C >= p:\n                break\n            n += 1\n    \n    # Now, for the maximum unidirectional pairs\n    # To maximize unidirectional pairs, we need a graph where as many edges as possible are unidirectional.\n    # The optimal structure is a complete DAG with layers, but let's think differently.\n    # Wait, no. Because the graph must have exactly p bidirectional edges, but beyond that, the rest can be unidirectional.\n    # But wait, the problem says the graph must be p-reachable, which means it has exactly p bidirectional edges, and the rest can be any direction.\n    # So to maximize unidirectional pairs, after having p bidirectional edges, add as many unidirectional edges as possible without affecting reachability.\n    \n    # So first, we need to construct the graph with exactly p bidirectional edges, and then add as many unidirectional edges as possible.\n    \n    # Let's think about the minimal n case.\n    # When n is minimal, it's likely a single SCC if possible.\n    # For example, when n=3 and p=3, the entire graph is a single triangle, so all 3 edges are bidirectional.\n    # Then, adding more edges can't be bidirectional because we already have p=3.\n    \n    # So, to maximize unidirectional pairs, after the p bidirectional edges, add as many unidirectional edges as possible.\n    # But how?\n    \n    # Wait, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest n where C(n,2) >= p.\n    # Because if you can make a single SCC, then you can have exactly p = C(n,2) edges.\n    # So for p=3, n=3 gives C(3,2)=3, which is p.\n    # So in that case, the graph is a triangle, and there are 0 unidirectional edges.\n    \n    # For p=6, n=4: C(4,2)=6, so the graph is a complete SCC, again with 0 unidirectional edges.\n    \n    # But what if p is not exactly C(n,2)? Like p=5, n=4: C(4,2)=6>5. So how to arrange it?\n    \n    # So perhaps, the minimal n is the smallest integer such that C(n,2) >= p.\n    # Once n is found, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is achieved when the graph is a DAG with n nodes, and as many edges as possible are unidirectional.\n    \n    # Wait, but in the minimal n case, the graph is a single SCC if possible. So to have exactly p bidirectional edges, perhaps the minimal n is such that C(n,2) is just enough to cover p.\n    \n    # So, for the maximum unidirectional pairs, after the necessary p edges, we can add any number of edges as unidirectional.\n    # But wait, the graph must remain strongly connected for the p edges. No, the graph doesn't have to be strongly connected overall. It's only that the p edges are mutual.\n    \n    # So, to maximize unidirectional pairs, the graph should be constructed as a DAG with the minimal n, and as many edges as possible are unidirectional, except for the p edges which are mutual.\n    \n    # Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is (n*(n-1) - p) + ...? Or perhaps it's (n*(n-1)) - p, since the total possible edges are n*(n-1), and p of them are mutual.\n    \n    # Wait, no. Because in a directed graph, each bidirectional edge contributes two directed edges. So the total number of directed edges is 2*p plus the number of unidirectional edges.\n    \n    # So the total number of possible directed edges is n*(n-1). Each undirected edge (u, v) is counted as two directed edges, and each unidirectional edge is counted as one.\n    \n    # So, the number of unidirectional edges is equal to the number of directed edges minus 2*p.\n    \n    # Therefore, to maximize the number of unidirectional edges, we need to minimize the number of directed edges beyond the 2*p required for the bidirectional edges.\n    \n    # But wait, the graph can have any number of unidirectional edges as long as it's reachable. Wait, no, the graph needs to have exactly p bidirectional edges, but beyond that, it can have any number of unidirectional edges.\n    \n    # So the maximum number of unidirectional edges is achieved when the graph is a DAG, with as many edges as possible being unidirectional.\n    \n    # In a DAG, the maximum number of edges is n*(n-1)/2, but here we have p bidirectional edges, which require 2*p directed edges. The remaining edges can all be unidirectional.\n    \n    # So the maximum number of unidirectional edges is (n*(n-1) - 2*p).\n    \n    # So for the sample input where p=3, n=3: total directed edges possible is 3*2=6. 2*p=6, so unidirectional edges are 6-6=0.\n    \n    # Another sample: if p=4, n=5. Then 5*4=20. 2*p=8. So unidirectional edges can be 12. So the output is 5 12.\n    \n    # Wait, but the sample input shows for p=4, the output is '5 6'. Wait, that contradicts my reasoning.\n    \n    # Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n    \n    # Oh wait, the problem says that the p is the number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are mutually reachable. So each such pair contributes one to p. But in terms of directed edges, each such pair requires two directed edges (u→v and v→u).\n    \n    # So the total number of directed edges contributed by these p pairs is 2*p.\n    \n    # The rest of the directed edges can be either unidirectional or not, but they don't contribute to p.\n    \n    # So the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is the number of directed edges in the graph minus 2*p, minus any edges that might form new bidirectional pairs.\n    \n    # But to maximize unidirectional pairs, we want as few additional edges as possible beyond the 2*p required for the p pairs.\n    \n    # So perhaps the maximum unidirectional pairs is (n*(n-1) - 2*p) - (number of new bidirectional edges added).\n    \n    # Alternatively, perhaps the maximum unidirectional pairs is the number of possible directed edges minus 2*p, because any new edges beyond the 2*p can be arranged to be unidirectional.\n    \n    # So for example, if n=5, p=4, then 5*4=20 directed edges. 2*p=8. So 20-8=12 possible unidirectional edges. So why does the sample output say 5 6?\n    \n    # Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's look at the sample input provided:\n    \n    # Input:\n    # 4\n    # Output:\n    # 5 6\n    \n    # So for p=4, n=5, the maximum unidirectional pairs is 6. How does that fit into my previous reasoning?\n    \n    # Let me think differently. Perhaps the way the graph is structured affects the count.\n    \n    # Maybe the minimal n is not always the smallest n where C(n,2) >= p. For example, for p=4, n=5 is needed because C(4,2)=6 which is larger than 4. But perhaps another structure allows a smaller n.\n    \n    # Wait, but for p=4, n=5 is the minimal because C(3,2)=3 <4, and C(4,2)=6>=4. So n=5.\n    \n    # Now, to maximize unidirectional pairs, perhaps the graph is structured as follows:\n    \n    # Have a small strongly connected component (like 3 nodes) contributing 3 bidirectional edges, and then attach two nodes with edges pointing in one direction.\n    \n    # So in this case, the 3-node component contributes 3 edges, and the two additional nodes contribute 3+2=5 edges, but perhaps some are unidirectional.\n    \n    # I'm not sure. Maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n    \n    # Let me try to derive a formula for the maximum unidirectional pairs given n and p.\n    \n    # The total number of directed edges possible in a directed graph with n nodes is n*(n-1).\n    \n    # Out of these, 2*p are used for the p bidirectional edges.\n    \n    # The remaining edges can be arranged to be unidirectional as much as possible. So the maximum number of unidirectional edges is (n*(n-1) - 2*p).\n    \n    # But wait, in the sample input where p=4, n=5: 5*4=20 directed edges. 2*p=8. 20-8=12. But the sample output is 6.\n    \n    # So this approach is incorrect. There must be a different way to compute the maximum unidirectional pairs.\n    \n    # Let's think differently. Perhaps the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is the number of edges in a transitive tournament graph, minus the 2*p edges used for the p bidirectional pairs.\n    \n    # A transitive tournament has n*(n-1)/2 edges, all directed in one way. So if we subtract the 2*p edges for the bidirectional pairs, the remaining would be the unidirectional edges.\n    \n    # So maximum unidirectional pairs would be (n*(n-1)/2 - p).\n    \n    # Let's test this with the sample inputs.\n    \n    # Sample 1: p=3, n=3. 3*2/2=3. 3-3=0. Which matches the sample output.\n    \n    # Sample 2: p=4, n=5. 5*4/2=10. 10-4=6. Which matches the sample output.\n    \n    # Sample 3: p=0, n=0. 0-0=0. Also matches.\n    \n    # So this seems to fit. Therefore, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is (n*(n-1)/2 - p).\n    \n    # So the approach is:\n    # 1. Find the minimal n where C(n,2) >= p. That's the minimal number of nodes.\n    # 2. Compute the maximum unidirectional pairs as (n*(n-1)/2 - p).\n    \n    # Now, implement this logic.\n    \n    # Edge cases:\n    # p=0: minimal n is 0. But according to the sample, when p=0, output is 0 0.\n    \n    # So the steps are:\n    # If p == 0:\n        # output 0 0\n    # Else:\n        # find minimal n such that C(n,2) >= p.\n        # compute max_unidirectional = (n*(n-1)//2 - p)\n        # output n and max_unidirectional\n    \n    # Now, let's code this.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n    \n    # Find minimal n where n*(n-1)/2 >= p\n    if p <= 1:\n        n = 2 if p == 1 else 1\n    else:\n        n = 0\n        while True:\n            c = n * (n - 1) // 2\n            if c >= p:\n                break\n            n += 1\n    \n    # Calculate maximum unidirectional pairs\n    max_uni = (n * (n - 1) // 2) - p\n    print(f\"{n} {max_uni}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Finding Minimum Nodes**: The code first checks if `p` is zero and handles it separately.
