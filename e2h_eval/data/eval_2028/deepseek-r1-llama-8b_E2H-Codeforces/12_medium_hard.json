The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, Xenia is in a city with houses arranged in a ring, right? She needs to do some tasks, and each task requires her to be at a specific house. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks.\n\nWait, the problem says that each task i must be done after all tasks j where j < i. So, for example, if her tasks are in the order a1, a2, ..., am, she has to handle them in that exact sequence. Or wait, no. Wait, the description says: \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" Oh, right, so she needs to process them in the order of their indices. So the first task is a1, then a2, etc., but each ai is the target house for task i. So the sequence is fixed as a1, a2, ..., am.\n\nBut wait, the input gives m integers a1, a2, ..., am. So the tasks are to visit each of these in the order given. So for each task i, she must reach ai, and then do any processing needed, and proceed to the next task.\n\nBut since the ring is circular, moving clockwise is the only allowed direction. So she starts at 1, and can only move clockwise around the ring.\n\nThe challenge is to find the minimal total time taken to go through all these tasks in order, possibly revisiting houses as needed.\n\nHmm, how to model this.\n\nLet me think about the movement between the tasks.\n\nEach task requires her to be at a certain house, but she might have to pass through several other houses in between.\n\nBut since the movement is along the ring, which is a cycle, the distance between two houses can be calculated in either direction. But because the traffic is one way (clockwise), the distance from A to B is the number of steps moving clockwise from A to B.\n\nWait, but the ring is circular, so for any two points A and B, there are two possible paths: the clockwise path and the counter-clockwise (which would be the other way around). But since the traffic is only allowed in one direction, she can't take the counter-clockwise path. So the distance is always the minimal steps moving clockwise.\n\nWait, no. Because the ring is a ring, the distance between A and B is min( (B - A) mod n, (A - B) mod n ), but since she can't go the other way, perhaps we need to calculate the shortest path in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, no. Because the ring is directed, the movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction. So the distance from A to B is (B - A) if B >= A, else (n - A + B). Because moving clockwise, you go from A to A+1, etc.\n\nWait, let's say n=4. The ring is 1->2->3->4->1. So the distance from 1 to 2 is 1 step, from 1 to 3 is 2 steps, from 1 to 4 is 3 steps, and from 1 to 1 is 0 steps.\n\nSimilarly, from 4 to 1, the distance is 3 steps (since you can't go counter-clockwise).\n\nSo the general formula for the distance from x to y is (y - x) % n, but since she can't go the other way, maybe not. Wait, no. Because (y - x) mod n could give a negative result if y < x. Wait, no, in Python, modulo is positive. So (y -x) mod n is correct.\n\nWait, for example, when x=4, y=1, n=4: (1-4) mod 4 is (-3) mod 4 = 1. Which is correct because she goes 4->1 in 1 step.\n\nYes, so the distance between x and y is (y - x) mod n. Because in the directed ring, moving clockwise, the minimal steps between x and y is (y-x) mod n.\n\nSo now, the plan is to model the movement between consecutive tasks.\n\nXenia starts at position 1. Then for each task i, she moves from the previous position to a_i, adding the required steps, and so on.\n\nWait, but the initial position is 1. Then for the first task, she has to go from 1 to a_1. For the second task, she's already at a_1, so she needs to go to a_2 from there. And so on until the last task.\n\nWait, but wait! No, that's not necessarily the case. Because perhaps a_1 is equal to a_2. In that case, she doesn't need to move. Or if a_2 is before a_1 in the ring, then she might have to loop around.\n\nWait, no. Because the movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction. So from a_1, she can't go back to a_2 if a_2 is earlier in the ring.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. The positions are arranged in a circle, and movement is strictly clockwise. So, for any two points x and y, the only path from x to y is along the clockwise direction. So the distance is (y - x) mod n.\n\nSo, for example, in the first test case, the tasks are 3, 2, 3.\n\nShe starts at 1. First task is 3. So she needs to go from 1 to 3, which is 2 steps. Then the second task is 2. From 3, moving clockwise, she can't go back. So she goes 3 ->4, then 4->1, then 1->2. So that's 3 steps. Then the third task is 3 again. From 2, moving clockwise, she goes 2->3, which is 1 step. So total steps: 2 + 3 +1 =6.\n\nWait, but that adds up correctly.\n\nSo the approach is to compute the sum of the distances between consecutive positions, considering that each step is from the current position to the next task's position.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n1. Sort the list of tasks, but wait, no. Because the tasks must be done in the order they are given. So the sequence is a1, a2, ..., am. So each step is from the current position to a_i.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the first test case is [3,2,3]. So the positions are 3, 2, 3.\n\nBut starting from 1, the first move is to 3, which is 2 steps.\n\nThen from 3 to 2: (2 -3) mod 4 is ( -1 ) mod4 = 3. So that's 3 steps.\n\nThen from 2 to 3: (3-2) mod4 =1.\n\nTotal steps: 2+3+1=6.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nIn the second test case, the input is 2,3,3. So the sequence is 2,3,3.\n\nFrom 1 to 2: 1 step.\n\nFrom 2 to 3: 1 step.\n\nFrom 3 to 3: 0 steps.\n\nTotal is 2 steps.\n\nWhich is the sample output.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Compute the cumulative steps by moving from the previous position to the current task's position, in the order of the tasks.\n\n- Sum all these steps.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\ncurrent_position = 1\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each task in a1, a2, ..., am:\n\n    distance = (task - current_position) % n\n\n    total_time += distance\n\n    current_position = task\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nWait, but wait: what about cases where the same task is repeated multiple times? Like in the second sample, the last two tasks are both 3. So from 3, moving to 3 takes 0 steps, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5, m=4, tasks are 5,5,5,5.\n\nShe starts at 1. Then:\n\n1 to 5: (5-1) mod5 =4 steps.\n\n5 to5: 0.\n\n5 to5: 0.\n\n5 to5: 0.\n\nTotal steps:4.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about a case where the next task is behind in the ring?\n\nLike n=5, m=3, tasks are 3,1,5.\n\nSo steps:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst task:3. (3-1)=2 mod5=2 steps.\n\nSecond task:1. (1-3) mod5= ( -2 ) mod5=3 steps.\n\nThird task:5. (5-1) mod5=4 steps.\n\nTotal: 2+3+4=9.\n\nSo that's the calculation.\n\nWait, but why 3 steps from 3 to 1? Because moving clockwise, she has to go 3→4→5→1, which is 3 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, the implementation.\n\nIn Python, read n and m, then read the list of a's.\n\nCompute the sum as per above.\n\nSo code structure:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntime = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    distance = (num - current) % n\n\n    time += distance\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(time)\n\nWait, that's it? It looks simple.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent=1\n\nfirst num is3: (3-1)=2 mod4=2. time=2. current=3.\n\nsecond num=2: (2-3) mod4= -1 mod4=3. time +=3 →5. current=2.\n\nthird num=3: (3-2)=1 mod4=1. time=6.\n\nOutput 6.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nfirst num=2: (2-1)=1 mod4=1. time=1. current=2.\n\nsecond num=3: (3-2)=1 mod4=1. time=2. current=3.\n\nthird num=3: (3-3)=0. time remains 2.\n\nSo output 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=4, a=[5,5,5,5]\n\nTime is (5-1) =4, then 0,0,0. Total 4.\n\nAnother test: n=5, m=3, a=[3,1,5].\n\nTime:\n\n1→3: 2 steps.\n\n3→1: (1-3) mod5=3.\n\n1→5:4 steps.\n\nTotal 9.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when the same position is hit multiple times?\n\nFor example, n=3, m=3, a=[2,3,2].\n\nSequence:\n\nStart at 1.\n\n1→2:1 step.\n\n2→3:1 step.\n\n3→2: (2-3) mod3=2 steps.\n\nTotal 4.\n\nIs that optimal? Let's see.\n\n1→2:1 step.\n\n2→3:1.\n\n3→2: moving clockwise, from 3 you can go 3→1→2, which is 2 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nSo I think this is the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks if she starts at house number 1 and moves clockwise around a ring of houses. Each task must be completed in the given order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to visit each specified house in the given order. The ring is directed, meaning she can only move clockwise. The distance between two houses `x` and `y` is calculated as `(y - x) % n`, which gives the shortest path in the clockwise direction.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each task, calculate the distance from her current position to the next required house. Sum these distances to get the total time.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the input values for `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks).\n   - Read the list of tasks.\n   - Initialize the current position at house 1 and the total time to 0.\n   - For each task, compute the distance from the current position to the task's house using modulo arithmetic, update the total time, and set the current position to the task's house.\n   - Output the total time after processing all tasks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent = 1\ntime = 0\nfor num in a:\n    distance = (num - current) % n\n    time += distance\n    current = num\nprint(time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first line reads `n` and `m`, followed by the list of tasks.\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with zero time.\n- **Processing Tasks**: For each task, calculate the clockwise distance from the current house to the task's house using modulo arithmetic. Update the total time and current position accordingly.\n- **Output**: Print the accumulated total time after all tasks are completed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging the properties of modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ring road.",
