For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of ways to choose c_s for each binary string s of length from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a beautiful multiset is. From the description, for every binary string s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix should not exceed c_s. Oh right, and the goal is to find how many ways we can choose these c_s values so that the largest possible beautiful multiset has size exactly f.\n\nSo, the approach here is probably to model this as some kind of dynamic programming problem, where we track the state based on the current choices of c_s and the constraints they impose on the multiset size.\n\nWait, but the problem involves all possible binary strings up to length n. That's a lot—2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^(n+1)-2 strings. For n=15, that's 32766, which is manageable, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the problem in terms of the trie structure of binary strings. Each node in the trie represents a certain prefix. The count of the multiset would then be determined by the number of leaves (or internal nodes) selected, but each selection must satisfy the c_s constraints.\n\nHmm, thinking about the trie: each node corresponds to a string s, and the number of times s can appear in the multiset is limited by c_s. But wait, no, because when you include a string t that is a longer version of s, it contributes to the count for s as well. So for example, if you have '00' and '000' in the multiset, both contribute to the count for '0'.\n\nSo, the key idea is that for each prefix s, the sum of the counts of all its superstrings t (where t starts with s) cannot exceed c_s.\n\nThis seems similar to building a trie and ensuring that for each node, the sum of its children plus itself (if it's a leaf) does not exceed c_s.\n\nWait, no. Because each occurrence of a string t contributes 1 to all of its prefixes. So, for each s, the total number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the number of times any string t that starts with s is present.\n\nSo, the condition is that for each s, the sum of the counts of all strings t that are extensions of s (including s itself) must be <= c_s.\n\nBut since the multiset is a collection of strings, each string contributes to all its prefixes. So, for the root node (empty string), it's the sum of all strings in the multiset. For each other node s, it's the sum of all its descendants in the trie.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to choosing c_s for each s, and then the maximum possible size of the multiset is f. We need to count the number of ways to choose the c_s such that this maximum is exactly f.\n\nWait, but how is f the maximum size? Oh right, because for each choice of c_s, we can compute the maximum possible size of the multiset. We need to count the number of c_s assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Enumerate all possible binary strings s of lengths 1..n.\n2. For each possible assignment of c_s, compute the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset.\n3. Count the number of such assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut enumerating all possible c_s assignments is impossible because k can be up to 2e5 and n up to 15, leading to 2^15 * 2e5 possibilities, which is way too big.\n\nSo, we need a smarter way. Maybe using dynamic programming or combinatorics.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. The constraints for each s are that the sum of the counts of all t that start with s must be <= c_s. But each string t contributes 1 to all of its prefixes, including itself.\n\nSo, the problem can be viewed as a tree where each node is a binary string s, and each edge represents adding a bit. Then, for each node s, the sum of the counts of all nodes in the subtree rooted at s (including s itself) must be <= c_s.\n\nThe maximum size of the multiset is the sum of all the counts of the leaves. Because each leaf contributes 1 to all its ancestors.\n\nWait, no. Because each leaf is a string, and when you include it, it contributes 1 to all of its prefixes. So the total size of the multiset is the sum of the counts of all leaves. Because each leaf is a unique string.\n\nWait, no, because the multiset is a set, so each string is counted once. So the total size is the number of distinct strings included in the multiset.\n\nWait, no. The multiset is a collection of strings, each appearing a certain number of times (but since it's a multiset, it's just a count). Wait, but the problem says \"multiset of binary strings\", so each string can appear multiple times. But in our case, each string is considered as a unique element, but when you add a string t, it contributes 1 to all its prefixes s. So the total number of elements in the multiset is the sum of all the counts of the strings. But since each string is a unique element, each string can be chosen any number of times, but the count for each string is how many times it's included.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nEach string s is a member of the multiset, possibly multiple times. For each s, the number of times it's present in the multiset is c_s. Wait, no. Because the c_s is the maximum allowed for the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. So for each s, the sum over all t that start with s of the count of t in the multiset must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, no. Because for each s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is the sum of the counts of all t that are in the multiset and have s as a prefix. So for example, if s is \"0\", and the multiset includes \"0\", \"00\", \"000\", etc., each contributes 1 to the count for s.\n\nThus, for each s, the sum of the counts of all t that are in the multiset and are extensions of s (including s itself) must be <= c_s.\n\nSo, the constraints are for each s: sum_{t in S, t starts with s} (count_t) <= c_s.\n\nOur goal is to maximize the total size of the multiset, which is the sum of count_t for all t in S (each t is a unique string, but the count is how many times it's included). But the counts are constrained by the c_s's.\n\nWait, no. Because each string t can be included multiple times. So the total size is the sum of count_t for all t.\n\nBut for each s, the sum of count_t for all t in the multiset where t is a prefix of s must be <= c_s.\n\nWait, no: for each s, the sum of count_t for all t that have s as a prefix is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. So that sum must be <= c_s.\n\nSo, the problem is to assign counts to each string t, such that for each s, the sum of count_t for t in the multiset where s is a prefix of t is <= c_s.\n\nBut since the multiset can include any number of each string, the constraints form a system of inequalities that must be satisfied.\n\nTo find the maximum possible size of the multiset, given the c_s's, we need to maximize the sum of count_t for all t, subject to the constraints that for each s, sum_{t in S, s is prefix of t} count_t <= c_s.\n\nThis looks like a linear programming problem, but with integer variables.\n\nBut considering that the variables are count_t for each t, and the constraints are sum_{t in T(s)} count_t <= c_s for each s, where T(s) is the set of all t that have s as a prefix.\n\nWe need to find the maximum sum of count_t, and then count the number of c_s assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut solving this for each possible c_s assignment is computationally infeasible.\n\nAlternative approach: Find a way to represent the constraints and the objective function in a way that allows us to compute the maximum for a given c_s assignment, and then find the number of c_s assignments that achieve a maximum of exactly f.\n\nBut even that seems challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible size is determined by the minimal c_s along all possible paths in the trie.\n\nHmm, another thought: the maximum possible size is the sum over all s of min(c_s, 1), but that's not correct because a single string contributes to multiple c_s's.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as building a trie and finding for each node s the maximum number of times we can take its children, plus itself, without exceeding c_s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: The problem is equivalent to selecting a subset of the possible strings (allowing multiple copies) such that for each s, the number of strings in the subset that have s as a prefix is at most c_s. The goal is to find the number of c_s assignments where the maximum possible subset size is exactly f.\n\nBut again, it's unclear how to proceed.\n\nLet's think about the problem in terms of the trie structure. Each node s in the trie has a certain depth, and the constraints on c_s affect how many strings can be taken under it.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node s, the maximum number of strings that can be chosen under s is c_s, but this includes all its descendants. So, for each node s, the sum of the counts of all its descendants (including itself) must be <= c_s.\n\nIn this case, the maximum size is the sum of the counts of the leaves, but each leaf's count is bounded by the minimum of c_s along the path from the root to the leaf.\n\nWait, no. Because each leaf's count is also part of the counts for all its ancestor nodes. So for a leaf t, its count can't exceed the c_s of its parent, grandparent, etc., all the way up to the root.\n\nSo, the maximum possible count for t is the minimum of c_s along the path from the root to t.\n\nBut then, the total maximum size would be the sum of min(c_0, c_{t}, c_{t'}, ...) for each leaf t, where t' are the prefixes of t.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the case. Let me consider an example.\n\nSuppose we have a trie where the root is s0, and the children are s01 and s10. Suppose c0 is 3, c01 is 2, c10 is 3, and the leaves are 01, 10, 11.\n\nWait, maybe the example given in the problem statement can help.\n\nIn the example given, the c_s values are such that the maximum beautiful multiset is {11, 01, 00, 01}. So, the count for 0 is 3 (because 0, 00, 01, 01 are in the multiset?), but wait, the actual count for 0 is the number of strings in the multiset that have 0 as a prefix. In the sample, the multiset includes 00, 01, 01. So for s=0, the sum is 3 (since 00 contributes 1, 01 contributes twice). So c0 is 3, which is >=3, which is okay.\n\nSo, for each node s, the sum of the counts of all t that have s as a prefix is <= c_s.\n\nSo, the maximum size is the sum of all the counts of the leaves, but each count is constrained by the c_s of their ancestors.\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps we can model this as a tree where each node's contribution is limited by the minimal c_s along the path from the root to it.\n\nWait, maybe each node s can have a value a_s, which is the maximum number of times the strings under s can be included. Then, a_s is the minimum of c_s and the a values of all its children.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, for each node s, a_s is the maximum number of times any string under s can be included. Then, a_s = min(c_s, a_{s0}, a_{s1}), where s0 and s1 are the children.\n\nBecause if s has two children, s0 and s1, then the number of strings under s is the sum of the a values of s0 and s1. But the sum of the a values of s0 and s1 must be <= a_s. And a_s is the minimum of c_s and the a values of its children.\n\nWait, I'm getting somewhere. Because for each node s, the a_s must be <= c_s, and a_s must be <= a_{child} for all children, because the a_child represents the maximum number of strings that can be included under that child. If a_child is smaller than a_s, then the sum of the child's a values will be limited by a_child, thus ensuring that the sum under s is <= a_s.\n\nWait, perhaps the a_s can be computed as follows:\n\na_s = min(c_s, a_{s0}, a_{s1}, ...)\n\nwhere s0, s1, etc. are the immediate children of s.\n\nThen, the total maximum size is the sum of a_s for all leaves s.\n\nBecause each leaf s contributes a_s to the total.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to assigning a_s for each node s, such that a_s = min(c_s, a_{children of s}), and the sum of a_s for all leaves is exactly f.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, we're given that the maximum possible size is exactly f. So, for each possible c_s assignment, we can compute the maximum possible multiset size by computing the sum of a_s for leaves, where a_s is as defined above.\n\nAnd we need to count the number of c_s assignments where this sum equals f.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Generate all binary strings of length 1 to n. Each string is a node in the trie.\n\n2. For each possible c_s assignment, compute a_s for each node as min(c_s, a_children).\n\n3. Compute the sum of a_s for all leaves. If this sum is equal to f, count this assignment.\n\n4. Sum all such valid assignments.\n\nBut this is computationally impossible because the number of possible c_s assignments is enormous.\n\nSo, we need a way to model this problem such that we can efficiently count the number of c_s assignments that lead to a sum of f.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this as a DP over the trie nodes, tracking for each node the possible a_s values, and the constraints on c_s.\n\nWait, but the a_s depends on the c_s and the a values of the children. So, for each node, a_s is the minimum of c_s and the a values of its children. So, for a node s, a_s can be any value between 0 and min(c_s, min(children_a)).\n\nBut how do we model this for the entire trie?\n\nPerhaps the key insight is that the a_s for each node is determined by its c_s and the a values of its children. So, the a_s can be thought of as the product of the constraints along the path.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node, a_s can be any value from 0 up to the minimum of c_s and the a values of its children. So, for the root node, a_0 is min(c_0, a_1, a_2, ...), assuming it has children 0 and 1.\n\nWait, but the root node is the empty string, which is a prefix of all strings. So, the sum of all the a values of the leaves must be <= a_0.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the a_0 is the sum of all a values of the leaves, but this can't be right because a_0 is the minimum of c_0 and its children's a values.\n\nWait, perhaps the a_0 is the maximum possible sum of the a values of the leaves, but constrained by c_0.\n\nNo, because a_0 is the minimum of c_0 and the a values of its children.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way to model this is to process the trie in a bottom-up manner. Starting from the leaves, which have no children, their a value is min(c_s, ...) which, since they have no children, a_s = min(c_s). Then, moving up the tree, for each non-leaf node s, a_s is the minimum between c_s and the a values of all its children.\n\nOnce all a_s are computed, the sum of the a values of the leaves is the maximum possible size of the multiset.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to choosing c_s for each node s, such that the sum of the a values of the leaves is exactly f, and then counting the number of such c_s assignments.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- For each node s, a_s is determined by c_s and the a values of its children.\n\n- The sum of a_s for leaves is the target f.\n\nThus, the problem becomes: assign c_s to each node s, then compute a_s as the min of c_s and the a values of its children, and the sum of the a_s of leaves is f.\n\nWe need to count the number of such c_s assignments.\n\nNow, the challenge is to model this in a way that allows us to compute the number of valid c_s assignments efficiently.\n\nGiven that n is up to 15, the number of nodes is 2^(n+1) - 2, which is manageable for n=15 as 32766 nodes. But since k can be up to 2e5 and f up to 2e5, we need a way to handle this without iterating through all possibilities.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming, where for each node, we track the possible a_s values and their contributions to the sum.\n\nWait, let's model this recursively. For each node s, its a_s can be any value between 0 and min(c_s, min of a_children). So, for each node, the a_s is determined by c_s and the a_children.\n\nThus, the sum of the a_s of the leaves is the sum of a_s for each leaf.\n\nSo, perhaps we can perform a post-order traversal of the trie, starting from the leaves and moving up to the root.\n\nAt each node s, we can keep track of the possible a_s values and the sum contributed by the subtrees under s.\n\nWait, yes. Because for each node s, the sum of its own a_s and the sum of its children's a_s is important. But wait, no: the sum of the a_s of the leaves is the total, so for a non-leaf node s, the sum contributed by s is the sum of a_s for its leaves. But for a non-leaf node, the a_s is the minimum of c_s and the a values of its children.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum contributed by a node s is the sum of a_t for all leaves t that are in the subtree of s. Because for each such t, their a_t contributes to the total sum.\n\nSo, for a node s, the sum of a_t for leaves in its subtree is equal to the sum of a_s multiplied by the number of leaves in the subtree if s is a leaf, otherwise the sum of the a_t of the leaves in the subtrees of its children.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no. Because for a non-leaf node s, the a_s is determined by c_s and the a_children. Once a_s is fixed, the sum of the a_t for the leaves in the subtree of s is the sum of the a_t of each leaf in each child's subtree. Because a_s is a constraint that may limit the a_children, but the a_children could be less than or equal to a_s.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum for s is the sum of the sums of its children, but each child's sum is the sum of a_t for its leaves, but a_t can't exceed a_child, which is min(c_child, a_children).\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too abstract. Let's think differently.\n\nEach node s has a certain number of leaves in its subtree. The sum of a_t for those leaves is the total contribution to the overall sum from the subtree of s.\n\nFor a leaf node s, the sum is a_s.\n\nFor a non-leaf node s, the sum is the sum of the sums of each child's subtree.\n\nBut wait, no. Because for a non-leaf node s, the a_s is determined by c_s and the a_children. So, a_s can't be larger than the minimum of c_s and the a_children of s.\n\nThus, for a non-leaf node s, the sum of its subtree is the sum of the sum of each child's subtree, but each child's a_t is the minimum of c_child and the a_grandchildren.\n\nBut this seems recursive and difficult to model.\n\nAnother approach: Since the a_s is determined by c_s and the a_children, perhaps for each node s, the a_s can be any value between 0 and the minimum of c_s and the a_children.\n\nBut this seems like a tree of dependencies, making it hard to model.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this with memoization. For each node s, and for each possible a_s, compute the number of ways to assign c_s and the c values of the children such that a_s is as specified.\n\nThis way, for each node, we can keep track of the possible a_s values and the number of ways to achieve them, considering the constraints from the children.\n\nSo, the idea is:\n\n- For each node s, during a post-order traversal, we calculate the number of ways to assign c_s and the c values of its children such that the a_s is a particular value.\n\n- Then, for each possible a_s, we accumulate the number of ways.\n\nThis sounds promising.\n\nLet's formalize this.\n\nFor each node s, we'll define a function dp[s][a], which represents the number of ways to assign the c values for s and its children such that the a_s is exactly a.\n\nThe base case is for a leaf node. For a leaf s:\n\n- a_s must be min(c_s, 1) because a leaf has no children, so a_s = min(c_s, ...) which is just c_s.\n\nWait, no. For a leaf s, a_s is min(c_s, a_children). But since s is a leaf, it has no children, so a_s = c_s.\n\nWait, but for a leaf, the a_s is min(c_s, a_children) where a_children is the a values of the children. But since it's a leaf, it has no children, so a_children is zero. So a_s = min(c_s, 0). Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. For a node s, a_s is the minimum of c_s and the a values of its children. So, if s is a leaf, it has no children, so the minimum is over an empty set. What's the minimum of an empty set?\n\nAh, that's undefined. So perhaps for a leaf node s, a_s is simply c_s, because there are no children to constrain it. Because the a_s for a leaf is min(c_s, a_children), but since a_children is zero (no children), perhaps a_s = c_s.\n\nYes, because for a leaf node s, the a_s is the minimum of c_s and the a_children. But since a_children is the a values of the children, which for a leaf is none, the min is taken over an empty list, which is typically considered as infinity. So, a_s is min(c_s, infinity) = c_s.\n\nSo, for a leaf node s:\n\na_s = c_s.\n\nThus, the dp for a leaf node s is:\n\ndp[s][a] = 1 if a == c_s, else 0.\n\nWait, no. Because for a leaf node s, the c_s can be any value between 0 and k. So, for each possible c_s, a_s is c_s, and for each a, dp[s][a] is the number of ways to choose c_s such that a_s = a.\n\nSo, for a leaf node s:\n\ndp[s][a] = 1 if 0 <= a <=k, else 0.\n\nWait, but in reality, for a leaf s, a can be any value between 0 and k. So, for each a in 0..k, dp[s][a] = 1.\n\nBut wait, no. Because for a leaf node s, a_s is exactly c_s. So, for each a in 0..k, there's exactly one way to choose c_s = a, hence dp[s][a] = 1.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nFor a non-leaf node s, which has children s0, s1, ..., sm:\n\na_s = min(c_s, a_{s0}, a_{s1}, ..., a_{sm}).\n\nWe need to find, for each possible a_s, the number of ways to choose c_s and the c values for the children such that a_s is this value.\n\nSo, for a non-leaf node s, and for a given a_s = a, the constraints are:\n\nc_s >= a (because a_s = min(c_s, a_children) = a implies c_s >= a).\n\nAnd for each child si, a_{si} must be >= a (since a_s = min(c_s, a_si, ...) = a, so each a_si >= a).\n\nWait, no. Because a_s is min(c_s, a_children). So, a_s is the minimum of c_s and the a values of the children. So, for a_s to be a, it's necessary that c_s >= a, and each a_child >= a.\n\nBecause if c_s were less than a, then a_s would be less than a, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, no. If c_s is less than a, then a_s is min(c_s, a_children). So, if any a_child is less than c_s, then a_s would be min(c_s, a_child). But this complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to express the condition for a_s = a as:\n\nc_s >= a\n\nAND\n\nfor all children si of s: a_si >= a\n\nBecause a_s is the minimum of c_s and all a_si. So, a_s is the smallest among these values. So, for a_s to be a, at least one of the a_si must be a, and c_s must be >= a.\n\nWait, not necessarily. Because the minimum could be a if either c_s is a or one of the a_si is a.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose s has two children, s0 and s1. Suppose a_s0 is 3, a_s1 is 5, and c_s is 4. Then, a_s is min(4,3,5) =3. So, a_s is 3, which is less than c_s.\n\nSo, in this case, a_s is 3, which is the minimum of c_s (4) and a_children (3 and 5). So, to have a_s = a, it's necessary that min(c_s, a_children) = a.\n\nWhich requires that at least one of c_s or the a_children is a, and all others are >= a.\n\nWait, no. Because if c_s is greater than a, but some a_child is less than a, then a_s would be less than a, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, to have a_s = a, it's necessary that:\n\nEither:\n\n- c_s = a and all a_children >= a.\n\nOR\n\n- c_s > a, but at least one a_child is a, and all other a_children >= a.\n\nBecause if c_s > a and some a_child < a, then a_s would be min(c_s, a_child) = a_child < a, which would make a_s < a, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, for a_s to be exactly a, the following must hold:\n\nEither:\n\nCase 1: c_s = a, and all a_children >= a.\n\nOR\n\nCase 2: c_s > a, and at least one a_child is a, and all other a_children >= a.\n\nThis is getting complicated, but perhaps we can model this with inclusion-exclusion.\n\nBut how to translate this into DP transitions.\n\nLet's think about the DP for a non-leaf node s.\n\nWe want to compute dp[s][a], which is the number of ways to assign c_s and the c values of the children such that a_s = a.\n\nAs per the above, a_s can be achieved in two cases.\n\nSo, for each a, dp[s][a] is the sum of two terms:\n\nterm1: c_s = a, and all children have a_child >= a.\n\nterm2: c_s > a, and at least one child has a_child = a, and all other children have a_child >= a.\n\nBut since the children are processed before s, we can compute these terms based on the dp of the children.\n\nHmm, but how to model term2.\n\nTerm2 requires that at least one child has a_child = a, and others >= a.\n\nThis can be handled by inclusion-exclusion over the children.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each child, we can precompute the number of ways where a_child >= a, and at least one has a_child = a.\n\nWait, perhaps for term2, it's the number of ways where c_s > a, and for each child, a_child >= a, and at least one child has a_child = a.\n\nBut since a_child is determined by the c values of the children, which are independent, perhaps we can model this as follows.\n\nFor term1: c_s = a, and for each child, a_child >= a.\n\nThe number of ways for term1 is:\n\nsum_{all subsets of children} [product of the number of ways for each child to have a_child >= a] multiplied by [the number of ways to choose c_s = a].\n\nBut since c_s can be any value >= a, but in term1, c_s is exactly a, the number of ways for c_s is 1 (only c_s = a is allowed).\n\nWait, no: for term1, c_s must be a, because a_s is min(c_s, a_children) = a.\n\nSo, the number of ways for term1 is the product of the number of ways for each child to have a_child >= a, multiplied by 1 (for c_s = a).\n\nWait, but the product is over all children, so for each child, the a_child can be any value >= a.\n\nSo, for each child, the number of ways to have a_child >= a is the sum of dp[child][b] for b >= a.\n\nSo, term1 is:\n\nways_for_c_s = 1 (since c_s = a)\nways_for_children = product for each child (sum_{b >= a} dp[child][b])\nterm1 = ways_for_c_s * ways_for_children\n\nFor term2: c_s > a, and at least one child has a_child = a, and all other children have a_child >= a.\n\nThe number of ways for term2 is:\n\nways_for_c_s = sum_{d = a+1 to k} 1 (since c_s can be any value >a)\nways_for_children: exactly one child has a_child = a, others have a_child >= a.\n\nBut this seems tricky because for each child, we'd have to consider whether it's the one that contributes a_child = a, and the others have a_child >= a.\n\nSo, for term2, the number of ways is:\n\nsum over all children s_i:\n[ (number of ways where s_i has a_i = a and others have a_j >=a ) ] * [ sum_{d >a} 1 ] \n\nBut for each s_i, the number of ways where s_i has a_i = a and others have a_j >=a is:\n\nprod_{j != i} (sum_{b >= a} dp[j][b]) ) * dp[i][a]\n\nThen, for each such i, multiply by the sum of d >a for c_s (which is (k - a)), and sum over all i.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\ndp[s][a] = term1 + term2.\n\nWhere:\n\nterm1 = (sum over children j: (sum_{b >=a} dp[j][b]))^m * 1, where m is the number of children.\n\nWait, no. Because for term1, c_s is exactly a, and each child must have a_j >=a. So, for each child, the number of ways is the sum of dp[j][b] for b >=a.\n\nThus, term1 is (product of (sum_{b >=a} dp[j][b]) for all children j) ) * 1.\n\nTerm2 is sum over all children i of [ (sum_{b >=a} dp[j][b]) for j !=i ) * (sum_{b =a} dp[i][b}) ) ] multiplied by (k - a).\n\nBecause for term2, c_s can be any value >a, which is (k - a) options.\n\nWait, no: the number of ways for c_s >a is (k - a) because c_s can be a+1, a+2, ..., k.\n\nSo, term2 is:\n\nsum_{i=1 to m} [ (product_{j !=i} (sum_{b >=a} dp[j][b})) * dp[i][a] ) ] * (k - a).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for each node s, during the post-order traversal, we compute dp[s][a] for all a from 0 to k.\n\nOnce we've processed all nodes, the root node's a_0 is the sum of all a_s for leaves in its subtree, which is the same as the sum of a_s for all leaves in the trie.\n\nWait, no. Because the root node's a_0 is the minimum of c_0 and the a_values of its children.\n\nBut the sum of a_s for all leaves is exactly the maximum size of the multiset, which we need to equal f.\n\nSo, after computing dp[root][f], we can get the total number of valid c_s assignments.\n\nWait, but wait: the sum of a_s for all leaves is f only if a_0 is >= f, because the a_0 is the minimum of c_0 and the a_children. But wait, the a_0 is the maximum possible a for the root, which is min(c_0, a_children).\n\nSo, for the sum to be f, a_0 must be >= f, and the sum of the leaves' a_s must be f.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum of the a_s for leaves is exactly the maximum size of the multiset. So, we need this sum to be f.\n\nBut a_0 can be any value >= f, but the sum must be exactly f.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum is f regardless of a_0, but a_0 must be >= f.\n\nNo, because a_0 is the minimum of c_0 and the a_children. So, the sum of the leaves' a_s is the sum of a_s for each leaf, which is also the sum of the a values of the leaves, which is the maximum possible size.\n\nSo, to have the maximum size equal to f, the sum of a_s for leaves must be exactly f.\n\nBut a_0 must be >= f, because a_0 is the minimum of c_0 and a_children. So, if a_0 < f, then the sum would be <= a_0, which is less than f, which can't happen. So, a_0 must be >= f.\n\nSo, in the DP, after processing the root, the number of ways where the sum of leaves is f is the sum of dp[root][a] for all a >= f, multiplied by the number of ways to have the sum of leaves equal to f.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum of leaves is exactly f. So, the root's a_0 must be >= f, and the sum of the leaves' a_s must be exactly f.\n\nWait, but the sum of the leaves' a_s is determined by the a_s of the leaves, which are determined by their respective c_s and children.\n\nSo, the sum is a function of the a_s of the leaves, which are determined by their c_s and their children.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial approach was wrong in trying to model the sum for each node. Because for each node, the a_s is determined by c_s and children, but the sum of the leaves' a_s is not directly tracked.\n\nThus, perhaps the DP approach is not sufficient.\n\nAn alternative idea: Since the sum of the a_s of the leaves is exactly f, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the contribution of each node to this sum.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum of the a_s of the leaves is the same as the sum of all the a values for the nodes that are leaves. So, for the root node, the sum is the sum of a_s for all leaves.\n\nThus, for the root node, the sum is the sum of a_s for leaves.\n\nSo, in the DP, for each node, we need to track not just a_s, but also the sum of a_t for leaves in its subtree.\n\nBut that's adding another dimension to the DP state, which increases the computational complexity.\n\nBut for n=15, the number of nodes is manageable",
