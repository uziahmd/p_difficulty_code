There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a tennis tournament where players are eliminated in each game, and the tournament grid isn't fixed yet. But there's a specific rule: two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. My task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in.\n\nHmm, right. So the winner needs to play as many games as possible, but each time he plays, the opponent must have a similar number of prior games. Let's think about how the tournament can be structured to maximize this.\n\nLet's start with small examples. For n=2, there's only one game. So the answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. Like, first he plays someone, then in the next round plays someone else. Wait, no, wait: the tournament is a knockout, so each game eliminates one player. So for 3 players, it's two rounds? Or perhaps not. Wait, no. In a knockout tournament with 3 players, the structure is such that one player gets a bye in the first round, then plays in the second. So for example, the initial bracket could be:\n\nRound 1: A vs B, C gets a bye.\nThen Round 2: Winner of A vs B (say A) plays C.\n\nSo the winner (A) has played two games.\n\nSimilarly, for n=4, the maximum games would be 2. Because the winner can't play more than two games without violating the rule. For example, after two wins, the next opponent would need to have either one or two games played. But in a 4-player tournament, maybe the structure allows the winner to play three times?\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me think again. For n=4, the maximum number of games the winner can play is 3? Or is it 2? Wait, in the sample given, when n=10, the output is 4. Hmm, that suggests that for some larger n, the maximum can be higher.\n\nWait, let's look at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input: ['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\nSample Output: ['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\nSo for n=10, the maximum is 4 games. How is that achieved?\n\nThe note explains that for n=4, the maximum is 2 games. Because the winner can't play all 3 players since after playing two games, the third opponent would have to have played one or two games, but perhaps it's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of games is determined by the Fibonacci sequence. Because the problem seems to model a scenario where each new opponent can be added by having a certain number of games played, which adds up in a Fibonacci-like way.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. Suppose f(k) is the maximum number of games a player can play if they have beaten k opponents. Each new opponent requires that the previous steps allow for the opponent to have a similar number of games.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum number of games is the largest m such that the sum of the first m Fibonacci numbers is less than or equal to n-1. Because each game adds another player, but the way they're arranged depends on their previous games.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of games is the largest m where F(m+2) <= n. Because the Fibonacci sequence starts with F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, etc.\n\nLet me see. Let's take n=2: the maximum is 1. The sum would be F(3) = 2, which is equal to n. So m is 1.\n\nn=3: F(4)=3. So m is 2.\n\nn=4: F(5)=5>4, so we look for F(4)=3<=4. So m=2.\n\nn=10: F(6)=8<=10, F(7)=13>10. So m=4 because F(6)=8, which is less than 10, but wait, what's the relation between m and the maximum games.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum number of games is m such that F(m+2) <= n < F(m+3). Then the maximum games is m.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nFor n=2: F(3)=2, so m=1.\n\nn=3: F(4)=3, m=2.\n\nn=4: F(5)=5>4. So m is the largest where F(m+2)<=4. F(4)=3, F(5)=5. So m=2.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought for n=10, the output is 4. Let's see.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the maximum number of games the winner can play follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Each time the winner plays a game, they eliminate an opponent, and the next opponent must have played either the same number or one less game than the winner. This leads us to consider the Fibonacci sequence where each term represents the cumulative number of players that can be accommodated with the winner playing that many games.\n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Generating Fibonacci numbers until the sum exceeds the number of players.\n2. Determining the largest Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to the number of players, which gives the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef max_games(n):\n    fib = [0, 1]\n    while True:\n        next_fib = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n        if next_fib > n:\n            break\n        fib.append(next_fib)\n    m = len(fib) - 2  # Because the first two are 0 and 1\n    return m - 1\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(max_games(n))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Generation**: We start with the initial Fibonacci numbers 0 and 1. Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two until the sum exceeds the number of players `n`.\n2. **Determine Maximum Games**: The length of the generated Fibonacci sequence minus 2 gives the index, which corresponds to the maximum number of games the winner can play. This is because each Fibonacci number at position `i` represents the maximum number of players that can be accommodated with the winner playing `i-1` games.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limit of input size.",
