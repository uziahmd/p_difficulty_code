He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Check the string,\" and from the description, it seems like we have to verify if a given string meets certain conditions based on how it was built by three friends—A, B, and C.\n\nHmm. Let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, the process is: A creates a string with some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's to the end. Then C appends some 'c's. But here's the catch: C must append a number of 'c's equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before he adds his part. Also, the order of the letters must be strictly a's followed by b's followed by c's. Oh right, because each friend appends their letters at the end.\n\nThe task is, given a string S, determine whether it could have been formed through this process.\n\nAlright, so the steps to check are:\n\n1. The string must consist of a sequence of a's, followed by a sequence of b's, followed by a sequence of c's. So any other order (like a's, then c's, then b's) would immediately make it invalid.\n\n2. After ensuring the order, we need to count the number of a's (count_a), b's (count_b), and c's (count_c).\n\n3. The count_c must be equal to either count_a or count_b. It can be equal to both, but it has to match at least one of them.\n\nWait, but wait—the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or to the number of 'b's. So count_c must be equal to count_a OR count_b.\n\nBut also, since C appends after B, the string must have a's first, then b's, then c's. So any other order, like a mix, makes it invalid.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Check the structure of the string first. Split it into runs of a's, then b's, then c's. If any other order exists, return NO.\n\n- Then, count each group. Let's say count_a is the number of a's, count_b the b's, count_c the c's.\n\n- Then, check if count_c is equal to count_a OR count_b.\n\nIf both conditions are satisfied, output YES; else, NO.\n\nBut wait, the problem also says that the string must have at least one a and one b. Because A and B made sure of that. So the string cannot have zero a's or zero b's. Wait, but let's look at the note in the problem statement.\n\nIn the note, it says: since both A and B like the characters, they made sure that at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string. So the string passed to C will have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Therefore, the input string S must also have at least one 'a' and one 'b'; otherwise, it's automatically invalid.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem statement says that the string could have been built as per the process, which requires that after B's step, there is at least one a and one b. So in the input string, it's possible that after B appends, the string has a's and b's. But if someone gives an input with, say, only a's and c's, that would not satisfy the condition because B didn't add any b's.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"they have made sure that at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.\" So the string given to C must have at least one of each. So for the input string S, it must have at least one 'a' and one 'b', because otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nWait, no. Because if the string is 'abc', then it's allowed. Because after A adds 'a's, B adds 'b's, and C adds 'c's. So the initial string from A is 'a', B adds 'b' making 'ab', then C adds 'c's. So for C, the count_c is 1, which equals count_a (1). So that's valid.\n\nBut if the input is 'ac', then the structure is incorrect. Because after a's comes c's, which isn't allowed. Or if it's 'aabbbc', that's okay.\n\nWait, but the structure is the first thing to check. So let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Check that the string is in the form of all a's, followed by all b's, followed by all c's. Any interleaving or different order is invalid.\n\n   For example, 'abac' is invalid because the a's are not contiguous.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order. The string must follow the structure where 'a's come first, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check the Structure**: The string must be composed of contiguous runs of 'a's, followed by contiguous runs of 'b's, and ending with contiguous runs of 'c's. Any other interleaving of these characters is invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: After confirming the correct structure, count the occurrences of each character ('a', 'b', 'c').\n3. **Validate Counts**: Ensure that the count of 'c's is equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's. Additionally, ensure that the string contains at least one 'a' and one 'b' as required by the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef check_string(s):\n    # Check if the string is in the form a^+ b^+ c^+\n    parts = []\n    current_char = None\n    for c in s:\n        if c == current_char:\n            continue\n        else:\n            if current_char is not None and current_char != c:\n                return False\n            current_char = c\n    if current_char != 'c':\n        return False\n\n    # Now count the a's, b's, c's\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n\n    # Check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        # Also, ensure that count_a >=1 and count_b >=1\n        if count_a > 0 and count_b > 0:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ns = input().strip()\nif check_string(s):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution first checks the structure of the string to ensure it follows the sequence 'a's -> 'b's -> 'c's without any interleaving. It then counts the occurrences of each character and verifies that the number of 'c's matches either the number of 'a's or 'b's. Finally, it ensures that there is at least one 'a' and one 'b' in the string before confirming it as valid. This approach efficiently handles the constraints and checks all necessary conditions to determine the validity of the string.",
