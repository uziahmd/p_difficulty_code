            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Guard Duty (easy)\n\nThe Rebel fleet is afraid that the Empire might want to strike back again. Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Guard Duty,\" and from the description, I understand that we need to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases in such a way that each base has exactly one guardian, each spaceship also has exactly one assigned base (so it's a perfect matching), and importantly, no two paths between a base and its spaceship intersect. \n\nHmm, right, the key here is that the paths shouldn't intersect. So each path is a straight line from the base to the spaceship, and these lines must not cross each other. So the challenge is to find if there's a way to pair the R spaceships with B bases so that all these conditions are satisfied.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Since R and B are both up to 10, which isn't too big, maybe a brute-force approach is feasible. But wait, the constraints also mention that no three points are colinear, so that's helpful because it avoids some edge cases where multiple points lie on the same line.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input: R and B, then read R spaceship coordinates, followed by B base coordinates.\n2. Generate all possible perfect matchings between the R spaceships and B bases. Since R equals B (because it's a perfect matching), each spaceship is matched to exactly one base and vice versa.\n3. For each matching, check two things:\n   a. That every base is assigned to exactly one spaceship.\n   b. That none of the connecting lines between a base and its assigned spaceship intersect with any others.\n4. If any matching satisfies both conditions, output 'Yes'. Otherwise, output 'No'.\n\nWait, but wait—R and B might not be equal? Oh, no, because the problem says it's a perfect matching, so R must equal B. Because a perfect matching is a bijection between two sets of the same size. So in the input, R and B are given, but for a perfect matching, R must equal B. So perhaps the first step is to check if R equals B. Because otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: It says \"it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases.\" But for a perfect matching, the numbers must be equal. So if R != B, then it's automatically 'No'. So the first thing I should do is check if R == B. If not, output 'No'.\n\nOh right, that's an important point. So in the code, the first condition is if R != B, then immediately return 'No'.\n\nNow, assuming R equals B, the next step is to generate all possible permutations of the bases, assigning each to a spaceship. Since the order matters (each permutation represents a different assignment), we can loop through all possible permutations of the bases.\n\nBut wait, since the bases are given as a list, each permutation is a possible matching. For each permutation, we can create pairs (base_i, spaceship_i) for each i.\n\nOnce we have a permutation, we need to check two things:\n\na) Are the paths non-intersecting? Or more precisely, the lines between the bases and their assigned spaceships do not cross each other.\n\nHow to check for line intersections. Since the lines are between a base and a spaceship, and each line is a straight path, we need to make sure that for any two lines, they don't cross.\n\nAn alternative way to think about it: the arrangement of the lines must form a planar embedding where no two edges cross. So the graph formed by the matching should be a non-crossing perfect matching.\n\nWait, but how to compute that. Let's think: for each pair of lines (from base A to space X and base B to space Y), determine if they intersect. If any pair does, then the matching is invalid.\n\nSo for a given permutation of bases, we can loop through all possible pairs of lines (i,j), i < j, and check if line i and line j intersect. If any pair intersects, the permutation is invalid.\n\nIf all pairs are non-intersecting, then this permutation is a valid solution, so we can output 'Yes'.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Check if R != B; if so, output 'No'.\n- Else, for all possible permutations of B bases (since each permutation represents a possible assignment to the R spaceships), do:\n   - For each permutation, create the list of pairs (space_i, base_j) based on the permutation.\n   - Then, for each pair of lines in this permutation, check if they intersect.\n   - If any pair intersects, skip to the next permutation.\n   - If none intersect, then return 'Yes' as a solution exists.\n- After checking all permutations, if none work, return 'No'.\n\nWait, but wait. The permutation is of the bases, and each base is assigned",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. Additionally, the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Perfect Matching**: First, check if the number of Rebel spaceships (R) equals the number of bases (B). If they are not equal, output \"No\" immediately because a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: For each permutation of the B bases, represent the assignment of spaceships to bases. Each permutation corresponds to a unique way of assigning spaceships to bases.\n3. **Check for Non-Intersecting Paths**: For each permutation, create pairs of lines between each base and its assigned spaceship. Check if any pair of these lines intersects. If no lines intersect for any permutation, output \"Yes\". If all permutations fail this check, output \"No\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef readints():\n    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nR, B = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nspaceships = [tuple(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())) for _ in range(R)]\nbases = [tuple(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())) for _ in range(B)]\n\nif R != B:\n    print(\"No\")\n    sys.exit()\n\nfor perm in permutations(bases):\n    # Assign each base in perm to a spaceship in order\n    match = []\n    for i in range(R):\n        match.append((spaceships[i], perm[i]))\n    \n    # Now check all pairs of lines for intersection\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(len(match)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(match)):\n            line1 = match[i]\n            line2 = match[j]\n            \n            # Check if the two lines intersect\n            x1, y1 = line1\n            x2, y2 = line2\n            \n            x3, y3 = bases[perm.index(line2[1])]\n            x4, y4 = bases[perm.index(line1[1])]\n            \n            # Compute the cross product to check if the lines intersect\n            # The cross product of vectors AB and CD is (B - A) × (D - C)\n            # If it's non-zero, lines intersect.\n            cross = (x2 - x1)*(y3 - y1) - (y2 - y1)*(x3 - x1)\n            if cross != 0:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n    if valid:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"No\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of spaceships and bases, followed by their coordinates.\n2. **Perfect Matching Check**: It first checks if the number of spaceships equals the number of bases.\n3. **Permutations**: It generates all possible permutations of the bases to explore every potential assignment.\n4. **Line Intersection Check**: For each permutation, it creates pairs of lines (from bases to spaceships) and checks if any pair intersects using the cross product method. If any permutation avoids intersections, it outputs \"Yes\". If all permutations fail, it outputs \"No\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible assignments and verify the non-intersecting condition, providing a solution that handles all edge cases within the given constraints.",
