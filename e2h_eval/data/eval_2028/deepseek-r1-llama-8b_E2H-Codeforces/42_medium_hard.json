    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Копирование файлов I\", which translates to something like \"File Copying I\". Hmm, the description says that we're dealing with two progress bars when copying files.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step. We have n files to copy in a specific order. Each file has a certain size. As we copy each byte, two progress bars update: one shows the percentage of the current file being copied, and the other shows the overall percentage across all files.\n\nThe first bar for the current file is calculated as floor(100 * x / a_i), where x is the number of bytes copied so far from this file. The second bar is floor(100 * (sum of a_1 to a_{i-1} + x) / total_sum). We need to find all the percentages between 0 and 100 inclusive where both bars show the same value at some moment.\n\nSo, the output should list all such percentages in increasing order.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Let's think about the process. For each file, we're going to simulate the copying process, updating both progress bars, and track the points where they are equal.\n\nWait, but simulating each byte might be too slow, especially since a_i can be up to 1000, and n is up to 100. So the maximum possible bytes would be 100 * 1000 = 100,000. But 100,000 steps are manageable because for each step, we just compute the two percentages and check if they match.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a smarter way than brute-forcing every single byte. Because for each file, the progress bar for the current file increases in increments based on the file's size. So for the i-th file, after each byte, the current progress bar increases by 100 * (x) / a_i, where x is the number of bytes processed in this file.\n\nWait, but x is the cumulative count for the current file. So for each file, the progress bar for it changes in discrete steps: each time we finish a whole a_i bytes, the progress bar jumps by 100%. So for a file of size 1000, the progress bar will increase by 1% each time 10 bytes are copied, right? Wait no: because 100*(x)/a_i is the percentage. So for a_i=1000, each byte adds 0.1%, so each byte increases the progress bar by 1/10 of a percent.\n\nWait, but the progress bar is updated after every byte. So for a file of size a, the progress bar for that file will go from 0 to 100 in steps of 0.01...% per byte, but since we're flooring, it's not exact. Or wait, no, the problem states that after each byte, both bars are updated. So for each byte, whether it's from the first, second, etc., file, we calculate the current progress for both bars and check if they are equal.\n\nWait, but the process is sequential: we copy a_1, then a_2, etc. So for each file, we copy all its bytes before moving on to the next. So the overall progress is a sum of the a_i's processed so far.\n\nSo perhaps the way to model this is to iterate through each file in order, and for each file, process each byte, updating the current progress and the overall progress, and after each byte, check if the two progress bars are equal.\n\nBut processing each byte individually might be feasible because the maximum number of steps is 1e5, which is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a mathematical way to determine when the two progress bars are equal without iterating each byte. That would be more efficient, especially for larger a_i.\n\nBut let's consider both approaches.\n\nFirst, the simulation approach:\n\nInitialize:\n- total_copied = 0\n- current_file_index = 0\n- current_file_position = 0\n\nFor each file in order:\n   a_i = size of current file\n   while current_file_position < a_i:\n      current_file_position += 1\n      bytes_copied_from_current_file = current_file_position\n      current_bar = floor(100 * bytes_copied_from_current_file / a_i)\n      total_copied += 1  # Wait, no, because each byte is 1 byte.\n      total_bytes = sum of all a_j for j < current_file_index plus bytes_copied_from_current_file\n      overall_bar = floor(100 * total_bytes / total_sum)\n      if current_bar == overall_bar:\n          record this value\n      else:\n          continue\n   current_file_position = 0\n\nWait, no. Wait, the 'total_copied' is the sum of all a_j processed so far. So for each file, when we start, the total_processed is the sum of a_1 to a_{i-1}. Then, as we process each byte in a_i, total_processed increases by 1 each time, until it reaches a_1+...+a_i.\n\nWait, no. Because each a_i is the size of the file. So when we start processing file i, the total_processed is S_{i-1} = a_1 + ... + a_{i-1}. Then, for each byte x in a_i, the total_processed becomes S_{i-1} + x, and the overall_bar is floor(100 * (S_{i-1} + x) / S_total), where S_total is the sum of all a_j.\n\nSo for each x in 1..a_i, during the processing of the i-th file, the overall progress is (S_prev + x) / S_total, multiplied by 100 and floored.\n\nSimilarly, the current file's progress is x / a_i * 100, floored.\n\nSo for each x from 1 to a_i, we can compute these two values and check if they are equal.\n\nThus, the algorithm could be:\n\nCompute the prefix sums S_0, S_1, ..., S_n, where S_0 = 0, S_1 = a_1, S_2 = a_1+a_2, etc.\n\nCompute S_total = S_n.\n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\n   for x from 1 to a_i:\n       current_file_progress = floor( (x * 100) / a_i )\n       total_copied = S_{i-1} + x\n       overall_progress = floor( (total_copied * 100) / S_total )\n       if current_file_progress == overall_progress:\n           add this value to a set of results.\n\nAfter processing all x, collect all unique values from 0 to 100 that are present in the results.\n\nThen, output them in sorted order.\n\nBut wait, including 0 and 100? Because initially, both are 0, and when all is done, both are 100. So those are definitely included.\n\nNow, the question is: how to implement this efficiently.\n\nBut considering that for each file, the x ranges from 1 to a_i, and for each x, we perform O(1) operations, the total time complexity is O(n * max(a_i)), which for n=100 and a_i=1000 is 1e5 steps, which is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read n and the list of a_i.\n\n2. Compute the prefix sums S_0, S_1, ..., S_n.\n\n3. Compute S_total = S_n.\n\n4. For each i from 1 to n:\n\n   a. a_i is the size of the current file.\n\n   b. for x in 1 to a_i:\n\n       i. current_bar = (x * 100) // a_i\n\n       ii. total_copied = S_{i-1} + x\n\n       iii. overall_bar = (total_copied * 100) // S_total\n\n       iv. if current_bar == overall_bar, add to a set.\n\n5. Collect all values from 0 to 100 that are in the set, sorted.\n\nBut wait, during the initial state, both bars are 0. Also, after processing all files, the overall bar is 100, and each file's bar is 100. So 0 and 100 are always included.\n\nWait, but in step 4.b, for x from 1 to a_i. So for the first file, x starts at 1, but the initial state is 0. So 0 is added only once, at the very beginning and at the end?\n\nWait, no. Because when we process x=1, the current_bar is 100*1/a_i, but the overall_bar is 100*(S_prev +1)/S_total.\n\nSo the initial state is not captured by any x. Therefore, we need to include 0 as a possible value.\n\nSimilarly, when all files are processed, the overall bar is 100, and each file's bar is 100. So 100 is also included.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Initialize a set with 0.\n\n- Process each x for each file, adding any matching current and overall bars.\n\n- Add 100 to the set.\n\nWait, no. Because during the processing, the last x of the last file will give overall_bar 100. So 100 is already in the set. So perhaps the initial 0 is added, and 100 is added automatically.\n\nBut to ensure correctness, perhaps it's better to initialize the set with 0, and then after all processing, add 100, or make sure that 100 is considered as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial 0 is captured when i=0, but according to the problem statement, the moment after 0 bytes have been copied is when both are 0. So that's a valid moment.\n\nSo in the code:\n\n- Initialize the result set with 0.\n\n- Then, for each file, process each x, and for each x, compute current and overall bar, and if equal, add to the set.\n\n- After all processing, add 100 to the set, because at the end, both bars are 100.\n\nWait, but when the last byte of the last file is processed, the overall bar is 100. So in that case, the x is a_i, and the current_bar is 100. So 100 is added during the processing. So perhaps 100 is already in the set.\n\nBut perhaps it's safer to add 0 and 100 explicitly.\n\nSo let's proceed.\n\nNow, how to compute the prefix sums.\n\nWe can precompute S = [0], then for each a in a_list, append S[-1] + a.\n\nSo S[0] = 0, S[1] = a_1, S[2] = a_1 +a_2, etc.\n\nThen, S_total = S[n].\n\nSo in code:\n\nn = int(input())\na_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprefix_sums = [0]\nfor a in a_list:\n    prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + a)\nS_total = prefix_sums[-1]\n\nThen, for each i in range(n):\n\n   a_i = a_list[i]\n\n   for x in range(1, a_i + 1):\n\n       current_bar = (x * 100) // a_i\n\n       total_copied = prefix_sums[i] + x\n\n       overall_bar = (total_copied * 100) // S_total\n\n       if current_bar == overall_bar:\n\n           result.add(current_bar)\n\nWait, but in code, it's 0-based, so for i in 0..n-1, the prefix_sums[i] is the sum of the first i elements.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in code:\n\nresult = set()\nresult.add(0)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a_i = a_list[i]\n    for x in range(1, a_i + 1):\n        current_bar = (x * 100) // a_i\n        total_copied = prefix_sums[i] + x\n        overall_bar = (total_copied * 100) // S_total\n        if current_bar == overall_bar:\n            result.add(current_bar)\nresult.add(100)\n\nWait, but when x is a_i, the total_copied becomes prefix_sums[i] + a_i, which is S_i = prefix_sums[i+1]. So for the next i, prefix_sums[i+1] is used.\n\nBut that's correct.\n\nWait, but when i is the last index (n-1), processing x from 1 to a_i, and when x equals a_i, the total_copied is prefix_sums[n-1] + a_i = S_total. So overall_bar becomes 100 * S_total / S_total = 100.\n\nSo yes, 100 is added to the set.\n\nThus, the code will capture all necessary cases.\n\nOnce all the values are collected, we need to output them in increasing order, from 0 to 100, including all numbers present in the result set.\n\nSo, the final steps are:\n\n- Create a sorted list of the result set.\n\n- Print each element in order, separated by '\\n'.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the outputs are in lines, each line being the numbers for a particular test case.\n\nWait, the sample input shows multiple test cases, but according to the problem statement, the input is one test case, but in the sample provided, it's given as a list of test cases, perhaps for different inputs.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the Input section, it says:\n\n\"В первой строке задано одно целое число n...\"\n\nSo the input is a single test case.\n\nBut in the sample input provided, it's written as ['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', ...], which looks like multiple test cases. But perhaps that was a formatting issue. Because in the problem statement, the sample input shows multiple test cases, but probably that's a mistake. Because in the Output, it's shown as four separate outputs, which suggests that the input may have had four test cases.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nAh, the note in the problem says: \"In the first test case...\" implying that the sample has multiple test cases.\n\nWait, no, the problem says:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\nWhich seems like four different inputs, each for a test case.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input...\", so perhaps each line is a separate test case.\n\nWait, but the problem's actual input is a single test case, but the sample input shows four, perhaps because it's an example of the output for each.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says, \"the following is a competitive programming problem.\" So the problem is a single task, but the sample input shows multiple test cases, perhaps due to the way the problem is presented.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is just illustrative, and the actual problem expects a single test case.\n\nIn any case, our code should read a single test case, process it, and output the required numbers.\n\nSo, in the code, we'll read n, then a list of n integers.\n\nSo, now, putting it all together.\n\nThe code steps are:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the next line as a list of n integers.\n\nCompute the prefix sums.\n\nCompute S_total.\n\nInitialize the result set with 0.\n\nLoop over each file (i from 0 to n-1):\n\n   a_i = a_list[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to a_i:\n\n       current_bar = (x * 100) // a_i\n\n       total_copied = prefix_sums[i] + x\n\n       overall_bar = (total_copied * 100) // S_total\n\n       if current_bar == overall_bar, add to the set.\n\nAdd 100 to the set.\n\nSort the set.\n\nPrint each element in order, each on a new line.\n\nWait, but the sample output shows that each line is a space-separated string of numbers, but wait, in the sample output, it's given as a list of strings, like '0\\n16\\n33...' which seems to represent the output lines.\n\nWait, no, perhaps each line is a single integer. Because the problem says, \"output all such numbers in order, each on a separate line.\"\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"Output: Выведите в возрастающем порядке все числа от 0 до 100 включительно такие, что ...\"\n\nSo the output is a sequence of lines, each containing a single number.\n\nSo in the sample, the first output line is '0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100'—wait, no, perhaps it's that each line represents the output for a test case, but perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no, the sample output is given as four lines, each corresponding to a test case, but the problem statement says to write a program that reads input and produces output for that input.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is four test cases, each with their own output lines.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the following is a competitive programming problem.\" So perhaps it's a single test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows four test cases. Hmm, perhaps the way the problem is presented is unclear.\n\nWell, regardless, our code will process a single test case.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nFirst test case input is '1\\n6' meaning n=1, a=[6].\n\nProcessing:\n\nprefix_sums = [0,6]\n\nS_total =6.\n\nFor i=0, a_i=6:\n\nx from 1 to 6:\n\nx=1: current_bar= 1*100//6=16; total_copied=0+1=1 → 1*100/6=16.666 → overall_bar=16.\n\nSo 16 is added.\n\nx=2: current_bar= 200//6=33.333 →33. overall_bar: 2 → 200/6=33.333 →33. So 33 added.\n\nx=3: 300//6=50. total_copied=3 →50. So 50.\n\nx=4: 400//6=66.666→66. total_copied=4 →66.666 →66.\n\nx=5:500//6=83.333→83. total_copied=5 →500/6=83.333 →83.\n\nx=6:600//6=100. total_copied=6 →100. So 100 is added.\n\nSo the result set is {0,16,33,50,66,83,100}.\n\nWhich matches the first line of the sample output.\n\nSo the code would produce the correct output for this case.\n\nAnother sample test case is n=2, a=[100,500].\n\nCompute prefix_sums:\n\n[0, 100, 600]\n\nS_total=600.\n\nFor i=0, a_i=100:\n\nx runs from 1 to 100.\n\ncurrent_bar = (x * 100)/100 = x.\n\noverall_bar = (100 + x) * 100 / 600 → (x+100)*100 /600 → (x+100)/6 → floor.\n\nSo for x=1: current_bar=1. overall_bar=(101*100)/600= 10100/600=16.833 →16.\n\n1 !=16 → no.\n\nx=100: current_bar=100, overall_bar= (200 *100)/600= 33.333 →33.\n\nSo 100 !=33.\n\nWait, but wait, when x=100, the total_copied is 100, so 100*100 /600 = 16.666 →16. So current_bar is 100, which is not equal to 16. So not added.\n\nWait, but when x=100, the current_bar is 100, but the overall_bar is 100 * (100) /600 = 16.666 →16.\n\nSo no equality except for 0 and 100.\n\nWait, but perhaps during the processing of the second file.\n\nWait, when i=1, a_i=500.\n\nx runs from 1 to 500.\n\nFor each x, current_bar = (x*100)/500 → 0.2x.\n\noverall_bar = (100 +x) *100 /600 → (100 +x)*100 /600.\n\nWe need to find x where 0.2x == floor( (100 +x)*100 /600 )\n\nLet's see for x=95:\n\ncurrent_bar=19.\n\noverall_bar: (195 *100)/600 = 19500/600=32.5 →32.\n\nNo.\n\nx=96: current_bar=19.2 →19. overall_bar: 196*100/600=32.666→32.\n\nNo.\n\nx=97: 19.4→19. 197*100/600=32.833→32.\n\nNo.\n\nx=98:19.6→19. 198*100/600=33 →33. So current_bar=19, overall_bar=33. Not equal.\n\nx=99:19.8→19. 199*100/600=33.166→33.\n\nNo.\n\nx=100:20. 200*100/600=33.333→33.\n\nStill not equal.\n\nWait, but the sample output for this case is '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100'. So how does that happen?\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the sample input for the second case.\n\nWait, the sample input is '2\\n100 500' which implies a_list = [100,500].\n\nSo during processing the first file (i=0, a_i=100):\n\nx runs from 1 to 100.\n\ncurrent_bar for x=1: 1%.\n\noverall_bar: (1 + 100) = 101 bytes. 101 * 100 / 600 = 16.833... →16.\n\nSo current_bar (1) !=16.\n\nx=100: current_bar=100, overall_bar= (100 +100) *100/600 = 200*100/600=33.333... →33. So 100 !=33.\n\nSo no match here.\n\nNow, processing the second file (i=1, a_i=500):\n\nFor each x from 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent_bar = (x * 100) //500 → 0.2x.\n\noverall_bar = (100 +x) * 100 //600 → (100 +x)*100 /600.\n\nWe need 0.2x = floor( (100+x)*100 /600 )\n\nLet me compute for x=95:\n\n0.2*95 =19.\n\n(100+95)=195. 195*100=19500. 19500 /600=32.5 →32.\n\n19 !=32.\n\nx=96: 0.2*96=19.2 →19.\n\n(196 *100)/600=19600/600=32.666→32.\n\nNo.\n\nx=97:19.4 →19.\n\n19700/600=32.833→32.\n\nNo.\n\nx=98:19.6→19.\n\n19800/600=33 →33.\n\nSo current_bar is 19, overall_bar is33. No match.\n\nx=99:19.8→19.\n\n19900/600=33.166→33.\n\nNo.\n\nx=100:20 →20.\n\n200*100=20000 /600=33.333→33.\n\n20 !=33.\n\nWait, but according to the sample output, 95,96,97,98,99 are in the output.\n\nSo perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps during the processing of the first file, when x=95, but the first file is 100 bytes, so x can't be 95 in the first file.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second file's processing.\n\nWait, for the second file, a_i=500.\n\nx can be from 1 to500.\n\nAt x=95, current_bar is (95*100)/500=19.\n\nOverall_bar: (100 +95) *100 /600 = 195*100/600=32.5 →32.\n\nSo 19 !=32.\n\nAt x=195: current_bar=39.\n\nOverall_bar: (100+195)*100/600=295*100/600=49.166→49. So 39 !=49.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find when 0.2x equals floor((100 +x)*100 /600).\n\nLet me think algebraically.\n\nWe have 0.2x = floor( (x+100)*100 /600 )\n\nMultiply both sides by 200: 40x = 20(x+100) →40x=20x+2000 →20x=2000 →x=100.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So perhaps the equation is:\n\n0.2x = (x + 100)*100 /600 → (since floor may vary).\n\nWait, but 0.2x = (x+100)*100 /600 → 0.2x = (x+100)/6 → multiply both sides by 6: x = 3(x+100) →x=3x +300 →-2x=300 →x=-150. Which is impossible.\n\nSo perhaps the equation is 0.2x = floor((x+100)/6).\n\nSo 0.2x must be equal to (x+100)/6, rounded down.\n\nSo (x+100)/6 >= 0.2x and <0.2x +1.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to loop through x and check.\n\nBut in the sample input for the second test case, the output includes 95,96,97,98,99, which suggests that during the processing of the second file, these x values cause the two bars to be equal.\n\nSo let's compute for x=95:\n\ncurrent_bar=19.\n\noverall_bar= (195 *100)/600=32.5 →32.\n\nNo.\n\nx=96:19.2→19. overall_bar=196*100/600=32.666→32.\n\nNo.\n\nx=97:19.4→19. 197*100/600=32.833→32.\n\nNo.\n\nx=98:19.6→19. 198*100/600=33 →33.\n\ncurrent_bar=19 !=33.\n\nx=99:19.8→19. 199*100/600=33.166→33.\n\nNo.\n\nx=100:20. 200*100/600=33.333→33.\n\nNo.\n\nx=150:30. (250 *100)/600=41.666→41.\n\n30 !=41.\n\nWait, this doesn't seem to align with the sample output.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the problem understanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the second test case's output is '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', which implies that 95 is in the output. But according to my calculations, it's not.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the overall_bar.\n\nWait, in the second test case, the files are 100 and 500.\n\nSo S_total is 600.\n\nFor i=1 (second file, a_i=500), x is 1 to 500.\n\nAt x=95:\n\ncurrent_bar = (95*100)/500=19.\n\ntotal_copied = 100 (from first file) +95=195.\n\noverall_bar= (195 *100)/600= 32.5 →32.\n\n19 !=32.\n\nAt x=195:\n\ncurrent_bar=39.\n\ntotal_copied=100 +195=295.\n\noverall_bar=295*100/600=49.166→49.\n\n39 !=49.\n\nWait, but when x= 95, the overall_bar is 32.5 →32.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some x where current_bar equals overall_bar.\n\nLet me try x=95:\n\ncurrent_bar=19.\n\noverall_bar=195*100 /600=32.5 →32.\n\nNo match.\n\nWhat about x= 95*6/5= 114.\n\nWait, 114 *100 /500= 22.8 →22.\n\noverall_bar: (100+114)*100/600=214*100/600=35.666→35.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second test case's output is 0,95,96,...,100. How?\n\nWait, perhaps during the processing of the second file, when x is 95, the current_bar is 19, but the overall_bar is 32.5, which is 32.\n\nWait, perhaps during the processing of the first file, when x=95, but that's not possible because the first file is only 100 bytes.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample output is for a different scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the initial state is considered as a moment where both bars are zero, but also, after all files are processed, the bars are both 100. So 0 and 100 are always present.\n\nWait, but according to the sample input, the second test case's output includes 0, 95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nSo 0 is included, and 100 is included.\n\nSo perhaps during the processing of the second file, x=95, the two bars are equal.\n\nBut according to my calculations, that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the overall_bar is computed as (S_prev +x)*100 / S_total, then floored.\n\nWait, for x=95, S_prev=100, so S_prev +x=195.\n\n195 *100=19500.\n\n19500 /600=32.5 →32.\n\nSo overall_bar is 32.\n\ncurrent_bar is 19.\n\nNo match.\n\nWait, perhaps during the processing of the second file, when x=95, the overall_bar is 32, but the current_bar is 19.\n\nSo why is 95 in the output?\n\nThis suggests that perhaps my approach is incorrect, and the simulation isn't capturing all possible cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way the overall_bar is computed.\n\nWait, perhaps the overall_bar is calculated as (sum of all a_i processed so far + x) *100 / S_total.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem considers the progress bars as being updated after every byte, which could include fractional percentages, but the problem says that the progress bars are updated after each byte and show the floored value.\n\nSo for x=95, the current_bar is 19, and overall_bar is 32.\n\nNo match.\n\nSo why is 95 in the output for the second test case?\n\nPerhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the second test case's a_list is [100,500], but during the processing of the first file, x=95 is not possible because the first file is 100 bytes.\n\nBut the sample output says 95 is included.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the sample input shows that the second test case is:\n\nInput:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\nOutput:\n\n0\n\n95\n\n96\n\n97\n\n98\n\n99\n\n100\n\nWhich suggests that 95 is achieved.\n\nSo perhaps during the processing of the second file, x=95, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps during the processing of the second file, the first file has been completely processed, so S_prev is 100.\n\nSo for x=95, the current_bar is 19, and the overall_bar is 32.\n\nBut 19 !=32.\n\nSo perhaps there's another x where it's equal.\n\nLet me compute for x= 95*6/5 = 114.\n\nx=114:\n\ncurrent_bar=22.8→22.\n\noverall_bar: (100+114)*100 /600= 214*100/600=35.666→35.\n\nNo.\n\nx=  600/7=85.714... so that 0.2x is 17.142 →17.\n\n(100+85.714) →185.714 →185.714*100=18571.428... /600=30.954 →30.\n\n17 !=30.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute all possible x in the second file.\n\nBut this would take a lot of time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that during the processing of the second file, the overall_bar is (100 +x) *100 /600, and current_bar is x *100 /500.\n\nWe need to find x where x*100/500 = floor( (100 +x)*100 /600 )\n\nWhich simplifies to 0.2x = floor( (100 +x)/6 )\n\nBecause 100*100/600 is (100 +x)*100/600.\n\nWait, no: (100 +x)*100 is divided by 600, which is (100 +x)/6.\n\nSo 0.2x = floor( (100 +x)/6 )\n\nSo:\n\n0.2x = floor( (100 +x)/6 )\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:\n\n1.2x ≤ (100 +x) < 1.2x +1\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to write:\n\nLet f(x) = floor( (100 +x)/6 )\n\nWe need 0.2x = f(x).\n\nSo 0.2x must be an integer, since f(x) is an integer.\n\nSo x must be a multiple of 5.\n\nSo x can be 5,10,15,...500.\n\nSo for x=5k, 0.2x= k.\n\nWe need k = floor( (100 +5k)/6 )\n\nSo:\n\nk = floor( (100 +5k)/6 )\n\nWhich implies:\n\nk <= (100 +5k)/6 <k+1\n\nMultiply by 6:\n\n6k <= 100 +5k <6k +6\n\nSo:\n\n6k -5k <=100 →k <=100.\n\nAnd 100 +5k <6k +6 →100 -6 <k →94 <k.\n\nSo k must be >94 and <=100.\n\nSo k can be 95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nSo x=5k can be 475,480,485,490,495,500.\n\nWait, but wait, x can't exceed a_i, which is 500. So x=500 is allowed.\n\nSo for k=95:\n\nx=475.\n\nCheck if 0.2*475=95 equals floor( (100+475)/6 )= (575)/6=95.833→95.\n\nYes.\n\nSo current_bar=95, overall_bar=95.\n\nSo x=475 is a point where the two bars are equal.\n\nSimilarly, for k=96:\n\nx=480.\n\ncurrent_bar=96.\n\noverall_bar: (580)/6=96.666→96.\n\nSo 96=96.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, for x=485:\n\ncurrent_bar=97.\n\n(585)/6=97.5→97.\n\nSo 97=97.\n\nYes.\n\nx=490: current_bar=98.\n\n(590)/6=98.333→98.\n\nYes.\n\nx=495: current_bar=99.\n\n(595)/6=99.166→99.\n\nYes.\n\nx=500: current_bar=100.\n\n(600)/6=100 →100.\n\nYes.\n\nSo these x values (475,480,485,490,495,500) will add 95,96,97,98,99,100 to the result set.\n\nSo in the second test case, the output is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nThus, the code needs to capture these x values.\n\nSo in the code, for i=1 (second file), x runs from 1 to 500, and for x=475, 480, etc., current_bar and overall_bar are equal.\n\nSo the code correctly captures these x's.\n\nThus, the code as designed earlier should correctly handle all cases.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a_list as list of integers.\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nCompute S_total.\n\nInitialize result set with 0.\n\nLoop over each file (i from 0 to n-1):\n\n   a_i = a_list[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to a_i:\n\n       current_bar = (x * 100) // a_i\n\n       total_copied = prefix_sums[i] + x\n\n       overall_bar = (total_copied * 100) // S_total\n\n       if current_bar == overall_bar:\n\n           add to result set.\n\nAdd 100 to result.\n\nSort the result set.\n\nPrint each element in order, each on a new line.\n\nThus, the code should work correctly.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nTest case 1: n=1, a=[6]. Output is 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nTest case 2: n=2, a=[100,500]. Output includes 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nAnother test case: n=4, a=[1000,2,2,998].\n\nLet's see:\n\nprefix_sums = [0,1000,1002,1004, 2002]\n\nS_total =2002.\n\nFor the first file (1000 bytes):\n\nx runs from 1 to 1000.\n\ncurrent_bar = x*100 /1000 →x.\n\noverall_bar = (1000 +x)*100 /2002.\n\nSo when x=0, both are 0.\n\nWhen x=1000, both are 50.\n\nWait, x=1000: current_bar=100.\n\noverall_bar: (1000+1000)*100 /2002 = 2000*100 /2002 ≈ 99.9 →99.\n\nSo 100 !=99.\n\nThus, 100 is added at the end.\n\nSo during the processing of the first file, perhaps some x's cause current_bar and overall_bar to be equal.\n\nBut perhaps the code will capture all such x's.\n\nI think the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the moments during which two progress bars show the same percentage. The first progress bar shows the percentage of a specific file being copied, while the second shows the overall percentage of all files copied so far. We need to find all such percentages from 0 to 100 inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation**: Compute the prefix sums of the file sizes to keep track of the cumulative size processed up to each file.\n3. **Simulation of Copying Process**: For each file, simulate the copying process byte by byte. After each byte, update both progress bars and check if they show the same percentage.\n4. **Track Progress Bars**: For each byte copied from a file, compute the current file's progress and the overall progress. If they match, record this percentage.\n5. **Collect Results**: Collect all unique percentages where both progress bars match, including 0 and 100.\n6. **Output Results**: Sort the collected percentages and print them in ascending order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprefix_sums = [0]\nfor a in a_list:\n    prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + a)\nS_total = prefix_sums[-1]\n\nresult = set()\nresult.add(0)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a_i = a_list[i]\n    for x in range(1, a_i + 1):\n        current_bar = (x * 100) // a_i\n        total_copied = prefix_sums[i] + x\n        overall_bar = (total_copied * 100) // S_total\n        if current_bar == overall_bar:\n            result.add(current_bar)\n\nresult.add(100)\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the sizes of the files.\n2. **Prefix Sums**: These are used to quickly compute the cumulative size of files processed up to any point, which helps in calculating the overall progress bar efficiently.\n3. **Simulating Copying**: For each file, we iterate through each byte, updating the progress bars after each byte. The current file's progress is calculated as `(x * 100) // a_i`, where `x` is the number of bytes processed so far in the current file. The overall progress is calculated using the prefix sums.\n4. **Tracking Matches**: Whenever the two progress bars show the same percentage, this value is added to the result set.\n5. **Sorting and Outputting**: The results are sorted and printed in ascending order, ensuring the correct output format.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the copying process and tracks the progress bars, ensuring that all necessary percentages are captured accurately.",
