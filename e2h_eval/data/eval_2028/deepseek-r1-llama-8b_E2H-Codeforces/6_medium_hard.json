Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about finding two vouchers that don't overlap, their durations add up exactly to x, and the total cost is as minimal as possible. If no such pair exists, we return -1.\n\nLet me break down the problem. We have n vouchers. Each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost costi. The duration of each voucher is ri - li + 1. We need to choose two different vouchers i and j. These two must not intersect, meaning either the end of i is before the start of j or vice versa. Also, the sum of their durations should be exactly x. And among all such possible pairs, we need the one with the smallest total cost.\n\nHmm, okay. So the first thing I need to do is find all possible pairs of vouchers that meet these conditions. But considering the constraints, n can be up to 2*10^5, which is 200,000. If I try to check every possible pair, that's O(n^2) which would be way too slow—like 4e10 operations. That's definitely not feasible. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, let's think about the properties required for the two vouchers. Let's say the first voucher has duration d1 and the second d2, where d1 + d2 = x. Also, the vouchers must not overlap in time. So perhaps we can group the vouchers by their durations and then look for pairs of durations that add up to x.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each voucher, we can note its duration and cost. Then, for each possible duration d, we can look for another duration (x - d). For each voucher of duration d, we can find the best possible voucher of duration (x - d) that doesn't overlap with it.\n\nBut even that might be tricky because we need to process each voucher efficiently to find non-overlapping ones. So how can we do that?\n\nAnother thought: for each voucher, we can precompute all possible other vouchers that could fit either before or after it, based on their duration. But again, with n being 2e5, this might not be efficient.\n\nWait, maybe we can sort the vouchers in some way to make this easier. Like, if we sort them by their end dates, then for a given voucher, all vouchers that end before it start are in the past, and those that start after it end are in the future.\n\nSo perhaps we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. Preprocess each voucher, noting its start and end days, duration, and cost.\n2. Group the vouchers by their durations. So for each d, we have a list of vouchers with duration d.\n3. For each voucher v, we can look into the group for duration (x - v.duration) and find the minimal cost voucher that does not overlap with v. Similarly, look into the group for duration (v.duration) and find the minimal cost voucher that doesn't overlap.\n4. Keep track of the minimal total cost found.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find the minimal cost voucher that doesn't overlap with v in the group for (x - d)?\n\nHmm, perhaps for each duration d, we can sort the vouchers in that group by their end date. Then, for a given voucher v, any voucher in the same group that ends before v's start is a candidate. Similarly, for vouchers in the other group that start after v's end.\n\nWait, but since the two vouchers must not overlap, one could come before the other. So for each voucher v of duration d, we can look for vouchers in the (x - d) group that end before v's start, or start after v's end.\n\nBut even this might not be efficient because for each voucher, checking all possible other vouchers could still take too much time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each duration d, we can create a sorted list of vouchers by their end dates. Then, for a given v, we can query in the (x - d) group for the earliest end date that is <= v's start date minus 1 (so that they don't overlap). Similarly, in the other direction.\n\nBut wait, for each voucher v of duration d, the target group is (x - d). So for the group (x -d), we need to find all vouchers u where u ends before v starts, or u starts after v ends.\n\nWait, but for the group (x -d), each voucher u in that group has duration (x -d). So for v of duration d, we need u to have duration (x -d), and the two shouldn't overlap.\n\nSo for each v, we can look into the (x -d) group and find the minimal cost u that doesn't overlap with v.\n\nBut how do we find u quickly?\n\nMaybe we can preprocess for each duration group, the vouchers are sorted by their end dates. Then, for a given v, we can perform a binary search to find all u in the (x -d) group that end before v's start. Or alternatively, for u that start after v's end.\n\nWait, but for u to end before v's start, u's end <= v's start - 1. Similarly, for u to start after v's end, u's start >= v's end + 1.\n\nSo for each v, in the (x -d) group, we can find all u's that satisfy either condition, and then select the one with the minimal cost.\n\nBut even that seems like it could be time-consuming because for each v, we'd have to process multiple u's.\n\nBut perhaps we can pre-process for each duration group:\n\n- Sort the vouchers by their end date. Then, for each voucher u in the group, we can know the earliest and latest possible start times.\n\nWait, maybe for each duration group, we can create two lists:\n\n1. Sorted by end date, so that for a given v's start, we can find the latest u that ends before v's start.\n2. Sorted by start date, so that for a given v's end, we can find the earliest u that starts after v's end.\n\nBut even that, I'm not sure how to combine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each group, we can also keep track of the minimal cost for each possible end time or start time. But that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, for each group, we can have the vouchers sorted by end time, and for each such u, we can store the minimal cost up to that end time. Then, when processing v, we can find the maximum end time that is <= v.start - 1, and query the minimal cost up to that point.\n\nSimilarly, for the other case where u starts after v's end.\n\nWait, here's an idea:\n\nFor each duration d, we have two structures:\n\n- A list sorted by end time, and for each position, we have the minimal cost up to that point. So when we query for a v, looking for u's that end before v.start, we can find the latest end time <= v.start -1, and then get the minimal cost up to that point.\n\nSimilarly, for the other case, we can have a list sorted by start time, and for each position, the minimal cost from that point onwards.\n\nWait, maybe using prefix arrays for minimal costs.\n\nAlternatively, for each duration group d, we can pre-sort the vouchers in two ways:\n\n1. Sorted by end time. Then, for each voucher, we can compute the minimal cost for all vouchers ending at or before a certain time.\n2. Sorted by start time. Then, for each voucher, we can compute the minimal cost for all vouchers starting at or after a certain time.\n\nThis way, when processing a voucher v, we can quickly find the minimal cost u in the (x -d) group that satisfies either u's end <= v.start -1 or u's start >= v.end +1.\n\nLet me think about the steps in code:\n\n1. Read all vouchers, calculate their duration. Create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration.\n\n2. For each duration d in the dictionary, process the list:\n\n   a. Sort the vouchers by end time. For each voucher in this sorted list, compute a prefix array that holds the minimal cost up to that index. So prefix_min[i] is the minimal cost among the first i+1 vouchers.\n\n   b. Sort the vouchers by start time. For each voucher in this sorted list, compute a suffix array that holds the minimal cost from that index to the end. So suffix_min[i] is the minimal cost from voucher i to the end.\n\n3. For each voucher v in the original list, we consider two cases:\n\n   a. Looking for a voucher u in the group (x - v.duration) that ends before v starts.\n\n      i. In the (x -d) group, use the end-sorted list. Find the largest end time <= v.start -1. Then, the minimal cost for u is the prefix_min at that position.\n\n   b. Looking for a voucher u in the group (v.duration) that starts after v ends.\n\n      i. In the (v.duration) group, use the start-sorted list. Find the smallest start time >= v.end +1. Then, the minimal cost for u is the suffix_min at that position.\n\n4. For each case, if a valid u is found, compute the total cost (v.cost + u.cost) and keep track of the minimal total cost.\n\nWait, but wait. Because for each v, the group for (x -d) may not exist. Also, for each v, it's possible that in the (x -d) group, there are multiple u's that satisfy the condition, but we need the one with the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for the group (d) when considering u comes after v.\n\nWait, but in case a, we're considering u is in (x -d) group, and comes before v. So for each v, we look into (x -d) group and find u's that end before v starts.\n\nIn case b, we look into the group d, and find u's that start after v ends. So for each v, we look into two groups: (x -d) and d.\n\nWait, but wait: For a voucher v of duration d, the other voucher u must have duration (x -d). So when looking for u in the (x -d) group, we can find u's that end before v's start, or u's that start after v's end.\n\nWait, but the two vouchers can be in any order. So for each v, we need to look for u's in the (x -d) group that don't overlap with v.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each voucher v:\n\n- d_v = duration of v.\n\n- target_d = x - d_v.\n\nIf target_d is not present in the duration groups, skip.\n\nElse:\n\n   Check in the group for target_d:\n\n      i. Are there u's whose end <= v.start -1? Find the maximal such u, and take the minimal cost among them.\n\n      ii. Are there u's whose start >= v.end +1? Find the minimal such u, and take the minimal cost among them.\n\nThen, for each of these, if found, compute the total cost and update the global minimum.\n\nAdditionally, for the group d_v (when considering u comes after v), we can look for u's that start after v's end, but that's already covered in part ii above.\n\nWait, no. Because for part ii, we are considering u in the group (x -d_v). But if v is in group d_v and u is in group (x -d_v), it's the same as in part i.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nEach pair (u, v) must consist of two different vouchers, possibly in any order. So for each voucher v, when looking for u, u can be in the (x -d_v) group, either before or after v.\n\nWait, but for u to be in the (x -d_v) group, regardless of whether it's before or after, we just need to ensure that u and v do not overlap.\n\nSo, for each v, when looking for u in the (x -d_v) group, we can have two scenarios:\n\n1. u ends before v starts.\n\n2. u starts after v ends.\n\nSo for each scenario, we can find the minimal cost u in the group that satisfies the condition.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nSo, for each group, we have two sorted lists:\n\n- Sorted by end time: allows us to find u's that end before v starts.\n\n- Sorted by start time: allows us to find u's that start after v ends.\n\nAnd for each sorted list, we can precompute the minimal cost up to a certain point (prefix min) or from a certain point (suffix min).\n\nSo for scenario 1: u ends before v starts.\n\nWe take the (x -d_v) group, sorted by end time.\n\nWe perform a binary search to find the largest end time <= (v's start -1). Then, among all u's up to that point, we want the one with the minimal cost. So the prefix min array can give us that.\n\nSimilarly, for scenario 2: u starts after v ends.\n\nWe take the (x -d_v) group, sorted by start time.\n\nWe perform a binary search to find the smallest start time >= (v's end + 1). Among all u's from that point, we want the one with minimal cost. The suffix min array can help here.\n\nWait, but how to build these prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nLet me think about it step by step.\n\nFor each group d:\n\n- Sort the vouchers in the group by end time.\n\n   For this sorted list, create a prefix_min array, where prefix_min[i] is the minimal cost in vouchers[0..i].\n\n   So for each i, prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], vouchers[i].cost).\n\n- Sort the vouchers in the group by start time.\n\n   For this sorted list, create a suffix_min array, where suffix_min[i] is the minimal cost in vouchers[i..n-1].\n\n   So for each i, suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], vouchers[i].cost).\n\nOnce these are built, for a given v, in the (x -d_v) group:\n\n1. To find u's ending before v.start:\n\n   Find the largest voucher in the group's end-sorted list where end <= (v.start - 1).\n\n   Let's say the index is k.\n\n   If k >=0, then the minimal cost is prefix_min[k].\n\n   So, the minimal cost for u in this scenario is prefix_min[k].\n\n2. To find u's starting after v.end:\n\n   Find the smallest voucher in the group's start-sorted list where start >= (v.end + 1).\n\n   Let's say the index is m.\n\n   If m < len(start_sorted_list), then the minimal cost is suffix_min[m].\n\n   So, the minimal cost for u in this scenario is suffix_min[m].\n\nNow, for each v, we can compute both possibilities and take the minimal between them, and then compare it to the global minimal.\n\nBut wait, in the first scenario, we're looking for u in the (x -d_v) group, which could have zero or more vouchers. Similarly for the second scenario.\n\nSo for each v, we need to check both scenarios and see if they yield a valid u.\n\nAdditionally, since the pair (u, v) is considered once for each possible order, we might need to process each pair twice. Wait, no—because for each v, we're considering u in the (x -d_v) group, and for each u, we'll process them as well, but when u is processed as v, it will consider the same pair again.\n\nWait, but in our approach, for each v, we're considering both scenarios, but each pair (u, v) is only considered once, when we process v as the 'second' voucher. So perhaps we need to process each pair twice, but that's not efficient.\n\nHmm, maybe that's a problem. Because if we process each v and for each, look into the (x -d_v) group, and for each u in that group that is compatible, then when we process u as v, it will look into the (x -d_u) group, which may include v. So it's possible that each pair is considered twice.\n\nBut that's okay because the minimal cost would be found correctly.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that i and j are different vouchers, so each pair is considered once as (i,j) and once as (j,i). But since in each case, the sum of durations is x, it's allowed.\n\nBut in terms of the cost, the sum is the same, so whether we process (i,j) or (j,i) first doesn't affect the result. But in our approach, each pair is considered twice, which may lead to redundant computations.\n\nBut since n is up to 2e5, and each binary search is O(log n), this is acceptable.\n\nWait, but for each v, we have to process two scenarios. For each scenario, a binary search is done, which is O(log k), where k is the size of the group.\n\nSo for 2e5 v's, each with two log operations, that's manageable.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\n- Preprocess the vouchers into duration groups.\n\n- For each group, sort by end time and create a prefix_min array.\n\n- For each group, sort by start time and create a suffix_min array.\n\n- For each voucher v:\n\n   Compute d = v.duration.\n\n   target_d = x - d.\n\n   If target_d is not in the groups, continue.\n\n   Else:\n\n      Get the group for target_d.\n\n      Scenario 1: u ends before v starts.\n\n         Use the end-sorted list of the group.\n\n         Find the largest end <= v.start -1.\n\n         If such u exists, record the minimal cost from prefix_min.\n\n      Scenario 2: u starts after v ends.\n\n         Use the start-sorted list of the group.\n\n         Find the smallest start >= v.end + 1.\n\n         If such u exists, record the minimal cost from suffix_min.\n\n   Take the minimal cost from both scenarios, if any, and compare to the global minimal.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, for each group, we'll have two sorted lists and their respective prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nSo, for each group d:\n\n   group_end = sorted list of vouchers, ordered by end time.\n\n   group_start = sorted list of vouchers, ordered by start time.\n\n   Compute prefix_min for group_end:\n\n      prefix_min[0] = group_end[0].cost\n\n      for i from 1 to len(group_end)-1:\n\n          prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], group_end[i].cost)\n\n   Similarly, compute suffix_min for group_start:\n\n      suffix_min[-1] = group_start[-1].cost\n\n      for i from len(group_start)-2 downto 0:\n\n          suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], group_start[i].cost)\n\nWait, no. Wait, for group_start, when sorted by start time, we need to find the earliest u that starts after v.end. So for the suffix_min, it's the minimal cost from that point onwards.\n\nSo, for each i in group_start, suffix_min[i] is the minimal cost in group_start[i...end].\n\nSo the computation is correct.\n\nNow, during the processing of each voucher v:\n\nFor scenario 1:\n\n   In the target_d group, we have group_end sorted by end.\n\n   We need to find the largest end <= (v.start - 1).\n\n   How? Since group_end is sorted by end, we can perform a binary search for (v.start - 1). The rightmost index where end <= (v.start -1) is the candidate.\n\n   Once we find the index, if it's >=0, the minimal cost is prefix_min[index].\n\nFor scenario 2:\n\n   In the target_d group, group_start is sorted by start.\n\n   We need to find the smallest start >= (v.end + 1).\n\n   So, we can binary search for (v.end + 1), and find the leftmost index where start >= this value.\n\n   If such an index exists, the minimal cost is suffix_min[index].\n\nSo, for each scenario, we can get a possible minimal cost, or None if no such u exists.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing the binary search.\n\nIn Python, the bisect module can help. For group_end, which is a list of end times, sorted in increasing order, we can use bisect_right to find the insertion point of (v.start -1). Then, the index is insertion_point -1.\n\nSimilarly, for group_start, which is a list of start times, sorted in increasing order, we can use bisect_left to find the insertion point of (v.end + 1). Then, the index is insertion_point.\n\nBut wait, in group_start, we need the earliest start time >= (v.end +1). So, the bisect_left function returns the first position where the element is >= (v.end +1). So, the index is the insertion point.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nImplement the steps as described, and for each v, compute the possible contributions from both scenarios.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nEach voucher is a tuple: (li, ri, costi). So, for each voucher, we can compute duration as ri - li + 1.\n\nWe can represent each group as a dictionary, where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of dictionaries or objects containing li, ri, costi, and duration.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps it's better to precompute all necessary information.\n\nSo, let's outline the code structure.\n\nRead n and x.\n\nvouchers = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    l, r, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    duration = r - l + 1\n\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, c, duration) )\n\ngroup_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor voucher in vouchers:\n\n    d = voucher[3]\n\n    group_dict[d].append(voucher)\n\n# Now, preprocess each group\n\nprocessed_groups = {}\n\nfor d in group_dict:\n\n    # Process group_end\n\n    group_end = sorted(group_dict[d], key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    # Compute prefix_min\n\n    prefix_min = []\n\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n\n    for voucher in group_end:\n\n        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, voucher[2])\n\n        prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n\n    # Process group_start\n\n    group_start = sorted(group_dict[d], key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # Compute suffix_min\n\n    suffix_min = [float('inf')] * len(group_start)\n\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n\n    for i in range(len(group_start)-1, -1, -1):\n\n        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, group_start[i][2])\n\n        suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n\n    # Store in processed_groups\n\n    processed_groups[d] = {\n\n        'group_end': group_end,\n\n        'group_start': group_start,\n\n        'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n\n        'suffix_min': suffix_min\n\n    }\n\nmin_total = float('inf')\n\nfor voucher in vouchers:\n\n    l, r, c, d = voucher\n\n    target_d = x - d\n\n    if target_d not in processed_groups:\n\n        continue\n\n    # Scenario 1: u ends before v starts\n\n    # target_group = processed_groups[target_d]\n\n    # group_end is sorted by end time.\n\n    # We need to find the largest end <= l-1.\n\n    group_end = processed_groups[target_d]['group_end']\n\n    ends = [voucher[1] for voucher in group_end]\n\n    import bisect\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(ends, l-1) - 1\n\n    if idx >= 0:\n\n        cost_u = processed_groups[target_d]['prefix_min'][idx]\n\n        total_cost = c + cost_u\n\n        if total_cost < min_total:\n\n            min_total = total_cost\n\n    # Scenario 2: u starts after v ends.\n\n    # group_start is sorted by start time.\n\n    group_start = processed_groups[target_d]['group_start']\n\n    starts = [voucher[0] for voucher in group_start]\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_left(starts, r+1)\n\n    if idx < len(group_start):\n\n        cost_u = processed_groups[target_d]['suffix_min'][idx]\n\n        total_cost = c + cost_u\n\n        if total_cost < min_total:\n\n            min_total = total_cost\n\n# After processing all vouchers, check if min_total is still infinity.\n\nif min_total == float('inf'):\n\n    print(-1)\n\nelse:\n\n    print(min_total)\n\nWait, but wait—what about when the same group is used for both scenarios? Like, when the target_d is the same as d, but in that case, the group is the same.\n\nNo, because for each v, we're looking for u in the (x -d) group. So, in scenario 1, u is from (x -d) group. So if x is even and d is x/2, then target_d is same as d.\n\nBut that's okay because u and v can be from the same group.\n\nBut what about the case where v is in the same group as u. But since the group is preprocessed, the code handles it.\n\nWait, but in the code, for each v, we are looking for u in the (x -d) group. So for example, if d is 3 and x is 6, then target_d is 3. So v is in group 3, and u is also in group 3.\n\nSo the code correctly looks into the same group.\n\nBut what about when the same voucher is considered for u and v? No, because the code processes all pairs, including when u comes before v, and when v comes before u.\n\nWait, no. Because when v is processed, u is in the (x -d) group, which could include vouchers before and after v. So for a pair (u, v), when processing u, it will look into the (x -du) group, which may include v.\n\nSo the pair (u, v) and (v, u) are considered, but that's okay because the minimal cost will be captured in both cases.\n\nBut this could lead to redundant processing. However, given the problem constraints, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but in the code above, for each v, it's considering u in the (x -d) group, which could be the same as v's group if target_d is same as d.\n\nBut in the code, we are not excluding the possibility that u is the same as v. But according to the problem statement, i and j must be different vouchers. So when v and u are the same voucher, they cannot form a pair.\n\nBut in the code, when processing v, it's looking into the group of (x -d) and taking u's from that group. So, when v is in a group where target_d is equal to d, u could be v itself, but in the preprocessing, the group contains all vouchers of that duration.\n\nWait, but the code includes all vouchers in the group, including v. So when v is processed, and target_d is d, it will look into the same group and possibly pick v as u. But that's invalid because u and v must be different.\n\nSo that's a problem. So in the code, when target_d is equal to d, and the group contains v, then the code may pick v as u, leading to an invalid pair.\n\nSo, how can we avoid that?\n\nHmm, perhaps when processing each voucher v, when target_d is equal to d, we need to exclude v itself from consideration.\n\nBut how? Because in the group, v is part of the list. So when we process scenario 1 or 2, and the group is the same as v's group, the code may pick v as u.\n\nSo, for each v, when target_d is equal to d, we need to make sure that when looking for u in the group, we exclude v.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nOne approach is, for each group, when target_d equals d, when searching for u, we need to skip the current voucher v.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps when target_d == d, in both scenarios, when we find u's that meet the conditions, we can check whether u is the same as v. But that's O(1) per u, but when the group is large, this can add overhead.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the preprocessing, for each group, when target_d is equal to d, the group's lists (group_end and group_start) can have v removed before processing.\n\nBut that complicates the preprocessing.\n\nAlternatively, during the processing of each v, when target_d == d, we can adjust the binary search to exclude v.\n\nWait, but in that case, when we process scenario 1, for the group_end list, we need to find u's with end <= (v.start -1) and u is not v.\n\nBut how to do that without checking each u.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to, in the scenario where target_d is equal to d, during the binary search, we can find all u's that meet the condition and are not v.\n\nBut that's complicated.\n\nAlternative idea: when target_d == d, during the processing of each v, after finding the index via binary search, check whether the voucher at that index is v. If yes, move to the next possible index.\n\nBut that could be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can process the vouchers in a way that, for each v, when target_d is equal to d, we have two separate groups: one that excludes v.\n\nBut that seems difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each v, when target_d is equal to d, we can compute both scenarios, and for each, if the minimal cost u is v, we skip it.\n\nBut how to know if u is v.\n\nWait, because when target_d is equal to d, and u is v, then u's end is ri, and v's start is li. So for scenario 1, u's end is <= v's start -1. Which implies that ri <= l-1. So unless l > r, which is impossible, this can't happen. So in scenario 1, u can't be v.\n\nWait, no. Because scenario 1 is u ends before v starts. So u's end <= v.start -1. For u to be v, that would require v's end <= v.start -1, which is impossible because end >= start.\n\nSo in scenario 1, u can't be v. So no problem there.\n\nIn scenario 2, u starts after v ends. So u's start >= v.end +1. For u to be v, that would require v's start >= v.end +1, which is impossible because start <= end.\n\nSo in scenario 2, u can't be v either.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So for the two scenarios, when target_d is equal to d, the u can't be v because the conditions are impossible. So in this case, when target_d is d, the code doesn't need to worry about selecting v as u.\n\nSo, the initial code is safe.\n\nBecause for scenario 1, u's end <= v.start -1, but u can't be v because that would require v's end <= v.start -1, which is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, scenario 2, u starts after v ends. u can't be v because v's start is <= v's end.\n\nSo, when target_d is equal to d, the u's selected from the group cannot be v.\n\nTherefore, the initial code is correct.\n\nThat's a relief.\n\nNow, testing this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2\n\nGrouping by duration:\n\nduration 3: [ (1,3,4,3) ]\n\nduration 2: [ (1,2,5,2), (5,6,1,2), (1,2,4,2) ]\n\nNow, for each voucher:\n\nProcessing the first voucher (1,3,4,3):\n\ntarget_d = 5 -3 = 2.\n\nCheck group for duration 2.\n\nScenario 1: u ends before 1-1=0 → no vouchers, since all have end >=1.\n\nScenario 2: u starts after 3+1=4.\n\nLooking into group for duration 2, sorted by start:\n\nThe vouchers are:\n\n(1,2,5,2), (1,2,4,2), (5,6,1,2). When sorted by start, it's [ (1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1) ].\n\nWe need u's start >=4.\n\nThe first such voucher is (5,6,1). Its start is 5 >=4.\n\nSo, the suffix_min for this index (index 2) is min(5,4,1) → 1.\n\nSo, total cost is 4+1=5.\n\nSo this is a candidate.\n\nProcessing the second voucher (1,2,5,2):\n\ntarget_d=5-2=3.\n\nCheck group for duration 3.\n\nOnly one voucher: (1,3,4,3).\n\nScenario 1: u ends before 1-1=0 → no.\n\nScenario 2: u starts after 2+1=3.\n\nThe group for duration 3 has a voucher (1,3,4). Its start is 1 <=3, so no u's meet the condition.\n\nSo no contribution.\n\nProcessing third voucher (5,6,1,2):\n\ntarget_d=5-2=3.\n\nSame as above. No u's in group 3 that meet the conditions.\n\nProcessing fourth voucher (1,2,4,2):\n\ntarget_d=5-2=3.\n\nAgain, no u's in group 3.\n\nSo the minimal total is 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: sample input 2.\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\nEach voucher has duration 3.\n\nSo target_d for each is 2-3=-1. So no group, hence output is -1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about edge cases.\n\nWhat if x is zero? But according to the problem statement, x is at least 2.\n\nWait, the constraints say x >=2? Let me check the problem statement.\n\nProblem says:\n\n2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105\n\nSo x is at least 2.\n\nSo no issues with x=0.\n\nAnother edge case: when two vouchers are completely non-overlapping, but their durations sum to x.\n\nE.g., voucher1: l=1, r=2, cost=10, duration=2.\n\nvoucher2: l=3, r=4, cost=20, duration=2.\n\nx=4.\n\nSo target_d for voucher1 is 4-2=2. So in the group for 2, voucher2 is present.\n\nScenario 1 for voucher1: u's end <=0 → none.\n\nScenario 2: u's start >=3. So voucher2's start is 3, so it's included. So the minimal cost is 20. Total cost 30.\n\nSimilarly, when processing voucher2, target_d is 4-2=2.\n\nNo, wait: x is 4, so target_d is 4? Wait, x is 5 in the problem statement.\n\nWait, no, in the sample, the code is written as x. So for each voucher, the sum of durations must be exactly x.\n\nIn this case, each voucher's duration is 2, so for two vouchers, the sum is 2. But x is 4, so it's possible.\n\nBut wait, in this example, I think I'm mixing up the problem. Let me see.\n\nWait, the code is supposed to read the inputs correctly.\n\nBut perhaps I should think of another test case.\n\nWait, let's make a small test case.\n\nTest case where n=2, x=5.\n\nvoucher1: l=1, r=5, cost=10.\n\nvoucher2: l=5, r=5, cost=1.\n\nWait, duration is 5.\n\nSo, their sum is 5, which is x=5.\n\nSo, in the sample, the first sample, it works.\n\nAnother edge case: when a voucher has duration 0, but that's impossible as per the problem statement.\n\nWait, the vouchers have li ≤ ri, etc.\n\nWait, the vouchers are given as li and ri, with li ≤ ri.\n\nThus, the problem is to find two non-intersecting vouchers.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, considering the constraints, the code needs to run within time limits, but the algorithm is O(n log n) which is acceptable.\n\nWait, but wait: in the initial problem statement, the code expects to read from stdin, but in the sample input, the user provided a sample that's incorrect.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem, the user provided an input that seems wrong.\n\nWait, the input was:\n\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n1 2 5\\n ... etc.]\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the first line is n and x.\n\nThen, each of the next n lines gives three integers li, ri, costi.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first line is '4 5', which is n=4, x=5.\n\nThen, four lines follow.\n\nBut in the sample input provided in the problem statement, it's written as:\n\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\nWhich seems to represent two test cases, but I think it's a typo, because in the actual problem statement",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers such that their combined duration equals the total vacation duration and their total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently searching for these pairs using preprocessing and binary search techniques.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: Each voucher is grouped by its duration. This helps in quickly finding potential pairs of vouchers whose durations sum up to the total vacation duration.\n2. **Preprocess Groups**: For each group of vouchers with the same duration, sort them by their end dates and compute prefix minimum costs. Similarly, sort them by their start dates and compute suffix minimum costs. This allows efficient querying of the minimal cost vouchers that fit specific time constraints.\n3. **Check Each Voucher**: For each voucher, determine the required complementary duration that would sum up to the total vacation duration. Check if there are valid vouchers in this complementary group that can be paired without overlapping in time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    \n    index = 2\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index +=3\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        vouchers.append( (l, r, c, duration) )\n    \n    # Group vouchers by their duration\n    groups = defaultdict(list)\n    for v in vouchers:\n        d = v[3]\n        groups[d].append(v)\n    \n    # Preprocess each group\n    processed_groups = {}\n    for d in groups:\n        group_end = sorted(groups[d], key=lambda x: x[1])\n        ends = [v[1] for v in group_end]\n        prefix_min = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for v in group_end:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, v[2])\n            prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n        \n        group_start = sorted(groups[d], key=lambda x: x[0])\n        starts = [v[0] for v in group_start]\n        suffix_min = [float('inf')] * len(group_start)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(group_start)-1, -1, -1):\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, group_start[i][2])\n            suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n        \n        processed_groups[d] = {\n            'group_end': group_end,\n            'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n            'group_start': group_start,\n            'suffix_min': suffix_min\n        }\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for v in vouchers:\n        l, r, c, d = v\n        target_d = x - d\n        if target_d not in processed_groups:\n            continue\n        \n        # Scenario 1: u ends before l-1\n        group_info = processed_groups[target_d]\n        group_end = group_info['group_end']\n        ends_list = [e[1] for e in group_end]\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(ends_list, l-1) -1\n        if idx >=0:\n            min_cost = group_info['prefix_min'][idx]\n            total = c + min_cost\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n        \n        # Scenario 2: u starts after r+1\n        group_start_list = group_info['group_start']\n        starts_list = [s[0] for s in group_start_list]\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(starts_list, r+1)\n        if idx < len(group_start_list):\n            min_cost = group_info['suffix_min'][idx]\n            total = c + min_cost\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into vouchers, each with its start day, end day, cost, and duration.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration to facilitate quick lookup of complementary durations.\n3. **Preprocessing Groups**: Each group of vouchers is preprocessed into two sorted lists (by end date and start date) along with prefix and suffix minimum cost arrays.\n4. **Checking Each Voucher**: For each voucher, we check if there exists a complementary voucher in the required duration group that can be paired without overlapping.
