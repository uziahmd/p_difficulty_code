He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Check the string,\" and from the description, it seems like we have to verify if a given string meets certain conditions based on how it was built by three friendsâ€”A, B, and C.\n\nHmm. Let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, the process is: A creates a string with some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's to the end. Then C appends some 'c's. But here's the catch: C must append a number of 'c's equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before he adds his part. Also, the order of the letters must be strictly a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, any other order isn't allowed.\n\nOur task is to check if a given string could have been formed this way. If yes, output \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\nSo, the steps for the solution are:\n\n1. Check the structure of the string. It should consist of a sequence of 'a's, followed by a sequence of 'b's, followed by a sequence of 'c's. Any interleaving or other characters would make it invalid.\n\n2. Once we confirm that the string is in the correct order, we need to count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n\n3. The number of 'c's added by C must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. Also, since C appends after B, the total 'c's must be exactly equal to one of these two counts.\n\nWait, but wait. The initial string after B has both 'a's and 'b's. So when C appends, the count of 'a' is fixed, as well as the count of 'b's. So the number of 'c's added by C must equal the count of 'a's (before C's addition) or the count of 'b's (before C's addition). But wait, the problem says that the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's OR the number of 'b's in the string. So, after B's step, the string is a's followed by b's. So when C appends, the number of 'c's is equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's.\n\nBut also, the entire string must follow the order a's -> b's -> c's.\n\nSo first, the string must be in the form a^m b^n c^k, where m, n, k are at least 1 because the problem says that after each step, at least one of each character exists.\n\nSo first, the string should not have any 'a's after a 'b' or 'c', nor any 'b's after a 'c'. So the string must be a sequence of a's, then b's, then c's without any breaks.\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is check the structure of the string. How can I do that?\n\nLet me think: iterate through the string and ensure that once a character changes, it doesn't go back. For example, the string can have a's, then switch to b's, then to c's. Any other pattern is invalid.\n\nOnce the structure is confirmed, we can proceed to count the a's, b's, and c's.\n\nThen, we need to check whether the count of c's is equal to the count of a's or to the count of b's.\n\nWait, but wait. The count of c's is exactly what C appended. So before C appends, the string is a's followed by b's. Then C appends k 'c's. So the total c's in the string is k.\n\nBut according to the problem, k must equal the number of a's (m) or the number of b's (n). So, k == m or k == n.\n\nBut wait, wait: the initial string before C's step has m a's and n b's. So when C appends, he appends k c's, which must equal either m or n.\n\nSo in the final string, the count of c's is k, which is equal to m or n.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\n1. Check the structure of the string. It must be a series of a's, then b's, then c's. So, the string must be non-decreasing in terms of the order a < b < c.\n\n   How to do this? We can track the current expected character. Initially, it's 'a'. Once a different character is found, it must be 'b' (only allowed next), and after 'b', only 'c' is allowed. Otherwise, the string is invalid.\n\n   For example,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order. The string must follow the structure where 'a's come first, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check the Structure**: The string must strictly follow the order 'a's -> 'b's -> 'c's. This means once the string transitions from 'a' to 'b', it cannot revert back to 'a'. Similarly, after transitioning to 'c's, it cannot revert to 'a' or 'b'.\n2. **Count Characters**: Once the structure is confirmed, count the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n3. **Validate 'c' Count**: Ensure the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check the structure: a's followed by b's followed by c's\ncurrent_char = 'a'\nfor c in s:\n    if c < current_char:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n    if c == current_char:\n        continue\n    elif c == 'b':\n        current_char = 'b'\n    elif c == 'c':\n        current_char = 'c'\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\n# Now, check if all a's are before b's and b's before c's\nif any(c < 'b' for c in s[s.find('b'):]):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif any(c < 'c' for c in s[s.find('c'):]):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Count the number of a's, b's, c's\ncount_a = s.count('a')\ncount_b = s.count('b')\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\n# Check if count_c equals count_a or count_b\nif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Structure Check**: The code iterates through each character in the string to ensure the order is strictly 'a's -> 'b's -> 'c's. If any character violates this order, the string is invalid.\n- **Character Counting**: After confirming the structure, the code counts the occurrences of each character.\n- **Validation**: Finally, it checks if the number of 'c's matches either the number of 'a's or 'b's, ensuring the string meets the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the structural integrity and the required counts of characters, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.",
