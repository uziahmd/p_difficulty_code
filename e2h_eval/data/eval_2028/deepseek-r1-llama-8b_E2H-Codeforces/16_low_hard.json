Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Crazy Town,\" and from the description, it seems like it involves lines dividing a plane into regions, and moving between these regions with certain rules.\n\nHmm, the task is to find the minimum number of steps to get from the home block to the university block. Each step allows moving to an adjacent block that shares a border of non-zero length. So, the key here is understanding how the lines partition the plane and how the points lie in these regions.\n\nWait, but considering all possible lines and their intersections could be computationally expensive. The constraints say n can be up to 300, which is manageable but needs a smart approach.\n\nLet me think about what defines the regions. Each line divides the plane into two parts. When multiple lines intersect, they create more regions. The problem is about determining how many such lines separate the home point from the university point, because each such line would add a step.\n\nOh right! Because if you have k lines that separate your home and the university, then you'd need k steps to get from one to the other. Because each line adds a region you have to cross. But wait, maybe not exactly—because some lines might not contribute if they don't actually separate the two points.\n\nWait, let me think again. For any line that separates the home and the university, the minimal path would require crossing that line. So the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of such separating lines.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each such line creates a barrier that you must cross, and each crossing can only happen once per line. So for each line, if home and university are on opposite sides, then that line contributes to the count.\n\nSo the plan is: for each of the n roads, determine whether the home and university are on opposite sides. The total number of such roads is the answer.\n\nBut how do we check if two points are on opposite sides of a line?\n\nRight. For a line ax + by + c = 0, plugging in (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) will give two values. If the product is negative, the points are on opposite sides. Otherwise, they're on the same side or on the line (but the problem states they are not on any road, so no need to handle equality).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2).\n2. Read n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n3. For each line, compute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n   Compute f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n4. If f1 * f2 < 0, increment the count.\n5. Output the count as the minimal steps.\n\nThat seems straightforward. Let's test this logic with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\nHome: (1,1)\nUniversity: (-1,-1)\nn=2\nLines:\n0 1 0 → y=0\n1 0 0 → x=0\n\nFor the first line (y=0), home is at y=1 (positive), university at y=-1 (negative). So f1=1, f2=-1. Product is -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond line (x=0): home is x=1 (positive), university x=-1 (negative). Product is -1 <0 → count +=1. Total 2 steps. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are two lines that both separate the points, but another line doesn't. Then the count is 2.\n\nSo yes, this approach should work.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nWe'll read the home and university points. Then for each line, calculate the two function values and check their product.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- What if a line has a_i and b_i zero? Wait, no. The problem statement says that ai and bi are not both zero. So each line is valid.\n\nAnother edge case: when the product is zero. But the problem says that neither home nor university lie on any road, so f1 and f2 can't be zero. So no division by zero or anything.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead x1, y1 from first line.\nRead x2, y2 from second line.\nRead n.\nFor each of n lines:\n   Read a, b, c.\n   Compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n   Compute val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n   If val1 * val2 < 0 → increment count.\n\nPrint count.\n\nSo, in Python, that's manageable.\n\nNow, handling large numbers: x1, y1 can be up to 1e6, but multiplying by a, b (also up to 1e6",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. The town is divided by multiple lines, and each step allows moving to an adjacent block that shares a border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each line in Crazy Town divides the plane into two regions. The key insight is that if a line separates the home and the university, then it will take one step to cross that line. Therefore, the minimum number of steps required is equal to the number of such separating lines.\n2. **Line Separation Check**: For each line defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\), we check if the home and university points lie on opposite sides. This can be determined by evaluating the line equation at both points and checking if their results have opposite signs (i.e., their product is negative).\n3. **Efficiency**: Given the constraints, iterating through each line and performing the sign check is efficient enough.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    x1 = int(input[ptr])\n    y1 = int(input[ptr+1])\n    ptr +=2\n    x2 = int(input[ptr])\n    y2 = int(input[ptr+1])\n    ptr +=2\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(input[ptr])\n        b = int(input[ptr+1])\n        c = int(input[ptr+2])\n        ptr +=3\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count +=1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of lines and their respective coefficients.\n- **Line Evaluation**: For each line, the code evaluates the line equation at the home and university coordinates.\n- **Sign Check**: If the results of the evaluations have opposite signs, it indicates that the line separates the home and university, thus incrementing the count.\n- **Output**: The total count of such separating lines is printed, which represents the minimum number of steps required.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their geometric interpretations.",
