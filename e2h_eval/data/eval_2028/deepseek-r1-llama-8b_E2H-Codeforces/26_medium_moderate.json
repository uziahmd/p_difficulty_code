    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles that satisfy certain conditions based on given integers A, B, C, D.\n\nHmm, let me read the problem statement carefully again. Oh right, the triangle has sides x, y, z where A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle must be non-degenerate, meaning x + y > z. Because for a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since z is the largest here, checking x + y > z is sufficient.\n\nSo the task is to find all possible triplets (x, y, z) that meet these conditions and satisfy x + y > z.\n\nFirst, let's think about the constraints. A, B, C, D can be up to 5e5, which is 500,000. So any solution with O(N^3) time complexity is definitely out of the question. We need an efficient approach.\n\nLet me break down the problem. Since x is between A and B, y is between B and C, and z is between C and D. Also, x ≤ y ≤ z because of the ordering. Wait, no, the problem says x can be up to B, y starts at B and goes up to C, but wait, in the condition it's A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Oh right, so x can be as high as B, and y is at least B and at most C, and z is at least C and at most D.\n\nSo for each valid triplet (x, y, z), we have A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, C ≤ z ≤ D. Additionally, x ≤ y (since x can be up to B, y starts at B, so x ≤ y is always true). Similarly, y ≤ z is always true because y can be up to C, and z is at least C.\n\nWait, no: wait, y can be up to C, and z is at least C, so y ≤ z is also always true. So the only thing we need to check is x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of triplets (x, y, z) where:\n\n- A ≤ x ≤ B\n- B ≤ y ≤ C\n- C ≤ z ≤ D\n- x + y > z\n\nAnd all these are integers.\n\nNow, how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet's think about the variables. For each possible y, perhaps we can compute something. Or maybe for each possible x, then for each y, compute the range of z's that satisfy x + y > z, and then multiply by the count of such z's.\n\nBut considering that the ranges can be large, we need a way to calculate this quickly without iterating through all possibilities.\n\nAnother approach: since x is between A and B, y is between B and C, and z is between C and D, perhaps we can precompute some cumulative sums or use mathematical expressions to find the total count.\n\nWait, another observation: for each (x, y), the minimal z that satisfies x + y > z is z < x + y. Since z is at least C, the valid z's are from C to min(D, x + y - 1). Because if x + y -1 >= C, then the count is (min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1). Otherwise, there are no valid z's.\n\nSo for each (x, y), the number of z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nSo the total number of triangles is the sum over x in [A,B], y in [B,C], of max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1).\n\nBut calculating this directly would be too slow because x and y can each have up to 5e5 values, leading to 2.5e11 operations, which is impossible.\n\nSo we need a smarter way to compute this sum.\n\nLet me think about the constraints on x and y. Since x can be up to B, and y can be up to C, perhaps we can find a way to express the sum in terms of x and y ranges, but using mathematical functions instead of iterating.\n\nHmm. Let's consider that x ranges from x_min = A to x_max = B, and y ranges from y_min = B to y_max = C. For each (x, y), the contribution is the number of z's that are ≥ C and ≤ min(D, x+y-1).\n\nSo the contribution is:\n\nif x + y -1 >= C:\n\nnumber of z's = min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1\n\nelse:\n\n0\n\nSo the condition is x + y -1 >= C → x + y >= C + 1.\n\nSo for a given x and y, if x + y >= C + 1, then the number of z's is the count from C to min(D, x+y-1). Else, zero.\n\nSo the problem is to find the sum for all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], where x + y >= C + 1, of (min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1).\n\nThis seems tricky. Let's try to find a way to compute this efficiently.\n\nIdea: for a fixed x, find the range of y's where x + y >= C + 1. Then for each such y, compute the contribution.\n\nBut even that might be O(N^2), which is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: for each x, determine the minimal y such that x + y >= C + 1. Then, for y starting from that point up to C, compute the contribution.\n\nBut even this approach could be too slow because x can be up to 5e5 and for each x, y can be up to 5e5 as well.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find a way to represent this as a mathematical function and compute the sum using prefix sums or other techniques.\n\nLet me think about the expression x + y. For each x, the minimal y is max(B, (C + 1 - x)). Because y must be at least B, but also y must be at least (C + 1 - x) to satisfy x + y >= C + 1.\n\nSo for each x, the lower bound of y is y_low = max(B, C + 1 - x). The upper bound is y_high = C.\n\nIf y_low > y_high, then no contribution for this x.\n\nOtherwise, for each y in [y_low, y_high], the contribution is (min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1) = (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nSo for each x, the contribution is the sum for y from y_low to y_high of (min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1).\n\nLet me denote S(x) as the sum for all y in [y_low, y_high] of (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nWe need to compute the sum of S(x) for all x in [A, B].\n\nSo now the problem is to compute S(x) efficiently for each x, and then sum over x.\n\nLet me try to express S(x):\n\nS(x) = sum_{y = y_low}^{y_high} [ min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1 ]\n\nLet me make a substitution: k = y.\n\nThen S(x) = sum_{k = y_low}^{y_high} [ min(D, x + k - 1) - C + 1 ]\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nsum_{k} (min(D, x + k -1 ) - (C -1)) )\n\nSo S(x) = sum_{k} min(D, x + k -1) - (y_high - y_low + 1)(C - 1)\n\nBecause the second term is (C-1) added for each y in the range.\n\nSo the first part is the sum of min(D, x + k -1) for k from y_low to y_high.\n\nThe second part is subtracting (C-1) multiplied by the number of y's in the range.\n\nSo, for each x, compute the sum of min(D, x + k -1) for k in [y_low, y_high], then subtract (y_high - y_low + 1)*(C-1).\n\nNow, the key is to compute the sum of min(D, x + k -1) efficiently.\n\nLet me denote m = x + k -1.\n\nWait, for each k in [a, b], m = x +k -1.\n\nSo when k increases by 1, m increases by 1.\n\nSo the sum is sum_{m} min(D, m) for m in [x + a - 1, x + b -1], but only considering the k's that are within [a, b].\n\nWait, but wait: for k from a to b, m starts at x + a -1 and ends at x + b -1.\n\nBut for each m, if m <= D, then min is m. Else, it's D.\n\nSo the sum is the sum of m from s to t, where s = x + a -1, t = x + b -1, but capped at D.\n\nWait, more precisely:\n\nLet s = x + y_low - 1\n\nt = x + y_high - 1\n\nThen, the sum of min(D, m) for m from s to t is equal to:\n\nif s > D: sum is 0.\n\nelif t <= D: sum is sum from s to t, which is (t*(t+1)/2) - ((s-1)*s/2).\n\nelse: sum is sum from s to D plus sum from D+1 to t, but the latter is all D, so the count is (t - D) * D.\n\nWait, no. Because for m beyond D, the min is D, so the sum is D for each m from D+1 onwards.\n\nSo the sum is:\n\nif s > D: 0\n\nelif t <= D: (t(t+1)/2) - (s(s-1)/2)\n\nelse:\n\nsum from s to D: (D*(D+1)/2 - (s-1)s/2) \n\nplus the number of terms from D+1 to t multiplied by D.\n\nNumber of terms from D+1 to t is t - D.\n\nSo the total sum is:\n\nsum_part = (D*(D+1)//2 - (s-1)*s//2) + (t - D)*D\n\nBut wait, let's compute this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, the sum can be written as:\n\nsum = min(D, s) + min(D, s+1) + ... + min(D, t)\n\nWhich can be broken into two cases:\n\nCase 1: t <= D → sum is sum from s to t.\n\nCase 2: s <= D < t → sum is sum from s to D, plus (t - D) * D.\n\nCase 3: s > D → sum is 0.\n\nSo, for each x, we can compute s and t as:\n\ns = x + y_low - 1\n\nt = x + y_high - 1\n\nThen, compute the sum as per the above.\n\nOnce we have that sum, subtract (y_high - y_low + 1) * (C-1) to get S(x).\n\nThen, sum all S(x) for x in [A, B], but only for x where y_low <= y_high.\n\nWait, but for each x, we have to first check whether y_low <= y_high. If not, then S(x) is 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFor each x in [A, B]:\n\n1. Compute y_low = max(B, C+1 -x)\n   Because y has to be >= B, and x + y >= C+1 → y >= C+1 -x.\n\n2. Compute y_high = C.\n\n3. If y_low > y_high → continue (no contribution for this x)\n\n4. Else:\n\n   a. Compute s = x + y_low - 1\n\n   b. Compute t = x + y_high - 1\n\n   c. Compute the sum of min(D, m) for m from s to t.\n\n   d. Subtract (y_high - y_low + 1) * (C-1) → this is the S(x)\n\n5. Sum all S(x) across x in [A, B]\n\nSo the steps are manageable, but the challenge is to compute this for all x efficiently.\n\nNow, the issue is how to compute this for each x quickly.\n\nThe problem is that x can be up to 5e5, which is manageable as long as each iteration is O(1).\n\nSo let's proceed.\n\nLet me outline the steps for each x:\n\nCompute y_low and y_high.\n\nIf y_low > y_high: skip.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute s = x + y_low -1\n\nt = x + y_high -1\n\nCompute the sum from s to t of min(D, m).\n\nSo, how to compute that sum quickly.\n\nWe can write a helper function to compute this sum.\n\nLet me think about how to implement that.\n\nFunction compute_sum(s, t, D):\n\n    if s > D:\n\n        return 0\n\n    if t <= D:\n\n        return (t * (t + 1) // 2) - ((s - 1) * s // 2)\n\n    else:\n\n        # sum from s to D, plus (t - D) * D\n\n        sum_s_to_D = (D * (D + 1) // 2) - ((s -1) * s // 2)\n\n        sum_rest = (t - D) * D\n\n        return sum_s_to_D + sum_rest\n\nYes, that should handle all cases.\n\nOnce we have that, for each x, we compute s and t, call this function, then subtract (y_high - y_low + 1) * (C-1) to get S(x).\n\nThen, sum all S(x) for x in [A, B].\n\nNow, the next step is to loop through each x from A to B, perform these calculations, and accumulate the total.\n\nBut wait, the constraints are up to 5e5, so for each x, the calculations are O(1), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the overall time complexity is O(B - A + 1), which is up to 5e5 steps, which is manageable.\n\nBut wait, what about the cases where A=B=5e5? Then it's 5e5 iterations, each taking O(1) time. That's acceptable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor x in A to B inclusive:\n\n   y_low = max(B, C + 1 - x)\n\n   y_high = C\n\n   if y_low > y_high:\n\n       continue\n\n   num_y = y_high - y_low + 1\n\n   s = x + y_low - 1\n\n   t = x + y_high - 1\n\n   sum_z = compute_sum(s, t, D)\n\n   S_x = sum_z - (num_y) * (C - 1)\n\n   total += S_x\n\nReturn total\n\nWait, but wait! Because C can be up to 5e5, and (C-1) can be up to 5e5, but in the code, for each x, it's multiplied by the number of y's, which could be up to 5e5. So the product can be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11, which fits into a 64-bit integer, but in Python, integers can handle that.\n\nWait, but what if C is zero? No, the problem statement says 1 <= A <= B <= C <= D, so C is at least 1. So no issues with negative numbers.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the input is four integers A, B, C, D where 1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D ≤ 5e5.\n\nSo, the code needs to process these.\n\nWait, but let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: '1 2 3 4'\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nLet's compute for x=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3+1 -1=3) → max(2,3)=3.\n\ny_high =3.\n\nSo y ranges from 3 to 3.\n\ns =1+3-1=3.\n\nt=1+3-1=3.\n\nsum_z is min(4,3)=3. So sum_z =3.\n\nnum_y=1.\n\nS_x=3 - (1)*(3-1) =3-2=1.\n\nSo contributes 1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3+1 -2=2) → 2.\n\ny_high=3.\n\ny ranges from 2 to 3.\n\ns=2+2-1=3.\n\nt=2+3-1=4.\n\nsum_z is sum from 3 to4, min(4, m).\n\nWhich is 3+4=7.\n\nnum_y=2.\n\nS_x=7 - 2*(3-1) =7-4=3.\n\nTotal becomes 1+3=4.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother sample: '1 2 2 5'\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nx ranges from 1 to 2.\n\nx=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 2+1-1=2) → 2.\n\ny_high=2.\n\ns=1+2-1=2.\n\nt=1+2-1=2.\n\nsum_z: min(5, 2)=2.\n\nnum_y=1.\n\nS_x=2 - 1*(2-1) → 2-1=1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(2, 2+1-2=1) → 2.\n\ny_high=2.\n\ns=2+2-1=3.\n\nt=2+2-1=3.\n\nsum_z: min(5,3)=3.\n\nnum_y=1.\n\nS_x=3 - 1*(2-1)=3-1=2.\n\nTotal 1+2=3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThird sample: '500000 500000 500000 500000'\n\nSo x can only be 500000.\n\ny_low = max(500000, 500000 +1 -500000) → max(5e5, 1) →5e5.\n\ny_high=5e5.\n\ns=5e5 +5e5 -1 = 999999.\n\nt= same as s.\n\nsum_z is min(5e5, 999999) →5e5.\n\nnum_y=1.\n\nS_x=5e5 - 1*(5e5-1) →5e5 -499999 =1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the logic works.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nIn Python, reading the input as four integers.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a single line, four integers, space-separated.\n\nSo, the code can read via input().split().\n\nBut sometimes, when the input is from a file, it's better to read via sys.stdin.\n\nBut for the purposes of the problem, the code can read via input(), split into four parts, convert to integers.\n\nThen, the code proceeds as described.\n\nSo, the code structure:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute the total as follows:\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor x in range(A, B+1):\n\n    y_low = max(B, C + 1 - x)\n\n    y_high = C\n\n    if y_low > y_high:\n\n        continue\n\n    num_y = y_high - y_low + 1\n\n    s = x + y_low - 1\n\n    t = x + y_high - 1\n\n    # compute sum_z\n\n    if s > D:\n\n        sum_z = 0\n\n    elif t <= D:\n\n        sum_z = (t*(t+1)//2) - ((s-1)*s//2)\n\n    else:\n\n        # sum from s to D, plus (t-D)*D\n\n        sum_s_D = (D*(D+1)//2) - ((s-1)*s//2)\n\n        sum_rest = (t - D) * D\n\n        sum_z = sum_s_D + sum_rest\n\n    # compute S_x\n\n    S_x = sum_z - num_y * (C - 1)\n\n    total += S_x\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but in the code, for each x, we have to compute this.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input 1, the code correctly returns 4.\n\nSimilarly, other samples.\n\nBut let me think about another case.\n\nSuppose A=1, B=3, C=4, D=10.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ny_low = max(3, 4+1 -1=4) →4.\n\ny_high=4.\n\ns=1+4-1=4.\n\nt=1+4-1=4.\n\nsum_z =4.\n\nnum_y=1.\n\nS_x=4 -1*(4-1) =4-3=1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(3,4+1 -2=3) →3.\n\ny_high=4.\n\ny ranges from 3 to4.\n\ns=2+3-1=4.\n\nt=2+4-1=5.\n\nsum_z is sum from 4 to5, but D is 10, which is larger.\n\nSo sum_z is 4+5=9.\n\nnum_y=2.\n\nS_x=9 - 2*3=9-6=3.\n\nx=3:\n\ny_low =max(3,4+1-3=2) →3.\n\ny_high=4.\n\ny ranges from3 to4.\n\ns=3+3-1=5.\n\nt=3+4-1=6.\n\nsum_z=5+6=11.\n\nnum_y=2.\n\nS_x=11 - 2*3=5.\n\nTotal is 1+3+5=9.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nLet me list all possible triplets.\n\nx can be 1,2,3.\n\ny can be 3,4.\n\nWait, for x=1:\n\ny=4.\n\nz must be >=4, <= min(10, 1+4-1=4).\n\nSo z can be4.\n\nSo one triangle.\n\nx=2:\n\ny=3: z can be >=4, <= min(10, 2+3-1=4). So z=4.\n\ny=4: z can be >=4, <= min(10,2+4-1=5). So z can be4,5.\n\nSo two triangles.\n\nx=3:\n\ny=3: z can be >=4, <= min(10,3+3-1=5). So z=4,5 → two options.\n\ny=4: z can be >=4, <= min(10,3+4-1=6). So 4,5,6 → three options.\n\nSo for x=3, 2+3=5 triangles.\n\nTotal: 1+2+5=8. Wait, but according to our code, it's 9.\n\nHmm, that's a discrepancy. So perhaps the code is wrong.\n\nWait, why is there a difference?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in manual calculation.\n\nWait, for x=2 and y=3:\n\nz must be >=4, and z < 2+3=5 → z can be4 only.\n\nSo for y=3, one option.\n\nFor y=4: z can be4,5 → two options.\n\nSo x=2 contributes 1+2=3.\n\nx=3:\n\ny=3: z can be4,5 → two options.\n\ny=4: z can be4,5,6 → three options.\n\nSo x=3 contributes 2+3=5.\n\nx=1: contributes 1.\n\nTotal 1+3+5=9.\n\nBut according to the code, the result is 9.\n\nWait, but according to the manual calculation, the total is 9.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial manual calculation was wrong.\n\nSo the code seems to handle this case correctly.\n\nAnother test case: what if x is 5, y is 5, C=5, D=5.\n\nThen x + y =10, which is larger than C=5.\n\nz must be >=5, <= min(5, 10-1=9) →5.\n\nSo z can only be5.\n\nSo the contribution is 1.\n\nBut according to the code:\n\ny_low = max(5, 5+1-5=1) →5.\n\ny_high=5.\n\ns=5+5-1=9.\n\nt=5+5-1=9.\n\nsum_z: min(5,9) is5.\n\nsum_z=5.\n\nnum_y=1.\n\nS_x=5 -1*(5-1) →5-4=1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: A=2, B=3, C=4, D=5.\n\nFor x=2:\n\ny_low = max(3,4+1-2=3) →3.\n\ny_high=4.\n\ns=2+3-1=4.\n\nt=2+4-1=5.\n\nsum_z is sum of min(5,4) and min(5,5).\n\nSo 4+5=9.\n\nnum_y=2.\n\nS_x=9 - 2*3=9-6=3.\n\nx=3:\n\ny_low = max(3,4+1-3=2) →3.\n\ny_high=4.\n\ns=3+3-1=5.\n\nt=3+4-1=6.\n\nsum_z is 5 (since D=5) and 5 again. So sum is5+5=10.\n\nnum_y=2.\n\nS_x=10 - 2*3=10-6=4.\n\nTotal:3+4=7.\n\nManually:\n\nx=2, y=3: z can be4,5 →2 options.\n\ny=4: z can be4,5 →2 options.\n\nTotal 4.\n\nx=3, y=3: z can be4,5 →2 options.\n\ny=4: z can be4,5,6 (but D=5, so only 4,5) →2 options.\n\nTotal 4.\n\nSo total 4+4=8. Hmm, but code says 3+4=7.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, let's re-examine.\n\nWait, for x=2:\n\ny can be3 or4.\n\nFor y=3: z can be4,5.\n\nSo 2 options.\n\nFor y=4: z can be4,5.\n\nSo 2 options.\n\nTotal 4.\n\nx=3:\n\ny=3: z can be4,5 →2.\n\ny=4: z can be4,5 →2.\n\nTotal 4.\n\nSo overall 4+4=8.\n\nBut code gives 3+4=7. So something's wrong.\n\nHmm, what's wrong?\n\nWait, in the code, for x=2:\n\ns =2 +3-1=4.\n\nt=2+4-1=5.\n\nsum_z is sum of min(5,4) and min(5,5): 4+5=9.\n\nnum_y=2.\n\nS_x=9 - 2*(4-1)=9-6=3.\n\nSo why is that?\n\nWait, because the code computes for y=3, the contribution is min(5,4) =4, and for y=4, it's min(5,5)=5.\n\nSum_z is 4+5=9.\n\nBut the number of y's is 2, so S_x=9 - 2*(4-1) →9-6=3.\n\nBut in reality, each y contributes a certain number of z's. For y=3, 2 z's; for y=4, 2 z's. So total 4.\n\nBut according to the code, it's 3. So the code is incorrect.\n\nWait, what's wrong here.\n\nAh, I see.\n\nBecause the formula for S_x is sum_z minus (C-1)*num_y.\n\nBut C is 4, so C-1 is 3.\n\nBut in the case of x=2, y=3: z can be4,5. Which is 2 options.\n\nSo for each y, the number of z's is (min(D, x+y-1) - C +1).\n\nFor y=3: min(5,4) is4. So 4-4 +1=1.\n\nWait, wait: wait, the code calculates sum_z as 4+5=9, which is the sum of min(D, x+y-1) for each y.\n\nBut for each y, the number of z's is min(D, x+y-1) - C +1.\n\nSo for y=3: 4 -4 +1=1.\n\nFor y=4:5 -4 +1=2.\n\nTotal is 3, which matches the code's S_x=3.\n\nWait, but earlier manual calculation shows that for x=2, y=3, there are 2 z's (4,5), but according to this formula, it's 1.\n\nHmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake in understanding the formula.\n\nWait, for a given y, the number of z's is the count of integers z where C ≤ z ≤ min(D, x + y -1).\n\nSo for y=3, x=2: x+y-1=2+3-1=4. So z can be from4 to4 (since D=5 is larger than 4, but z is limited to 4).\n\nSo z can be4. So one option.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought z could be4 and5. Why?\n\nBecause z is between C=4 and min(D, x+y-1=4). So 4 ≤ z ≤4.\n\nOnly 4 is allowed. So one option.\n\nBut earlier, I thought z can be4 and5. That was wrong.\n\nSo for x=2, y=3: z can be4 →1 option.\n\nFor y=4: x+y-1=2+4-1=5. So z can be4,5 →2 options.\n\nSo total for x=2 is1+2=3, which matches the code.\n\nSo earlier manual calculation was wrong.\n\nSo in that case, the code is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code will pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\) holds. A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Given the constraints, we need an efficient approach to avoid excessive computations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints and Conditions**: The sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) must satisfy \\(A \\leq x \\leq B\\), \\(B \\leq y \\leq C\\), and \\(C \\leq z \\leq D\\). Additionally, for a non-degenerate triangle, \\(x + y > z\\).\n2. **Range Analysis**: For each valid \\(x\\) in the range \\([A, B]\\), determine the valid range of \\(y\\) such that \\(x + y \\geq C + 1\\). This ensures \\(z\\) can be chosen such that \\(x + y > z\\).\n3. **Sum Calculation**: For each valid pair \\((x, y)\\), compute the number of valid \\(z\\) values. This is done by calculating the sum of the minimum values of \\(z\\) that satisfy the triangle inequality.\n4. **Efficient Summation**: Use mathematical expressions to efficiently compute the sum of valid \\(z\\) values for each \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), avoiding direct iteration over all possible values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef compute_sum(s, t, D):\n    if s > D:\n        return 0\n    if t <= D:\n        return (t * (t + 1) // 2) - ((s - 1) * s // 2)\n    else:\n        sum_s_D = (D * (D + 1) // 2) - ((s - 1) * s // 2)\n        sum_rest = (t - D) * D\n        return sum_s_D + sum_rest\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, input_line.split())\n    \n    total = 0\n    for x in range(A, B + 1):\n        y_low = max(B, C + 1 - x)\n        y_high = C\n        if y_low > y_high:\n            continue\n        num_y = y_high - y_low + 1\n        s = x + y_low - 1\n        t = x + y_high - 1\n        sum_z = compute_sum(s, t, D)\n        S_x = sum_z - num_y * (C - 1)\n        total += S_x\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\).\n2. **Loop Through x Values**: For each \\(x\\) in the range \\([A, B]\\), compute the valid range for \\(y\\) such that \\(x + y \\geq C + 1\\).\n3. **Compute Valid z Values**: For each valid \\(y\\), compute the range of \\(z\\) values using the `compute_sum` function, which efficiently sums the minimum valid \\(z\\) values.\n4. **Accumulate Results**: Sum the contributions of each valid \\((x, y)\\) pair to get the total number of non-degenerate triangles.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count valid triangles without iterating over all possible combinations, making the solution feasible even for large input sizes.",
