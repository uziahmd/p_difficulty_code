    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles that satisfy certain conditions based on given integers A, B, C, D.\n\nHmm, let me read the problem statement carefully again. Oh right, the triangle has sides x, y, z where A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle must be non-degenerate, meaning x + y > z. Because for a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x <= y <= z, checking x + y > z is sufficient.\n\nSo the task is to find all possible triplets (x, y, z) that meet these conditions and satisfy x + y > z.\n\nFirst, let's think about the constraints. A, B, C, D can be up to 5e5, which is 500,000. So any solution with O(N^3) time complexity is definitely out of the question. We need an efficient approach.\n\nLet me break down the problem. Since x is between A and B, y is between B and C, and z is between C and D. Also, x ≤ y ≤ z.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says x ≤ y because of the inequalities A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z. So yes, x is at most B, y is at least B, so x can't be larger than y. Similarly, y is at most C, and z is at least C.\n\nBut wait, the way it's written is A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z. So x can be up to B, y starts from B, and y can be up to C. Similarly, z starts from C up to D.\n\nSo the variables are constrained as x ranges from A to B, y ranges from max(B, x) to C, and z ranges from max(C, y) to D. But since x <= y and y <= z, the ranges are more structured.\n\nWait no, actually, the problem statement specifies that x is ≤ B, y is ≥ B, and so on. So x can be anything from A to B, y is from B to C, and z is from C to D. But also, x must be ≤ y, because the condition is x ≤ B ≤ y. So x is up to B, y is at least B, so x ≤ y holds automatically.\n\nSo for each possible x in [A, B], y can be in [max(B, x), C], and z can be in [C, D]. But wait, no, because y can be up to C, but z can be up to D, which is ≥ C. So for each x and y, z can be from C to D, but with the condition that x + y > z.\n\nSo the approach is to iterate over all possible x, y, z within their ranges, but that's not feasible directly because the ranges can be up to 5e5, and iterating through all possible triplets would be O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)*(D-C+1)), which could be way too slow if the ranges are large.\n\nWe need a smarter way to calculate the number of valid (x, y, z) triplets without enumerating each one.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the count efficiently.\n\nThe key is to fix x and y, then find the number of z's that satisfy z < x + y and z ≥ C. Because z is in [C, D], so the lower bound is C, and the upper bound is min(D, x + y - 1). Because z has to be less than x + y.\n\nSo for each x and y, the number of valid z's is the maximum of zero and (upper_bound - lower_bound + 1). Where upper_bound = min(D, x + y - 1), and lower_bound = C.\n\nSo for each x in [A, B], and for each y in [B, C], if y >= x, then compute how many z's are there between C and min(D, x+y-1).\n\nBut even that approach would require iterating through each x and y, which can be up to 5e5 each, leading to 2.5e11 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo we need to find a mathematical way to compute the sum without iterating each x and y.\n\nLet me reorganize the problem. Let's consider x and y such that x is in [A, B], y is in [y_min, C], where y_min is max(B, x). But since x can vary, perhaps we can find a way to group terms or find a formula that can compute the sum across all x and y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can precompute some values or use prefix sums.\n\nWait, another observation: since z has to be >= C and <= D, and also z < x + y. So for a given x and y, the number of z's is max(0, min(x + y - 1, D) - C + 1) if x + y > C. Otherwise, zero.\n\nBut since x is at least A, which is >=1, and y is at least B, which is >= A, so x + y is at least A + B. But C can be as small as B (since B <= C). So for cases where C is very small, x + y could be larger than C, but for others, maybe not.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to split the problem into two parts:\n\nFor each x in [A, B], and for each y in [y_start, y_end], compute the number of valid z's.\n\nBut again, iterating for each x and y is not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: For fixed x, find the range of y's that when combined with x, give a certain number of z's.\n\nWait, but that might not help directly.\n\nLet me think about the constraints on x, y, and z.\n\nz must be >= C, and z < x + y. So z can be from C to min(D, x + y - 1). So the count is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y > C.\n\nSo for each (x, y), the contribution is:\n\nif x + y > C:\n   cnt_z = min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1\nelse:\n   cnt_z = 0\n\nSo the total is the sum over x in [A,B], y in [B,C], y >= x, and x + y > C of (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nLet me try to express the sum in terms of x and y. So for each x, we can compute the sum over y in [y_min, y_max] where y >= x and y >= B, and y <= C, and x + y > C.\n\nWait, but y is between B and C, and y >= x. So y must be >= max(B, x).\n\nSo for a fixed x, the y's start from max(B, x) and go up to C. But also, for each y, x + y must be > C. So y must be > C - x.\n\nSo for each x, the y's that contribute are those in [y_start, y_end], where y_start is max(max(B, x), (C - x + 1)) ), and y_end is min(C, ... )\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nFor a fixed x, the y must satisfy:\n\ny >= max(B, x)\n\ny <= C\n\nand x + y > C → y > C - x.\n\nSo y must be >= max(B, x, C - x + 1).\n\nAnd also, y <= C.\n\nIf the lower bound for y is higher than C, then there are no y's for that x.\n\nSo for each x, the valid y's are in [y_low, C], where y_low = max(B, x, C - x + 1).\n\nBut only if y_low <= C.\n\nOtherwise, no contribution.\n\nSo the steps for each x are:\n\n1. Compute y_low = max(B, x, C - x + 1)\n\n2. If y_low > C → no y's for this x → continue.\n\n3. Else, the number of y's is (C - y_low + 1).\n\nFor each such y, compute the number of z's.\n\nWait, but for each y, the number of z's depends on x and y.\n\nSo the contribution for each x is the sum over y in [y_low, C] of (number of z's for that y).\n\nSo for each x, the contribution is:\n\nsum_{y = y_low}^{C} max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1 )\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nsum_{y = y_low}^{C} [ if x + y - 1 < D → (x + y - 1 - C + 1) else (D - C + 1) ]\n\nSo, the term inside is:\n\nif x + y - 1 <= D → (x + y - 1 - C + 1) = (x + y - C)\nelse → (D - C + 1)\n\nSo, the term is (x + y - C) if x + y <= D, else (D - C + 1).\n\nSo for each x, the sum over y is:\n\nsum_y [ (x + y - C) if y <= (D - x) else (D - C + 1) ]\n\nBut y can be up to C. So depending on whether (D - x) is >= C or not, the condition changes.\n\nSo let's find the threshold y_val = D - x.\n\nIf y_val >= C, then for all y in [y_low, C], x + y <= D → condition is satisfied, so each term is (x + y - C).\n\nElse, for y <= y_val → (x + y - C), for y > y_val → (D - C + 1).\n\nSo the sum can be broken into two parts:\n\nCase 1: y_val >= C → all y in [y_low, C] contribute (x + y - C).\n\nCase 2: y_val < C → split into y <= y_val and y > y_val.\n\nSo let's handle these cases.\n\nLet me compute for each x:\n\nCompute y_low = max(B, x, C - x + 1)\n\nIf y_low > C → no contribution.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute y_val = D - x\n\nCompute:\n\nsum_y = 0\n\nif y_val >= C:\n\n   sum_y = sum_{y=y_low to C} (x + y - C)\n\nelse:\n\n   sum_y = sum_{y=y_low to y_val} (x + y - C) + sum_{y=y_val + 1 to C} (D - C + 1)\n\nSo now, for each x, we can compute sum_y using these formulas.\n\nNow, the next step is to find a way to compute these sums efficiently.\n\nLet's look at case 1: y_val >= C.\n\nIn this case, for all y in [y_low, C], the term is (x + y - C) = (y - (C - x)).\n\nSo the sum is sum_{y = a}^b (y) - (C - x)(b - a + 1), where a = y_low, b = C.\n\nSum of y from a to b is (b*(b+1)/2) - ((a-1)*a/2) ) = (b(b+1) - (a-1)a ) / 2.\n\nSo the sum becomes:\n\nsum = [ (b(b+1) - (a-1)a ) / 2 ] - (C - x) * (b - a + 1 )\n\nCase 1: sum_y = [sum of y from a to b] - (C - x) * (count).\n\nCase 2: y_val < C.\n\nSo we have two parts.\n\nFirst part: y from a to y_val → sum (x + y - C) = sum y from a to y_val minus (C -x) * (y_val - a + 1).\n\nSecond part: y from y_val + 1 to C → sum (D - C + 1) for (C - y_val) terms.\n\nSo sum_y = [sum y from a to y_val - (C -x)(y_val - a + 1)] + (D - C + 1) * (C - y_val).\n\nSo, to compute each x's contribution, we need to calculate either case 1 or case 2.\n\nNow, the question is how to loop over x from A to B, and for each x, compute a, b, etc., and calculate the sum.\n\nBut given that A, B can be up to 5e5, looping through each x could be manageable if the per x computation is O(1).\n\nSo let's see.\n\nThe plan is:\n\nLoop x from A to B:\n\n   compute y_low = max(B, x, C - x + 1)\n\n   if y_low > C → continue\n\n   else:\n\n      compute y_val = D - x\n\n      if y_val >= C:\n\n          a = y_low\n\n          b = C\n\n          num_terms = b - a + 1\n\n          sum_part = (b*(b+1) // 2 - (a-1)*a//2) - (C - x) * num_terms\n\n          add sum_part to the total.\n\n      else:\n\n          a = y_low\n\n          b = y_val\n\n          if a > b:\n\n              first_sum = 0\n\n          else:\n\n              first_sum = (b*(b+1)//2 - (a-1)*a//2) - (C - x) * (b - a + 1)\n\n          second_sum = (D - C + 1) * (C - b - 1)\n\n          sum_part = first_sum + second_sum\n\n          add sum_part to the total.\n\nSo, the per x computation is O(1), and since x can be up to 5e5, the total time is O(5e5), which is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, what about when x is very large? For example, x could be up to B, which could be up to 5e5.\n\nBut D can also be up to 5e5, so y_val = D - x could be as low as zero, but that's okay.\n\nNow, the main thing is to correctly compute a, b, y_val, etc.\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 1 2 3 4\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nSo for each x from 1 to 2:\n\nx=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 1, 3 -1 +1 ) → max(2,1,3) → 3.\n\nIs y_low (3) <= C (3) → yes.\n\ny_val = 4 - 1 =3.\n\nSince y_val (3) >= C (3) → case1.\n\na=3, b=3.\n\nnum_terms=1.\n\nsum_part = (3*4//2 - (2*3//2)) - (3-1)*1 → (6 -3) -2*1 → 3-2=1.\n\nSo contributes 1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(2,2, 3-2+1) → max(2,2,2) → 2.\n\ny_val=4-2=2.\n\nSince 2 <3 → case2.\n\na=2, b=2.\n\nfirst_sum: y from 2 to 2 → sum is 2.\n\nminus (3-2)*(2-2+1)=1*1=1.\n\nso first_sum is 2-1=1.\n\nsecond_sum: (4-3+1) * (3-2-1) → (2) *0=0.\n\nsum_part=1+0=1.\n\nSo total is 1+1=2.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the output is 4. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, wait, let's see. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the sample input says that the output is 4.\n\nWait, according to my calculation, x=1 contributes 1, x=2 contributes 1, total 2. That's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the sample analysis.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nWait, in the first sample, the correct triplets are:\n\n(1,3,3): 1+3>3 →4>3 yes.\n\n(2,2,3): 2+2>3 →4>3 yes.\n\n(2,3,3): 2+3>3 yes.\n\n(2,3,4): 2+3>4 →5>4 yes.\n\nSo four triplets.\n\nSo why did the code compute 2?\n\nAh, I see. Because when x=1, y can be 3, and z can be 3 (only 1 option). So the code counts 1 for x=1.\n\nWhen x=2, y can be 2 and 3.\n\nFor y=2: z can be 3 (since 2+2>3 →4>3). So 1 option.\n\nFor y=3: z can be 3 and 4, but since z must be >=3, but x+y=5>3. So z can be 3,4 → 2 options.\n\nWait, no, because in the code, for x=2, y=3:\n\ny_val = D - x =4-2=2. So case2.\n\na =2, b=2. So first_sum is for y=2.\n\nThen, second_sum is for y from 3 to 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the case2 calculation.\n\nWait, let's re-calculate for x=2.\n\ny_low = max(2, 2, 3-2+1=2) →2.\n\ny_val =4-2=2.\n\nSo since y_val (2) < C (3), case2.\n\na=2, b=2.\n\nSo first_sum is for y=2.\n\nsum(y) from 2 to 2 is 2.\n\nsubtract (3-2)*(2-2+1) =1*1=1.\n\nso first_sum is 2-1=1.\n\nThen, second_sum is (4-3+1) * (3-2-1) = 2 *0=0.\n\nSo sum_part is 1+0=1.\n\nBut when y=3, it's in the second part.\n\nWait, because y_val is 2, so y starts from 2 to 2 for the first sum, and from 3 to 3 for the second sum.\n\nWait, no. In case2, y_val is D -x=2.\n\nSo y can be up to y_val=2, but since y starts at 2, the first sum is for y=2.\n\nThe second sum is for y from y_val+1=3 to C=3.\n\nSo for y=3, it's included in the second sum.\n\nSo for y=3, the term is (D - C +1) = (4-3+1)=2.\n\nSo the second sum is 2 * (3-2) = 2 *1=2.\n\nSo the sum_part is 1 (from y=2) + 2 (from y=3) → total 3.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake in the earlier calculation. So the code needs to compute both parts correctly.\n\nSo let's re-examine the case2:\n\nsum_part = first_sum + second_sum.\n\nWhere first_sum is for y from a to b (y_val), and second_sum is for y from y_val+1 to C.\n\nSo in the case where x=2:\n\ny_low=2, y_val=2.\n\nSo first sum: y from 2 to 2 → contributes 1 (as before).\n\nsecond_sum: y from 3 to 3 → 1 term.\n\nEach term in second_sum contributes (D - C +1) = 2.\n\nSo second_sum is 2 *1=2.\n\nSo sum_part is 1+2=3.\n\nSo for x=2, the contribution is 3.\n\nSo overall, x=1 contributes 1, x=2 contributes 3 → total 4, which matches the sample.\n\nAh, so I see where I went wrong earlier. In the case2, I forgot to include the second part for y beyond y_val.\n\nSo the code's logic is correct, but I made a mistake in the manual calculation.\n\nSo the plan is solid.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this.\n\nWe'll loop x from A to B:\n\nfor x in range(A, B+1):\n\n   compute y_low = max(B, x, (C -x +1))\n\n   if y_low > C → continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      y_val = D -x\n\n      if y_val >= C:\n\n          a = y_low\n\n          b = C\n\n          num_terms = b - a +1\n\n          sum_part = (b*(b+1)//2 - (a-1)*a//2) - (C -x)*num_terms\n\n      else:\n\n          a = y_low\n\n          b = y_val\n\n          # first part: a to b\n\n          if a > b:\n\n              first_part =0\n\n          else:\n\n              first_part = (b*(b+1)//2 - (a-1)*a//2) - (C -x)*(b -a +1)\n\n          # second part: y_val+1 to C\n\n          count_second = C - (y_val +1) +1 → C - y_val\n\n          second_part = (D - C +1) * count_second\n\n          sum_part = first_part + second_part\n\n      total += sum_part\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nTest case 3:\n\nInput:500000 500000 500000 500000.\n\nSo A=B=C=D=5e5.\n\nx can only be 5e5.\n\ny_low = max(5e5,5e5, 5e5 -5e5 +1) →5e5.\n\ny_val =5e5 -5e5=0 < C=5e5 → case2.\n\na=5e5, b=0 → invalid, so first_part is 0.\n\nsecond_part: y from 0+1=1 to 5e5.\n\nBut wait, C is 5e5, so y can't exceed 5e5.\n\nWait, no: y is in [B, C], which is [5e5, 5e5], so y can only be 5e5.\n\nSo in this case, y_val =0, which is less than C=5e5.\n\nSo for y in a=5e5, which is y_low, but y_val is 0, so a > b.\n\nSo first_part is 0.\n\nThen, second_part: y runs from 0+1=1 to 5e5.\n\nBut wait, y can't be less than y_low, which is 5e5.\n\nSo in this case, the second_part is for y from 5e5 +1 to 5e5 → which is empty. So second_part is 0.\n\nThus, sum_part is 0.\n\nBut wait, wait: no. Because y_low is 5e5, and y_val is 0.\n\nSo in case2, the first sum is for a to b, where a=5e5, b=0 → a >b → first_part is 0.\n\nThe second sum is for y from 1 to 5e5 → but y must be >= y_low=5e5.\n\nSo the second sum is for y from 5e5+1 to 5e5, which is nothing.\n\nSo sum_part is 0.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because for x=5e5, y can be 5e5, and z can be 5e5.\n\nBecause x + y = 5e5 +5e5 =1e6 >5e5.\n\nSo z can be from 5e5 to min(D, x+y-1)=5e5 to 999999.\n\nBut D is 5e5, so z can only be 5e5.\n\nSo for this x and y, the count is 1.\n\nSo why isn't the code counting it?\n\nBecause in the code, for x=5e5:\n\ny_low = max(5e5,5e5, (5e5 -5e5 +1)) →5e5.\n\ny_val =5e5 -5e5=0 < C=5e5.\n\nSo case2.\n\na=5e5, b=0 → first_part is 0.\n\nsecond_part: y runs from 1 to 5e5.\n\nBut y must be >= y_low=5e5.\n\nSo y starts at 5e5.\n\nSo for y=5e5, the term is (D - C +1) → (5e5 -5e5 +1)=1.\n\nSo for y=5e5, the term is 1.\n\nSo how does the code compute this?\n\nIn case2:\n\nsecond_part is (D - C +1) multiplied by (C - y_val).\n\nBut y_val is 0, so C - y_val is 5e5.\n\nBut that's not correct because y can't be beyond C.\n\nWait, wait. No.\n\nIn case2, the second sum is for y from y_val +1 to C.\n\nBut y_val is D -x =0.\n\nSo the range is 1 to C=5e5.\n\nBut y must be >= y_low=5e5.\n\nSo for y in [5e5,5e5], which is just y=5e5.\n\nSo in the second sum, the number of terms is (5e5 - (y_val +1) +1) = 5e5 -1 +1 =5e5.\n\nBut wait, that's incorrect because y can't be larger than C.\n\nSo the correct way is:\n\nthe second sum is for y from y_val +1 to C, but y can't be less than y_low.\n\nSo the actual range is max(y_val +1, y_low) to C.\n\nSo the count is max(0, C - max(y_val +1, y_low) +1).\n\nBut in the code, the current logic is:\n\ncount_second = C - (y_val +1) +1 → but this would be incorrect if y_val +1 > C.\n\nSo for the sample case 3, y_val +1 is 1, which is less than C=5e5.\n\nBut y must be >= y_low=5e5.\n\nSo the correct range is y from 5e5 to 5e5 → one term.\n\nSo the code's current logic is incorrect.\n\nAh! So the code needs to adjust for the overlap between y_val and y_low.\n\nSo in case2, the second sum is for y from (y_val +1) to C, but also y must be >= y_low.\n\nSo the actual starting point is max(y_val +1, y_low).\n\nSo the count is max(0, C - max(y_val +1, y_low) +1).\n\nSo in code, the second part should be computed as:\n\nstart_second = y_val + 1\n\nend_second = C\n\nstart_second = max(start_second, y_low)\n\nif start_second > end_second:\n\n    second_part = 0\n\nelse:\n\n    count_second = end_second - start_second +1\n\n    second_part = (D - C +1) * count_second\n\nSo in the sample case3:\n\nstart_second = 0+1=1\n\nend_second=5e5.\n\nstart_second after max is max(1,5e5)=5e5.\n\nend_second=5e5.\n\ncount_second=1.\n\nsecond_part=1 *1=1.\n\nSo sum_part is 0 (first_part) +1=1.\n\nSo the code will add 1 to the total, which is correct.\n\nSo the code needs to be adjusted to account for this.\n\nThis suggests that in the case2 handling, the code must compute the second sum correctly, considering the y_low.\n\nSo the corrected code for case2 is:\n\nif y_val < C:\n\n   a = y_low\n\n   b = y_val\n\n   if a > b:\n\n       first_part =0\n\n   else:\n\n       first_part = (b*(b+1)//2 - (a-1)*a//2) - (C -x)*(b -a +1)\n\n   # second part:\n\n   start_second = y_val +1\n\n   end_second = C\n\n   start_second = max(start_second, y_low)\n\n   if start_second > end_second:\n\n       second_part =0\n\n   else:\n\n       count_second = end_second - start_second +1\n\n       second_part = (D - C +1) * count_second\n\n   sum_part = first_part + second_part\n\nSo, this is a crucial correction.\n\nAnother test case: sample 2.\n\nInput:1 2 2 5.\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nSo for x in 1,2.\n\nx=1:\n\ny_low = max(2,1, 2-1+1=2) →2.\n\ny_val=5-1=4.\n\nSince y_val (4) >= C (2) → case1.\n\na=2, b=2.\n\nsum_part = (2*3//2 - (1*2//2)) - (2-1)*(1) → (3 -1) -1*1=2-1=1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(2,2, 2-2+1=1) →2.\n\ny_val=5-2=3.\n\nSince 3 >=2 → case1.\n\na=2, b=2.\n\nsum_part=(2*3//2 - (1*2//2)) - (2-2)*(1) → (3-1) -0=2.\n\nTotal is 1+2=3, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works here.\n\nAnother test case: when x + y <= C.\n\nSuppose x=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nWait, for x=1:\n\ny_low is max(2,1,3-1+1=3) →3.\n\ny_val=4-1=3.\n\ncase1: since 3 >=3.\n\nsum_part is sum from y=3 to3 of (x+y -C) =1+3-3=1 → sum is1.\n\nSo for x=1, contributes1.\n\nSimilarly, for x=2:\n\ny_low= max(2,2,3-2+1=2) →2.\n\ny_val=4-2=2.\n\nsince 2 <3 → case2.\n\na=2, b=2.\n\nfirst_part: sum from2 to2 of (2+2 -3)=1 → (2) - (3-2)*1=2-1=1.\n\nsecond_part: y from3 to3.\n\nstart_second=3.\n\nend_second=3.\n\ncount=1.\n\nterm is (4-3+1)*1=2.\n\nsum_part=1+2=3.\n\nTotal 1+3=4.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: when x + y <= C.\n\nSay A=1, B=2, C=3, D=10.\n\nx=1:\n\ny_low=3.\n\ny_val=10-1=9 >=3 → case1.\n\nsum from3 to3 of (1+3-3)=1 →1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low=2.\n\ny_val=8 >=3.\n\nsum from2 to3 of (2+y -3).\n\nFor y=2: 2+2-3=1.\n\ny=3: 2+3-3=2.\n\nsum is 1+2=3.\n\nSo total is 4.\n\nWait, wait.\n\nWait, for x=2:\n\ny_low is max(2,2, 3-2+1=2) →2.\n\ny_val=10-2=8 >=3 → case1.\n\nsum from2 to3 of (2+y -3) → for y=2: 1, y=3: 2 → sum is 3.\n\nSo x=1 contributes1, x=2 contributes3 → total4.\n\nBut according to the code, for x=1, sum is1, x=2 sum is3 → total4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's proceed to implement this.\n\nThe code will read A, B, C, D from the input.\n\nBut the input is given as space-separated strings. So, for example, the first line is '1 2 3 4' → A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nSo in Python, we can read them as:\n\nA, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\n\nBut wait, looking at the sample input, the user may pass multiple lines? Or is it a single line?\n\nWait, the problem statement says the first line contains four integers. So it's a single line.\n\nSo, the code should read one line, split into four integers.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nA, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, initialize the total to 0.\n\nLoop x from A to B inclusive.\n\nFor each x:\n\nCompute y_low = max(B, x, (C -x +1)).\n\nIf y_low > C → continue.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute y_val = D -x.\n\nIf y_val >= C:\n\n   a = y_low\n\n   b = C\n\n   num_terms = b - a +1.\n\n   sum_part = (b*(b+1)//2 - (a-1)*a//2) - (C -x)*num_terms.\n\nElse:\n\n   a = y_low\n\n   b = y_val.\n\n   if a >b → first_part=0.\n\n   else:\n\n       first_part = (b*(b+1)//2 - (a-1)*a//2) - (C -x)*(b -a +1)\n\n   start_second = y_val +1\n\n   end_second = C\n\n   start_second = max(start_second, y_low)\n\n   if start_second > end_second:\n\n       second_part=0\n\n   else:\n\n       count_second = end_second - start_second +1\n\n       second_part = (D - C +1) * count_second\n\n   sum_part = first_part + second_part\n\nAdd sum_part to total.\n\nFinally, print the total.\n\nSo, the code is straightforward.\n\nBut in Python, for loops with 5e5 iterations are manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about potential issues.\n\nWhat if C is larger than D?\n\nWait, no, because the problem statement says A <= B <= C <= D.\n\nSo C <= D, so z can be at least C, which is <= D.\n\nSo, (D - C +1) can be zero or positive.\n\nSo, when D < C, it's impossible, but according to the problem statement, C <= D.\n\nSo, no issue.\n\nAnother edge case: when x + y -1 < C.\n\nFor example, x=1, y=2, C=4.\n\nx + y =3 →3-1=2 <4.\n\nSo z can't be >=C, so no contribution.\n\nThus, the code should correctly return 0.\n\nAnother case: when x + y -1 == C.\n\nLike x=2, y=2, C=3.\n\nx + y =4 →4-1=3 ==C.\n\nSo z can be 3.\n\nSo, the code should count 1.\n\nTesting:\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(2,2,3-2+1=2) →2.\n\ny_val =D -x.\n\nAssuming D is 4, then y_val=2.\n\nSo case2: y_val=2 <3.\n\na=2, b=2.\n\nfirst_part: 2+2-3=1 → sum is1.\n\nstart_second=3.\n\nend_second=3.\n\nso count_second=1.\n\nsecond_part= (4-3+1)*1=2.\n\nsum_part=1+2=3.\n\nBut for x=2, y can be 2 and 3.\n\nWait, no, in this case, D is 4.\n\nWait, for x=2, y_low=2, y_val=2.\n\nSo case2.\n\na=2, b=2.\n\nfirst_part: 2+2-3=1 → sum is1.\n\nsecond_part: y from3 to3.\n\nz can be 3,4.\n\nBut for y=3, x+y=5>3.\n\nz can be 3,4.\n\nSo for y=3, the count is 2.\n\nSo the code computes second_part as 2 *1=2.\n\nSo sum_part=1+2=3.\n\nBut for x=2, y can be 2 and 3.\n\ny=2: z can be3.\n\ny=3: z can be3,4.\n\nSo total is 1+2=3.\n\nWhich the code correctly adds.\n\nAnother edge case: when y_low is greater than C.\n\nFor example, A=4, B=5, C=3, D=10.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, A<=B<=C<=D.\n\nSo in this case, C=3 is less than B=5. Which is impossible.\n\nThus, the code doesn't have to handle such cases.\n\nThus, the code is safe.\n\nSo, the final code should implement this logic.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code.\n",
