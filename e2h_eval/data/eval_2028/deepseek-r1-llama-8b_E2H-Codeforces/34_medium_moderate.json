And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Average Sleep Time.\" Hmm.\n\nThe task says that Polycarp has been keeping track of his sleep times for n days. But a week in Berland is k days long. So the doctor wants to find the average sleep time per week over all possible consecutive weeks. Oh right, like sliding windows of size k.\n\nSo the input gives me two integers, n and k, followed by a list of n integers representing each day's sleep time. My goal is to compute the average of these k-day windows.\n\nWait, how do I approach this? Well, let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to process all possible consecutive k-day windows in the array a. For each window, calculate the sum, then find the average of all those sums.\n\nLet me think about the example given. Like in the first sample input, n=3, k=2, a = [3,4,7]. So the possible windows are [3,4], sum 7; [4,7], sum 11. So there are 2 weeks. The average is (7+11)/2 = 9, which matches the output.\n\nAnother example: when n=k, there's only one window, so the average is just the sum divided by 1.\n\nNow, considering the constraints. The maximum n is 2e5. So we can't do anything with O(n^2) complexity because that would be 4e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nHmm, so the straightforward approach of iterating through each window and calculating the sum each time would be O(nk), which for n=2e5 and k=2e5 would be 4e10 operations. That's definitely not feasible. So we need a more efficient method.\n\nWait, but wait: for each window, the sum is the sum of k consecutive elements. So perhaps we can use a sliding window technique where we keep a running sum and update it as we move the window by one element at a time.\n\nYes! That's the key. Here's how:\n\n- Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n- Add this sum to a total sum variable.\n- Then, for each subsequent window, subtract the element that's leaving the window and add the new element that's entering. Update the total sum each time.\n- After processing all windows, divide the total sum by the number of windows (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\nThis approach is O(n) time and O(1) space, which is perfect for the constraints.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n and k from input.\n2. Read the array a.\n3. If k > n, that's impossible because the problem states 1 ≤ k ≤ n. So no need to handle that case.\n4. Initialize current_sum as the sum of the first k elements.\n5. Initialize total_sum with current_sum.\n6. For i in range(k, n):\n   a. Subtract a[i - k] from current_sum.\n   b. Add a[i] to current_sum.\n   c. Add current_sum to total_sum.\n7. Calculate average as total_sum / (n - k + 1).\n8. Print the average with at least 6 decimal places.\n\nBut wait, how to handle the division? Since we're dealing with floating points, we need to make sure that the division is accurate enough. Also, Python handles large numbers, so we shouldn't have any issues with integer overflow.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 2\n3 4 7\n\nInitial sum: 3+4=7. Total =7.\n\nNext window: 4+7=11. Total becomes 7+11=18.\n\nNumber of weeks: 2. Average 18/2=9.0, which matches.\n\nSample Input 3:\n8 2\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the third sample input is written as '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1'. So n=8, k=2. So the number of weeks is 7.\n\nCompute the sum for each window:\n\n1+2 =3\n\n2+4=6\n\n4+100000=100004\n\n100000+123=100123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789+1=790\n\nSum all these: 3+6=9, +100004=100013, +100123=200136, +579=200715, +1245=201960, +790=202750.\n\nTotal sum is 202750. Divided by 7, it's 28964.2857142857..., which is the sample output.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nWe need to read the input correctly. The second line is the array a. So in Python, I can read the first line as n, k, then the next line as a list of integers.\n\nWait, but sometimes the input could be read as a single string. So using input().split() might be better.\n\nIn code:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBut wait, what if the second line doesn't have exactly n numbers? Well, according to the problem statement, it should, so no need to handle that.\n\nThen compute the initial sum.\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\ntotal_sum = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(k, len(a)):\n    current_sum += a[i] - a[i - k]\n    total_sum += current_sum\n\naverage = total_sum / (n - k + 1)\n\nThen print the average with 10 decimal digits, but wait, the problem says to output at least 6 digits after the decimal point. So perhaps we can format it to 10 or more digits, but ensure that trailing zeros are included.\n\nIn Python, printing with something like \"{:.10f}\".format(average) would give 10 decimal places. But looking at the sample outputs, sometimes it's 7 digits after decimal (like 9.0000000000 and 10.0000000000). So perhaps we should format it to always have 10 decimal digits.\n\nWait, but in the third sample, the output is 28964.2857142857, which is 10 digits after decimal.\n\nSo in code, the format string should be something like '%.10f' or '{:.10f}'. Using the latter.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the precision in formatting is the number of digits after the decimal point. So, using .10f will show 10 digits, adding trailing zeros if needed.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nBut wait, the third sample expects 7 digits after the decimal. Wait, no, no. Looking back, the sample output for the third case is '28964.2857142857' which is 10 digits after the decimal.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement's note. It says that the answer is correct if the absolute or relative error is <=1e-6. So, we need to output enough digits such that the error is within 1e-6. Printing 6 digits is sufficient, but perhaps more ensures that.\n\nBut in the examples, they printed 10 digits. So perhaps the intended way is to print at least 6, but the sample shows 10. So perhaps the solution should output up to 10 digits, as in the samples.\n\nSo in code, the print statement would be to format the average to 10 decimal places.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nWait, but what if n equals k? Then the number of windows is 1, so the average is the same as the sum.\n\nYes, our code handles that because the loop runs from k to len(a), which is n. So when n=k, the loop doesn't run, and total_sum remains current_sum, which is the sum of the entire array. The average is sum/(n-k+1) = sum /1, correct.\n\nWhat about when k=1? Then each window is a single element, and the average is the average of all elements, which is the sum of all elements divided by n.\n\nYes, the code would handle that.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- n=1, k=1: average is a[0].\n- n=2, k=2: sum is a[0]+a[1], average is same.\n- When all elements are zero: average is zero.\n\nTesting with these cases should be fine.\n\nNow, thinking about the code:\n\nWait, a[:k] when k is larger than n? No, because the problem states 1<=k<=n. So a[:k] will have exactly k elements.\n\nSo, code seems solid.\n\nI think that's all. Now, write the code accordingly.\n\nWait, but in the third sample, the output is 28964.2857142857, which is 10 digits after decimal. So the code should output 10 digits.\n\nIn Python, using the format string as mentioned earlier should suffice.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nRead n and k, read a.\n\nCompute initial sum.\n\nLoop from k to n-1.\n\nUpdate sum and total.\n\nCompute average.\n\nPrint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nThat's the plan.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of size k from a given list of sleep times for n days. The goal is to efficiently calculate this average using a sliding window technique to handle large input sizes within acceptable time limits.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given a sequence of sleep times for n days and need to find the average sleep time over all possible k-day windows. Each window represents a week in Berland.\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Instead of recalculating the sum for each window from scratch, we use a sliding window approach to maintain a running sum. This allows us to update the sum efficiently as we move from one window to the next.\n3. **Efficiency**: The sliding window technique ensures that we only traverse the list once after the initial setup, making the solution efficient with a time complexity of O(n).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\ntotal_sum = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(k, n):\n    current_sum += a[i] - a[i - k]\n    total_sum += current_sum\n\naverage = total_sum / (n - k + 1)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line contains integers n and k. The second line contains the sleep times for n days.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the first k elements to initialize the sliding window.\n3. **Sliding Window Update**: For each subsequent element, adjust the current sum by subtracting the element that is sliding out of the window and adding the new element that is entering the window.\n4. **Total Sum Accumulation**: Keep a running total of all window sums.\n5. **Average Calculation**: Compute the average by dividing the total sum by the number of windows, which is (n - k + 1).\n6. **Output**: Print the result formatted to 10 decimal places to ensure precision.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem constraints and ensures that we can process large inputs within a reasonable time frame.",
