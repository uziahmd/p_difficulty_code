    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Array Stabilization. Hmm.\n\nThe task is, given an array of integers, to remove exactly one element such that the instability of the remaining array is minimized. Instability is defined as the maximum element minus the minimum element in the array.\n\nSo, I need to find which single element to remove so that the resulting array has the smallest possible max - min. And then output that minimal instability.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this efficiently? Because if I just try removing each element one by one and calculate the instability each time, that would be O(n^2), which won't work for n up to 1e5.\n\nWait, right. So for a large n, we can't do anything with O(n) per operation. We need a way to compute the best possible removal quickly.\n\nLet me think about what affects the instability when we remove an element. The instability depends on the min and max of the array after removal. So for each element a[i], when I remove it, the new array's min could be either the original min (if a[i] isn't the current min) or the next smallest element. Similarly, the new max could be either the original max (if a[i] isn't the current max) or the next largest element.\n\nSo maybe the idea is to precompute for each position what would be the new min and max if that element is removed. Then, for each i, calculate the new instability as (new_max - new_min) and find the minimum among all these.\n\nBut how do I compute the new max and min efficiently?\n\nLet's think about the sorted array. Wait, but sorting the array might help here. If I have the array sorted, then for each element, the min of the array without it would be the first element unless the element being removed is the first one. Similarly, the max would be the last element unless the element being removed is the last one.\n\nWait, no, because if you remove an element from the middle, the min remains the same as the original min, and the max remains the same as the original max. Only when you remove the current min or max does the new min or max change.\n\nOh right! So if the array is not modified by any removal except for the min or max, then the new instability could only decrease or stay the same. But wait, not necessarily. For example, if the array is [1,3,3,7], removing 7 gives [1,3,3], which has max 3, min 1, instability 2. But if I remove 1, the array becomes [3,3,7], instability 4. Or if I remove a 3, the array is [1,3,7], instability 6. So the minimal is achieved by removing 7.\n\nSo the key insight is: when you remove an element that is not the current min or max, the min and max of the array remain the same. So the instability for that case is (max - min), which is the original instability. So, the only candidates for improvement are the cases where we remove the min or the max.\n\nWait, but maybe that's not entirely accurate. Suppose the array has multiple elements equal to the min or max. For instance, if the array is [1,1,2,3]. The min is 1, and there are two instances. If I remove one of the 1s, the new min is still 1. Similarly, if I remove the 3, the new max is 2.\n\nSo, the general approach is: the minimal instability can be found by considering the cases where we remove either the global min, the global max, or some other elements that are either the min or max but perhaps more than one occurrence.\n\nWait, but perhaps the minimal instability is either:\n\n- The original instability minus something, or\n- Removing a min or a max.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal possible instability is the minimum between the original instability (minus some delta?), but no, that's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal instability is achieved by either removing the global min, the global max, or some other element that is either part of the min or max group.\n\nWait, but let's think: when I remove an element that's neither the min nor the max, the instability remains the same as before. So, the minimal instability can't be better than the original instability. So, to find the minimal instability, I need to consider whether removing the global min or the global max (or some other similar elements) reduces the instability.\n\nWait, no. Because sometimes, if the array has multiple min elements, removing one of them won't change the min. So, for example, if the array is [1,1,100], the min is 1, and the max is 100. Removing one 1 leaves the min",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that removing an element that is neither the current minimum nor the current maximum will not change the instability. Therefore, the minimal instability can only be achieved by removing either the global minimum, the global maximum, or another element that is part of the min or max group (if there are multiple occurrences).\n\n1. **Identify Global Min and Max**: Find the smallest and largest elements in the array.\n2. **Check Multiple Occurrences**: If there are multiple instances of the minimum or maximum, removing one instance might still leave the other instance(s) to maintain the same min or max.\n3. **Evaluate Removals**: Compute the instability for each possible removal of the global min, global max, or any other critical elements that could potentially reduce instability.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\nmin_val = min(a)\nmax_val = max(a)\n\n# Check if all elements are the same\nif min_val == max_val:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\n# Check if there are multiple min or max\ncount_min = a.count(min_val)\ncount_max = a.count(max_val)\n\nif count_min > 1:\n    # Removing one min won't change the min\n    pass\nelif count_max > 1:\n    # Removing one max won't change the max\n    pass\n\n# Now, compute the possible candidates\ncandidates = []\n\n# Remove one occurrence of min\nif count_min == 1:\n    new_min = min([x for x in a if x != min_val])\nelse:\n    new_min = min_val\nnew_max = max_val\ncandidates.append(new_max - new_min)\n\n# Remove one occurrence of max\nif count_max == 1:\n    new_max = max([x for x in a if x != max_val])\nelse:\n    new_max = max_val\nnew_min = min_val\ncandidates.append(new_max - new_min)\n\n# If there are more than one min or max, check removing another element\n# which could potentially affect the min or max\n# But since it's time-consuming, perhaps we can just consider the original max and min\n# Alternatively, maybe we can find if removing another element can lead to a better result\n# For example, if the array has [1, 2, 3, 4], removing 2 doesn't change anything, but perhaps removing 4 gives a lower instability.\n\n# Another approach: the minimal instability is either the original minus something, or the removal of min or max\n# So, let's compute the original instability and compare with the candidates\noriginal = max_val - min_val\n\nmin_candidate = min(candidates + [original])\n\nprint(min_candidate)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the input values for the array length and the array itself.\n2. **Edge Cases**: Handles cases where the array has only one element or all elements are the same.\n3. **Global Min and Max**: Determines the minimum and maximum values in the array.\n4. **Candidates for Removal**: Evaluates the instability when removing the global min and max, considering multiple occurrences if any.\n5. **Compute Instability**: Calculates the instability for each candidate removal and finds the minimum value.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the optimal element to remove to minimize instability without resorting to an O(n^2) solution.",
