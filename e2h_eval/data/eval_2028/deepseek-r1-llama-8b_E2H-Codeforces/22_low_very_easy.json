After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the question carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining how many students are considered \"successful\" based on their marks in various subjects. A successful student is one who is the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher mark for that subject.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. We have n students and m subjects. For each subject, we need to find out which student has the highest mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the top in at least one subject.\n\nSo, the steps I think are:\n\n1. Read the input correctly.\n2. For each subject, determine which student has the maximum mark.\n3. For each student, count how many subjects they are the top in. If at least one, increment the successful count.\n\nWait, but for each subject, only one student can be the best, right? Because if multiple students have the same max, then no one is the best in that case? Or wait, no, the problem says a student is the best if there's no student with a higher mark. So if two students have the same max, then neither is the best because both have the same high mark. So for a subject, the best is the one with the maximum, but if there are ties, no one is the best for that subject.\n\nOh, right! So in that case, for each subject, the best is unique. If two or more students have the same maximum, then no student is the best in that subject.\n\nSo, for each subject, I need to find the maximum mark and see if exactly one student has that mark. If yes, that student is the best for that subject. Otherwise, no one is the best.\n\nSo, for each subject, we can process all students' marks and find if there's a single student with the maximum. If so, that student gets credit for being the best in that subject.\n\nThen, for each student, we count how many subjects they are the best in. If any, they are successful.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each of the m subjects:\n   - Find the maximum mark among all students.\n   - Check how many students have that mark.\n   - If exactly one student has it, note that student as the best for this subject.\n   - Else, no one is the best.\n\n- For each student, collect the subjects where they are the best.\n- Count the number of students who have at least one such subject.\n\nSo, how do I represent the data?\n\nLet me think. Each student's marks can be stored as a list of strings or integers. Maybe for each subject, we can track the maximum and the count.\n\nAlternatively, for each subject, we can keep track of the maximum value and the list of students who achieved it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to process each subject separately.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read n lines, each line being a string of m characters (digits). For each line, convert each character into an integer, creating a list per student.\n\nFor example, student 0's marks could be [2,2,3], etc.\n\nThen, for each subject j from 0 to m-1:\n\n   Find the maximum mark among all students for subject j.\n\n   Collect all students who have this maximum.\n\n   If the length of this collection is 1, then that student is the best in subject j.\n\n   Else, no one is the best.\n\nSo, for each subject, we can create a dictionary or a list indicating which student is the best, or None if there's a tie.\n\nOnce we have for each subject the best student (if any), we can then for each student count how many subjects they are the best in.\n\nSo, for each student, initialize a count to 0. Then, for each subject, if the student is the best, increment their count.\n\nFinally, count how many students have a count >=1.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read the input. Wait, the input is given as a single string, but the problem shows it as ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111'], but that's probably just for the example. In reality, the first line is n and m, then n lines follow.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would read from stdin.\n\nSo, first, read the first line as n, m.\n\nThen, read the next n lines, stripping any whitespace, then for each line, convert into a list of integers.\n\nLike:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nThen, for each subject j in 0 to m-1:\n\nmax_mark = -1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject is defined as the student with the highest mark, and there must be no other student with the same highest mark for that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: First, read the number of students `n` and the number of subjects `m`. Then, read each student's marks for the subjects.\n2. **Track Best Marks**: For each subject, determine the highest mark achieved by any student. Check how many students have this highest mark.\n3. **Identify Best Student per Subject**: If exactly one student has the highest mark for a subject, note that student as the best for that subject.\n4. **Count Successful Students**: For each student, count how many subjects they are the best in. If a student is the best in at least one subject, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nbest_per_subject = [-1 for _ in range(m)]\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_mark = -1\n    max_students = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > max_mark:\n            max_mark = students[i][j]\n            max_students = [i]\n        elif students[i][j] == max_mark:\n            max_students.append(i)\n    if len(max_students) == 1:\n        best_per_subject[j] = max_students[0]\n\nsuccessful = 0\nbest_count = [0] * n\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    if best_per_subject[j] != -1:\n        best_count[best_per_subject[j]] += 1\n\nfor count in best_count:\n    if count > 0:\n        successful += 1\n\nprint(successful)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of students and subjects, followed by each student's marks for the subjects.\n2. **Processing Each Subject**: For each subject, the code finds the highest mark and checks how many students achieved this mark. If only one student did, that student is noted as the best for that subject.\n3. **Counting Successes**: For each student, the code counts how many subjects they are the best in. If a student is the best in at least one subject, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Output Result**: Finally, the number of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the best-performing student for each subject and accurately count the number of successful students.",
