Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Cards.\" Hmm. Let me read the description carefully.\n\nSo, Vanya has some cards with numbers on them. Each number can be positive, negative, or zero, but their absolute value doesn't exceed x. Natasha hid all his cards, but he found n of them. He wants the sum of all the found cards to be zero. But right now, the sum isn't zero. So, he needs to find some more cards (from the infinite supply of -x to x) to add to the found ones so that the total sum is zero. Our task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nWait, but how do we determine which cards to add? Because each card can have any value as long as it's within [-x, x]. So the problem reduces to finding the smallest number of integers (each between -x and x) that when added to the current sum will make it zero.\n\nLet me think about the approach here.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. We need to find the minimal k such that there exists a set of k integers (each with absolute value ≤x) whose sum is -S. Because adding those k integers will bring the total sum to zero.\n\nSo, the key is to find the smallest possible k where the required sum (-S) can be achieved by adding k numbers, each up to x in absolute value.\n\nWhat's the condition for being able to achieve a certain sum with a given number of terms?\n\nI remember that for a sum T, the minimal number of terms needed is such that:\n\nThe maximum possible sum you can get with k terms is k * x (if all are x). Similarly, the minimum possible sum is -k*x.\n\nSo, for a target sum T, if |T| ≤ k*x, then it's possible. Otherwise, it's not.\n\nWait, but wait: no, because the sum could also be made by combining positive and negative numbers. For example, if T is 5, x is 3. Then, two terms: 3 + 2 → sum 5. Wait, but 2 is within x=3. So yes, it's possible. So the minimal k is 1 only if T is 0. Wait, no: if the sum is already zero, then no additional cards are needed. So first, check if the current sum is zero. If yes, output 0.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input shows that when the sum is 3, x is 2, the minimal k is 1 because -3 is not allowed since x=2. So the required sum is -3, but since each term can't exceed 2, so with one term, the maximum negative is -2. So to reach -3, you need at least two terms: like -2 + (-1). But wait, that's two terms. So the minimal k is 2 in that case.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample says that for the first input, the sum is 2. Because the found cards are -1, 1, 2. Sum is (-1+1+2)=2. So the required sum to reach zero is -2. So can we achieve that with one card? Yes, if the card is -2. So the minimal k is 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: input is 2 3, and the cards are -2 and -2. Their sum is -4. To reach zero, we need a sum of 4. What's the minimal k? Since each card can contribute up to 3. So 4 divided by 3 is 1.333, so ceiling is 2. So 2 cards: 3 and 1, but wait, 3+1=4. Alternatively, 2+2=4. Either way, two cards. So the output is 2.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n2. If S is zero, return 0.\n3. Else, compute the required sum T = -S.\n4. Find the minimal k such that |T| ≤ k * x, and that k is as small as possible.\n\nBut wait, is that sufficient? Because sometimes, even if |T| <= k*x, you might not be able to reach exactly T with k terms. Or is that always possible?\n\nWait, for any integer T and k, as long as |T| ≤ k * x, can you always find a sequence of k numbers each between -x and x that sums to T?\n\nYes. Because you can distribute the sum across the k terms. For example, if T is positive, you can take as many x's as possible, and adjust the rest with smaller numbers. Similarly for negative T.\n\nFor example, let's say T is 5 and x is 3, k is 2: 3+2=5. Or T is 4, x is 3, k is 2: 3+1=4. So yeah, it's possible.\n\nSo the minimal k is the smallest integer such that k >= |T| / x, rounded up. But wait, let me see.\n\nWait, |T| must be <= k * x. So the minimal k is the ceiling of |T| / x.\n\nBut wait, what if |T| is exactly divisible by x? Then, k = |T| / x.\n\nOtherwise, it's the next integer.\n\nFor example, |T|=5, x=3: 5/3=1.666 → ceil is 2.\n\nWhich is correct, as shown earlier.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n- If S is zero, output 0.\n- Else, compute T = -S.\n- Compute the minimal k as the ceiling of |T| / x.\n- Output k.\n\nWait, but what about when T is zero? That's handled by the first condition.\n\nSo, let's test with the samples.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nFound cards: -1, 1, 2 → sum S is 2. So T is -2.\n\nx is 2. |T|=2. 2/2=1 → k=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample: sum is -4. T is 4. x=3. 4/3 is 1.333 → ceil is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose sum is 5, x is 5. Then T is -5. |T|=5. 5/5=1 → k=1.\n\nIf sum is 6, x is 5: T is -6. 6/5=1.2 → ceil is 2. So you need two cards: 5 and 1 → sum 6, but wait, the target is -6. So two cards: -5 and -1 → sum -6. So yes.\n\nAnother case: sum is 0 → output 0.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nWhat if sum is x+1? Like x=3, sum is 4. So T is -4. x=3. 4/3 is 1.333, so ceil is 2. So two cards: 3 and 1 → sum 4. But for T=-4, two cards: -3 and -1 → sum -4.\n\nAnother case: sum is -x. So T is x. Then k=1. Because x/x=1.\n\nAnother edge case: sum is x-1. x=3, sum is 2. T is -2. 2/3 is 0.666, ceil is 1. So can we get -2 with one card? Yes, -2. So k=1.\n\nWait, but wait: what if the sum is 0 after adding some cards? No, because the initial sum is S, and we're adding k cards to get sum 0. So S plus the sum of the k new cards equals zero. So the sum of the new cards is -S.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nIn code:\n\nRead n and x from input.\n\nThen read the list of numbers.\n\nCompute S as the sum.\n\nIf S is zero: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute T = -S.\n\nCompute the absolute value of T: abs_T.\n\nCompute k = ceil(abs_T / x).\n\nBut wait, in Python, how to compute the ceiling of division.\n\nBecause in Python, dividing two integers with / gives a float. So for example, 5 / 3 is 1.666..., and math.ceil(1.666) is 2.\n\nBut in cases where abs_T is exactly divisible by x, we just take abs_T /x.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nimport math\n\nsum_found = sum of the list.\n\nif sum_found == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    required = -sum_found\n\n    abs_required = abs(required)\n\n    k = (abs_required + x - 1) // x  # this is integer division, equivalent to ceiling.\n\n    print(k)\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nTesting this logic against the samples.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nsum is 2. required is -2 → abs is 2.\n\nx=2. 2/2=1 → k=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nsum is -4 → required is 4. x=3.\n\n4/3 is 1.333 → (4 +3-1)//3 → (6)//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x=5 → required is -5, abs 5. (5+5-1)/5 =9//5=1. Correct.\n\nSum is 6, x=5 → 6/5=1.2 → (6+5-1)/5=10//5=2. Correct.\n\nSum is 0 → output 0.\n\nSum is x → output 1.\n\nSum is x+1 → output 2.\n\nAll seems correct.\n\nSo, now, the code.\n\nWe need to read the input. The input is given as two lines. The first line is n and x. The second line is the list of n integers.\n\nWait, looking back at the input format:\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\nSo, the code needs to read these inputs.\n\nIn Python, reading from stdin can be done via input().split().\n\nBut for the second line, the input could be something like '3 2\\n-1 1 2'—so the first line is '3 2', the second is '-1 1 2'.\n\nSo, code:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nfound = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_found = sum(found)\n\nif sum_found == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    required = -sum_found\n\n    abs_required = abs(required)\n\n    k = (abs_required + x - 1) // x\n\n    print(k)\n\nThat's it.\n\nWait, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2\n\nsum_found is 2. So required is -2. abs is 2.\n\n(2 +2-1)//2 → (3)//2=1. Output is 1.\n\nSample 2:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2 → sum is -4. Required is 4. abs is4.\n\n(4+3-1)/3=6/3=2. Output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the samples.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=5, found card is 3. Sum is 3. Required is -3. abs is3.\n\n(3+5-1)/5=7//5=1. So k=1.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 0 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum is x+1. Like x=3, sum is4. Required is-4. 4/3=1.333→ceil is 2. So (4+3-1)//3=6//3=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",

Otherwise, calculate the target sum needed to make the total sum zero, which is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Compute Minimum Cards**: The goal is to find the smallest number of cards such that their values can sum up to the required adjustment. This is done by finding the ceiling of the division of the absolute value of the target sum by x. This ensures that we use the minimum number of cards to reach or exceed the required adjustment.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nfound = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_found = sum(found)\n\nif sum_found == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    required = -sum_found\n    abs_required = abs(required)\n    k = (abs_required + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of found cards `n` and the maximum absolute value `x` of the cards. The second line reads the list of integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed.\n3. **Check for Zero Sum**: If the sum is already zero, print 0 as no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Target Adjustment**: Calculate the target adjustment needed to make the sum zero.\n5. **Calculate Minimum Cards**: Use integer division to determine the minimum number of cards required.
