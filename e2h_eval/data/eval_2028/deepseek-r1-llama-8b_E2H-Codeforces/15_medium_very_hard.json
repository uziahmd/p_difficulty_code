They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about a playoff tournament with 2^n teams. The tournament has multiple phases, and in each phase, certain rules determine which teams progress to the next round. Each phase is determined by the string s, where each character represents whether higher or lower skill wins in that phase.\n\nThe goal is to find all winning integers x, meaning all x such that there exists a permutation p of the skills 1 to 2^n where team x becomes the champion after the entire tournament.\n\nHmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to model the tournament structure. The tournament has n phases. In each phase i (from 0 to n-1), the number of games is 2^(n - i - 1). For example, the first phase (i=0) has 2^(n-1) games, then phase i=1 has 2^(n-2) games, and so on until the last phase i = n-1, which is just one game.\n\nEach phase depends on the corresponding character in the string s. So for phase i, s[i] is either '0' or '1'. \n\nWhen s[i] is '0', in each match of that phase, the lower-skilled team wins. So in the pairings, the weaker team advances. When s[i] is '1', the stronger team wins, so the higher-skilled team advances.\n\nWait, but how are the teams paired in each phase? Oh right, in the first phase, the teams are paired as 1 vs 2, 3 vs4, etc. Then, the winners of those pairs proceed to the next phase, which is again paired in the same way, but with the remaining teams.\n\nSo each phase re-pairs the remaining teams into consecutive pairs, starting from the first remaining team.\n\nNow, the key is to model the tournament in a way that allows us to determine for each possible x whether it can be the champion under some permutation p.\n\nBut trying all possible permutations is impossible because 2^18 is around 260k, which is manageable for small n, but for n=18, the total permutations are (2^18)! which is way too big.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach. Maybe using dynamic programming or bitmasking.\n\nLet me think about the tournament structure as a series of rounds. Each round reduces the number of teams by half. The outcome of each round depends on the current phase's rule.\n\nEach round can be thought of as a step where certain teams get eliminated based on their relative skills and the phase's rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the required conditions for a team x to reach the final and win.\n\nIn each phase, the team must survive each round. So for each phase i, the team x must have certain properties based on the s[i] value.\n\nBut how do these phases affect the possible winners?\n\nAnother angle: the tournament can be viewed as a binary tree. Each node represents a game, and the leaves are the initial matches. The winner of each game proceeds to the parent node. The root is the final game determining the champion.\n\nEach internal node has two children, representing the two games that feed into it. So for each phase, the teams are arranged into groups of two, and their winners form the next group.\n\nWait, but the way the teams are paired in each phase is always consecutive. So the structure is like a binary heap where each level corresponds to a phase.\n\nSo for a team to win, it must be the maximum (or minimum, depending on the phase's rule) in its sub-tree.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to model the tournament as a series of constraints. Each phase imposes certain conditions on the possible winners.\n\nFor example, in phase 0 (the first phase), the teams are grouped into consecutive pairs. The winners of each pair move on. Depending on the phase's rule, each pair's winner is determined by whether higher or lower skill wins.\n\nThen, in phase 1, the winners from phase 0 are grouped again into consecutive pairs, and so on.\n\nSo for a team x to be the champion, it must satisfy all the necessary conditions imposed by each phase.\n\nHmm, but how do these conditions cascade?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering the tournament's structure as a set of layers. Each layer corresponds to a phase. For each layer, the team x must be able to win in the context of that layer's grouping.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this recursively. For each phase, the team must be the winner of its sub-bracket, given the current phase's rule.\n\nLet's consider the tournament as a binary tree where each node is a game. The leaves are the initial matches, and each internal node represents a game between the winners of its two children.\n\nSo for each internal node (game), the winner must be determined based on the phase's rule and the skills of the two participants.\n\nBut how does this help in determining the possible champions?\n\nI think another approach is to model the tournament's structure as a series of decisions. Each phase has a rule (s[i]), and the way teams are grouped affects which teams can progress.\n\nBut since the pairing is fixed (consecutive pairs), the structure is deterministic once the initial order is known. Wait no, the initial order is given as a permutation p. But the pairing is fixed based on the initial order.\n\nWait, no. The initial teams are numbered from 1 to 2^n, but the permutation p determines their skills. So the initial pairing is based on their positions in the list. So for example, in the first phase, team 1 plays against team 2, team 3 against 4, etc.\n\nSo the initial order is fixed as 1,2,3,...,2^n, but their skills are assigned according to the permutation p.\n\nBut the permutation p is unknown. So our task is to find all x such that there exists a p where x is the champion.\n\nHmm, so the initial order of the teams is 1,2,...,2^n, but the permutation p assigns their skills. So the pairing in each phase is based on their position in the initial list, not their actual skill.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So the initial teams are ordered as 1,2,3,...,2^n. So the first phase pairs 1&2, 3&4, etc. Then, the next phase takes the winners of those games, in the order they were won, and pairs them as 1&2 again, etc.\n\nWait no, in each phase, the remaining teams are ordered according to the previous phase's winners, but their order is preserved except for the eliminated teams. So the next phase's pairings are the first two, then next two, etc.\n\nSo for phase 0, the initial list is [t1, t2, t3, ..., t_{2^n}].\n\nAfter phase 0, the list becomes [w1, w2, w3, ..., w_{2^{n-1}}}, where wi is the winner of each pair.\n\nIn phase 1, the list is processed in the same way: pair w1 & w2, w3 & w4, etc., and the winners form the next list.\n\nThis continues until only one remains.\n\nSo the tournament structure is such that each phase's pairings are fixed based on the initial order of the teams, not their skills.\n\nSo the permutation p assigns the skills to the team's initial order. So the first team (team 1) has skill p[0], team 2 has p[1], etc.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the champion.\n\nHmm. So for each possible x, we need to determine if there's a permutation p where x ends up as the champion.\n\nBut trying all x from 1 to 2^n is feasible for small n, but n can be up to 18, giving 2^18=262144 possibilities. That's manageable, but for each x, we need to check if it can be a champion, which requires checking all the phases.\n\nBut how to model this for each x.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, we can model the minimal and maximal possible ranks it must have in each phase to win through.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process can be viewed as building a binary decision tree where at each node (phase), the team must be the winner of its group according to the phase's rule.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to realize that for a team x to be a champion, it must be the maximum (or minimum, depending on the phase) in certain subsets of the permutation.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model that.\n\nAnother idea: Since the pairing is fixed for each phase, perhaps the tournament can be represented as a binary tree, and the path from the leaf (initial game) to the root (final game) determines the necessary conditions for x to win.\n\nBut for each x, the path would involve certain matchups that x must win, and in each matchup, the outcome is determined by the phase's rule and the skills of the two teams.\n\nBut since the permutation is variable, perhaps for x, we can arrange the permutation such that x wins each of its required matches, given the phase's rules.\n\nWait, but how do the phases' rules affect the required matchups for x?\n\nPerhaps for each phase, x must be the winner in its group, but the group is determined by the phase and the initial order of the teams.\n\nWait, maybe the tournament can be broken down into levels, and for each level, the team x must be the top or bottom in its group, depending on the phase's rule.\n\nSo for each phase i (starting from 0 to n-1), the team x must be the maximum or minimum in a certain group of 2^{n-i} teams, depending on s[i].\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me think about this.\n\nPhase 0: each group is 2 teams. So in phase 0, x must be the max or min in their group, based on s[0]. Then, in phase 1, the groups are larger, and so on.\n\nWait, but phase 1's groups are formed from the winners of phase 0's matches. So the grouping depends on the initial order of the phase 0 winners.\n\nHmm, maybe the correct way to model this is that for each phase, the group size is 2^{n-i} teams, and the team must be the winner of its group in that phase, according to the phase's rule.\n\nBut how does the grouping work?\n\nWait, perhaps each phase i has groups of size 2^{n-i+1} ? Or wait, no. Let me think about phase 0: it's the first phase, with 2^{n-1} games. Each game is between consecutive pairs. So for phase 0, the group size is 2 teams.\n\nPhase 1 has 2^{n-2} games, each consisting of two groups from phase 0's winners. So each group in phase 1 is of size 2^{n-1} teams? No, wait. Wait, phase 0 produces 2^{n-1} winners. Then phase 1 will have 2^{n-1}/2 = 2^{n-2} games, each consisting of two consecutive winners from phase 0. So each group in phase 1 is 2^{n-1} teams? No, wait, phase 1's groups are formed by the winners of phase 0's games.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's take a concrete example.\n\nSuppose n=3, so 8 teams. Phase 0 has 4 games:\n\n1 vs 2 → winner W1\n\n3 vs4 → winner W2\n\n5 vs6 → winner W3\n\n7 vs8 → winner W4\n\nThese four winners go to phase 1. Phase 1 has 2 games:\n\nW1 vs W2 → winner A\n\nW3 vs W4 → winner B\n\nThen phase 2 has 1 game: A vs B → winner C.\n\nSo in phase 1, the group for W1 is W1 and W2. So the group is size 2, and in phase 1, s[1] determines whether higher or lower skill wins in each game.\n\nBut phase 0 is s[0], which is the first character in the string.\n\nSo for each phase i, the group size is 2, because each phase after the first reduces the number of groups by half, but each group in phase i is formed by the winners of phase i-1's games, which themselves are grouped in pairs.\n\nWait, no. Wait, phase 0 has 2^{n-1} games, each producing one winner. So phase 1 has 2^{n-2} games, each consisting of two consecutive winners from phase 0.\n\nSo in phase 1, each game is between two consecutive winners from phase 0. So the group size for phase 1 is 2.\n\nSimilarly, phase 2 has 2^{n-3} games, each consisting of two consecutive winners from phase 1.\n\nWait, that can't be right because phase 2's groups are the winners of phase 1's games. So phase 1's winners are grouped in consecutive pairs.\n\nWait, no. Phase 1's winners are arranged in the order they came from phase 0. So for example, after phase 0, the winners are [W1, W2, W3, W4]. Then in phase 1, they are grouped as (W1,W2) and (W3, W4), each pair playing a game. So each group in phase 1 is of size 2.\n\nSo for phase i, the group size is 2, regardless of i.\n\nWait, that makes sense because each phase i has 2^{n-i} games, each consisting of two teams. So for each phase i, the group size is 2.\n\nSo for each phase i, the team must be the winner of its group of size 2, and the winner is determined by s[i].\n\nSo the process is, for each phase i, the team must be the maximum or minimum in its group of two, depending on s[i].\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the group in phase 1 is formed by two winners from phase 0, who themselves might have been part of groups in phase 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps my initial understanding is incorrect. Maybe each phase i has groups of size 2^{i+1}, but that doesn't fit with the example.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the tournament as a binary tree, where each node is a game, and the leaves are the initial matches. The root is the final game.\n\nEach non-leaf node represents a game whose participants are the winners of its two children. So for the initial phase, the leaves are the 2^{n} initial games, and each internal node above corresponds to a phase.\n\nSo for phase i, the nodes at that level correspond to the games in that phase. Each node has two children, which are the games in the phase below.\n\nBut in this structure, the group size for each phase i is 2, because each game in phase i is between two teams that came from the same group in phase i+1.\n\nWait, maybe that's the case. So for each phase i, each game is between two teams that were in the same group in phase i+1. So the group size for phase i is 2.\n\nBut how does this affect the condition for a team to be a champion?\n\nAh! So for a team x to become champion, it must win all the games in each phase, starting from the initial phase up to the final phase.\n\nIn each phase i, the team x must be in a group (a pair) and must be the winner of that pair according to the phase's rule.\n\nBut the groupings are determined by the initial order of the teams.\n\nWait, but the initial order is fixed as 1, 2, 3, ..., 2^n, but their skills are determined by the permutation p. So the group in phase 0 is {1,2}, {3,4}, etc.\n\nSo for phase 0, the groups are fixed as consecutive pairs. So for any permutation p, the groupings are known.\n\nThus, for phase 0, the group of x is determined by whether x is in a pair with another team.\n\nWait, no. Because the permutation p defines the skills, but the groupings are based on the initial team numbers.\n\nSo, for example, team 1 is always in the first group of phase 0, paired with team 2. Team 3 is in the next group, paired with team4, and so on.\n\nSo the groupings are fixed, regardless of the permutation p.\n\nWait, that's a crucial observation. The groupings in each phase are fixed based on the initial numbering of the teams. So, for phase i, the groupings are fixed as consecutive pairs of the remaining teams in the order they were in the previous phase's winners.\n\nWait, no. Because the winners of phase i-1 are ordered, and phase i groups them into consecutive pairs.\n\nSo the groupings in phase i depend on the initial order of the teams and the outcomes of the previous phases.\n\nBut since the permutation p is variable, the groupings in phase i can change depending on p.\n\nWait, but the groupings are based on the initial team order, not their skills. So, for example, in phase 0, team 1 is always paired with 2, 3 with4, etc. So regardless of their skills, the initial groupings are fixed.\n\nSo the groupings in each phase are fixed based on the initial ordering, but the winners are determined by the permutation p.\n\nAh, that's a key point. So for each phase i, the groupings are fixed as consecutive pairs of the initial team order, but the outcome of each group depends on p.\n\nSo for a given x, we need to determine whether there exists a permutation p such that x wins all necessary games across all phases.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the problem can be approached by considering the required conditions on x's position in the permutation.\n\nWait, perhaps for x to be a champion, it must satisfy certain constraints in each phase. For example, in phase 0, x must be in a group where, according to s[0], x is the winner. Similarly, in phase 1, x must be the winner of its group, which is determined by the winners of phase 0's groups, and so on.\n\nBut how do we model this.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the tournament as a binary tree, and for each x, determine whether it can be the root by satisfying certain constraints.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to represent the tournament as a series of binary decisions. For each phase i, the team x must be in a group, and within that group, x must be the max or min, depending on s[i], to win that phase's game.\n\nBut wait, in phase i, each group is a pair of two teams, so for x to win that group, x must be the max if s[i] is '1', or the min if s[i] is '0'.\n\nSo, for each phase i, the group containing x must consist of two teams: x and another team y. Then, according to s[i], x must be the max or min of x and y.\n\nBut the problem is that the group y is determined by the initial team order and the outcomes of the previous phases.\n\nWait, but the initial team order is fixed. So for phase i, the group containing x is determined by the initial order of the teams, not their skills.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial groupings are fixed as consecutive pairs, regardless of the permutation p.\n\nSo for phase 0, the group of x is determined by whether x is in an even or odd position in the initial list.\n\nWait, for phase 0, the groups are 1-2, 3-4, etc. So for x=1, group is [1,2]; for x=3, group is [3,4], etc.\n\nSo for phase 0, the group is known, and the winner is determined by s[0]. So for x to win phase 0, if s[0] is '0', x must be the min of their group; if '1', x must be the max.\n\nBut in phase 1, the group is determined by the winners of phase 0's groups. So for example, if x is the winner of group 1-2 in phase 0, then in phase 1, x will be grouped with the next winner from phase 0.\n\nSo the group in phase 1 is [W1, W2], [W3, W4], etc.\n\nSo the group in phase 1 is determined by the winners of phase 0's groups.\n\nBut the permutation p determines which teams are in which phase 0 group, thus affecting the phase 1 groups.\n\nWait, but the permutation p determines the skills, not the team order. So the groupings in each phase are fixed based on the initial team order, not their skills.\n\nSo the group structure is fixed regardless of p. So for phase i, the group of x is determined by the initial team order, and the group consists of the next 2^{i} teams in the initial order.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly, but perhaps the group in phase i is determined by the initial team order and the phase's index.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the group in phase i as the set of 2^{i} consecutive teams in the initial list.\n\nWait, no. Because phase 0 has group size 2, phase 1 has group size 2, etc. Wait, no, earlier thinking was that group sizes are 2 for all phases. But in reality, the group in phase i has 2^{i+1} teams, perhaps.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the phase indices.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nFor n=3, 8 teams.\n\nPhase 0: 4 games (each group is 2 teams)\n\nPhase 1: 2 games (each group is 2 winners from phase 0)\n\nPhase 2: 1 game (group is 2 winners from phase 1)\n\nSo, for phase 2, the group is 2 teams, which are the winners of phase 1's two games.\n\nSo, in each phase i, the group size is 2.\n\nThus, for each phase, the group is a pair of two teams. So for x to win phase i, x must be the max or min of their pair, according to s[i].\n\nBut how are the pairs formed in each phase?\n\nIn phase 0, the initial order is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. The pairs are (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), (7,8).\n\nIn phase 1, the winners of phase 0's games are arranged in the order of their occurrence. So suppose the winners are [A, B, C, D], then phase 1's pairs are (A,B), (C,D).\n\nIn phase 2, the winners of phase 1's games are E and F, so the pair is (E,F).\n\nSo for phase 1, the group for x (if x is the winner of A in phase 0) is the pair (A,B) in phase 1.\n\nThus, the group in phase 1 for x is determined by the winners of phase 0's games that are in the same group as x in phase 0.\n\nWait, no. Because in phase 0, x is in a group, and in phase 1, x is grouped with the next winner in the initial order.\n\nSo for example, if x is in group (1,2) and wins, then in phase 1, x is grouped with the winner of (3,4). So the group in phase 1 is (x, W(3,4)).\n\nSo the group in phase 1 is determined by the initial order of the winners from phase 0.\n\nSo, for x to win in phase 1, it needs to be the max or min in the pair (x, y), where y is the winner of the next group in the initial order.\n\nBut since the permutation p is variable, we can arrange y's skill such that x is the winner according to s[1].\n\nSo, for each phase i, the group is a pair consisting of x and another team, which is determined by the initial order of the winners from phase i-1.\n\nThus, the group in phase i is the pair (prev_winner, next_winner_in_initial_order).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the tournament as a binary tree, where each node is a game. The leaves are the initial phase 0 games, and each internal node represents a game in a higher phase. The root is the final game.\n\nEach internal node has two children, which are the games that fed into it. So, for phase i, the games are the internal nodes at that level.\n\nThus, for a team x to be the champion, it must be the winner of all the games along the path from the leaf (its initial game) to the root.\n\nBut how do the phase rules affect this.\n\nWait, each game (node) has a rule s[j], where j is the depth of the node minus one (since phase 0 is level 0, phase 1 is level 1, etc.). So for each node, the rule determines whether the higher or lower skilled team wins.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, it must be the winner of every game in its path to the root, considering the rules of each game.\n\nBut the permutation p determines the skills of the teams, so for each node in the path, x must be the winner according to the rule.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to checking whether there's a permutation p such that x is the winner of all the games in its path, given the rules s[j] of each game.\n\nBut the issue is that the path is determined by the initial grouping, which depends on the initial order of the teams.\n\nWait, but the initial order is fixed as 1,2,3,...,2^n. So for any permutation p, the initial order is 1,2,3,...,2^n, but their skills are assigned as p[0], p[1], etc.\n\nSo, for example, team 1 has skill p[0], team 2 has p[1], etc.\n\nThus, the path that x takes through the tournament is determined by the initial group it is in and the structure of the tournament.\n\nSo, for each x, we need to determine whether there exists a permutation p such that x wins all the games along its path, given the rules s[j] for each game.\n\nBut how to model the path for x.\n\nWait, perhaps the path is determined by the initial phase 0 grouping. For example, x is in a certain initial group, and then in phase 1, it's grouped with the next initial group's winner, and so on.\n\nBut the exact structure is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the tournament's structure as a binary heap. Each phase corresponds to a certain level in the heap. For each x, the path from x to the root (champion) is fixed, based on the initial grouping.\n\nSo, for each x, we can determine the set of games it must win, and for each such game, determine the required condition on p.\n\nBut how.\n\nPerhaps, for each x, the path to the root consists of log2(2^n) = n games. Each game is determined by the phase it's in.\n\nSo, for phase 0, the initial game is between x and its partner in the initial group. For phase 1, the next game is between x and the winner of the next initial group, and so on.\n\nThus, for each x, the path includes n games, each in a different phase.\n\nIn each phase i, the game is between x and another team y_i. The outcome depends on s[i]:\n\n- If s[i] is '0', then x must be the min of x and y_i.\n\n- If s[i] is '1', then x must be the max.\n\nBut wait, the other team y_i is determined by the initial grouping and the outcomes of the previous phases.\n\nBut since p is a permutation, we can choose the other team's skill to satisfy the condition.\n\nSo, for each phase i, given x, we can choose y_i's skill to make x the winner according to s[i].\n\nThus, for x to be a champion, for each phase i, the condition on y_i's skill must be satisfied.\n\nBut how to model the y_i's.\n\nWait, perhaps the other team in each phase i is the winner of a certain group in the previous phase.\n\nBut this seems recursive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each x, the other teams in each phase i's game can be chosen as the minimal or maximal possible, allowing x to win.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, the other team in the game must be less than or greater than x, depending on s[i].\n\nSo, for phase i, if s[i] is '0', then x must be the min of x and y_i. So y_i must be > x.\n\nIf s[i] is '1', x must be the max. So y_i must be < x.\n\nThus, for each phase i, the other team in the game must be either less than or greater than x.\n\nBut how do we ensure that the other teams can be arranged such that all these conditions are met.\n\nMoreover, the other teams must be unique and form a permutation.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: can we assign the other teams in each phase i's game such that for each phase i, the other team satisfies the condition (y_i < x or y_i > x) according to s[i], and all these y_i's are distinct and not x, and the rest of the permutation is filled in a valid way.\n\nBut how to model this for all phases.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this as a binary decision for each phase i, indicating whether x must be the max or min.\n\nThen, for each phase i, we can represent the required relationship between x and y_i.\n\nOnce we have these relationships, we can model the problem as whether there exists a permutation p where all these conditions are met.\n\nBut how to represent these constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the required constraints as a set of inequalities.\n\nFor each phase i:\n\nif s[i] == '0': y_i > x\n\nif s[i] == '1': y_i < x\n\nThen, all y_i's must be distinct and not equal to x.\n\nAdditionally, the other teams in the permutation must be arranged such that all the y_i's are in the correct positions.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for x to be a champion, the required conditions can be represented as a bitmask of bits, where each bit indicates whether x is the min or max in a certain phase.\n\nThen, the problem reduces to finding whether there's a permutation p that satisfies all these conditions.\n\nBut how to represent this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, we can precompute the required conditions for each phase i. Then, for each x, we can check if the required conditions are compatible, and whether the number of teams that must be greater than x or less than x is feasible.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, let's think about the required conditions.\n\nFor each phase i:\n\nif s[i] is '0', x must be the min, so y_i > x.\n\nif s[i] is '1', x must be the max, so y_i < x.\n\nBut for each such phase i, the other team y_i is determined by the initial group in phase i.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, the other team in the game is a specific team, say z_i, which is determined by the initial group structure.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the other team in each phase i's game is determined by the initial group structure and the previous phase's winners.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the other team in phase i's game is the winner of a certain group in phase i-1. So for example, in phase 1, the other team is the winner of the group in phase 0 that comes after x's group.\n\nBut this requires knowing the initial group structure.\n\nBut since the initial group structure is fixed, perhaps for x, the other teams in each phase can be determined based on the initial group structure.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the initial group structure is fixed, perhaps for x, the other teams in each phase can be determined.\n\nFor example, in phase 0, x is in a group of two teams. The other team is fixed as the initial group's partner.\n\nIn phase 1, x is in a group consisting of the winner of the previous phase's group and the next group's winner. So the other team is determined by the initial group that comes after x's group in phase 0.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, the other teams in each phase can be determined by the initial group structure.\n\nThus, for x, the other team in phase 0 is fixed, the other team in phase 1 is fixed, etc.\n\nThus, for each phase i, the other team in the game is a specific team z_i, determined by the initial group structure.\n\nIf that's the case, then for x to be a champion, in each phase i, z_i must satisfy the condition based on s[i].\n\nThus, for each x, we can compute the required condition on z_i for each phase i.\n\nIf for all phases, the condition can be satisfied, then x is a winning integer.\n\nBut how to determine z_i for each phase i.\n\nHmm, perhaps the other team in phase i's game is determined by the initial group structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the group structure can be represented as a binary tree, where each node represents a group in a certain phase.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think recursively.\n\nLet's take x as a specific team, say team k.\n\nIn phase 0, x is in a group with team k+1 if k is odd, or k-1 if k is even.\n\nWait, no. Because phase 0's groups are 1-2, 3-4, etc. So for any x, the partner is x + 1 if x is odd, else x-1.\n\nWait, yes. So for x in phase 0, the partner is x+1 if x is odd, else x-1.\n\nThus, in phase 0, the partner is known.\n\nThen, in phase 1, the group is determined by the winners of phase 0's groups.\n\nAssuming that x wins phase 0, the next group in phase 1 is the winner of phase 0's group to the right of x's group.\n\nSo, for example, x is in group 1-2. Then, the next group is 3-4. So in phase 1, x's group is (x, the winner of 3-4).\n\nSimilarly, in phase 2, the group is (x, the winner of phase 1's next group).\n\nThus, for x, the other team in phase i's game is determined by the initial group structure and the previous phase's outcome.\n\nBut since the permutation p is variable, the winners can be arranged in any way.\n\nWait, but the other team in phase i's game is determined by the initial group structure, not by p.\n\nNo, because the initial group structure is fixed as per the initial team order. So, for phase i, the group is determined by the initial order of the winners from phase i-1.\n\nBut the initial order of the winners is determined by the permutation p.\n\nSo, for example, in phase 1, the initial order of the winners is [w1, w2, w3, w4], where w1 is the winner of group 1-2, w2 of 3-4, etc.\n\nThus, the group in phase 1 is (w1, w2), (w3, w4).\n\nSo for x, which is in group 1-2 and wins, in phase 1, x is in the first group of phase 1.\n\nThus, the other team in phase 1's game is the winner of group 3-4.\n\nSo, for x to win phase 1, the winner of group 3-4 must have a skill less than x (if s[1] is '1') or higher (if s[1] is '0').\n\nBut since p is a permutation, we can choose the winner of group 3-4 to be any team except x.\n\nSo, for phase 1, the condition is that the winner of group 3-4 must be less than x (if s[1] is '1') or greater (if '0').\n\nThus, for x, the other team in phase 1's game is the winner of group 3-4, which is any team except x.\n\nSo, to model this, for each x, in each phase i, the other team is determined by the initial group structure and the previous phase's winners.\n\nBut how to represent this for all phases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each x, the required conditions on the other teams in each phase i can be represented as a set of inequalities.\n\nFor example, for phase 0, x must be > partner_0 if s[0] is '0', or < partner_0 if s[0] is '1'.\n\nSimilarly, for phase 1, x must be > winner_1 if s[1] is '0', or < winner_1 if s[1] is '1'.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut the problem is that the winner_1 is the winner of the next group in phase 0.\n\nBut since p is a permutation, the winner_1 can be any team, so for x, we can choose the winner_1 to satisfy the condition.\n\nThus, for each phase i, the other team can be any team not yet used and not x, as long as it satisfies the condition.\n\nThus, the key is to determine for each x whether, across all phases, the required number of teams are available to satisfy the conditions.\n\nWait, but how.\n\nAnother idea: For each x, the required number of teams that must be less than x is the number of phases where s[i] is '1', and similarly, the number of teams that must be greater than x is the number of phases where s[i] is '0'.\n\nBut x must be compared with each of these teams in the respective",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all possible winning integers \\( x \\) in a playoff tournament where teams are eliminated based on their skill levels and the rules provided by a string. The goal is to find all integers \\( x \\) such that there exists a permutation of skill levels allowing \\( x \\) to be the champion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament consists of \\( 2^n \\) teams and \\( n \\) phases. Each phase halves the number of teams until only one remains.\n2. **Phase Rules**: Each phase has a rule (either '0' or '1'). If '0', the lower-skilled team wins; if '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n3. **Permutation Constraints**: For a team \\( x \\) to be the champion, it must win all its matches in each phase. The permutation of skills must be arranged such that \\( x \\) wins according to the rules in each phase.\n\n### Key Insights\n- **Phase Grouping**: Teams are grouped in fixed consecutive pairs initially. Winners from each group proceed to the next phase, maintaining their order.\n- **Winning Conditions**: For each phase, the team \\( x \\) must either be the minimum or maximum in its group based on the phase's rule. This imposes constraints on the permutation of skills.\n- **Recursive Check**: For each team \\( x \\), check if it can satisfy all phase conditions by ensuring the required number of teams with higher or lower skills exist.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Precompute for each position i, the phase's condition\n    # We'll represent for each x, the required parity (less than or greater than) for each phase\n    # For each x, collect the required conditions across all phases\n    # Then, for each x, check if it's possible to arrange other teams to satisfy these conditions\n    \n    # For each x, compute the required constraints\n    max_teams = 1 << n\n    result = []\n    \n    for x in range(1, max_teams + 1):\n        required_less = 0\n        required_more = 0\n        used = set()\n        used.add(x)\n        \n        for phase in range(n):\n            if s[phase] == '0':\n                # x must be the min, so other must be > x\n                required_more += 1\n            else:\n                # x must be the max, so other must be < x\n                required_less += 1\n            \n            # Now, check if the available teams can satisfy the constraints up to this point\n            # Also, ensure that the total required does not exceed the available teams\n            # But since we can choose any permutation, as long as for each phase, the required number of teams with higher or lower skills are present\n            \n            # The other team in this phase can be any team not used yet, and must satisfy the condition\n            # So, for each phase, we need at least 'required_more' or 'required_less' teams to be more or less than x\n            \n            # We don't need to track exactly which teams, just count the required constraints\n            # Because we can always choose other teams to fit the required counts\n            \n            # So, after each phase, accumulate the required counts\n            # But we need to make sure that up to phase 'phase', the required counts are feasible\n        \n        # Now, check feasibility\n        # The required_less is the number of teams that must be less than x\n        # The required_more is the number of teams that must be more than x\n        # Additionally, in each phase, the other team must be unique and not x\n        \n        # The total number of teams is 2^n - 1 (all except x)\n        # So, required_less + required_more <= (max_teams - 1)\n        # Also, required_less >= 0, required_more >=0\n        \n        # Wait, but the way the phases are structured, each phase requires a specific relationship with another team\n        # So, for each phase, the required team must be either less than or greater than x\n        # So, the sum of required_less and required_more must not exceed the available teams (excluding x)\n        \n        # Thus, the total required teams is required_less + required_more\n        # And this must be <= (max_teams - 1)\n        # Because each phase contributes one required team\n        \n        if (required_less + required_more) > (max_teams - 1):\n            continue  # Not possible\n        \n        # Now, check if the required conditions can be satisfied\n        \n        # To do this, we need to have enough teams less than x and more than x\n        # Let's compute the number of teams less than x and greater than x in the permutation\n        # Since p is a permutation, the number of teams less than x is (x-1), and greater is (max_teams - x)\n        \n        # For required_less: need to have at least that many teams less than x\n        # For required_more: need to have at least that many teams greater than x\n        \n        # Check if the required_less <= (x-1) and required_more <= (max_teams - x)\n        if required_less <= (x - 1) and required_more <= (max_teams - x):\n            result.append(x)\n    \n    # Now, collect all winning x and print them\n    # Sort and output\n    result.sort()\n    for group in result:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, group)), end=' ')\n    print()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution iterates over each possible team \\( x \\) and checks if it can be the champion by satisfying all phase conditions.
