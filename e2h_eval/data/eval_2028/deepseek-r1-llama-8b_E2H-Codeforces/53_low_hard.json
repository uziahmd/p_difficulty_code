Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The task is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about the examples they gave. For 'abcd', the output is 0 because all substrings are unique. For 'ababa', the output is 3. Oh right, because 'aba' appears twice, overlapping in the middle. And for 'zzz', the output is 2 because 'zz' occurs twice, but not 'zzz'.\n\nSo how do I approach this? I need to check all possible substrings and find the maximum length where at least two occurrences exist.\n\nFirst, I should consider all possible substring lengths starting from the largest possible down to 1. For each length l, I check every possible substring of that length and see if it appears more than once. Once I find the maximum l where this is true, I can return it.\n\nBut wait, checking all possible substrings for each length might be time-consuming, but since the maximum string length is 100, it's manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over possible substring lengths l, starting from the maximum possible (length of string - 1) down to 1.\n2. For each l, generate all possible substrings of length l.\n3. Use a set to keep track of seen substrings. If a substring is added to the set again, we have a duplicate.\n4. As soon as for a particular l, any substring is found to appear more than once, return l as the answer.\n5. If no such l is found (which shouldn't happen because for l=0, it's always true), return 0.\n\nWait, but for l=0, the substring is empty, which technically appears infinitely many times, but the problem says the string is non-empty, so maybe the minimum is 1 or 0? Looking at the sample input, the first case returns 0, which suggests that when there are no substrings that appear at least twice (even the empty one?), but perhaps the empty substring is considered present only once. Wait, no, the empty string would be present once, so for a string of length 1, the maximum is 0 because no substrings longer than 0 appear twice.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\" So for a string like 'a', the only substrings are 'a' (length 1) and the empty string. But 'a' appears once, so the maximum is 0.\n\nSo for the code:\n\n- For each l from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n   - collect all substrings of length l\n   - if any substring occurs more than once, return l\n- If none found, return 0\n\nSo, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nIn Python, for a given l, I can loop through the string and collect all substrings of length l. Then, for each substring, check if it's already in a set. If yes, then return l.\n\nWait, but for each l, I need to process all possible substrings, adding them to a set, and as soon as a duplicate is found, break and return l.\n\nWait, no. Because for a particular l, it's possible that some substrings appear multiple times. So I can stop as soon as I find any substring that appears more than once.\n\nAlternatively, I can collect all substrings of length l into a dictionary, counting their occurrences. If any count is >=2, then return l.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead the input string s.\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n    substrs = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in substrs:\n            return l\n        substrs.add(substr)\nreturn 0\n\nWait, but wait. What about for l=3 in 'ababa'? Substrings are 'aba' at positions 0, 1, and 2. So 'aba' occurs three times. So in the loop, when i=0, add 'aba' to the set. When i=1, check 'aba' is already in the set—so we return 3.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nAnother example: 'zzz'. For l=2, substrings are 'zz' (positions 0 and 1). So when i=0, add to set. i=1, substring is 'zz' which is already in set, so return 2.\n\nWhat about a string like 'aaaa'? For l=3, the substrings are 'aaa' (i=0 and 1). So when",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Substring Lengths**: Start from the maximum possible length of substrings (which is one less than the length of the string) and go down to 1.\n2. **Check Each Substring Length**: For each length `l`, generate all possible substrings of that length.\n3. **Track Substrings Using a Set**: Use a set to keep track of seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, it means this substring appears at least twice.\n4. **Return the Longest Valid Substring Length**: As soon as a valid substring is found for a particular length `l`, return `l` as the result. If no such substring is found, return 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest valid substring by checking each possible length from the largest down to the smallest.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n- **Loop Through Lengths**: The outer loop iterates over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible down to 1.\n- **Generate Substrings**: For each length `l`, the inner loop generates all possible substrings of that length.\n- **Check for Duplicates**: Each substring is checked against a set of seen substrings. If a duplicate is found, the current length `l` is printed and the program exits.\n- **Handle No Duplicates**: If no valid substring is found after checking all lengths, the program prints 0.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem constraints and ensures that we find the longest valid substring in an optimal manner.",
