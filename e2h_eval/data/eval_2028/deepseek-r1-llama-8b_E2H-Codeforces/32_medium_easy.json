    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Array Stabilization. Hmm.\n\nThe task says that given an array of integers, I need to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. So, for each possible removal of an element, I calculate the new max and min, subtract them, and then find the smallest such value among all possibilities.\n\nWait, but calculating this naively for each element would be O(n^2), which won't work for n up to 1e5. That's way too big. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about what happens when we remove an element. The max and min of the remaining array could either stay the same or change depending on whether the removed element was contributing to either the current max or min.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal strategy is to find the second maximum and second minimum, but that might not always be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best way is to consider all possible candidates for the new max and min after removing each element and compute the instability accordingly.\n\nWait, but considering all possibilities is still O(n). How?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the array. Sorting will help in efficiently finding the next max and min after removing any element.\n\n2. For each element in the sorted array, consider removing it and compute the new max and min.\n\nBut wait, if the array is sorted, the original max is the last element and the original min is the first. When I remove an element, the new max could be the second last if the removed element was the max, otherwise it remains the same. Similarly for min.\n\nWait, that's a key insight. So for each element a[i], when removed, the new max is either a[-2] (if a[i] was the max) or a[-1]. Similarly, the new min is either a[0] (if a[i] was the min) or a[1].\n\nWait, no. Because even if a[i] isn't the max or min, removing it could potentially affect the max or min of the remaining array. But wait, no: the max and min are based on all elements except the removed one. So if a[i] is the current max, then the new max is the second max. If it's not, then the max remains the same as before. Same logic applies for the min.\n\nWait, no, because if you have multiple elements equal to the max, like [5,5,3,2], then removing one of the 5s doesn't change the max. So, the idea is to precompute the first and second max, and first and second min.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Compute the current global max and min.\n\n- Also, find the second maximum and the second minimum.\n\nWait, but how? Because when you remove an element, the new max could be either the second max or another element higher than that.\n\nNo, wait. The second max is the highest value that is less than or equal to the max. So, if the max occurs more than once, then the second max is the same as the max. So, for example, in [5,5,3], the max is 5, and the second max is 5.\n\nSimilarly for the min.\n\nSo, to handle all cases, I need to know:\n\nFor the max part:\n- The maximum value in the array.\n- The number of times this maximum occurs.\n\nIf the count is more than one, then removing one occurrence of the max won't change the max of the array.\n\nSimilarly, if the count is exactly one, then removing that element will cause the max to drop to the second max.\n\nSame logic for the min.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the maximum value and its count.\n\n2. Find the second maximum value, which is the maximum of the array excluding any elements equal to the first maximum.\n\n3. Similarly, find the minimum value and its count.\n\n4. Find the second minimum value, which is the minimum of the array excluding any elements equal to the first minimum.\n\nOnce I have these values, for each element in the array, I can determine whether removing it affects the max or min.\n\nWait, but that might not capture all cases. Because, for instance, an element that's not the max or min could be the only element that's the second max or second min.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach: after sorting the array, for each position i, the new max after removing a[i] is the maximum of the subarray from 0 to i-1 and from i+1 to n-1. Similarly for the new min.\n\nBut computing this for each i would require knowing the max and min in the left and right parts.\n\nWait, perhaps using prefix and suffix arrays for max and min.\n\nYes! That's a good idea.\n\nLet me think about it:\n\n- Precompute prefix_max, where prefix_max[i] is the maximum of the first i elements.\n\n- Precompute suffix_max, where suffix_max[i] is the maximum of elements from i to end.\n\nSimilarly for prefix_min and suffix_min.\n\nThen, for each i, the new max after removing a[i] would be the maximum between prefix_max[i-1] and suffix_max[i+1]. Similarly for the new min.\n\nThis way, for each i, I can compute the new max and min quickly.\n\nThat sounds manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Sort the array.\n\nWait, but no, because when we remove an element, the array is still considered without that element. So, for the prefix and suffix arrays, we can compute them for the original array.\n\nWait, but the prefix and suffix arrays are built for the entire array, so when an element is removed, the new array is missing that element, but the prefix and suffix can help us find the max and min of the remaining elements.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to build the prefix and suffix arrays for the original array, and for each index i, compute the max and min of the array excluding a[i] by combining the prefix up to i-1 and the suffix starting from i+1.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that approach.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\n- Read the input: n and the array a.\n\n- Compute the prefix_max array: prefix_max[i] is the maximum from a[0] to a[i].\n\n- Compute the suffix_max array: suffix_max[i] is the maximum from a[i] to a[-1].\n\nSimilarly for prefix_min and suffix_min.\n\nThen, for each i, compute the new_max as max(prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+1]).\n\nCompute the new_min as min(prefix_min[i-1], suffix_min[i+1]).\n\nWait, but wait: if i is 0, then prefix_max[i-1] is invalid. So for i=0, the new_max is just suffix_max[i+1]. Similarly, for i = n-1, new_max is prefix_max[i-1]. For other i, it's the max of the two.\n\nSame for min.\n\nOnce I have new_max and new_min for each i, the instability is new_max - new_min. We need the minimum of all such instabilities.\n\nWait, but what about cases where the array has only one element left? No, n is at least 2, so after removing one element, the array has n-1 >= 1 element, so the max and min can be computed.\n\nSo, let's structure the code:\n\nRead n and a.\n\nCompute prefix_max, suffix_max, prefix_min, suffix_min.\n\nInitialize the minimal instability to a very large number.\n\nLoop through each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   if i == 0:\n       left_max = -infinity\n       right_max = suffix_max[1]\n   elif i == n-1:\n       left_max = prefix_max[n-2]\n       right_max = +infinity\n   else:\n       left_max = prefix_max[i-1]\n       right_max = suffix_max[i+1]\n   new_max = max(left_max, right_max)\n\n   Similarly for min:\n   if i == 0:\n       left_min = +infinity\n       right_min = prefix_min[1]\n   elif i ==n-1:\n       left_min = -infinity\n       right_min = suffix_min[n-2]\n   else:\n       left_min = prefix_min[i-1]\n       right_min = suffix_min[i+1]\n   new_min = min(left_min, right_min)\n   \n   instability = new_max - new_min\n   if instability < current_min:\n       current_min = instability\n\nAfter all i's, output current_min.\n\nWait, but wait: the prefix and suffix arrays must be correctly computed.\n\nLet me think about how to compute prefix_max.\n\nprefix_max[0] = a[0]\n\nfor i from 1 to n-1:\n\n   prefix_max[i] = max(prefix_max[i-1], a[i])\n\nSimilarly for suffix_max:\n\nsuffix_max[n-1] = a[n-1]\n\nfor i from n-2 downto 0:\n\n   suffix_max[i] = max(suffix_max[i+1], a[i])\n\nSame for prefix_min and suffix_min, but taking the min.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput: 1 3 3 7\n\nAfter sorting, it's [1,3,3,7].\n\nprefix_max: [1,3,3,7]\n\nsuffix_max: [7,7,7,7]\n\nWait, no. Wait, for the suffix_max, it's the maximum from i onwards.\n\nSo for i=0, the suffix_max[0] is max(1,3,3,7) =7.\n\ni=1: max(3,3,7)=7.\n\ni=2: max(3,7)=7.\n\ni=3: 7.\n\nSo the suffix_max array is [7,7,7,7].\n\nSimilarly, prefix_max is [1,3,3,7].\n\nprefix_min is [1,1,1,1].\n\nsuffix_min is [1,1,1,1].\n\nNow, for each i, compute new_max and new_min.\n\ni=0:\n\nleft_max is -infinite, right_max is suffix_max[1] =7.\n\nnew_max =7.\n\nleft_min is +infinite, right_min is prefix_min[1] =1.\n\nnew_min=1.\n\nInstability: 6.\n\ni=1:\n\nleft_max = prefix_max[0]=1.\n\nright_max = suffix_max[2]=7.\n\nnew_max=7.\n\nleft_min = prefix_min[0]=1.\n\nright_min = suffix_min[2]=1.\n\nnew_min=1.\n\nInstability:6.\n\ni=2:\n\nleft_max=prefix_max[1]=3.\n\nright_max=suffix_max[3]=7.\n\nnew_max=7.\n\nleft_min=prefix_min[1]=1.\n\nright_min=suffix_min[3]=1.\n\nInstability:6.\n\ni=3:\n\nleft_max=prefix_max[2]=3.\n\nright_max is infinity, but since i is 3, the right side is nothing, so new_max is 3.\n\nleft_min=prefix_min[2]=1.\n\nnew_min is 1.\n\nInstability: 2.\n\nSo the minimal instability is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput is 1 100000.\n\nAfter sorting, [1,100000].\n\nprefix_max: [1,100000]\n\nsuffix_max: [100000,100000]\n\nprefix_min: [1,1]\n\nsuffix_min: [1,1]\n\nFor each i:\n\ni=0:\n\nleft_max is -inf, right_max is suffix_max[1]=100000. new_max=100000.\n\nleft_min is inf, right_min is prefix_min[1]=1. new_min=1.\n\ninstability=99999.\n\ni=1:\n\nleft_max is prefix_max[0]=1.\n\nright_max is inf.\n\nnew_max=1.\n\nleft_min is prefix_min[0]=1.\n\nnew_min=1.\n\ninstability=0.\n\nSo the minimal is 0.\n\nWhich also matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 1e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the array as a list of integers.\n\nCompute prefix_max, prefix_min.\n\nCompute suffix_max, suffix_min.\n\nLoop through each i, compute new_max and new_min, and track the minimal instability.\n\nNow, code:\n\nIn Python, handling the edge cases.\n\nBut in Python, for the first element, i=0, the left_max is -infinity, right_max is suffix_max[1].\n\nSimilarly, for i=n-1, right_max is +infinity, left_max is prefix_max[n-2].\n\nSame for min.\n\nImplementing this:\n\nSo, code:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nn = len(a)\n\nprefix_max = [0]*n\nprefix_min = [0]*n\n\nprefix_max[0] = a[0]\nprefix_min[0] = a[0]\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    prefix_max[i] = max(prefix_max[i-1], a[i])\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], a[i])\n\nsuffix_max = [0]*n\nsuffix_min = [0]*n\n\nsuffix_max[-1] = a[-1]\nsuffix_min[-1] = a[-1]\n\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n    suffix_max[i] = max(suffix_max[i+1], a[i])\n    suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], a[i])\n\nmin_instability = float('inf')\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if i ==0:\n        left_max = -float('inf')\n        right_max = suffix_max[i+1] if i+1 <n else -float('inf')\n    elif i ==n-1:\n        left_max = prefix_max[i-1]\n        right_max = float('inf')\n    else:\n        left_max = prefix_max[i-1]\n        right_max = suffix_max[i+1]\n    current_max = max(left_max, right_max)\n    \n    if i ==0:\n        left_min = float('inf')\n        right_min = prefix_min[i+1] if i+1 <n else float('inf')\n    elif i ==n-1:\n        left_min = prefix_min[i-1]\n        right_min = -float('inf')\n    else:\n        left_min = prefix_min[i-1]\n        right_min = suffix_min[i+1]\n    current_min = min(left_min, right_min)\n    \n    instability = current_max - current_min\n    if instability < min_instability:\n        min_instability = instability\n\nprint(min_instability)\n\nWait, but wait: when i is 0, i+1 could be 1, which is valid. Similarly for i=n-1.\n\nWait, in the code above, for i=0, right_max is suffix_max[1], which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the samples should work.\n\nWait, but in the second sample, n=2, a=[1,100000]. After sorting, it's [1,100000].\n\nprefix_max: [1,100000]\n\nsuffix_max: [100000,100000]\n\nprefix_min: [1,1]\n\nsuffix_min: [1,1]\n\nFor i=0:\n\ncurrent_max = max(-inf, suffix_max[1]=100000) → 100000.\n\ncurrent_min = min(inf, prefix_min[1]=1) → 1.\n\nInstability 99999.\n\nFor i=1:\n\ncurrent_max = max(prefix_max[0]=1, inf) →1.\n\ncurrent_min = min(prefix_min[0]=1, -inf) →1.\n\nInstability 0.\n\nSo the code outputs 0.\n\nAnother test case: what if all elements are same?\n\nE.g., a = [5,5,5].\n\nThen, for any i, removing it, the new array is [5,5], so instability is 0.\n\nSo the code should return 0.\n\nCompute prefix_max: [5,5,5]\n\nsuffix_max: [5,5,5]\n\nprefix_min: same.\n\nsuffix_min: same.\n\nFor each i:\n\ni=0:\n\ncurrent_max = max(-inf, suffix_max[1]=5) →5.\n\ncurrent_min = min(inf, prefix_min[1]=5) →5.\n\nInstability 0.\n\nSame for all i.\n\nThus, code returns 0.\n\nAnother test case: a = [2,1,4,3,5].\n\nSorted is [1,2,3,4,5].\n\nprefix_max: [1,2,3,4,5]\n\nsuffix_max: [5,5,5,5,5]\n\nprefix_min: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nsuffix_min: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nNow, for each i:\n\ni=0: removing 1.\n\nnew_max is suffix_max[1] =5.\n\nnew_min is prefix_min[1] =1.\n\nWait, no. Because when i=0, the remaining elements are 2,3,4,5.\n\nnew_max is 5, new_min is 2.\n\nWait, but according to the code, for i=0:\n\nleft_max is -inf, right_max is suffix_max[1] =5.\n\ncurrent_max is 5.\n\nleft_min is inf, right_min is prefix_min[1] =1.\n\ncurrent_min is 1.\n\nSo instability is 5-1=4.\n\nBut wait, the actual array after removing 1 is [2,3,4,5], so max is 5, min is 2. So the code's calculation is wrong.\n\nAh, wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, why is the code giving current_min as 1 instead of 2?\n\nBecause, for i=0, the right_min is prefix_min[1], which is the min of a[1], a[2], etc.\n\nWait, no. The right_min is the min of a[1..n-1], which in the original array is [2,3,4,5], so the min is 2. But according to the code, for i=0, the right_min is prefix_min[1] which is 1. Which is wrong.\n\nWait, no, wait: the code computes prefix_min as the min up to each index. So prefix_min[1] is the min of a[0] and a[1], which is 1.\n\nBut when i=0 is removed, the remaining elements are a[1]...a[n-1]. So the min of those is 2.\n\nBut the code is computing the right_min as prefix_min[1], which is 1, which is incorrect.\n\nSo there's a bug in the approach.\n\nWait, why? Because the prefix_min[i] is the min of the first i+1 elements (indices 0 to i). So when i is 0, prefix_min[1] is the min of a[0], a[1], which is 1. But when i=0 is removed, the remaining elements start from a[1], so the min is the min of a[1..n-1], which is 2.\n\nSo the approach of using prefix_min[i+1] is wrong.\n\nOh, this is a critical error.\n\nSo, the initial approach is flawed because the prefix_min and suffix_min arrays are designed for the entire array, but when we remove an element, the min of the remaining elements is not simply prefix_min[i+1], because that includes a[0], which is now removed.\n\nWait, no. Because the prefix_min is the min up to each index. So for i=0, the remaining elements are from 1 to n-1. The min of these is the min of a[1..n-1], which is the same as the suffix_min[1].\n\nSimilarly, the prefix_min is the min of a[0..i], but when we remove a[0], the min of a[1..n-1] is the suffix_min[1].\n\nSo perhaps the code should use suffix_min[i+1] for i=0, not prefix_min.\n\nWait, that's the mistake.\n\nSo, in the code, for i=0:\n\nthe remaining elements are a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]. So the min of these is the suffix_min[1], not the prefix_min[1].\n\nSimilarly, for i= n-1:\n\nthe remaining elements are a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-2]. So the min of these is prefix_min[n-2], not the suffix_min[n-2], because the suffix_min starts from i.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the suffix_min.\n\nWait, the suffix_min[i] is the min from a[i] to a[n-1]. So, for i=0, it's the min of the entire array.\n\nSo, for i=0, the remaining array is a[1..n-1], whose min is the suffix_min[1].\n\nSimilarly, for i=1, the remaining array is a[0..0] and a[2..n-1], so the min is min of a[0] and the min of a[2..n-1], which is min(prefix_min[0], suffix_min[2]).\n\nWait, but in the code, for i=1, the code uses prefix_min[i-1] and suffix_min[i+1]. So for i=1, it's prefix_min[0] and suffix_min[2]. Which is correct.\n\nSo the issue is with i=0 and i=n-1.\n\nLet me re-examine the code:\n\nFor i=0:\n\nthe left_max is -inf, right_max is suffix_max[1].\n\nWhich is correct because the right part is a[1..n-1], whose max is suffix_max[1].\n\nSimilarly, the min is the min of the right part, which is suffix_min[1].\n\nBut in the code, for i=0, the right_min is prefix_min[1], which is incorrect.\n\nSo, in the code, the current_min for i=0 is computed as min(left_min, right_min) → min(inf, prefix_min[1]) → prefix_min[1], which is 1. But the correct min is suffix_min[1], which is 2.\n\nSo the code is wrong.\n\nSimilarly for i=n-1:\n\nthe left part is a[0..n-2], whose min is prefix_min[n-2], but in the code, it's using suffix_min[n-2], which is wrong.\n\nSo the fix is to correctly compute for i=0 and i=n-1:\n\nFor i=0:\n\nleft_max is -inf.\n\nright_max is suffix_max[1].\n\ncurrent_max is max(left_max, right_max) = suffix_max[1].\n\nleft_min is inf.\n\nright_min is suffix_min[1].\n\ncurrent_min is suffix_min[1].\n\nSimilarly, for i=n-1:\n\nleft_max is prefix_max[n-2].\n\nright_max is inf.\n\ncurrent_max is prefix_max[n-2].\n\nleft_min is prefix_min[n-2].\n\nright_min is inf.\n\ncurrent_min is prefix_min[n-2].\n\nSo, the code needs to be adjusted for these cases.\n\nSo, let's correct the code:\n\nIn the loop over i:\n\nif i ==0:\n\n   left_max = -inf\n\n   right_max = suffix_max[1]\n\n   current_max = right_max\n\n   left_min = inf\n\n   right_min = suffix_min[1]\n\n   current_min = right_min\n\nelif i ==n-1:\n\n   left_max = prefix_max[i-1]\n\n   right_max = inf\n\n   current_max = left_max\n\n   left_min = prefix_min[i-1]\n\n   right_min = inf\n\n   current_min = left_min\n\nelse:\n\n   left_max = prefix_max[i-1]\n\n   right_max = suffix_max[i+1]\n\n   current_max = max(left_max, right_max)\n\n   left_min = prefix_min[i-1]\n\n   right_min = suffix_min[i+1]\n\n   current_min = min(left_min, right_min)\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if i == 0:\n        # left is nothing, right is a[1..n-1]\n        left_max = -float('inf')\n        right_max = suffix_max[i+1] if i+1 <n else float('inf')\n        current_max = max(left_max, right_max)\n        \n        left_min = float('inf')\n        right_min = suffix_min[i+1] if i+1 <n else float('inf')\n        current_min = min(left_min, right_min)\n    elif i == n-1:\n        # right is nothing, left is a[0..n-2]\n        left_max = prefix_max[i-1]\n        right_max = float('inf')\n        current_max = max(left_max, right_max)\n        \n        left_min = prefix_min[i-1]\n        right_min = float('inf')\n        current_min = min(left_min, right_min)\n    else:\n        left_max = prefix_max[i-1]\n        right_max = suffix_max[i+1]\n        current_max = max(left_max, right_max)\n        \n        left_min = prefix_min[i-1]\n        right_min = suffix_min[i+1]\n        current_min = min(left_min, right_min)\n    \n    instability = current_max - current_min\n    if instability < min_instability:\n        min_instability = instability\n\nYes, this should fix the issue.\n\nNow, testing the earlier sample where a = [1,2,3,4,5], i=0.\n\nIn the code:\n\ni=0:\n\ncurrent_max = suffix_max[1] =5.\n\ncurrent_min = suffix_min[1] =2.\n\nSo instability is 3.\n\nWhich is correct, because after removing 1, the array is [2,3,4,5], max 5, min 2. 5-2=3.\n\nSo the code would compute 3, which is better than the previous approach.\n\nSo the code needs to be corrected in the computation of current_max and current_min for i=0 and i=n-1.\n\nSo, with this correction, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nAnother test case: the array is [3,1,2,4,5,6].\n\nsorted is [1,2,3,4,5,6].\n\nprefix_max: [1,2,3,4,5,6]\n\nsuffix_max: [6,6,6,6,6,6]\n\nprefix_min: [1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nsuffix_min: [1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nWhen i=0 (removing 1):\n\ncurrent_max is suffix_max[1] =6.\n\ncurrent_min is suffix_min[1] =1.\n\nWait, no, because the remaining elements are [2,3,4,5,6], so min is 2.\n\nWait, no, suffix_min[1] is the min from a[1] to a[5], which is 2. So current_min is 2.\n\nSo, current_max is 6, current_min is 2, instability is 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: i=2 (removing 3).\n\nleft_max is prefix_max[1] =2.\n\nright_max is suffix_max[3] =6.\n\ncurrent_max is 6.\n\nleft_min is prefix_min[1] =1.\n\nright_min is suffix_min[3] =4.\n\ncurrent_min is 1.\n\nso instability is 5.\n\nBut wait, the remaining array is [1,2,4,5,6], so max is 6, min is 1. Correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle it.\n\nSo, the corrected code should pass all the test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to minimize the instability by removing one element from the array. Instability is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array. Removing an element can potentially change both the maximum and minimum values of the array.\n\n2. **Intuition**: When an element is removed, the new maximum and minimum values could be influenced by the elements before or after the removed element. To efficiently compute these values, we can use prefix and suffix arrays for both maximum and minimum values.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute prefix and suffix arrays for both maximum and minimum values. These arrays help in quickly determining the maximum and minimum values when any element is removed.\n   - For each element, compute the potential new maximum and minimum values by considering the elements before and after the current element using the prefix and suffix arrays.\n   - Track the minimum instability across all possible removals of a single element.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time due to the linear computation of prefix and suffix arrays and the subsequent loop through each element. This ensures it handles the upper constraint efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nn = len(a)\n\nif n <= 1:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\nprefix_max = [0] * n\nprefix_min = [0] * n\n\nprefix_max[0] = a[0]\nprefix_min[0] = a[0]\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    prefix_max[i] = max(prefix_max[i-1], a[i])\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], a[i])\n\nsuffix_max = [0] * n\nsuffix_min = [0] * n\n\nsuffix_max[-1] = a[-1]\nsuffix_min[-1] = a[-1]\n\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n    suffix_max[i] = max(suffix_max[i+1], a[i])\n    suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], a[i])\n\nmin_instability = float('inf')\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if i == 0:\n        left_max = -float('inf')\n        right_max = suffix_max[i+1] if (i + 1) < n else float('inf')\n        current_max = max(left_max, right_max)\n        \n        left_min = float('inf')\n        right_min = suffix_min[i+1] if (i + 1) < n else float('inf')\n        current_min = min(left_min, right_min)\n    elif i == n-1:\n        left_max = prefix_max[i-1]\n        right_max = float('inf')\n        current_max = max(left_max, right_max)\n        \n        left_min = prefix_min[i-1]\n        right_min = float('inf')\n        current_min = min(left_min, right_min)\n    else:\n        left_max = prefix_max[i-1]\n        right_max = suffix_max[i+1]\n        current_max = max(left_max, right_max)\n        \n        left_min = prefix_min[i-1]\n        right_min = suffix_min[i+1]\n        current_min = min(left_min, right_min)\n    \n    instability = current_max - current_min\n    if instability < min_instability:\n        min_instability = instability\n\nprint(min_instability)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: These arrays are built to store the maximum and minimum values up to each index and from each index to the end, respectively.\n3. **Computing Instability**: For each element, compute the potential new maximum and minimum values by combining the relevant parts of the prefix and suffix arrays. Track the minimum instability found.\n4. **Output**: Print the minimum instability after evaluating all possible removals.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by leveraging prefix and suffix arrays to avoid redundant calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
