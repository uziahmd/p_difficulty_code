A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Soft Drinking,\" and from the description, I need to calculate how many toasts each friend can make given certain resources.\n\nHmm. Let me try to break down the problem step by step.\n\nThe input consists of several integers. Let's list them out:\n\nn: number of friends.\nk: number of bottles.\nl: milliliters per bottle.\nc: number of limes.\nd: slices per lime.\np: grams of salt.\nnl: milliliters needed per toast per friend.\nnp: grams of salt needed per toast per friend.\n\nSo the goal is to find the maximum number of toasts each friend can make such that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet me think about each resource:\n\n1. Drink:\nEach toast requires nl milliliters per friend, and there are n friends. So per toast, total drink needed is n * nl. We have k * l milliliters in total. So the maximum possible toasts based on drink is (k*l) / (n * nl). But we have to take the floor here because we can't have a fraction of a toast.\n\n2. Lime slices:\nEach lime gives d slices. We have c limes, so total slices are c*d. Each toast requires 1 slice per friend, so total per toast is n slices. So maximum toasts based on lime is (c*d) / n. Again, floor it.\n\n3. Salt:\nEach toast needs np grams per friend, so per toast it's n * np grams. We have p grams. So maximum toasts from salt is p / (n * np), floored.\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three values because all resources must be sufficient for the same number of toasts.\n\nWait, but wait—no, no. Because each toast requires one slice per person, right? So for each toast, every friend gets a slice. So for t toasts, you need t * n slices. And since each lime gives d slices, total required is t * n ≤ c * d → t ≤ (c*d)/n.\n\nSimilarly for salt, t * n * np ≤ p → t ≤ p/(n * np).\n\nAnd for drink, t * n * nl ≤ k*l → t ≤ (k*l)/(n*nl).\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of these three computed values.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute the drink limit: (k * l) // (n * nl)\n- Compute the lime limit: (c * d) // (n)\n- Compute the salt limit: p // (n * np)\n- Take the minimum of these three, and that's the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.\n\nBut wait, what if any of these divisions result in zero? Like, for example, if the total drink is exactly equal to what's needed for zero toasts. Well, the minimum will take care of it.\n\nSo now, I need to read the input as eight integers in order: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nThen compute the three limits as above and output the smallest.\n\nNow, let's look at the sample input and output to test.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nCompute:\n\nDrink: (4*5) = 20 mL. Each toast needs 3 * 3 =9 mL? Wait, no: each toast requires nl per friend, and n friends. So per toast, it's n * nl = 3*3=9 mL. So 20 /9 is 2.222, so floor is 2.\n\nLime: c*d=10*8=80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices. So 80/3=26.666, floor 26.\n\nSalt: p/(n * np) =100/(3*1)=33.333, floor 33.\n\nSo the min of 2,26,33 is 2. So output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → drink is 1000 mL.\n\nnl=4, so per toast:5*4=20 mL. 1000/20=50.\n\nc=1, d=19 → slices=19. per toast, 5 slices. 19/5=3. So drink is 50, lime is 3, then salt: p=90/(5*3)=6.\n\nSo min(50,3,6) is 3.\n\nThird sample: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → drink 1e6.\n\nnl=50 → per toast:10*50=500 → 1e6 /500=2000.\n\nc=25, d=23 → 575 slices. per toast, 10 slices. 575/10=57.\n\nSalt:1/(10*1)=0.1 → 0.\n\nSo min is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as a single string, split into 8 integers.\n\nCompute the three values:\n\ndrink_toast = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nlime_toast = (c * d) // n\n\nsalt_toast = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_toast, lime_toast, salt_toast)\n\nPrint result as a string.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime = (c * d) // n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\n\nmax_toasts = min(drink, lime, salt)\n\nprint(max_toasts)\n\nWait, but wait: in the sample input, the first case, drink_toast is 20/(3*3) = 20/9=2.222→ floor 2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nCase where n is larger than possible:\n\nFor example, n=1, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=1, np=1.\n\nThen drink:1*1/(1*1)=1.\n\nlime:1*1//1=1.\n\nsalt:1/(1*1)=1.\n\nmin is 1.\n\nAnother case where one of them is zero: like when p is less than n * np.\n\nLike n=2, np=1, p=1.\n\nsalt_toast is 1/(2*1)=0.\n\nSo overall max is 0.\n\nSo the code handles all cases.\n\nSo that should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, lime slices, and salt per friend. The solution involves calculating the maximum number of toasts possible based on each resource and then taking the minimum of these values to ensure all friends can toast equally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Maximum Toasts Based on Drink**: \n   - Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink. The total drink available is `k * l` milliliters. Thus, the maximum number of toasts based on drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n\n2. **Calculate the Maximum Toasts Based on Lime Slices**:\n   - Each lime provides `d` slices, and with `c` limes, the total number of slices is `c * d`. Each toast requires `n` slices, so the maximum number of toasts based on lime slices is `(c * d) // n`.\n\n3. **Calculate the Maximum Toasts Based on Salt**:\n   - Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt. The total salt available is `p` grams. Thus, the maximum number of toasts based on salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n\n4. **Determine the Minimum Toasts**:\n   - The actual maximum number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum of the three values calculated above, as all resources must be sufficient for the same number of toasts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime = (c * d) // n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\n\nmax_toasts = min(drink, lime, salt)\n\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Drink Calculation**: The total drink available is `k * l`, and each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters. Dividing these gives the maximum number of toasts possible from the drink.\n- **Lime Calculation**: Each lime yields `d` slices, and with `c` limes, the total slices are `c * d`. Each toast needs one slice per friend, so dividing by `n` gives the maximum number of toasts from lime slices.\n- **Salt Calculation**: Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt, so dividing the total salt `p` by this value gives the maximum number of toasts possible from salt.\n- The final result is the minimum of these three values, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied for equal toasting among friends.",
