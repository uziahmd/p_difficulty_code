Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Selling Souvenirs.\" Hmm, I think I understand the gist. Petya has a bunch of souvenirs, each with a weight and cost. He wants to select a subset where the total weight doesn't exceed m, and the total cost is as high as possible. So, it's like a knapsack problem, right?\n\nWait, but the constraints might be a bit tricky here. Let me check the input details. Oh right, n can be up to 100,000, and m up to 300,000. Hmm, that's a lot. So a standard dynamic programming approach might not work because the time complexity would be O(n*m), which for 1e5 * 3e5 is way too big—like 3e10 operations. That's definitely not going to work. So I need a more efficient approach.\n\nWhat's different here? Oh, wait, the weights are only 1, 2, or 3. Oh right! So the weights are limited to 1, 2, 3. That's a crucial piece of information. So maybe we can group the items by their weights and process them separately.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Since the weights are small, perhaps we can use a different approach than the standard knapsack. Maybe we can precompute the maximum value for each possible number of 1s, 2s, and 3s in the subset.\n\nSo, let's break down the items into three groups: those with weight 1, weight 2, and weight 3. For each group, we'll sort them in descending order of cost because we want the most valuable ones first.\n\nOnce sorted, for each group, we can compute the prefix sums. The prefix sum for the i-th element will give the maximum cost achievable by taking the top i elements from that group.\n\nThen, the problem reduces to choosing some number of 1s, 2s, and 3s such that the total weight (number of 1s*1 + number of 2s*2 + number of 3s*3) is <= m, and the sum of their costs is maximized.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Separate the items into three groups based on their weights.\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n3. Compute the prefix sums for each group.\n4. Use a triple loop (i, j, k) where i is the number of 1s, j is the number of 2s, and k is the number of 3s, but ensure that the total weight i + 2j + 3k <= m. We need to find the combination that gives the maximum total cost, which is the sum of the corresponding prefix sums.\n\nBut wait, even with this approach, the loops could be expensive. Let's see: for each possible i, j, and k, but m is up to 3e5. How many possibilities do we have?\n\nThe maximum possible for each group is the sum of all items. For example, for weight 1, the maximum i is up to m (since each contributes 1). Similarly, j can be up to m//2, and k up to m//3.\n\nBut considering all possible combinations of i, j, k would be O(m^2) in the worst case, which is way too slow for m=3e5.\n\nHmm, so we need a smarter way to iterate through the possible combinations.\n\nAnother approach is to iterate over one of the variables, say k (number of 3s), and then for each k, determine the best possible j and i within the remaining weight capacity.\n\nSo for each possible k (from 0 to max_k), calculate how much weight is left (m_remaining = m - 3*k). Then, for this m_remaining, we need to choose some j (number of 2s) and i (number of 1s) such that 2*j + i <= m_remaining. The goal is to maximize the sum of their prefix sums.\n\nBut even this might be too slow if done naively, because for each k, j can be up to m_remaining // 2, and for each j, we'd have to compute the best i.\n\nAlternatively, for each k, we can precompute the best possible j and i for the remaining weight.\n\nWait, another idea: for the remaining weight after choosing k, we can treat it as a classic knapsack problem where we can take any number of 1s and 2s, but without 3s. But since the weight of 1s and 2s is small, perhaps we can find an optimal solution efficiently.\n\nSo for each k, we can compute the maximum possible sum of 2s and 1s that fit into m_remaining = m - 3*k.\n\nHow can we do this quickly?\n\nWell, for the 2s and 1s, the problem becomes selecting a combination of a certain number of 2s and 1s, such that 2*a + b <= W, and the sum of their costs is maximized.\n\nBut since the number of 2s is limited by the prefix sum array, perhaps for each k, we can compute the best possible j (number of 2s) and then find the best i (number of 1s) given the remaining weight.\n\nWait, but for each k, the maximum possible j is min(j_max, (m_remaining)//2), where j_max is the length of the 2s array. So for each k, we can iterate j from 0 to the maximum possible, and for each j, compute how much weight is left for 1s (w = m_remaining - 2*j). Then, the maximum i is the minimum between w and the available 1s.\n\nBut again, this seems like it could be O(m) per k, which is not feasible for large m.\n\nAlternative idea: for each k, the problem is to find the best j and i such that 2j + i <= W, where W is m_remaining. So for each j, the maximum i is min(w_j, len(ones) - 1), where w_j = W - 2j.\n\nBut even this is O(m) per k, which is not acceptable.\n\nWait, maybe we can find for each possible W, the maximum possible sum for 2s and 1s.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible W, we can precompute the best possible j and i.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a two-step process for the 1s and 2s.\n\nWe can precompute for all possible W (up to m) the maximum sum of 2s and 1s.\n\nHow?\n\nHmm, let's think about it. The maximum possible sum for 2s and 1s when the weight limit is W.\n\nFor each W, the maximum sum is the maximum over j (number of 2s taken) from 0 to min(j_max, W//2), and for each j, take as many 1s as possible in the remaining W - 2j.\n\nWait, but how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nWell, for each j, the maximum i is min(W - 2j, len_ones).\n\nBut the sum would be sum_2[j] + sum_1[i], where i is as above.\n\nSo for each j, we can calculate the maximum possible sum.\n\nBut trying all j for each W is O(m * j_max), which may be manageable if j_max is small. But j_max is up to 1e5, and m is up to 3e5, so 3e5 * 1e5 is 3e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo that approach won't work.\n\nAlternative approach: For the 2s and 1s problem, can we find a way to compute the maximum sum for any W in O(1) or O(W) time?\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute for the 2s and 1s, the maximum sum for all W up to m.\n\nThis sounds similar to the classic unbounded knapsack problem but with two items. Wait, no, it's a 0-1 knapsack because each item is used once.\n\nWait, but the 2s and 1s are separate. So perhaps for the 2s, the best way is to take as many as possible of the highest value ones, and similarly for the 1s.\n\nWait, no, because sometimes taking a lower number of 2s allows more 1s, which could yield a higher total sum.\n\nSo this seems complicated.\n\nAnother thought: the maximum possible sum for 2s and 1s is equivalent to a knapsack problem with two types of items: weight 2 and weight 1. But since the weight is small, perhaps we can model this with a DP approach where dp[w] represents the maximum sum achievable with total weight exactly w.\n\nWait, but the maximum weight here is up to m, which is 3e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo, for the 2s and 1s, we can create a DP array where dp[w] is the maximum sum for weight w, using any combination of 2s and 1s.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nYes, let's try that.\n\nWe can initialize the DP array as follows: dp[0] = 0, and all others as 0 or negative infinity.\n\nWait, but since the weights are positive, for each possible weight, we can compute the maximum sum.\n\nSo, for each item in the 2s group (sorted in descending order), we process it and update the DP array.\n\nSimilarly, for the 1s group.\n\nWait, but processing all items in the 2s group and 1s group in a way that builds up the DP.\n\nBut perhaps the order is important. For the 2s group, since each item is unique, we can process them in order, updating the DP array for each possible weight.\n\nWait, but this would be O((len_2 + len_1) * m), which could be up to (1e5 + 1e5) * 3e5 = 6e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nHmm, that's not going to work either.\n\nWait, but the 2s and 1s can be processed differently. Since 1s are weight 1, their contribution is additive. So perhaps for the 1s, the maximum sum is just the sum of the top i 1s, for any i. So we can precompute the prefix sum for the 1s group.\n\nSimilarly, for the 2s group, we can also precompute the prefix sum.\n\nThen, for each possible W (the weight limit after choosing k 3s), we can find the maximum sum of 2s and 1s such that 2j + i <= W.\n\nSo, for each k, W = m - 3k.\n\nWe need to find the best j and i where 2j + i <= W, and sum_2[j] + sum_1[i] is maximized.\n\nBut how to find this quickly for each W.\n\nIdea: For each W, the maximum possible sum is the maximum over all j (from 0 to min(j_max, W//2)) of (sum_2[j] + sum_1[min(W - 2j, len_1)]). Because for each j, the maximum i is the minimum of W - 2j and the total number of 1s available.\n\nBut even this approach could be O(m * j_max) which is too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: Precompute for each possible W, the maximum sum for the 2s and 1s.\n\nBut with W up to 3e5, and for each W, j can vary up to W//2, which is up to 1.5e5. So the total operations would be 3e5 * 1.5e5 = 4.5e10, which is way beyond feasible.\n\nNot good.\n\nAlternative approach: Find a way to find, for each W, the optimal j and i quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute for each possible W, the best j and i.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the 2s are in a sorted order, for each W, the best j is somewhere around W/2, but perhaps we can binary search for the optimal j.\n\nWait, that's an interesting thought. Because for each j, the total weight is 2j + i, but i can be up to W - 2j. So for each j, the sum is sum_2[j] + sum_1[W - 2j] (if W-2j >=0, else 0).\n\nWait, but W - 2j must be >=0, so j can be at most W//2.\n\nSo for each W, the maximum sum is the maximum of sum_2[j] + sum_1[ min(W - 2j, len_1) ] for j in 0 ... min(j_max, W//2).\n\nSo perhaps for a given W, we can find the j that maximizes this function.\n\nNow, the function is sum_2[j] + sum_1[ min(W-2j, len_1) ].\n\nBut how does this function behave as j increases? It's not necessarily monotonic, so binary search isn't straightforward.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the function is unimodal, meaning it increases to a point and then decreases. If that's the case, we could use ternary search to find the maximum.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the case. Let's think about it.\n\nAs j increases, 2j increases, so W-2j decreases. So the number of 1s that can be taken decreases as j increases. So the sum_1 part could decrease, but sum_2 increases as j increases.\n\nSo the overall function could have a single peak, making it unimodal. So ternary search could be applicable.\n\nIf that's the case, for each W, we can perform a ternary search on j in [0, min(j_max, W//2)] to find the j that gives the maximum sum.\n\nSince each ternary search is O(log j_max) steps, and for each step we compute the sum, which is O(1), this could be feasible.\n\nSo the plan would be:\n\n1. Separate the items into three groups: w1, w2, w3.\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of c.\n\n3. Compute prefix sums for each group.\n\n4. For each possible k (number of 3s), compute W = m - 3*k. If W <0, skip.\n\n   a. For this W, compute the maximum sum of 2s and 1s that fit into W.\n\n      i. Use ternary search on j to find the optimal j, then compute the best i.\n\n   b. The total sum is sum_3[k] + sum_2[j] + sum_1[i].\n\n5. Keep track of the maximum sum across all possible k.\n\nSo now, the question is whether the function is unimodal, allowing ternary search.\n\nLet's consider some examples.\n\nSuppose W is fixed, and j increases from 0 to j_max.\n\nAt j=0: sum_2[0] + sum_1[W]\n\nAs j increases, sum_2 increases, but sum_1 decreases.\n\nSo the function could have a single maximum.\n\nYes, I think this is the case.\n\nTherefore, for each W, we can perform a ternary search on j to find the optimal value.\n\nBut we need to make sure that the function is indeed unimodal.\n\nAnother approach is to note that the function is convex, but I'm not sure.\n\nWell, regardless, let's proceed under the assumption that ternary search is applicable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Precompute prefix sums for each group.\n\n- For each k, compute W = m - 3*k. If W <0, skip.\n\n   a. For W, find the best j in 0..min(j_max, W//2) that maximizes sum_2[j] + sum_1[ min(W-2j, len_1) ].\n\n   b. To find j, perform a ternary search between low=0 and high=min(j_max, W//2).\n\n- Keep track of the maximum total sum.\n\nNow, let's think about the time complexity.\n\nFor each k, we perform a ternary search over j in O(log j_max) steps, which is about 20 steps for j_max up to 1e5.\n\nEach step involves calculating sum_2[j] + sum_1[...], which is O(1).\n\nThe number of k's is up to m//3, which is about 1e5.\n\nSo total steps: 1e5 * 20 = 2e6, which is manageable.\n\nThat seems feasible.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read the input:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen, for each of the next n lines, read wi and ci.\n\nSeparate the items into three lists: group1 (wi=1), group2 (wi=2), group3 (wi=3).\n\nSort each group in descending order of ci.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each group.\n\nThen, for each possible k (number of 3s taken):\n\n   current_weight = 3*k\n\n   if current_weight > m: break, since further k's will be larger.\n\n   W = m - current_weight.\n\n   Now, for W, find the best j and i.\n\n   The best j is found via ternary search in [0, min(j_max, W//2)].\n\n   Once j is found, compute the maximum i as min(W - 2*j, len_1).\n\n   sum_total = sum3[k] + sum2[j] + sum1[i].\n\n   Update the maximum sum.\n\nFinally, output the maximum sum.\n\nWait, but the sum3 is the prefix sum of group3 up to k items.\n\nWait, no: group3's prefix sum is sum3[k], which is the sum of the top k items. So yes.\n\nSimilarly for sum2 and sum1.\n\nBut wait, in the code, group1 is the list of items with wi=1, sorted in descending order of ci. So sum1[i] is the sum of the first i items.\n\nSame for group2 and group3.\n\nSo, when we compute for a given k, it's the number of items taken from group3, which is up to min(k, len(group3)), but in our code, we'll process k up to the maximum possible.\n\nBut in the code, for each k, it's better to take min(k, len(group3)), because you can't take more than the available items.\n\nWait, but in our prefix sums, the sum3[k] is the sum of the top min(k, len(group3)) items, but for k beyond len(group3), it's the same as len(group3). So during the initial setup, the prefix sums should be built correctly.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. Suppose group3 has 5 items. So sum3[0] =0, sum3[1]=c1, sum3[2]=c1+c2, ..., sum3[5] = sum of all 5. sum3[6] = sum3[5]. So the prefix sum array for group3 is built as sum3[0], sum3[1], ..., sum3[len], and for any k beyond len, it's sum3[len].\n\nSo when k is larger than len(group3), the sum is the same as sum3[len].\n\nSo in code, when building the prefix sums, we can compute up to the length of each group, and for k beyond that, just take the last sum.\n\nSo during the loop for k, we can loop k from 0 to min(len_group3, m//3). Because beyond that, adding more k's doesn't increase the sum.\n\nWait, but m can be larger than 3*len_group3, but in that case, adding more k's beyond len_group3 doesn't help, since sum3 can't increase anymore.\n\nSo, the maximum possible k is min( len_group3, m//3 ).\n\nWait, but m//3 may be larger than len_group3, but in that case, the sum3 can't be increased beyond len_group3.\n\nSo the loop for k should run from 0 to min( len_group3, m//3 ), inclusive.\n\nWait, no, because for k beyond len_group3, the sum3 remains the same as len_group3.\n\nSo the maximum useful k is min( len_group3, m//3 ). Because beyond that, taking more k's doesn't add anything.\n\nSo the code can loop k from 0 to min(len_group3, m//3). Because beyond that, it's redundant.\n\nSo that's manageable.\n\nSimilarly, for group2, the maximum j is min( len_group2, W//2 ), but W can vary.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: When m is zero. Then, the sum is zero.\n\nWait, but according to the input constraints, m is at least 1, right? Looking back: the input says 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000. So no, m can't be zero.\n\nWait, no, the first line says 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 3e5. So m can be 1.\n\nSo no need to handle m=0.\n\nAnother edge case: when all items are too heavy for m.\n\nLike, if m is 1 and all items have weight 2 or 3. Then sum is zero.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the third test case is:\n\n['4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\nWhich I think is n=4, m=4.\n\nWait, perhaps the code needs to handle when no items can be taken.\n\nSo, the initial maximum sum should be zero.\n\nNow, another consideration: the sum can be zero if all items are too heavy.\n\nSo, in the code, we should initialize the maximum sum as zero, and compare all possible k's.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation steps.\n\nImplementing in Python:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Read n lines, split into wi and ci.\n\n3. Group into three lists: group1, group2, group3.\n\n   group1 contains (wi, ci) where wi == 1.\n\n   Similarly for others.\n\n4. Sort each group in descending order of ci.\n\n5. Compute prefix sums for each group.\n\n   sum1: sum1[0] = 0, sum1[1] = group1[0].ci, sum1[2] = sum1[1] + group1[1].ci, etc.\n\n   Similarly for sum2 and sum3.\n\n6. Now, for each k in 0 to min(len(group3), m//3), inclusive:\n\n   a. current_weight = 3*k.\n\n   b. if current_weight > m: break (since k increases, further k's will be larger)\n\n   c. W = m - current_weight.\n\n   d. Now, compute the best j and i for W.\n\n      i. j_max = min( len(group2), W // 2 )\n\n      ii. if j_max <0: continue.\n\n      iii. perform ternary search in [0, j_max] to find j that maximizes sum2[j] + sum1[ min(W-2*j, len(group1)) ]\n\n      iv. compute the maximum sum for this j.\n\n   e. total_sum = sum3[k] + sum2[j] + sum1[i]\n\n   f. update the global maximum.\n\n7. After processing all k's, print the maximum sum.\n\nBut wait, in step 6d, how do we perform the ternary search?\n\nWe need to write a function that, given W, returns the maximum sum for 2s and 1s.\n\nSo, the function is:\n\ndef max_sum_two_one(W):\n\n    j_max = min(len(group2), W // 2)\n\n    if j_max == 0:\n\n        return sum1[ min(W, len(group1)) ]\n\n    # Perform ternary search between low=0 and high=j_max\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = j_max\n\n    best = 0\n\n    for _ in range(100):  # enough iterations for precision\n\n        mid1 = low + (high - low) //3\n\n        mid2 = high - (high - low) //3\n\n        s1 = sum2[mid1] + sum1[ min(W - 2*mid1, len(group1)) ]\n\n        s2 = sum2[mid2] + sum1[ min(W - 2*mid2, len(group1)) ]\n\n        if s1 < s2:\n\n            low = mid1 +1\n\n            if s2 > best:\n\n                best = s2\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid2 -1\n\n            if s1 > best:\n\n                best = s1\n\n    # After ternary search, we might need to check all points around the found best\n\n    for j in range(max(0, best_j-5), min(best_j+5, j_max)+1):\n\n        current_sum = sum2[j] + sum1[ min(W - 2*j, len(group1)) ]\n\n        if current_sum > best:\n\n            best = current_sum\n\n    return best\n\nWait, but this is a rough idea. Alternatively, perhaps implement the ternary search properly, and after that, check a few nearby points to ensure that we haven't missed the maximum.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the exact implementation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of a ternary search, we can use binary search, but I'm not confident.\n\nAnother alternative is to precompute for each possible W, the best j.\n\nBut that's not feasible due to memory constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps in Python, for each k, we can precompute j in a loop, but that's O(1e5 * 1e5) = 1e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nNo, that won't work.\n\nSo the ternary search approach seems necessary.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that in the ternary search, the function is not necessarily strictly increasing or decreasing, so the ternary search may miss the actual maximum.\n\nThus, after the ternary search, it's a good idea to check a few points around the found j to ensure that we've captured the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is convex, so the ternary search would find the correct j.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps after the ternary search, we can check a window around the found j to capture any local maxima.\n\nIn code, for each W, during the ternary search, after finding a candidate j, we can check j-5 to j+5, ensuring that we don't miss any peaks.\n\nBut for performance, this should be manageable since it's a small number of steps.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing the function.\n\nWait, perhaps in code, the function can be written as:\n\ndef get_max_sum(W):\n\n    j_max = min(len_group2, W // 2)\n\n    if j_max ==0:\n\n        return sum1[min(W, len_group1)]\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = j_max\n\n    best = 0\n\n    for _ in range(100):\n\n        if high <= low:\n\n            break\n\n        mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n        mid2 = high - (high - low) //3\n\n        s1 = sum2[mid1] + sum1[ min(W - 2*mid1, len_group1) ]\n\n        s2 = sum2[mid2] + sum1[ min(W - 2*mid2, len_group1) ]\n\n        if s1 < s2:\n\n            low = mid1 +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid2 -1\n\n        if s1 > best:\n\n            best = s1\n\n        if s2 > best:\n\n            best = s2\n\n    # After 100 steps, check near 'best' position\n\n    for j in range(max(0, best -5), min(best +5, j_max) +1):\n\n        current_sum = sum2[j] + sum1[ min(W - 2*j, len_group1) ]\n\n        if current_sum > best:\n\n            best = current_sum\n\n    return best\n\nThis should handle the cases where the function is not perfectly captured by the ternary search.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for each mid1 and mid2, we compute s1 and s2, and then adjust the search range. Also, after each iteration, we compare to find the best so far.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is not sufficient. Another way is to keep track of the best and narrow the search window each time.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact implementation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a loop that tries multiple points, but I'm not sure.\n\nWell, perhaps in practice, the ternary search would find a j close to the optimal, and checking a small window around it would capture the maximum.\n\nSo, in code, after the ternary search, we can check j from best_j-5 to best_j+5, and pick the maximum.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n3\n\n1 1\n\n2 1\n\n4 3\n\n3 10\n\n2 7\n\n2 8\n\n1 1\n\nWait, no, the sample input is probably:\n\nThe first line is 3, m=4.\n\nThen three lines:\n\n1 1 → weight 1, cost 1\n\n2 2 → weight 2, cost 2\n\n4 3 → weight 4, cost 3\n\n3 10 → weight 3, cost 10\n\n2 7 → weight 2, cost7\n\n2 8 → weight 2, cost8\n\n1 1 → weight 1, cost1\n\nWait, that makes n=7, which seems inconsistent with the sample input description. Or perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, the sample input shows:\n\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nn=3, m=4.\n\nWait, no, the first line is n=3, m=4.\n\nThen three lines:\n\n1 1 → group1.\n\n2 2 → group2.\n\n4 3 → group3.\n\nWait, but then the next lines would be group3's items, but perhaps the sample is a bit unclear.\n\nIn any case, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nAfter grouping and sorting, group1 is [1,1], group2 is [2,2,2], group3 is [3,10,2,7,2,8,1,1] ?\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Wait, group3 is the items with weight 3. So in the sample input, the third line is '4 3' → weight 4? No, wait, the third line is '4 3' which is weight 4, which is more than 3. So it's not in group3.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine the sample input.\n\nThe sample input is described as:\n\nInput:\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\nWait, perhaps this is a representation of three test cases.\n\nSo, for the first test case, n=1, m=1, the items are (1,1). Output is 0, because 1<=1, but the maximum cost is 1.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to refer to the sample input as:\n\nIt's three separate test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the actual input is:\n\nFirst test case:\n\nn=1, m=1\n\nitem: 1 1\n\noutput: 1.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nn=2, m=2.\n\nitems: 2 2, 1 3.\n\nSo group1 has [1,3], group2 has [2,2].\n\nSum1 for i=1 is 3.\n\nSum2 for j=1 is 2.\n\nSo for m=2, 3 +2=5, but 2*1 +1*1=3, which is within m=2. So total is 5.\n\nThird test case:\n\nn=4, m=4.\n\nitems:4 3 (group3?), 3 10, 2 7, 2 8, 1 1.\n\nWait, no, the third line is '4 3' → weight 4, which is larger than 3, so it's not in group3.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nn=3, m=4.\n\nThen three items:\n\n1 1 → group1.\n\n2 1 → group2.\n\n4 3 → group3.\n\nSo group1: [1,1], group2: [2,1], group3: [4,3].\n\nBut in that case, the maximum sum would be 3 (taking the 4-weight item is not possible, since 4>4).\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is a bit confusing.\n\nBut regardless, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, another thought: what if W is very large, but the group2 and group1 have limited items. Then, for W, the maximum sum is the sum of all group2 and group1.\n\nSo, for each k, the maximum possible sum is sum3[k] + sum2[j_max] + sum1[i_max], where j_max is min(len_group2, W//2) and i_max is min( W - 2*j_max, len_group1).\n\nSo, perhaps after the ternary search, we should also compute this scenario and compare it with the best found.\n\nBecause the ternary search may miss the case where j is at the maximum possible.\n\nSo, in code, for each W, after the ternary search, we can compute the sum when j is j_max and also when i is i_max, and take the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, in the ternary search, include the j_max and j=0 in the checked points.\n\nBut perhaps in the code, after the ternary search, we can compute the sum for j_max and j=0, and compare with the best found.\n\nThis will ensure that we don't miss the maximum.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nmax_sum = 0\n\nfor each k in 0..max_k:\n\n    W = m -3*k\n\n    if W<0: break\n\n    j_max = min( len_group2, W//2 )\n\n    if j_max ==0:\n\n        i_max = min(W, len_group1)\n\n        current_sum = sum3[k] + sum1[i_max]\n\n    else:\n\n        # perform ternary search\n\n        best_j = ... \n\n        # compute sum2[best_j] + sum1[...]\n\n        # also compute for j_max and 0\n\n        # compare all three\n\n        option1 = sum2[j_max] + sum1[ min(W - 2*j_max, len_group1) ]\n\n        option0 = sum2[0] + sum1[ min(W, len_group1) ]\n\n        current_sum = max( best_j_sum, option1, option0 )\n\n    if current_sum > max_sum:\n\n        max_sum = current_sum\n\nSo, in code, for each k, we can compute the sum for j_max, j=0, and the best_j found via ternary search, and take the maximum.\n\nThis should cover all possibilities.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nImplementing the code in Python.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, read the next n lines.\n\ngroup1 = []\ngroup2 = []\ngroup3 = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    wi, ci = map(int, input().split())\n    if wi ==1:\n        group1.append(ci)\n    elif wi ==2:\n        group2.append(ci)\n    elif wi ==3:\n        group3.append(ci)\n\nThen, sort each group in descending order.\n\ngroup1.sort(reverse=True)\ngroup2.sort(reverse=True)\ngroup3.sort(reverse=True)\n\nCompute prefix sums.\n\nCompute sum1, sum2, sum3.\n\ndef compute_prefix(arr):\n    prefix = [0]\n    s =0\n    for x in arr:\n        s +=x\n        prefix.append(s)\n    return prefix\n\nsum1 = compute_prefix(group1)\nsum2 = compute_prefix(group2)\nsum3 = compute_prefix(group3)\n\nNow, for each k in 0 to min(len(group3), m//3), inclusive.\n\nmax_total =0\n\nmax_k = min(len(group3), m//3)\n\nfor k in range(0, max_k +1):\n\n    current_weight = 3*k\n\n    if current_weight >m:\n\n        break\n\n    W = m - current_weight\n\n    # Now, for W, compute max sum of 2s and 1s.\n\n    j_max = min( len(group2), W //2 )\n\n    if j_max ==0:\n\n        # Only 1s can be taken.\n\n        i_max = min(W, len(group1))\n\n        total = sum3[k] + sum1[i_max]\n\n    else:\n\n        # Need to find best j.\n\n        # Perform ternary search.\n\n        low =0\n\n        high = j_max\n\n        best = 0\n\n        for _ in range(100):\n\n            if high <= low:\n\n                break\n\n            mid1 = low + (high - low) //3\n\n            mid2 = high - (high - low) //3\n\n            # compute sum2[mid1] + sum1[...]\n\n            w1 = W - 2*mid1\n\n            i1 = min(w1, len(group1))\n\n            s1 = sum2[mid1] + sum1[i1]\n\n            w2 = W - 2*mid2\n\n            i2 = min(w",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market without exceeding a given weight limit.
