Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string — the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Minimum Ternary String. Hmm. So, the task is to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing certain swap operations. \n\nWait, the allowed swaps are only between '0' and '1' if they are adjacent, and between '1' and '2' if they are adjacent. So, for example, you can't swap a '0' and a '2' directly because they aren't adjacent in the swap rules. Oh right, that's an important point.\n\nSo the string consists of 0s, 1s, and 2s. And we can only swap adjacent 0 and 1, or 1 and 2. The goal is to rearrange the string as much as possible using these swaps to get the lex smallest possible string.\n\nHmm. So how do I approach this? Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible relative orderings between the characters. Since swapping 0 and 1 can change their positions, but 0 cannot be swapped with 2, and 2 cannot be swapped with 0, except through other characters. Wait, no—because 1 can be swapped with 2. So, for example, a 0 can be moved past a 2 by moving the 1 between them. Like, 0,1,2: you can first swap 1 and 2 to make 0,2,1, then swap 0 and 2? No, wait, no, because 0 and 2 can't be swapped directly. Oh right, so that's not possible. So perhaps 0 can't be reordered beyond certain points.\n\nWait, maybe I need to model the dependencies here. So the key is to figure out which characters can be swapped with each other through a chain of allowed swaps. For instance, 0 and 1 can be swapped, and 1 and 2 can be swapped. So 0 can be moved past 2 via 1, but only if there's a path.\n\nWait, no. Because 0 can't be swapped with 2 directly, but if there's a 1 between them, like 0,1,2, can I move the 0 past the 2? Let's see: 0,1,2 → swap 1 and 2 to get 0,2,1. Then, can I swap 0 and 2? No, because that's not allowed. So the 0 is stuck before the 2. So in this case, 0 and 2 can't switch places because there's no way to move the 0 past the 2 without being able to swap them directly.\n\nHmm, so the relative order of 0 and 2 can't be changed. Because any 0 that comes before a 2 will remain before it, unless there's a way to swap them through other means. But since 0 can't be swapped with 2 directly, and the only way is via 1, but that doesn't allow a 0 and 2 to switch.\n\nWait, but what if there's a longer sequence? Like 0,1,2,1. Can I somehow get 0 to the end? Let's see. Swap the second 1 and 2: 0,1,2,1 → becomes 0,1,1,2. Then, the 0 can't go past the 1s, so no. Or wait, maybe I can do something else. Hmm, no, because the 0 is still at the front.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the allowed swaps:\n\n- Swap any two adjacent 0 and 1.\n- Swap any two adjacent 1 and 2.\n\nSo, for example, 0 and 1 can be reordered, but 0 and 2 can't. Similarly, 1 and 2 can be reordered, but 2 and 0 can't. So, the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. They can't cross each other. Because any 0 that is before a 2 must stay before it, and vice versa.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because if there's a 1 in between, can the 0 and 2 somehow be reordered through that?\n\nLet me take an example: 0,1,2. Can I arrange this into 2,0,1?\n\nNo. Because the 0 can't be swapped with the 2 directly. The only way is through 1. So, 0,1,2 → swap 1 and 2 to get 0,2,1. Now, the 0 is before 2. So, in this case, the 0 was already before 2, so nothing changes. What if it's 2,1,0? Can",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing a series of allowed swaps. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', and between adjacent '1' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that characters '0' and '2' cannot be directly swapped, but '1' acts as a bridge between them. This means that while '0's and '2's can be reordered relative to '1's, their positions relative to each other remain fixed. Therefore, we can only swap '0's among themselves and '2's among themselves, but their order relative to each other cannot change.\n\nBased on this, we can break down the problem into two parts:\n1. **Sort '0's**: Since '0's can be moved past '1's but not '2's, all '0's should be moved to the leftmost possible positions.\n2. **Sort '2's**: Similarly, all '2's should be moved to the rightmost possible positions, after all '0's and '1's.\n\nOnce the '0's are sorted to the left and the '2's to the right, the remaining '1's in the middle can be sorted among themselves.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    # First, count the number of 0s, 1s, and 2s\n    count0 = s.count('0')\n    count1 = s.count('1')\n    count2 = s.count('2')\n    \n    # The result will have all 0s first, followed by 1s, then 2s\n    res = ['0'] * count0 + ['1'] * count1 + ['2'] * count2\n    return ''.join(res)\n\n# Read input\ns = input().strip()\nprint(min_ternary_string(s))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Counting Characters**: We count how many '0's, '1's, and '2's are present in the input string.\n- **Construct Result String**: Using these counts, we construct the result string by placing all '0's first, followed by all '1's, and then all '2's.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it involves only counting and constructing the result string.\n\nThis method ensures that we achieve the lexicographically smallest string by leveraging the allowed swaps optimally.",
