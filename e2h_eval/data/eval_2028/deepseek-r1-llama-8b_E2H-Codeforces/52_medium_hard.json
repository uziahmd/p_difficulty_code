Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Vasily has some candles and can create new ones from the stubs. The goal is to find out how many hours he can keep the room lit. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nHmm, let's see. The initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for exactly one hour before it goes out. So the first thing that happens is, all 'a' candles burn, adding 'a' hours, and leaving 'a' stubs.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, the problem says he can make 'b' stubs into a new candle. So after burning 'a' candles, he has 'a' stubs. How many new candles can he make from them? It's a // b, right? Because each new candle requires 'b' stubs.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the process is: after burning a candle, you get a stub. Then, when you have enough stubs (like at least 'b' of them), you can exchange them for a new candle. So each time you have some stubs, you can convert as many as possible into new candles, then use those again, and so on until you can't make any more.\n\nSo the idea is to calculate the total hours by considering the initial a, then the additional candles made from the stubs, and so on.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Start with 'total_hours' = a.\n2. The number of stubs after burning the initial a candles is also a.\n3. While the number of stubs is >= b:\n   a. Make as many new candles as possible from the stubs. That's (stubs // b).\n   b. Add this number to total_hours because each new candle burns for an hour.\n   c. The new stubs are the ones left after making these new candles, plus the stubs from the newly burned candles.\n   Wait, no. Because each new candle burns for an hour, which gives another stub. So for each new candle x, it contributes x stubs after burning.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- After initial a candles: total_hours = a, stubs = a.\n- Now, while stubs >= b:\n   - new_candles = stubs // b\n   - total_hours += new_candles\n   - remaining_stubs = stubs % b + new_candles  # because each new candle adds a stub\n   - stubs = remaining_stubs\nRepeat this loop until stubs < b.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 4 2\n\nInitial: total = 4, stubs =4.\n\nLoop: stubs >=2.\n\nnew_candles =4//2=2. total becomes 4+2=6.\n\nremaining_stubs =4%2=0 +2=2.\n\nNow, stubs=2. Again, >=2.\n\nnew_candles=1. total=7.\n\nremaining_stubs=0 +1=1. Now stubs=1 <2, loop ends.\n\nSo total is 7, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: 6 3.\n\nInitial: 6, stubs=6.\n\n6//3=2, total 8. remaining_stubs=0+2=2.\n\nNext, stubs=2 <3, loop ends. So output is 8, correct.\n\nWhat about when a is less than b?\n\nLike a=5, b=10. Initial stubs=5<10, so no more candles. Total is 5.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=3.\n\nInitial:10, stubs=10.\n\nFirst iteration:10//3=3, total=13. stubs=10%3=1 +3=4.\n\nNow stubs=4<3? No, wait 4>=3.\n\nSecond iteration:4//3=1, total=14. stubs=1 +1=2. Now stubs=2<3. Loop ends. So total is 14.\n\nYes, because 10 +3 +1=14.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead a and b from input.\n\nInitialize total =a, stubs =a.\n\nLoop while stubs >=b:\n\n   new_candles = stubs //b\n\n   total += new_candles\n\n   stubs = (stubs %b) + new_candles\n\nEnd loop.\n\nPrint total.\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nThe code structure would be:\n\nRead the input line as two integers a and b.\n\nThen compute as above.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nCase where a=0: But according to the input constraints, a is at least 1, so no problem.\n\nWhat if b is 1? Well, but in the input, b is at least 2.\n\nWait, the input constraints say 2 ≤b ≤1000, so no division by zero or anything.\n\nSo the code can proceed safely.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead the line, split into a and b.\n\nCompute total and stubs.\n\nLoop.\n\nFinally, print total.\n\nImplementing in Python:\n\nSomething like:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = (stubs % b) + new\nprint(total)\n\nYes, that should do it.\n\nTesting with the samples:\n\nSample 1: a=4, b=2.\n\nLoop: stubs=4.\n\nnew=2, total=6. stubs=0+2=2.\n\nAgain, new=1, total=7. stubs=0+1=1 <2. Done.\n\nOutput 7.\n\nSample 2: a=6, b=3.\n\nStubs=6.\n\nnew=2, total=8. stubs=0+2=2 <3. Output 8.\n\nAnother test: a=5, b=3.\n\nStubs=5.\n\n5//3=1, total=6. stubs=5%3=2 +1=3.\n\nNext iteration: stubs=3 >=3.\n\nnew=1, total=7. stubs=0 +1=1 <3. So total is 7.\n\nWhich makes sense: 5 +1 +1 =7.\n\nAnother test: a=10, b=3.\n\nAs before, total is 14.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has and the stubs from burned-out candles. The process involves burning candles and then converting the resulting stubs into new candles to continue the cycle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a`. Each candle burns for exactly one hour, so initially, we can light the room for `a` hours.\n2. **Convert Stubs to Candles**: After burning all initial candles, we have `a` stubs. Using these stubs, we can create new candles by grouping them into sets of `b` stubs each. Each new candle will again burn for an hour and produce another stub.\n3. **Iterative Process**: Continue converting stubs into new candles as long as we have enough stubs (at least `b`). Each time we create new candles, add the number of new candles to the total hours and update the number of stubs accordingly.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The process stops when the number of stubs is less than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be made.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `a` and `b`, representing the initial number of candles and the number of stubs needed to make a new candle, respectively.\n- **Initial Hours Calculation**: The initial number of hours is simply the number of candles `a`.\n- **Loop for Conversion**: While there are enough stubs (`>= b`) to make new candles, we calculate how many new candles can be made, add this number to the total hours, and update the stub count to reflect the remaining stubs after making new candles plus the stubs from the newly burned ones.\n- **Output the Result**: Once the loop terminates, print the total number of hours the room can be illuminated.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion of stubs into new candles iteratively, ensuring that all possible hours are accounted for optimally.",
