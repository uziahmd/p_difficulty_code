Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Cards.\" Hmm. Let me read the description carefully.\n\nSo, Vanya has some cards with numbers on them. Each number can be positive, negative, or zero, but their absolute value doesn't exceed x. Natasha hid all his cards, but he found n of them. He wants the sum of all the found cards to be zero. But right now, the sum isn't zero. So, he needs to find some more cards (from the infinite supply of -x to x) to add to the found ones so that the total sum is zero. Our task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nWait, but how do we determine which cards to add? Because each card can have any value as long as it's within [-x, x], but in such a way that the sum becomes zero with as few cards as possible.\n\nLet me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. We need to make the total sum zero by adding some cards. So, the sum of the new cards should be -S. Let's denote the required sum for the new cards as T = -S.\n\nOur goal is to find the minimal number of cards k such that the sum of k cards is equal to T, where each card has an absolute value ≤ x.\n\nWhat's the minimal k? Well, the maximum possible sum we can get per card is x (if we choose x each time), and the minimum is -x. So, to reach T with as few cards as possible, we should maximize the contribution of each card.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Calculate the sum S of the found cards.\n2. Compute T = -S, which is the sum we need from the new cards.\n3. Find the minimal number of cards k such that k*x >= |T|. Because each card can contribute at most x towards T's absolute value.\n\nWait, let's break it down. Suppose T is positive. Then, each card can add up to x. So, the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x). Similarly, if T is negative, the same logic applies since the sum can be achieved by adding negative values, but each step contributes a maximum of x towards reducing the sum.\n\nWait, no. Wait, T is the sum needed. So, the absolute value of T divided by x gives the minimal number of cards. Because each card can contribute at most x towards the sum.\n\nSo, for example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then we need 3 cards: 2+2+1. Or wait, no—each card can be any value up to x. So, to get 5, the minimal number is ceil(5/2) = 3.\n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? Then, no cards are needed.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n- Compute the sum S of the given cards.\n- Compute T = -S.\n- If T is zero, output 0.\n- Else, compute the absolute value of T, divide by x, and take the ceiling. That's the minimal k.\n\nBut wait, let's test this with the examples given.\n\nIn the first example:\n\nInput:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nSum S is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T is -2. The absolute value is 2. x is 2. So 2/2=1 → k=1.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example:\n\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nSum S is -4. T is 4. x is 3. So 4/3 is 1.333, so ceiling is 2. So two cards each with 2: 2+2=4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if S is 0? Then, no cards needed.\n\nAnother case: if S is 5, x is 3. Then T is 5, so 5/3 is ~1.666, so ceiling is 2. So two cards: 3+2=5.\n\nWait, but wait: can the second card be 2? Yes, because 2 <=3.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo the steps are clear.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nThe input is two lines: the first line has n and x. Second line has n integers.\n\nCompute sum S of those integers.\n\nCompute T = -S.\n\nIf T is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute the absolute value of T, divide by x, and take the ceiling. That's the answer.\n\nBut wait, what if x is zero? Oh, no, according to the input constraints, x is at least 1. So we don't need to handle",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his found cards equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: Compute the sum of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Required Sum**: The target sum needed from the additional cards is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Compute Minimum Cards**: If the required sum is zero, no additional cards are needed. Otherwise, the minimum number of cards required is the ceiling of the absolute value of the required sum divided by x. This ensures that each card contributes the maximum possible value towards reaching the target sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent_sum = sum(cards)\nrequired = -current_sum\n\nif required == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    absolute_required = abs(required)\n    minimal_k = (absolute_required + x - 1) // x  # Ceiling division\n    print(minimal_k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: We read the number of found cards and the maximum absolute value of the cards. We then read the values on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the found cards.\n3. **Target Sum Calculation**: Determine the sum needed from the additional cards to make the total sum zero.\n4. **Ceiling Division**: Calculate the minimum number of cards required using ceiling division to ensure we cover any remainder when dividing the target sum by the maximum card value.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of additional cards needed by leveraging basic arithmetic operations and ensures optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
