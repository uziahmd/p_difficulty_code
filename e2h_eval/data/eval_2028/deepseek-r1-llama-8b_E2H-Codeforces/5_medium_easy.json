Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves.

It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks.

The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Colored Boots.\" Hmm.\n\nSo, the setup is that there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color represented by a lowercase letter or a question mark. We need to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of one left and one right boot, and their colors are compatible.\n\nWhat counts as compatible? Two specific colors are compatible if they're the same. A question mark is compatible with any color, including other question marks. So for example, '?' with 'a' is fine, 'a' with 'a' is also fine, but 'a' with 'b' isn't.\n\nOur goal is to maximize the number of such pairs. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair. So no overlapping.\n\nThe output needs to print the maximum k, followed by k lines each listing a left index and a right index, making sure all lefts and rights are unique in their respective lists.\n\nHmm. So how to approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about the structure of the problem. Each left boot can potentially pair with some right boots. We need to match them optimally.\n\nI remember that for problems like this, sometimes using greedy methods or bipartite matching algorithms like maximum bipartite matching could work. But considering the constraints (n up to 150,000), we need an efficient solution—probably O(n log n) time.\n\nWait, what's the maximum possible n here? 150,000. So any O(n^2) approach is definitely out of the question. We need something linear or near-linear.\n\nLet me think: For each left boot, determine which right boots are compatible. Then, assign as many as possible without overlapping.\n\nBut even that seems tricky because it's a matching problem. So perhaps we can model this as a bipartite graph where edges exist between compatible left and right boots, and then find the maximum matching.\n\nBut with n=15e4, building the graph is impossible—it would require way too much memory and time. So that approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the compatibility is based on the color, maybe we can group the left and right boots by their color (or question mark) and then compute the maximum possible matches within these groups.\n\nFor example, for each color c, count how many lefts have color c, how many rights have color c. The minimum of these two gives the number of pairs possible between those exact colors.\n\nAdditionally, consider the question mark. Any left '?' can pair with any right, regardless of the right's color. Similarly, any right '?' can pair with any left, but since each pair must consist of one left and one right, the total number from question marks is min(left_q, right_q), but wait—no. Because for question marks, all left ? can pair with any right, including those that have specific colors.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute:\n\n- For each specific color c, the number of lefts is l[c], the number of rights is r[c]. Pairs between these can be min(l[c], r[c]).\n\n- Additionally, for each left boot that's '?', it can pair with any right, including those that are not '?'. So the total number of possible pairs from left '?' is the number of left ? multiplied by the number of rights that are either ? or have a specific color.\n\nWait, no. Because when a left is '?', it can pair with any right, but each right can only be used once.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal strategy is:\n\n1. Handle the question marks first. Because each left ? can pair with any right, but we need to maximize the number of pairs.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to process certain colors first. Or perhaps the optimal way is to find the maximum possible by considering both specific colors and the question marks.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to model the problem as a bipartite graph where:\n\n- Left nodes are the left boots.\n\n- Right nodes are the right boots.\n\nAn edge exists between left i and right j if l[i] and r[j] are compatible.\n\nThen, the problem reduces to finding the maximum matching in this bipartite graph.\n\nBut again, with n=15e4, this is impossible to handle directly.\n\nSo, we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about how the edges are structured. An edge exists between left i and right j if:\n\n- l_i == r_j, or\n\n- l_i is '?', or\n\n- r_j is '?'.\n\nSo, for each left i, its compatible right j's are:\n\n- All j where r_j is '?' OR l_i is '?' OR r_j equals l_i.\n\nHmm. So for each left i, the compatible rights are:\n\nAll rights j where r_j is '?', plus all rights j where r_j == l_i.\n\nSo the set of compatible j's for i is the union of these two sets.\n\nNow, how can we model this efficiently?\n\nPerhaps, for each color c, collect all the right j's with r_j = c, and then for each left i with l_i = c, we can take the minimum between the count of c in left and right, and add that to the total.\n\nAdditionally, process the question marks.\n\nWait, but the question marks complicate things because a left ? can pair with any right, including those with specific colors.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible is the sum of:\n\n- For each c, min(left_c, right_c).\n\nPlus the minimum of the number of left ? and the number of right ?.\n\nBut no, because that's not correct. Because for example, a left ? can pair with a right that's already paired with a specific left.\n\nWait, let's take an example.\n\nSuppose:\n\nLeft: [ 'a', '?', 'c' ]\n\nRight: [ '?', 'a', 'c' ]\n\nIn this case:\n\n- Specific pairs:\n\n   - a pairs with a: 1\n\n   - c pairs with c: 1\n\nTotal specific pairs: 2.\n\nQuestion marks: 1 left ?, 1 right ?. So min(1,1) is 1 more pair.\n\nTotal is 3.\n\nBut another approach: the left ? can pair with the right a, which is already used as a specific pair. So that would not be allowed.\n\nSo the initial approach of adding specific pairs and then the question mark pairs is incorrect because it may overcount.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, each boot can be part of at most one pair. So once a right is used in a specific pair, it cannot be used again in a question mark pair.\n\nSo the problem is not just the sum of min(c) and min(q), but more involved.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the question marks can contribute to the total, but the way to calculate it depends on the remaining available rights after handling the specific pairs.\n\nThis suggests that the order in which we process the pairs matters. For instance, perhaps processing the specific pairs first, and then the question mark pairs is the way to go, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible is the sum of the number of specific pairs plus the number of question mark pairs, but ensuring that each right is only used once.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think of it this way:\n\nEach pair can be of two types:\n\n1. Exact match: l_i == r_j.\n\n2. Mixed: l_i is '?', r_j is anything (could be '?', but in that case, it's already considered in type 1 or 2).\n\nWait, no. Because if both are '?', then it's an exact match, which is handled in type 1.\n\nSo the mixed type is when one is '?' and the other is a specific color.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nType 1: l_i == r_j.\n\nType 2: l_i is '?' AND r_j is something else (could be a specific color or '?'), but since l_i is '?', it's compatible with r_j regardless.\n\nBut in this case, since each pair is made of one left and one right, the Type 2 pairs can only use rights that are not used in Type 1.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is:\n\n- Compute the maximum number of Type 1 pairs.\n\n- Then, compute the maximum number of Type 2 pairs, using the remaining available rights.\n\nBut how to model the remaining available rights after Type 1.\n\nWait, but how to compute the maximum possible Type 1 pairs.\n\nFor Type 1, for each color c, the number of pairs is the minimum of the number of lefts with c and the number of rights with c.\n\nSumming this over all c gives the total Type 1 pairs.\n\nThen, for Type 2, we can have left ? pairing with any right that hasn't been used yet.\n\nBut the rights that are used in Type 1 are the ones with r_j = c where l_i was c.\n\nSo, after Type 1, the remaining rights are:\n\nrights = total_rights - Type_1_pairs * 1 (since each Type 1 pair uses one right per left).\n\nWait, no. Because for each Type 1 pair, one left and one right are used. So the number of used rights is equal to the number of Type 1 pairs.\n\nSo the number of remaining rights is (total_rights - Type_1_pairs).\n\nSimilarly, the number of left ? is fixed (let's call it L_q). So the maximum Type 2 pairs is the minimum of L_q and (remaining_rights).\n\nSo total = Type_1 + Type_2.\n\nBut wait, what about the rights that were used as '?'. Like, suppose a right is '?', and in Type 1, it wasn't used. It can be used in Type 2.\n\nSo yes, the approach is:\n\nCompute Type_1 as the sum for each c of min(left_c, right_c).\n\nCompute Type_2 as min(L_q, R_q') where R_q' is the number of rights that are not used in Type_1.\n\nBut wait, R_q' is the number of rights that are either '?' or have a color not present in any Type_1 pair.\n\nBecause for a right j, if r_j is '?', it can be used in Type 2. If it's a specific color, but that color's lefts are all used in Type_1, then it can also be used in Type_2.\n\nWait, no. Because for a specific color c, if all lefts with c are used in Type_1, then the rights with c are all used. So the remaining rights are those that are not c.\n\nBut this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate Type_2 as the minimum of the number of left ? and the number of right ? plus the number of left ? that can pair with specific rights that weren't used in Type_1.\n\nBut that seems complicated.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is:\n\nAfter computing Type_1, the number of available rights is (R_total - Type_1_pairs). Because each Type_1 pair uses one right.\n\nThe number of left ? is L_q.\n\nSo the maximum Type_2 is the minimum of L_q and (R_total - Type_1_pairs).\n\nBut wait, that's not exactly correct because some of the R_total - Type_1_pairs are specific colors, but the left ? can pair with any of them.\n\nYes, because the left ? can pair with any right, regardless of color.\n\nSo, the total Type_2 is min(L_q, (R_total - Type_1_pairs)).\n\nSo overall, the total pairs is Type_1 + Type_2.\n\nBut wait, let's test this with an example.\n\nExample 1:\n\nl = ['a', '?', 'c']\n\nr = ['a', 'c', '?']\n\nType_1: for 'a', min(1,1)=1; for 'c', min(1,1)=1. So Type_1 is 2.\n\nL_q is 1, R_total is 3. After Type_1, R_used is 2, so remaining rights is 1.\n\nType_2 is min(1, 1) = 1.\n\nTotal is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nl = ['?', '?']\n\nr = ['a', 'b']\n\nType_1: for each c, left_c is 0 except for '?', so Type_1 is 0.\n\nType_2: L_q is 2, R_total is 2. So Type_2 is 2.\n\nTotal 2.\n\nAnother example:\n\nl = ['a', '?', 'b']\n\nr = ['a', '?', 'b']\n\nType_1: a:1, b:1. Type_1 is 2.\n\nL_q is 1. R_total is 3. R_used is 2, so remaining is 1.\n\nType_2 is min(1,1) =1.\n\nTotal 3.\n\nSo yes, this approach works.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput:\n\nn = 2\n\nl = \"??\"\n\nr = \"??\"\n\nType_1: for each c, min(2, 2) =2 for c='a' if any, but in reality, since all are '?', the Type_1 is 2 (each '?' pairs as exact match).\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each c, the number of lefts with c is 2 (since all are '?'), but the number of rights with c is 2 (all are '?'). So for each c, min is 2, but since there are 26 possible letters, this approach would overcount.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Oh wait, no. Because for a particular c, the number of lefts is 2 (all are '?'), but the number of rights with c is 2 (all are '?'). So for each c, we add min(2,2) =2, which when summed over 26 letters gives 52, which is way more than possible.\n\nSo clearly, this approach is incorrect.\n\nAh, I see the mistake. The previous approach counts for each c, min(left_c, right_c), but when l and r are all '?', this approach would sum over all 26 letters, which is wrong.\n\nSo the previous approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, we need a different approach.\n\nHmm. So what's the correct way to count the Type_1 pairs.\n\nWait, Type_1 is the number of pairs where l_i == r_j. But when l_i is '?', it can pair with any r_j, including '?', but in this case, l_i is '?', so r_j can be anything.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the Type_1 is specifically for exact matches, i.e., l_i equals r_j. So when l_i is '?', it can pair with r_j only if r_j is '?', because l_i is '?', so it can pair with any r_j, but the Type_1 counts only when l_i and r_j are exactly the same.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if l_i is '?', and r_j is 'a', then l_i and r_j are compatible because '? is compatible with 'a', but they are not exact matches. So Type_1 is only when l_i and r_j are exactly same.\n\nSo in the example where l and r are all '?', the Type_1 pairs are all possible pairs where l_i and r_j are same. But since all are '?', all pairs are acceptable as Type_1.\n\nBut in that case, the maximum number of Type_1 pairs is n, because each left can pair with any right, but each can only be used once.\n\nWait, no. Because each left can pair with exactly one right. So for n=2, you can have 2 pairs: left 1 with right 1, and left 2 with right 2. That's two pairs.\n\nBut according to the previous approach, it's min(left_c, right_c) for each c. For c='?', left_c is 2, right_c is 2, so min is 2. Summing for all c would give 2*26=52, which is way more than n.\n\nSo that approach is wrong.\n\nSo, the initial approach is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that a single '?' can't pair with multiple rights.\n\nSo, what's the correct way to compute Type_1?\n\nType_1 is the number of pairs where l_i == r_j. So for each i, j, if l_i == r_j, then it's a possible pair.\n\nBut since each i and j can be used only once, the problem is to find the maximum matching where each left is matched to a right such that their colors are same.\n\nThis sounds like a bipartite graph where each left node is connected to right nodes with the same color. The maximum matching in this graph is the Type_1.\n\nBut how to compute that quickly.\n\nWait, but this is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of exact color matches, with each left and right used once.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that for Type_1 pairs, each left can be matched to a right of the same color. So the maximum number of Type_1 pairs is the sum for each color c of the minimum between the count of lefts with color c and the count of rights with color c.\n\nBut wait, that's what the initial approach did, which failed in the example where all are '?'.\n\nAh, right. Because in that case, the sum for all c would be 26*(min(left_q, right_q)), which is 26*2=52, but the actual maximum Type_1 is 2.\n\nSo the initial approach overcounts Type_1 when there are multiple '?'.\n\nSo, the problem is that the initial approach considers each color separately, but when a color is '?', it's being treated as multiple colors, leading to overcounting.\n\nSo, perhaps we need to adjust for the '?' color.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think differently. For each color c (including '?'), the number of Type_1 pairs is min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c]).\n\nBut in the case where c is '?', the l_counts['?'] is the number of lefts that are '?', and r_counts['?'] is the number of rights that are '?'.\n\nSo, for c='?', the number of Type_1 pairs contributed is min(l_q, r_q), where l_q is the number of lefts that are '?', and r_q is the number of rights that are '?'.\n\nWait, that's correct because for a left '?' and a right '?', they form a Type_1 pair.\n\nSo in the earlier example where all are '?', the Type_1 is min(2,2) =2, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, in that case, the sum of Type_1 is 2, but in the initial approach, the code would have considered all 26 letters, each contributing 0, except for '?', which contributes 2.\n\nWait, no. Because in the initial approach, for each c, including '?', it adds min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c]). So for the example where all are '?', for c='?', it's 2, and for other c's, it's 0. So the sum is 2, which is correct.\n\nSo why did the initial approach fail in that case? Oh, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis.\n\nWait, let's re-examine:\n\nIn the example where l and r are all '?', the initial approach computes Type_1 as min(left_q, right_q) = 2. Then Type_2 is min(left_q - Type_1, R_total - Type_1). Wait, no. Type_2 is computed as min(L_q, R_available), where R_available is R_total - Type_1.\n\nSo in this case, L_q is 2, R_available is 3 (since R_total is 3, and Type_1 is 2). So Type_2 is min(2,1) =1.\n\nTotal is 3.\n\nBut in reality, the maximum possible pairs is 2, because each left can pair with one right, and in Type_1, you have two pairs (like 1-1, 2-2), and then you can't have any more Type_2 because all rights are used.\n\nWait, no. Wait, after Type_1, Type_1 pairs are 2. So R_available is 3 - 2 =1.\n\nWait, but the initial approach says Type_2 is min(2,1)=1.\n\nBut in reality, all rights are used in Type_1, so no Type_2 pairs can be formed.\n\nSo the initial approach overcounts in this scenario.\n\nHmm. So the problem is that the initial approach double-counts the '?' cases.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to compute Type_1 as the sum for each color c of min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c]), but for c='?', we subtract the Type_1 pairs and compute Type_2 accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps should be:\n\n1. Compute for each color c, the number of Type_1 pairs: t1 = sum over c of min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c]).\n\n2. Compute the number of left ? (L_q) and right ? (R_q).\n\n3. The number of Type_2 pairs is the minimum of L_q and R_q, but also ensuring that the sum of Type_2 does not exceed the remaining available rights after Type_1.\n\nWait, but in the previous example, Type_1 is 2 (from the '?'), then Type_2 is min(2, 3-2=1) → 1. But in reality, after using 2 Type_1 pairs, all rights are used, so Type_2 is 0.\n\nSo the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is that the Type_1 includes the pairs where both are '?', which should not be considered as Type_2.\n\nWait, no. Because in Type_1, the pairs are exactly when l_i == r_j. So when both are '?', they are considered Type_1.\n\nThus, in the initial approach, when we compute Type_1 as sum of min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c]) for each c, including '?', then Type_2 is computed as min(L_q, R_available), but R_available is R_total - Type_1.\n\nWait, but in the case where all are '?', R_available is 3-2=1. L_q is 2. So Type_2 is 1, but in reality, you can't have any more Type_2 pairs because all rights are used.\n\nSo the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to compute Type_1 as the sum of min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c]) for all c except '?'. Then, compute Type_1 for '?', but then, for Type_2, we have the remaining rights.\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nType_1 is the sum for all c except '?' of min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c]).\n\nThen, for the '?', the number of Type_1 pairs is min(l_q, r_q).\n\nThen, the remaining rights after Type_1 is (R_total - Type_1).\n\nSo Type_2 is min(L_q, R_available).\n\nBut wait, no. Because Type_1 for '?', which is min(l_q, r_q), is included in the sum, so the remaining rights are R_total - Type_1.\n\nSo, for the case where all are '?', Type_1 is min(2,2) =2. So R_available is 3-2=1.\n\nType_2 is min(2,1)=1.\n\nBut in reality, that's impossible because the 2 Type_1 pairs have used all 3 rights (since each pair uses one right). Wait, no: Type_1 is 2, which uses 2 rights. So R_available is 1.\n\nSo Type_2 can be 1. But that would require using one more right, which is not possible because the Type_1 has already used two, and R_total is 3.\n\nWait, no. R_available is 1, meaning that one right is unused in Type_1.\n\nBut in the case where all are '?', all 3 rights are '?', so in Type_1, 2 pairs are formed (say, 1-1 and 2-2). The third right (3) is still available.\n\nSo for Type_2, the left ? can pair with the third right, which is '?'. But in the initial approach, Type_2 is computed as 1, which is correct.\n\nWait, no. Because the Type_2 is the number of pairs where a left ? is paired with any right that hasn't been used in Type_1.\n\nBut the Type_1 pairs used two rights. So there's one right left. So Type_2 is min(2,1) =1. So total pairs is 3.\n\nBut that's correct because:\n\nPair 1-1 (Type_1), 2-2 (Type_1), 3-1 (Type_2). Or 3-2 (Type_2).\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nWait, but in that case, the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo why in the earlier example did the approach seem to overcount?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in that analysis.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is correct, and my confusion was due to a miscalculation.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nType_1 = sum for each c of min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c]).\n\nType_2 = min(L_q, R_available), where R_available = R_total - Type_1.\n\nThus, the total pairs is Type_1 + Type_2.\n\nSo, now the next step is to implement this.\n\nBut wait, how do we compute Type_1 correctly when some c's have l_counts[c] and r_counts[c] greater than zero.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe can create two dictionaries (or arrays) for left and right counts.\n\nCompute for each c, min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\nSum all these to get Type_1.\n\nThen, compute L_q = left_counts.get('?', 0)\n\nR_q = right_counts.get('?', 0)\n\nType_2 = min(L_q, R_total - Type_1)\n\nTotal = Type_1 + Type_2.\n\nBut wait, this might not be correct because in the case where a left is '?', it can pair with any right, including those that are not '?'. But in the initial approach, Type_1 already includes the pairs where left is '?' and right is '?'.\n\nSo, the Type_2 is the number of additional pairs where left is '?' and the right is not '?', but that's not correct because the right could be a specific color.\n\nWait, no. Because the Type_2 is the number of pairs where left is '?' and right is any (including '?') but the right hasn't been used in Type_1.\n\nBut in the initial approach, Type_1 includes all pairs where left and right are same, including when both are '?'.\n\nSo, the Type_2 is the number of pairs where left is '?' and right is any, but the right is not already used in Type_1.\n\nWhich is handled by R_available = R_total - Type_1.\n\nSo, for example, if R_total is 3, Type_1 is 2, then R_available is 1.\n\nThus, Type_2 is the minimum of L_q and 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is correct.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute left_counts and right_counts for each color.\n\n2. Compute Type_1 as the sum for each color c of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\n3. Compute L_q as left_counts.get('?', 0), R_q as right_counts.get('?', 0).\n\n4. Compute R_available = R_total - Type_1.\n\n5. Type_2 = min(L_q, R_available).\n\n6. Total pairs = Type_1 + Type_2.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where a right is '?', and not used in Type_1, but is available for Type_2.\n\nYes, because R_available is the total rights minus Type_1.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nSo, now the next step is to compute the actual pairs.\n\nBut how to collect the pairs?\n\nWe need to collect the Type_1 pairs first, then the Type_2.\n\nBut how to represent the pairs.\n\nFor Type_1:\n\nFor each color c, find the indices of the lefts that are c, and the indices of the rights that are c.\n\nWe can then match the lefts and rights in a way that maximizes the number of pairs.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe can sort the lefts and rights for each color c, and then pair the first k of lefts with the first k of rights, where k is min(l_count[c], r_count[c]).\n\nBut to collect the actual pairs, we need to note the original indices.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to collect all the possible pairs for Type_1, then collect all possible pairs for Type_2.\n\nBut for large n, this might be computationally intensive.\n\nBut given that n is up to 150,000, we need an efficient way to collect the pairs.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, for Type_1:\n\nWe can process each color c:\n\n- Collect all the indices of lefts that are c.\n\n- Collect all the indices of rights that are c.\n\n- Take the minimum of the two counts.\n\n- Pair the first x lefts with the first x rights, where x is the min.\n\nBut to pair them, we can take the first x lefts and the first x rights, sorted.\n\nWait, but the order doesn't matter as long as each is matched once.\n\nBut perhaps, for the purpose of pairing, we can just collect the left indices and the right indices in the order they appear, and then take the first x pairs.\n\nBut the problem is that the left and right indices are 1-based in the output.\n\nSo, for each c:\n\nleft_indices = list of positions where l[i] == c.\n\nright_indices = list of positions where r[i] == c.\n\nx = min(len(left_indices), len(right_indices)).\n\nTake the first x left indices, and the first x right indices, and create pairs (left, right).\n\nAdd these to the list of Type_1 pairs.\n\nBut for large n, this could be O(n) per color, which is manageable because the number of colors is 26 + 1.\n\nWait, but 27 is manageable.\n\nOnce Type_1 is processed, then for Type_2, we need to collect the left ? indices, and the right ? indices, and pair as much as possible.\n\nBut wait, no. Because Type_2 is the number of pairs where left is ? and the right is any (including ?), but not used in Type_1.\n\nWait, no. Type_2 is the number of pairs where left is ? and the right is any that is not used in Type_1.\n\nBut the right can be a '?', as long as it's not used in Type_1.\n\nSo, after Type_1, the R_available is the number of rights not used in Type_1.\n\nThese rights can include rights that are '?', but were not used in Type_1.\n\nSo, for Type_2, we can pair as many left ? as possible with any of the R_available rights.\n\nBut the problem is to collect the pairs.\n\nSo, steps for collecting pairs:\n\n1. For Type_1:\n\n   a. For each color c:\n\n      i. Get the list of left indices where l[i] == c.\n\n      ii. Get the list of right indices where r[i] == c.\n\n      iii. x = min(len(left), len(right)).\n\n      iv. Take the first x left indices and first x right indices.\n\n      v. For each k in 0..x-1: add (left[k], right[k]) to the list.\n\n2. For Type_2:\n\n   a. Collect all left ? indices: L_q_list.\n\n   b. Collect all right ? indices: R_q_list.\n\n   c. The number of Type_2 pairs is min(len(L_q_list), R_available).\n\n   d. Take the first y = min(len(L_q_list), R_available) left ? indices and first y right ? indices.\n\n   e. For each k in 0..y-1: add (L_q_list[k], R_q_list[k]) to the list.\n\nBut wait, no. Because R_available includes all rights not used in Type_1, which includes not just the '?' rights, but also any specific color rights that were not used in Type_1.\n\nSo, for Type_2, the right can be any right that is not used in Type_1.\n\nBut how to track which rights are available?\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to represent the Type_2 pairs as follows:\n\n- For Type_2, we need to pair each left ? with a right that is not used in Type_1.\n\nBut to do this, we need to track which rights are used in Type_1.\n\nBut for n=15e4, this is not feasible with a simple array.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\n- For Type_1, collect all the used rights. These are the rights that are used in Type_1.\n\n- For Type_2, the available rights are the ones not in this set.\n\nBut storing the used rights is impractical for n=15e4.\n\nSo, perhaps a smarter way is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Type_2 can be constructed by taking the left ? indices and the right ? indices, and pairing them, but ensuring that the number of pairs is min(L_q, R_available).\n\nBut how to ensure that the right is not used in Type_1.\n\nWait, perhaps the right is a '?' and not used in Type_1, or a specific color but not used in Type_1.\n\nBut how to track that.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for Type_2, the available rights are:\n\nrights_available = [j for j in 0..n-1 if j not in Type_1_right_used_set]\n\nBut again, storing this is not feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps the following:\n\nAfter processing Type_1, for the right indices used in Type_1, mark them in a set.\n\nBut for n=15e4, this is manageable as a boolean array.\n\nWait, but n can be up to 150,000, so a list of booleans is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Create a list 'used_right' of size n, initialized to False.\n\n- For each Type_1 pair (i,j), mark used_right[j] = True.\n\n- Then, for Type_2, iterate through all left ? indices and all right ? indices, and for each right j not used_right[j], pair it with a left i.\n\nBut this could lead to a situation where a right j is not used in Type_1 but is a specific color, and thus can be used in Type_2.\n\nBut how to efficiently find which rights are available.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\n- For Type_2, we can collect all right j where used_right[j] is False.\n\n- Then, the available rights are these j's.\n\n- We need to pair as many left ? as possible with these j's.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For Type_1:\n\n   a. For each color c:\n\n      i. Collect left indices where l[i] == c.\n\n      ii. Collect right indices where r[i] == c.\n\n      iii. x = min(len(left), len(right)).\n\n      iv. For k in 0..x-1:\n\n          - add (left[k], right[k]) to Type_1_pairs.\n\n          - mark used_right[right[k]] = True.\n\n2. For Type_2:\n\n   a. Collect all left ? indices into L_q_list.\n\n   b. Collect all right j where used_right[j] is False into R_available.\n\n   c. Now, we need to pair as many left ? as possible with R_available.\n\n   d. The number of Type_2 pairs is min(len(L_q_list), len(R_available)).\n\n   e. For each left i in L_q_list[:y], and right j in R_available[:y], where y is the min, pair them.\n\nBut this requires creating R_available as a list, which for n=15e4 could be expensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can track for each right j whether it is available.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to collect all the right j's that are not used in Type_1, and then collect the left ? indices and pair them.\n\nSo, during the Type_1 processing, we mark the used right indices.\n\nThen, for Type_2, we can collect all right j's where used_right[j] is False.\n\nBut how to collect them efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute all the right j's where r[j] == '?', and then for Type_2, collect those j's that are not used in Type_1.\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient because some specific color j's are not used in Type_1 and can be paired with left ?.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for Type_2, we can collect all the right j's that are not used in Type_1, regardless of their color.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nWait, perhaps the following:\n\nDuring Type_1 processing, for each right j used, mark it in a boolean array.\n\nThen, for Type_2, we can collect all j's where used_right[j] is False.\n\nThese j's can be paired with left ?.\n\nBut for n=15e4, this is manageable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Initialize used_right as a list of False, size n.\n\n- For Type_1:\n\n   a. For each color c:\n\n      i. Get left list and right list.\n\n      ii. x = min(len(left), len(right)).\n\n      iii. For k in 0..x-1:\n\n          - i = left[k], j = right[k].\n\n          - Mark used_right[j] = True.\n\n          - Add (i+1, j+1) to Type_1_pairs.\n\n- After Type_1, collect all right j where used_right[j] is False.\n\n   a. This can be done by iterating through all j and checking used_right[j].\n\n   b. Store them in R_available.\n\n- Then, collect all left ? indices: L_q_list.\n\n- The number of Type_2 pairs is min(len(L_q_list), len(R_available)).\n\n- Select the first y pairs from L_q_list and R_available,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. Each boot has a color represented by a lowercase letter or a question mark ('?'). Two boots are compatible if their colors are the same or if one of them is a question mark.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Colors**: First, we count the occurrences of each color in both left and right boot lists.\n2. **Exact Matches (Type 1 Pairs)**: For each color, determine the maximum number of exact matches between left and right boots. This is done by taking the minimum of the counts of each color from both lists.\n3. **Question Mark Pairs (Type 2 Pairs)**: After handling exact matches, we use the remaining available right boots to form pairs with left question mark boots. The number of such pairs is determined by the minimum of the remaining right boots and the count of left question mark boots.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n\n    left_counts = {}\n    for c in l:\n        left_counts[c] = left_counts.get(c, 0) + 1\n    right_counts = {}\n    for c in r:\n        right_counts[c] = right_counts.get(c, 0) + 1\n\n    # Initialize used_right array\n    used_right = [False] * n\n\n    type1_pairs = []\n\n    # Process Type 1: exact matches\n    for c in left_counts:\n        if c in right_counts:\n            left_list = []\n            right_list = []\n            for i in range(n):\n                if l[i] == c:\n                    left_list.append(i)\n                if r[i] == c:\n                    right_list.append(i)\n            x = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n            for k in range(x):\n                i = left_list[k]\n                j = right_list[k]\n                used_right[j] = True\n                type1_pairs.append((i+1, j+1))\n\n    # Now process Type 2: left ? with any unused right\n    L_q = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] == '?':\n            L_q.append(i+1)\n\n    R_available = []\n    for j in range(n):\n        if not used_right[j]:\n            R_available.append(j+1)\n\n    y = min(len(L_q), len(R_available))\n    type2_pairs = []\n    for k in range(y):\n        type2_pairs.append((L_q[k], R_available[k]))\n\n    total_pairs = type1_pairs + type2_pairs\n\n    # Output the result\n    print(len(total_pairs))\n    for pair in total_pairs:\n        print(pair[0], pair[1])\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of boots and their respective colors.\n2. **Counting Colors**: We count the occurrences of each color in both the left and right boot lists.\n3. **Exact Matches**: For each color, we determine the maximum number of exact matches by comparing the counts from both lists.

The number of such pairs is limited by the minimum of the remaining right boots and the count of left question mark boots.\n5. **Output**: Finally, we print the total number of pairs and the pairs themselves.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the number of compatible pairs efficiently, even for large input sizes.",
