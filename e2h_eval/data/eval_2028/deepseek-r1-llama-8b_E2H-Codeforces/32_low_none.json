    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Array Stabilization. Hmm.\n\nThe task says that given an array of integers, I need to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. So, for each possible removal of an element, I calculate the new max and min, subtract them, and then find the smallest such value among all possibilities.\n\nWait, but calculating this naively for each element would be O(n^2), which won't work for n up to 1e5. That's way too big. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about what happens when we remove an element. The max and min of the remaining array could either stay the same or change depending on whether the removed element was the current max, min, or something else.\n\nSo, the plan is: find all possible candidates for the new max and min after each possible removal, and compute the minimal instability.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nHmm, maybe the key is to precompute the global max and min, and then consider the cases where removing an element affects either the max or the min.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The initial max and min are known. When we remove an element, the new max will be either the original max (if the removed element wasn't the max) or the next highest element. Similarly for the min.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Find the global max and its count (how many times it appears).\n2. Find the global min and its count.\n3. Then, for each element, consider if removing it would affect the max or min.\n\nWait, but that might not capture all scenarios. For example, if the max occurs multiple times, removing one of them doesn't change the max.\n\nSo, the idea is to compute:\n\nFor each possible candidate element to remove, determine what the new max and min would be. The minimal instability is then (new_max - new_min). We need the minimal such value across all possible removals.\n\nBut computing this for each element directly isn't feasible because n is up to 1e5.\n\nAlternative approach: find the best possible scenario after removing each element by considering the cases where the max or min could decrease.\n\nLet me think about the possible candidates for the new max and new min after removing an element.\n\nSuppose the array has elements sorted. Then, for each element a[i], if I remove it, the new max could be either the next higher element or remain the same if a[i] wasn't the max. Similarly for min.\n\nWait, but the array isn't necessarily sorted. So perhaps the first step is to sort the array. Then, for each position i, if I remove a[i], the new max is the maximum of the array without a[i], which would be the max between the left part (from 0 to i-1) and the right part (i+1 to end). But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for the sorted array, the max and min are at the ends. So, if I can find, for each element, whether removing it affects the max or the min.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal scenario is to choose to remove an element that is either the current max or current min, especially if they have duplicates.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the array. This helps in quickly finding the next max or min after removing an element.\n\n2. Compute the initial max and min. But wait, after sorting, the max is the last element, min is the first.\n\n3. Now, for each possible element to remove, find the new max and min.\n\nBut for each i in 0 to n-1, the new max would be either the same as the original max (if a[i] is not the max) or the second last element if a[i] is the max. Wait, no. Because after removing a[i], if a[i] is the max, then the new max is the next highest, which could be the second max in the array.\n\nSimilarly for the min: if a[i] is the min, then the new min is the next smallest.\n\nBut how do I find the second max and second min quickly?\n\nWait, here's another thought: in the sorted array, the max is a[-1], and the second max is a[-2]. Similarly, the min is a[0], and the second min is a[1].\n\nSo, when you remove an element, the new max could be the original max (if it's not the element being removed) or the second max. Similarly for the min.\n\nWait, but that's only true if the element being removed is either the max or the min, or perhaps even if it's in between.\n\nNo, that's not correct. For example, suppose the array is [1, 3, 4, ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps us efficiently determine the potential new max and min values after removing any element.\n2. **Identify Key Values**: Determine the current maximum (max_val) and minimum (min_val) values of the array.\n3. **Compute Second Max and Min**: After sorting, the second maximum value is the second last element, and the second minimum value is the second element.\n4. **Evaluate Each Element Removal**: For each element, check if removing it affects the max or min. If it does, compute the instability for the resulting array and keep track of the minimum instability found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, *rest = map(int, open(0).read().split())\na = rest[0]\na = list(map(int, a.split()))\na.sort()\n\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\nmin_val = a[0]\nmax_val = a[-1]\n\n# Compute the second min and max\nsecond_min = a[1]\nsecond_max = a[-2]\n\ncandidates = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    # Current element being removed is a[i]\n    if a[i] == max_val:\n        # New max is second_max\n        new_max = second_max\n    else:\n        new_max = max_val\n\n    if a[i] == min_val:\n        # New min is second_min\n        new_min = second_min\n    else:\n        new_min = min_val\n\n    instability = new_max - new_min\n    candidates.append(insanity)\n\n# Now, find the minimal instability\nprint(min(candidates))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Array**: By sorting the array, we can easily access the maximum and minimum values and their neighbors.\n2. **Identifying Key Values**: The maximum and minimum values are at the ends of the sorted array. Their neighbors are the second maximum and second minimum.\n3. **Evaluating Each Element**: For each element, we consider what happens if we remove it. If the element is the current max, the new max becomes the second max; similarly, if it's the current min, the new min becomes the second min.\n4. **Computing Instability**: For each removal, compute the instability and track the minimum value across all possible removals.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum possible instability without having to repeatedly scan the entire array, making it suitable for large input sizes.",
