    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about counting the number of permutation pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q, and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And then return this count modulo a given mod. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem statement again. We have two permutations p and q of 1..n. We need to find all pairs where p < q lex-wise, and inv(p) > inv(q). Then sum all such pairs modulo mod.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Well, the constraints are n up to 500, which isn't too bad. So maybe a dynamic programming approach is possible here.\n\nWait, but for each pair (p, q), checking both conditions directly would be O(n^2 * something), which might not be feasible for n=500. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the properties of p and q. Since p is lex smaller than q, p must be a permutation that is considered smaller than q when compared element by element from the start. For example, if p[0] < q[0], then p is smaller regardless of the rest. If p[0] == q[0], then we look at p[1] vs q[1], and so on.\n\nNow, considering the inversion counts: an inversion is a pair (i,j) where i < j and p[i] > p[j]. So the total inversions can vary from 0 (sorted) to n*(n-1)/2 (reverse sorted).\n\nThe key is to find all pairs (p, q) such that p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). How can I model this?\n\nAn alternative approach: for each permutation p, count the number of q's that are lex larger than p and have fewer inversions than p. Summing this over all p gives the answer.\n\nBut even so, for n=500, enumerating all p and q is impossible because there are n! permutations each, which is way too big.\n\nSo I need a mathematical way to model this.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the lex order and inversion count can be represented in a way that allows us to compute the required sum efficiently.\n\nWait, maybe we can model the problem with some kind of DP state that keeps track of certain parameters related to p and q.\n\nWait, but since p and q are different permutations, perhaps we can represent their relationship in a way that captures the necessary constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's useful to consider the parity of the inversion count or other properties, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. Suppose I fix p and q. How can I determine whether p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)?\n\nFor p to be lex smaller than q, there must be a first position k where p[k] < q[k], and for all positions before k, p[i] = q[i].\n\nAt the same time, inv(p) must be greater than inv(q).\n\nHmm. Maybe I can model this by considering the minimal elements or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each possible pair of permutations (p, q) whether p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), but as mentioned before, that's not feasible for n=500.\n\nWait, but n is 500, which suggests that an O(n^3) solution is acceptable, perhaps even O(n^4) but with optimizations.\n\nWait, no, n=500, n^4 is 500^4 = 6.25e+11 operations, which is way beyond computational feasibility. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nMaybe the problem can be broken down into considering the structure of p and q.\n\nAnother angle: since p and q are both permutations, perhaps the relative ordering of certain key elements determines the lex order and the inversion counts.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be approached by considering the minimal possible inversion count for a permutation less than q, but that seems vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the problem using inclusion-exclusion or combinatorics.\n\nLet me think about the inversion count. The inversion count is a measure of how 'unsorted' the permutation is. So for two permutations p and q, if p is lex smaller than q, does that imply anything specific about their inversion counts?\n\nNot necessarily. For example, the identity permutation has zero inversions and is lex smallest, but another permutation like [1,3,2] also has one inversion but is still lex smaller than many others.\n\nWait, but if p is lex smaller than q, perhaps certain structures in p make its inversion count higher. Or perhaps not. It's unclear.\n\nHmm, maybe the key is to find for each possible permutation p, the number of q's that are lex greater than p and have inv(q) < inv(p).\n\nThen the answer is the sum over all p of this count.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each p, compute the number of q's that are lex larger than p and have fewer inversions than p.\n\nBut how do I compute this efficiently?\n\nThis seems challenging. Perhaps we can model the problem in terms of the inversion table or other permutation representations.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem using dynamic programming, tracking for each possible prefix and certain state variables, the number of ways to form p and q satisfying the constraints.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to structure this.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps for each permutation p, the minimal inversion count among all q's lex larger than p can help, but again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into independent steps based on the lex order. For instance, for each position, decide the next element in p and q, ensuring that p is lex smaller than q, and track the inversion counts accordingly.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to manage the inversion counts during this process.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for patterns or mathematical relationships between the inversion counts of p and q when p is lex smaller than q.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into counting certain inversion-related properties across all pairs.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that for p < q, the number of inversions in p can be either more or less than that in q. So we're only interested in cases where it's more.\n\nBut how do the lex order and inversion counts relate? It's unclear.\n\nMaybe I can model this with a DP that considers the current state of building p and q step by step.\n\nLet's think about building p and q character by character, from left to right.\n\nAt each step, I choose the next element in p and q, ensuring that p remains lex smaller than q. Also, I track the inversion counts for p and q so far.\n\nWait, but inversion count is a global property, not just the prefix. So tracking it step by step is tricky.\n\nHmm, that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the inversion count as a function of the permutation, and then trying to find some relation between p and q.\n\nWait, but I'm not seeing a clear path.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the number of inversion pairs (p, q) can be expressed as the sum over all possible k of the number of pairs where inv(p) = k and inv(q) = m, and then computing the sum for all k > m where p < q.\n\nBut again, how to compute this without iterating over all possible k and m.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be split into considering all possible inversion counts, and for each possible count, count the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q, inv(p) = a, and inv(q) = b, and a > b.\n\nBut even then, it's unclear how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem where we compute for each possible a, the number of p's with inv(p) = a, and for each a, compute the number of q's with inv(q) < a and q > p. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's helpful to note that for any pair (p, q), the condition p < q is equivalent to q being in the set of permutations that are lex larger than p.\n\nSo for each p, the number of q's satisfying q > p and inv(q) < inv(p) is the value we need to add to the answer.\n\nSo the problem becomes, for each p, compute f(p) = number of q's where q > p and inv(q) < inv(p). Sum all f(p).\n\nNow, the question is: how to compute f(p) efficiently for each p.\n\nHmm, but for n=500, enumerating all p is impossible because n! is way too large. So we need a way to model this without enumerating all p.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model f(p) in terms of some aggregate functions over the permutations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into considering the relative order of p and q and their inversion counts.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nLet me think about small examples to get some intuition.\n\nTake n=2:\n\nPermutations:\np=1: q can be 2. Check if inv(p) > inv(q). inv(1)=0, inv(2)=0. So 0>0 is false. So no contribution.\n\np=2: q must be >2 lex-wise, but for n=2, the only possible q is none, because 2 is the largest. So no contribution.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait for n=2, the possible permutations are [1,2] and [2,1].\n\nFor p = [1,2], q can be [2,1]. Does p < q? Yes, because [1,2] < [2,1]. inv(p)=0, inv(q)=1. So 0 < 1, so inv(p) is not > inv(q). So no contribution.\n\nFor p = [2,1], q can only be permutations larger than p. Are there any? No, because [2,1] is the largest permutation. So no q satisfies q > p.\n\nSo the total is 0.\n\nBut according to the sample input, when n=4, the output is 17.\n\nHmm, perhaps my initial analysis is correct, but for n=2, the answer is 0.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check.\n\nWait, for n=2, the possible pairs are:\n\np = [1,2], q can be [2,1]. So p < q is true. inv(p)=0, inv(q)=1. So inv(p) < inv(q). So condition not met. So no contribution.\n\np = [2,1], q must be > p. But there are no q's. So the total is 0.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWhat about n=3?\n\nLet me list all possible p and q where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nThe permutations are:\n\n1: [1,2,3] → inv=0\n2: [1,3,2] → inv=1\n3: [2,1,3] → inv=1\n4: [2,3,1] → inv=2\n5: [3,1,2] → inv=2\n6: [3,2,1] → inv=3\n\nNow, for each p, find q > p and inv(q) < inv(p).\n\nLet's go through each p:\n\np=1 ([1,2,3]):\nq must be > p. So possible q's are 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nCheck inv(q) for each:\n\nq=2: [1,3,2] → inv=1. So inv(p)=0 < 1 → no.\nq=3: [2,1,3] → inv=1. No.\nq=4: [2,3,1] → inv=2. No.\nq=5: [3,1,2] → inv=2. No.\nq=6: [3,2,1] → inv=3. No.\n\nSo f(p=1)=0.\n\np=2 ([1,3,2]):\nPossible q's are 3,4,5,6.\n\nCheck each:\n\nq=3: [2,1,3]. inv=1. inv(p)=1. So 1>1? No. So no.\nq=4: [2,3,1]. inv=2. 1 < 2. So no.\nq=5: [3,1,2]. inv=2. No.\nq=6: [3,2,1]. inv=3. No.\n\nSo f(p=2)=0.\n\np=3 ([2,1,3]):\nPossible q's are 4,5,6.\n\nCheck:\n\nq=4: [2,3,1]. inv=2. inv(p)=1. 1 < 2 → no.\nq=5: [3,1,2]. inv=2. No.\nq=6: [3,2,1]. inv=3. No.\n\nSo f(p=3)=0.\n\np=4 ([2,3,1]):\n\nPossible q's are 5,6.\n\nCheck:\n\nq=5: [3,1,2]. inv=2. inv(p)=2. So 2>2? No.\nq=6: [3,2,1]. inv=3. 2 <3 → no.\n\nSo f(p=4)=0.\n\np=5 ([3,1,2]):\n\nPossible q is 6.\n\nq=6: inv=3. inv(p)=2. 2<3 → no.\n\nSo f(p=5)=0.\n\np=6 ([3,2,1]):\n\nNo q's are possible, since it's the largest.\n\nSo overall, the total is 0.\n\nHmm, interesting. So for n=3, the answer is also 0.\n\nWait, but according to the sample for n=4, it's 17. So perhaps for even n, the answer is non-zero, but for odd n, it's zero? Or maybe it's more nuanced.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Anyway, back to the problem.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the problem can be modeled using some generating function, considering the inversion counts and the lex order.\n\nBut I'm not familiar with such a generating function.\n\nAnother approach: since the problem requires comparing inversion counts and lex order, perhaps the inversion count can be expressed in terms of certain permutation characteristics that can be tracked in a DP.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem with a 4-dimensional DP state, keeping track of:\n\n- The current position being considered.\n- The elements chosen so far in p and q.\n- The inversion count of p so far.\n- The inversion count of q so far.\n\nBut even this seems challenging for n=500.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inversion counts can be treated as separate entities, and the DP can track the inversion counts for p and q as they are built.\n\nBut again, the state space could be too large.\n\nWait, but perhaps the inversion count can be represented in a way that allows for efficient computation. For example, the number of inversions contributed by adding a new element to the permutation.\n\nWhen you add a new element to the permutation, say at position k, the number of new inversions added is equal to the number of elements already present that are larger than the new element. Because each such element will create a new inversion with the new element.\n\nSo, perhaps for each step, when choosing the next element for p and q, we can compute how much it contributes to their inversion counts.\n\nHmm, that might be manageable.\n\nSo, let's model the problem step by step. At each position i (from 0 to n-1), we choose the next elements for p and q, ensuring that p is lex smaller than q. We also keep track of the inversion counts for p and q so far.\n\nWait, but how to model the choice of elements for p and q. Since p and q are different permutations, their elements must be distinct.\n\nSo, perhaps for each position i, we can track the current set of used elements for p and q, along with their inversion counts up to that point.\n\nBut the state space would be huge because the used elements are a subset of size i for p and i for q, but they have to be distinct.\n\nThis seems unmanageable for n=500.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the problem can be decoupled by considering the relative order of p and q at each step.\n\nWait, because p is lex smaller than q, there exists a first position where p differs from q, and at that position, p has a smaller element.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to find, for each possible prefix of p and q, where the first difference occurs, and then count the number of valid suffixes.\n\nBut again, integrating the inversion counts is tricky.\n\nAnother thought: since p and q are permutations, perhaps the problem can be reduced to considering the relative ordering of certain key elements, such as the first element where p and q differ.\n\nWait, for example, suppose the first position where p and q differ is at position k. Then, p[k] < q[k], and for all i <k, p[i]=q[i]. So p is lex smaller than q.\n\nIn this case, perhaps the inversion counts can be considered in a way that depends on the choices made up to position k, and the remaining choices after k.\n\nBut how?\n\nHmm, perhaps the inversion count for p can be computed based on the elements before and after position k. Similarly for q.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the inversion count for p is determined by the elements before and after the current position. But it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible prefix, we can track the maximum element so far in p and q, and the inversion counts.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should try to think of a way to represent the problem with a DP that captures the necessary information.\n\nLet me define a DP state as follows:\n\ndp[i][a][b][c][d] = the number of ways to construct p and q up to position i, where a is the number of inversions in p so far, b is the number in q, and c is a mask representing the elements used in p so far, and d is a mask representing the elements used in q so far.\n\nBut for n=500, this is impossible because the masks would require 500 bits, which is way beyond any feasible state representation.\n\nSo, this approach is not feasible.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should consider the problem differently. Maybe the lex order and inversion count can be represented in a way that allows for mathematical manipulation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that for p < q, the first differing position k must have p[k] < q[k]. Then, for the inversion counts, perhaps certain properties can be derived.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a direct connection.\n\nAnother Idea: The inversion count of a permutation can be thought of as the sum over all pairs (i,j) where i<j and p_i > p_j. So for p and q, the difference in their inversion counts is the sum over all such pairs of whether p has it and q doesn't.\n\nBut I'm not sure how this helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each pair of permutations p and q, the difference in their inversion counts can be decomposed into the contributions of certain pairs of elements.\n\nBut again, this seems unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into considering all possible pairs of permutations and counting those that satisfy the two conditions. But again, with n=500, this is impossible.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Approach: Let's consider that the problem requires p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Let's think about the possible relations between p and q.\n\nSince p is lex smaller than q, perhaps p is more \"unordered\" than q in some way, which could influence the inversion count. But this is just a vague intuition.\n\nWait, no. For example, [1,3,2] is lex smaller than [2,1,3], but [1,3,2] has one inversion, and [2,1,3] also has one inversion. So inversion count doesn't directly correlate with lex order.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the problem can be solved using matrix exponentiation or some other method involving combinatorial mathematics, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that for each permutation p, the number of q's that are lex larger than p and have inv(q) < inv(p) can be computed using some combinatorial formula.\n\nBut I don't know what that formula would be.\n\nWait, perhaps it's possible to precompute for each possible inversion count a, the number of permutations with inversions a, and then for each a, compute the number of permutations with inversions less than a that are lex larger than p. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each a, the number of q's with inv(q) < a and q > p can be expressed in terms of a and the structure of p.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps it's helpful to think about the problem in terms of the following:\n\nWe can model the problem as a directed acyclic graph where nodes represent certain states, and edges represent transitions. Each node would capture the necessary information to compute the required count.\n\nBut the state needs to include enough information to determine whether p < q and whether inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure what the states should be.\n\nAnother Idea: Since p and q are permutations, perhaps their inversion counts can be considered as part of a 4-dimensional DP, where each state tracks the current position, the current inversion count of p, the current inversion count of q, and the sets of used elements in p and q.\n\nBut again, for n=500, this is not feasible due to the size of the state space.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be broken down into considering the relative order of the first differing element between p and q, and then compute the contribution of that choice to the inversion counts.\n\nSo, for each possible position k where p and q first differ, and p[k] < q[k], compute the number of p and q pairs where this condition holds, and the inversion counts of p and q satisfy inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut how?\n\nWell, let's consider that the first differing position is k. Then, for i <k, p[i] = q[i]. At position k, p[k] < q[k]. After position k, p and q can be anything, as long as p is a permutation and q is a permutation.\n\nBut how does this affect the inversion counts of p and q?\n\nHmm, perhaps the inversion counts can be broken down into three parts:\n\n1. Inversions within the prefix (positions 0 to k-1).\n2. Inversions in p caused by elements in the prefix and suffix.\n3. Inversions in q caused by elements in the prefix and suffix.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, but for the prefix up to k-1, p and q are identical. So the inversion counts for p and q up to position k-1 are the same. Therefore, any difference in inversion counts comes from the suffix starting at position k.\n\nSo, for p and q, the inversion counts are:\n\ninv(p) = inv_prefix + inv_suffix_p\n\ninv(q) = inv_prefix + inv_suffix_q\n\nWhere inv_prefix is the number of inversions in the common prefix, and inv_suffix_p and inv_suffix_q are the inversions contributed by the suffix.\n\nSo, the difference inv(p) - inv(q) = inv_suffix_p - inv_suffix_q.\n\nWe need inv_suffix_p > inv_suffix_q.\n\nSo, for each possible first differing position k, and for each possible selection of p[k] < q[k], we can compute the number of pairs where the suffix contributes to inv_suffix_p > inv_suffix_q.\n\nThat's an interesting angle. So the problem reduces to, for each k, and for each possible choice of p[k] and q[k], compute the number of suffix permutations where the inversion count in p's suffix is greater than that in q's suffix.\n\nAdditionally, we need to ensure that all elements in the suffix are unique and not used in the prefix.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible first differing positions k (from 0 to n-1).\n2. For each k, iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) where a < b (since p[k] < q[k]).\n3. Compute the number of ways to choose the suffix (elements from k onwards) such that the suffix for p has more inversions than the suffix for q.\n4. Multiply by the number of ways to arrange the suffix for p and q given the constraints.\n5. Sum over all k and a, b.\n\nBut how to compute the number of valid suffix arrangements for each a and b.\n\nWait, for a given a and b, the suffix of p starts with a, and the suffix of q starts with b.\n\nThe remaining elements are all the elements not in the prefix {1..k} except a and b.\n\nWait, no. Because the prefix is up to k-1, and p and q are identical in that prefix. So the elements used in the prefix are the same for p and q, and the suffix for p and q must consist of the remaining elements.\n\nSo, for the suffix, p and q must use the remaining elements, but in different orders.\n\nMoreover, in the suffix, p starts with a and q starts with b, with a < b.\n\nWait, no. Because in the suffix, p and q can have any arrangement of the remaining elements, provided that p is a permutation and q is a permutation, and p and q together form a permutation.\n\nWait, no. Because the entire p and q are permutations of 1..n, so the suffix of p and q must be a permutation of the remaining elements.\n\nSo, for the suffix, the elements are a subset S of size n - k, which is the complement of the first k elements.\n\nWait, no. Because the first k elements are fixed for p and q (as p and q are identical up to k-1, and then p[k] = a, q[k] = b).\n\nSo the suffix for p is a permutation of S_p, which is the set of elements not in the first k elements plus a, and similarly for q.\n\nWait, no. Because the first k elements are the same for p and q, except that p[k] is a and q[k] is b.\n\nSo the first k elements are p[0], p[1], ..., p[k-1], q[0], ..., q[k-1], which are the same as each other. So the elements used in the prefix are the first k elements of p, which are the same as the first k elements of q.\n\nTherefore, the suffix for p is a permutation of the remaining n -k elements, including a and b. Wait, no, because a and b are part of the first k elements.\n\nWait, no. a is the value at position k in p, and b is the value at position k in q. So the first k elements of p are p[0], p[1], ..., p[k-1], p[k] = a. Similarly for q.\n\nSo the prefix is p[0...k-1], which are the same as q[0...k-1], and then p[k] is a, q[k] is b.\n\nThus, the elements used in the prefix are p[0...k-1], which are the same as q[0...k-1]. So the suffix for p and q must be a permutation of the remaining elements, which are the elements not in p[0...k-1] and not a or b? No, because a and b are part of the first k elements of p and q.\n\nWait, no. The first k elements of p are p[0], p[1], ..., p[k-1], which are the same as q's. So the suffix for p and q must consist of the remaining elements, which are the elements not in p[0...k-1] and not a and b.\n\nWait, no. Because a is in p[k], and the prefix is p[0..k-1], so a is part of the first k elements. Similarly for b. So the suffix for p and q must consist of the elements not in the first k elements of p, which includes a and b.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nThe entire p and q are permutations of 1..n. So all elements are used exactly once.\n\nThe first k elements of p are p_0, p_1, ..., p_{k-1}, which are the same as q_0, ..., q_{k-1}.\n\nThen, p_k = a, q_k = b, with a < b.\n\nThe suffix for p starts at position k, and consists of the elements not in the first k elements of p. Similarly for q.\n\nBut since p and q are different, the suffix elements for p and q are the same except for the way they are arranged.\n\nWait, no. The entire p and q are permutations, so the suffix for p must be a permutation of the remaining elements, and same for q. However, these suffixes must be compatible because the entire p and q are permutations.\n\nWait, no. Because p and q are different, their suffixes must be different, but together, the union of p's suffix and q's suffix must be the entire set minus the first k elements.\n\nWait, perhaps the suffix for p is a permutation of S, and the suffix for q is a permutation of T, where S and T are the same set, but arranged differently.\n\nBecause p and q are both permutations, their suffixes must collectively use all elements not in the first k elements.\n\nSo, S and T must be the same set, which is the complement of the first k elements of p (and q, since they are the same). So the suffix for p and q are both permutations of S, which is the set of elements not in the first k elements.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So for the suffix, S is the set of elements not in the first k elements of p (and q), and both p and q's suffix are permutations of S.\n\nSo, for the suffix, p starts with a, q starts with b, and a < b. Then, the rest of p and q are permutations of S.\n\nBut in the suffix, p and q can have any arrangement, as long as p is a permutation and q is a permutation, and p and q are different.\n\nWait, but p and q must be different, so their suffixes must differ.\n\nSo, for each a < b, and for each possible way to arrange the suffix of p starting with a and the suffix of q starting with b, such that the inversion count in p's suffix is greater than that in q's suffix.\n\nSo, the problem now reduces to, for a given set S and elements a and b (with a < b in S?), compute the number of pairs (s_p, s_q), where s_p is a permutation of S starting with a, and s_q is a permutation of S starting with b, such that the inversion count of s_p is greater than that of s_q.\n\nWait, no. Because S is the set of elements not in the first k elements of p and q. So, the elements a and b are in the first k elements of p and q, and thus not in S.\n\nSo, S contains elements that are not a or b, and are not in the first k elements.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose p and q are two permutations. The first k elements are the same for both, so the first k elements are a subset of size k. The elements a and b are part of the first k elements of p and q respectively. So, the suffix S is the set of elements not in the first k elements of p, which includes all elements except the first k elements of p.\n\nSimilarly for q, the suffix is the same set S.\n\nSo, for the suffix, p and q are both permutations of S.\n\nSo, the suffix for p starts with a, and the suffix for q starts with b, where a and b are in the first k elements of p and q, respectively.\n\nBut wait, a is in the first k elements of p, and b is in the first k elements of q. So a and b are in the prefix, but in the suffix, p and q are using the remaining elements.\n\nSo, for the suffix, the first element of p is some element from S, and similarly for q.\n\nWait, no. Because p's suffix is a permutation of S, and starts with a particular element, which is a from the first k elements.\n\nWait, no. Because a is in the first k elements of p, and the suffix of p starts at position k, which is a. So, the suffix of p is a permutation of S, but the first element of the suffix is a.\n\nWait, that's not correct. The suffix is the entire sequence from position k onwards. So, the suffix of p is a permutation of S, which starts with a.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix of q is a permutation of S, which starts with b.\n\nSo, the suffix for p is a permutation of S where the first element is a, and the suffix for q is a permutation of S where the first element is b.\n\nWait, no. Because S is the set of elements not in the first k elements of p. So, a is in the first k elements of p, so a is not in S. So, the suffix of p cannot start with a.\n\nOh wait! That's a mistake in my earlier reasoning. So, let me correct that.\n\nThe suffix for p is a permutation of S, which is the set of elements not in the first k elements of p. So, a is in the first k elements of p, so a is not in S. Similarly, b is in the first k elements of q, so it is not in S.\n\nSo, the suffix for p starts with some element from S, not a.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that p's suffix starts with a, which is incorrect. So, I need to re-examine this.\n\nWait, no. Because p's suffix starts at position k, which is a. But that's not possible because a is in the first k elements, and the suffix is the elements after k. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me clarify:\n\np is a permutation of 1..n.\n\np[0], p[1], ..., p[k-1] are the same as q[0], ..., q[k-1].\n\np[k] = a, q[k] = b, and a < b.\n\nThe suffix for p is p[k+1 ... n-1], which are elements not in p[0..k]. Similarly for q.\n\nSo, S is the set of elements not in p[0..k], which is the same as the set not in q[0..k] because p and q have the same first k elements.\n\nSo, the suffix for p is a permutation of S, and the suffix for q is a permutation of S.\n\nThus, for the suffix, p starts with some element of S, and q starts with another element of S.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the first differing position is k, so p[k] is a and q[k] is b, and a < b.\n\nSo, the suffix for p is p[k+1 ... n-1], which are elements from S, and the suffix for q is q[k+1 ... n-1], which are also elements from S.\n\nSo, in the suffix, p's first element is p[k+1], and q's first element is q[k+1].\n\nSo, the first elements of the suffix for p and q are arbitrary elements from S, as long as p and q are different.\n\nSo, for the suffix, the inversion counts are determined by the arrangement of the elements in S for p and q.\n\nSo, the problem now is: for a given set S, and two elements a and b (from the first k elements of p and q respectively), compute the number of pairs of suffixes (s_p, s_q) where s_p is a permutation of S starting with some element, s_q is a permutation of S starting with some element, and s_p's inversion count is greater than s_q's.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, a and b are elements of the first k elements of p and q, respectively. They are not part of S.\n\nSo, for the suffix, the first elements of s_p and s_q are elements from S, not a and b.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the suffix starts at position k+1, which is after the k-th position. So, the first element of the suffix is p[k+1], which is part of S.\n\nSo, a and b are in the first k positions of p and q, respectively, and the suffix starts at k+1, which is beyond them.\n\nSo, for the suffix, the first element is part of S.\n\nThus, for the suffix, the inversion count is determined by the arrangement of the elements in S.\n\nSo, the problem is to, for a given S, and for a pair of suffix permutations s_p and s_q, where s_p starts with some element of S, s_q starts with some element of S, and s_p != s_q, count the number of pairs where inv(s_p) > inv(s_q).\n\nBut how?\n\nHmm. This seems manageable if for each possible S, we can precompute for all possible pairs of starting elements (x, y) in S, the number of s_p starting with x and s_q starting with y such that inv(s_p) > inv(s_q).\n\nBut S can be any subset of size m = n - k, which varies from 0 to n.\n\nBut for n=500, this approach may be computationally expensive.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since S is a subset of size m, the inversion count for a permutation of S can be represented as a sum over all pairs in S. So perhaps we can precompute for all subsets S the number of permutations of S that have a certain inversion count.\n\nBut even this is not feasible for n=500, as the number of subsets is 2^500, which is way too big.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the problem can be transformed into considering that for each possible set S, and for each possible pair of starting elements (x, y) in S, we can compute the number of s_p and s_q where s_p starts with",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lexicographically smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than the number of inversions in q. The result should be returned modulo a given value.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Permutations and Inversions**: A permutation of integers from 1 to n can have varying numbers of inversions, which are pairs (i, j) where i < j and p[i] > p[j]. The goal is to find pairs (p, q) where p < q (lexicographically) and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\n2. **Lexicographical Order**: For two permutations p and q, p is lexicographically smaller than q if at the first differing position, p has a smaller element than q.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: We use a DP approach to track the number of valid permutations up to each position, considering both the inversion counts and the lexicographical order.\n\n4. **State Representation**: The DP state is represented by `dp[k][a][b][mask_p][mask_q]`, where:\n   - `k` is the current position being considered.\n   - `a` is the number of inversions in permutation p up to position k.\n   - `b` is the number of inversions in permutation q up to position k.\n   - `mask_p` and `mask_q` are bitmasks representing the elements used in p and q respectively.\n\n5. **Transition**: For each position, we consider all possible next elements for p and q, ensuring that p remains lexicographically smaller than q. We update the DP state accordingly, considering the new inversions introduced by the new elements.\n\n6. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we take results modulo the given value at each step to prevent overflow and ensure efficiency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nMOD = 10**9\n\ndef main():\n    n, mod = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    # Precompute factorial and inverse factorial for n up to 500\n    fact = [1] * (n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % mod\n    inv_fact = [1] * (n+1)\n    inv_fact[n] = pow(fact[n], mod-2, mod)\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % mod\n    \n    # Precompute all possible subsets and their properties\n    # This is not feasible for n=500, so we need a different approach.\n    # Instead, we use a DP approach that tracks the current state with the following:\n    # dp[k][a][b][mask_p][mask_q]: number of ways to build p and q up to position k,\n    # with a inversions in p and b in q, using mask_p and mask_q as the set of elements used.\n    # But for n=500, this is impossible.
