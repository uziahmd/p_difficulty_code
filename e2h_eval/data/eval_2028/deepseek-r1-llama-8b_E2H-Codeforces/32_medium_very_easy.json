    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Array Stabilization. Hmm.\n\nThe task says that given an array of integers, I need to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. So, for each possible removal of an element, I calculate the new max and min, subtract them, and then find the smallest such value among all possibilities.\n\nWait, but calculating this naively for each element would be O(n^2), which won't work for n up to 1e5. That's way too big. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about what happens when we remove an element. The max and min of the remaining array could either stay the same or change depending on whether the removed element was the current max, min, or something else.\n\nSo, the plan is: find all possible candidates for the new max and min after each possible removal, and compute the minimal instability.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nHmm, maybe the key is to precompute the global max and min, and then consider the cases where removing an element affects either the max or the min.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The minimal instability can't be less than the global max minus the global min, right? Because even if you remove some elements, the remaining array must have a max at least the global min and a min at most the global max. So the minimal possible instability is zero only if all elements are equal, but in general, it depends on which elements are removed.\n\nWait no, not necessarily. For example, if the array is [1, 3, 3, 7], the global max is 7, min is 1. But if you remove 7, the new max is 3, min is 1. So the instability is 2.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the minimal instability comes from either removing a max element or a min element.\n\nSo here's an idea: find the second maximum and the second minimum. Because when you remove the first maximum, the next maximum becomes the second maximum. Similarly, when you remove the first minimum, the next minimum becomes the second minimum.\n\nSo, the minimal instability could be either:\n\n- (max - second_max) → when we remove the original max\n- (second_min - min) → when we remove the original min\n- Or, possibly, even lower if there are other elements that when removed, the new max and min are closer.\n\nBut wait, that's not entirely accurate. For instance, suppose the array has multiple max elements. Then removing one of them doesn't change the max. Similarly for the min.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Find the global max (current_max) and its count.\n   - If the count is more than one, then removing one doesn't change the max.\n2. Similarly for the global min.\n\nSo, if the current_max occurs multiple times, then removing one of them will leave the max as current_max. Similarly for the min.\n\nTherefore, the approach is:\n\nCompute the global max and min, and also the second_max and second_min.\n\nThen, the possible candidates for the new instability are:\n\n- When we remove the current_max:\n   - If there were multiple current_max elements, then the new max is still current_max. So the new instability is current_max - new_min, where new_min is the min of the array excluding current_max.\n   - Wait, no. Because when you remove the current_max, the new min could remain the same or change? No, the min remains the same unless all elements except one are being considered. Wait, no, the min is the smallest element, so unless all other elements are larger than some element, which isn't the case.\n\nWait, no. The min of the entire array is the smallest element. So, when you remove the max, the min remains the same as the global min. So the new instability is current_max - min, but if you remove the max, but another element could have a higher min. Wait, no. The min is the smallest element, so if you remove a max, the min can't increase because you're just removing a larger element.\n\nWait, no. The min is the minimum of all elements. So, if you remove an element, say, which is the max, the min of the remaining elements is still the global min. Because the global min is present in the array (unless all elements are the same, but that's a corner case).\n\nWait, no. Suppose the array is [1, 100]. Removing 100 gives [1], so min is 1. Removing 1 gives [100], min is 100. So yes, when you remove the max (100), the min remains 1. So the new instability is 0, because 100 -1 is 99, but wait no, in that case, when you remove 100, the array becomes [1], so the instability is 0.\n\nWait, the problem's note says that in the second example, when you remove 1 or 100000, the instability is 0.\n\nSo, back to the approach.\n\nSo, to compute the possible instability after removing any element, perhaps the minimal instability is the minimum among:\n\n- (max without current_max) - min_without_current_max\n- (max_without_current_min) - min_without_current_min\n- (current_max - current_min)\n- (second_max - second_min)\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating things.\n\nAnother approach: the minimal instability can be achieved by either:\n\na) Removing the current_max, which could potentially lower the max, thus reducing the instability.\n\nb) Removing the current_min, which could potentially raise the min, thus reducing the instability.\n\nc) Or, perhaps removing an element that is neither max nor min, but when removed, both the new max and min are closer together.\n\nWait, but considering that, perhaps the minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\n- (current_max - current_min)\n- (current_max - second_min)\n- (second_max - current_min)\n- (second_max - second_min)\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal instability is the minimum of:\n\n- The instability when we remove the current_max.\n- The instability when we remove the current_min.\n- The instability when we remove the second_max.\n- The instability when we remove the second_min.\n\nBut this might not capture all possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal instability can be found by considering all possible elements that could be removed and computing the new max and min, but doing this in O(1) time per candidate.\n\nSo, let's think about precomputing the following:\n\n- The global maximum and the count of how many times it occurs.\n- The global minimum and the count of how many times it occurs.\n- The second maximum (the maximum in the array excluding the global maximum).\n- The second minimum (the minimum in the array excluding the global minimum).\n\nThen, when we remove the global maximum:\n\nIf the count of global_max is 1, then the new maximum is the second_max. The new minimum is the global_min.\n\nSo the instability is second_max - global_min.\n\nIf the count is more than 1, then the new maximum remains global_max. So the new instability is global_max - new_min, where new_min is the min of the array excluding one occurrence of global_max.\n\nWait, but the new_min is the global_min because all other elements are <= global_max, but some could be less than others. Wait, no, because the global_min is the smallest element in the array. So when you remove an element (which is global_max), the min can't increase because the global_min is still present.\n\nWait, wait, no. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the global_max is 5. If I remove 5, the new array is [1,2,3,4], so the min is 1. So the instability is 4-1=3. Which is less than the original 5-1=4.\n\nSo, when I remove the global_max, the new instability is (second_max) - (global_min). Because the new maximum is the second_max, and the min remains the global_min.\n\nSimilarly, when I remove the global_min, the new instability is (global_max) - (second_min). Because the new min is the second_min, and the max remains global_max.\n\nWait, but what if the array has multiple instances of the global_max? Like [3,3,5,7,7]. The global_max is 7, which occurs twice. If I remove one 7, the new max is still 7. So the new instability is 7 - the new min.\n\nBut what's the new min? It's still the global_min, which is 3.\n\nSo, in that case, removing a global_max (count >1) leaves the max as global_max and the min as global_min. So the instability is same as before, which is 7-3=4.\n\nBut wait, perhaps if I remove a 3 (the min), then the new min is the next min, which is 3 again (since there are two 3s). So the instability remains 7-3=4.\n\nSo, in this case, the instability after removing any element except the ones that are not min or max won't change.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the minimal instability can be found by considering the cases where we remove the global_max (if it's unique) or the global_min (if it's unique), and also considering the cases where the new max is the second_max or the new min is the second_min.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the global_max and its count (global_max_count).\n\n2. Compute the global_min and its count (global_min_count).\n\n3. Compute the second_max: the maximum of the array excluding the global_max. This is done by creating a list of elements that are less than global_max, and then taking the max of that list. If all elements are equal to global_max, then second_max = global_max.\n\n4. Compute the second_min: the minimum of the array excluding the global_min. Similar logic.\n\nOnce these are computed, the possible candidates for the minimal instability are:\n\na) If global_max_count ==1: then after removing it, the new max is second_max, min is global_min. So instability is second_max - global_min.\n\nb) If global_min_count ==1: after removing it, new min is second_min, max is global_max. So instability is global_max - second_min.\n\nc) The minimal instability when we remove an element that is neither the global_max nor the global_min. In this case, the new max could be either the same as the global_max (if there are multiple), and the new min could be same as the global_min (if there are multiple). So the instability remains the same as the original.\n\nd) Also, perhaps removing a second_max or second_min could lead to a better result.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute all possible candidates:\n\n- The original instability: global_max - global_min.\n\n- The instability when removing the global_max (if possible): which could be (second_max - global_min) if global_max was unique.\n\n- The instability when removing the global_min (if possible): which could be (global_max - second_min) if global_min was unique.\n\n- The instability when removing the second_max: which would be (max_after_second_max) - (global_min). But what's max_after_second_max? It could be the same as the original max if there are multiple second_max elements.\n\nWait, but this seems complicated. Maybe the correct approach is to compute four possible values:\n\n1. The original instability: global_max - global_min.\n\n2. The instability when we remove the global_max (only if it's unique): (second_max - global_min).\n\n3. The instability when we remove the global_min (only if it's unique): (global_max - second_min).\n\n4. The instability when we remove the second_max (but this is probably already covered in case 2).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct set of candidates is:\n\n- The original instability.\n\n- The instability when removing the global_max (if it's unique).\n\n- The instability when removing the global_min (if it's unique).\n\nBecause, if you remove an element that's neither the global_max nor the global_min, the new max could be the same as the global_max (if there are multiple) and the new min could be same as global_min (if there are multiple), leading to the same instability as the original. So, the minimal instability can't be lower than the original, except in the cases where removing the global_max or global_min reduces it.\n\nWait, but in some cases, removing a different element might give a better result. For example, suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 100]. The global_max is 100, global_min is 1. Original instability is 99.\n\nIf we remove 100, the new max is 4, min is 1. Instability is 3.\n\nBut if instead, we remove 4, the new max is 100, min is 1. Instability is 99.\n\nSo, in this case, removing the global_max gives a better result.\n\nAnother example: [1, 3, 3, 7]. Global_max is 7, count 1. Global_min is 1, count 1. So, when you remove 7, the new max is 3, min is 1. Instability is 2.\n\nWhen you remove 1, new max is 7, min is 3. Instability is 4.\n\nSo, the minimal is 2.\n\nWhich is covered by considering the case of removing the global_max.\n\nSo, the idea is that the minimal instability is the minimum between the original, and the cases where we remove the global_max (if it's unique) or global_min (if it's unique).\n\nWait, but what about when both global_max and global_min are unique? Then, the minimal instability could be the minimum of the three options: original, remove global_max, remove global_min.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when the array has multiple global_max or global_min?\n\nFor example, array is [2,2,3,4,4]. The global_max is 4, count 2. Global_min is 2, count 2.\n\nOriginal instability is 4-2=2.\n\nIf I remove one 4, the new max is still 4. Min is 2. So instability remains 2.\n\nIf I remove one 2, the new min is 2 (another exists). Max is 4. So instability remains 2.\n\nSo, the minimal instability is 2.\n\nSo, in this case, all possibilities give the same result.\n\nSo, the conclusion is:\n\nThe minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\n- The original instability.\n\n- If global_max is unique: second_max - global_min.\n\n- If global_min is unique: global_max - second_min.\n\nAdditionally, since sometimes the minimal instability could be achieved by removing another element, but that scenario is already covered by the above.\n\nWait, but what if the array is [1, 2, 4, 5]. The global_max is 5, global_min is 1.\n\nIf I remove 5, the new max is 4, min is 1. Instability is 3.\n\nIf I remove 1, new min is 2, max is5. Instability is 3.\n\nBut the original instability is 4.\n\nSo the minimal is 3.\n\nWhich is covered by considering the cases of removing the unique global_max and the unique global_min.\n\nSo, now, the algorithm becomes:\n\nCompute:\n\noriginal = global_max - global_min.\n\ncase1 = if global_max_count ==1: second_max - global_min.\n\ncase2 = if global_min_count ==1: global_max - second_min.\n\nthen the minimal instability is the minimum of original, case1, case2.\n\nWait, but what about when the array is [5,5,5,5]. All elements are same.\n\nThen, removing any element gives the same array, so the instability is 0.\n\nIn this case, original is 0. case1 and case2 are irrelevant because all counts are more than 1.\n\nSo the minimal is 0.\n\nAnother test case: input is ['2\\n1 100000'].\n\nGlobal_max is 100000, count 1.\n\nGlobal_min is 1, count 1.\n\ncase1: second_max is 1, so 1 -1 =0.\n\ncase2: second_min is 100000, so 100000 - 100000 =0.\n\nso the minimal is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Find the global_max and its count.\n\n- Find the global_min and its count.\n\n- Compute second_max: the maximum of all elements except the global_max, but if all elements are global_max, second_max is same as global_max.\n\nWait, no. For example, if all elements are 5, then removing one 5, the second_max is 5.\n\nSo, to compute second_max:\n\nWe can create a list of elements that are less than global_max, and take their max. If the list is empty, then second_max is global_max.\n\nSimilarly for second_min.\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient. Because, suppose the array has multiple elements equal to global_max, but when you remove one, the next max is the same as global_max.\n\nSo, perhaps, the second_max is the same as the global_max if the count is more than one.\n\nSo, the way to compute second_max is:\n\nIf the count of global_max is >=2, then second_max is global_max.\n\nElse, second_max is the maximum of the array after removing all global_max elements.\n\nSimilarly for second_min.\n\nWait, no. Because, in the case where the array is [5,5,6], the global_max is 6, count 1. So second_max is 5.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nTo compute second_max:\n\nCreate a list 'others' which contains all elements except the global_max.\n\nIf others is not empty, then second_max is max(others).\n\nElse, second_max is global_max.\n\nSimilarly for second_min.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nothers_max = [x for x in a if x != current_max]\nif others_max:\n    second_max = max(others_max)\nelse:\n    second_max = current_max\n\nSame for second_min.\n\nSo, with these values, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the array a.\n\nCompute current_max and its count.\n\nCompute current_min and its count.\n\nCompute second_max and second_min.\n\nCompute case1: if current_max_count ==1, then case1 is second_max - current_min.\n\nElse, case1 is infinity or a large number.\n\nCompute case2: if current_min_count ==1, then case2 is current_max - second_min.\n\nElse, case2 is infinity.\n\nCompute the original as current_max - current_min.\n\nThen, the minimal instability is the minimum of original, case1, case2.\n\nWait, but what if the array is such that removing a non-max or non-min element gives a better result? For example, in [3,5,5,7], the current_max is 7, current_min is3. Original instability is4.\n\nIf I remove 5, the new array is [3,5,7], max is7, min3. So same as original.\n\nSo, no improvement.\n\nAnother example: [1, 10, 10, 20].\n\nOriginal instability is 19.\n\nRemoving 1: new instability is 20-10=10.\n\nRemoving 10: new instability is 20-10=10.\n\nRemoving 20: new instability is 10-1=9.\n\nSo the minimal is 9.\n\nWhich is handled by case1: since current_max is 20, count 1.\n\ncase1 is second_max (10) - current_min (1) = 9.\n\nSo it's covered.\n\nAnother test case: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5].\n\ncurrent_max is5, count 2.\n\ncurrent_min is1, count 1.\n\noriginal instability is4.\n\ncase1: since current_max_count>1, case1 is infinity.\n\ncase2: current_min_count is1. So case2 is 5 - second_min.\n\nWhat is second_min?\n\nothers_min is [2,3,4,5], so second_min is2.\n\nSo case2 is 5-2=3.\n\nSo the minimal is min(4, 3) →3.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nYes. Because if you remove the 1, the new array is [2,3,4,5,5], max is5, min is2. So instability is3.\n\nSo, the code correctly captures this.\n\nSo, the code needs to compute all these.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the list a.\n\nCompute current_max = max(a).\n\ncurrent_min = min(a).\n\ncount_max = a.count(current_max).\n\ncount_min = a.count(current_min).\n\nCompute others_max = [x for x in a if x != current_max]\n\nif others_max:\n\n    second_max = max(others_max)\n\nelse:\n\n    second_max = current_max\n\nSimilarly for others_min and second_min.\n\nCompute case1:\n\nif count_max ==1:\n\n    case1 = second_max - current_min\n\nelse:\n\n    case1 = infinity\n\nCompute case2:\n\nif count_min ==1:\n\n    case2 = current_max - second_min\n\nelse:\n\n    case2 = infinity\n\noriginal = current_max - current_min\n\nresult = min(original, case1, case2)\n\nPrint result.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first case is [1,3,3,7], current_max is7, count1.\n\ncurrent_min is1, count1.\n\nothers_max is [1,3,3], so second_max is3.\n\nothers_min is [1,3,3,7] except 1: [3,3,7], but wait, no. Wait, others_min is [x for x in a if x != current_min]. So in the first case, current_min is1, so others_min is [3,3,7].\n\nSo second_min is3.\n\ncase1: second_max (3) - current_min (1) →2.\n\ncase2: current_max (7) - second_min (3) →4.\n\noriginal is 7-1=6.\n\nSo the minimal is min(6,2,4)=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [5,5,5,5].\n\ncurrent_max=5, count4.\n\ncurrent_min=5, count4.\n\nothers_max is empty, so second_max=5.\n\nothers_min is empty, so second_min=5.\n\ncase1 is infinity (count_max>1).\n\ncase2 is infinity (count_min>1).\n\noriginal is0.\n\nSo result is0.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: [1,2,4,5].\n\ncurrent_max=5, count1.\n\ncurrent_min=1, count1.\n\nothers_max: [1,2,4] → second_max=4.\n\nothers_min: [2,4,5] → second_min=2.\n\ncase1:4-1=3.\n\ncase2:5-2=3.\n\noriginal:5-1=4.\n\nSo minimal is3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [1,100000].\n\ncurrent_max=100000, count1.\n\ncurrent_min=1, count1.\n\nothers_max is [1], second_max=1.\n\nothers_min is [100000], second_min=100000.\n\ncase1:1-1=0.\n\ncase2:100000-100000=0.\n\noriginal:99999.\n\nmin is0.\n\nSo correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python.\n\nBut wait, for n=2, when we compute others_max, it's a list of length 1, which is okay.\n\nBut for large n, like 1e5, the list comprehensions may be slow.\n\nWait, but in Python, for n=1e5, a.count is O(n), but for the list comprehensions, they are also O(n).\n\nSo for n=1e5, it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps using a more efficient way.\n\nWait, but in the worst case, for n=1e5, each list comp is O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nSo, code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the array.\n\nCompute current_max, current_min.\n\nCompute count_max = a.count(current_max).\n\nCompute count_min = a.count(current_min).\n\nCompute others_max = [x for x in a if x != current_max]\n\nif others_max:\n\n    second_max = max(others_max)\n\nelse:\n\n    second_max = current_max\n\nSimilarly for others_min.\n\nWait, but others_min is [x for x in a if x != current_min].\n\nSo, code for others_min:\n\nothers_min = [x for x in a if x != current_min]\n\nif others_min:\n\n    second_min = min(others_min)\n\nelse:\n\n    second_min = current_min\n\nWait, no. Because others_min is the list of elements excluding the current_min. So the min of others_min is the second_min.\n\nWait, no. Because if current_min appears once, others_min is the rest of the elements, which are all >= current_min. So the min of others_min is the next smallest element.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nothers_max = [x for x in a if x != current_max]\n\nif others_max:\n\n    second_max = max(others_max)\n\nelse:\n\n    second_max = current_max\n\nothers_min = [x for x in a if x != current_min]\n\nif others_min:\n\n    second_min = min(others_min)\n\nelse:\n\n    second_min = current_min\n\nBut wait, in the case where others_min is empty, which means all elements are current_min. Then, second_min is current_min.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code, that's correct.\n\nThen compute case1 and case2.\n\nCase1: if count_max ==1, then second_max - current_min.\n\nElse, case1 is infinity.\n\nCase2: if count_min ==1, then current_max - second_min.\n\nElse, case2 is infinity.\n\nThen, the minimal is the minimum of original, case1, case2.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_max = max(a)\n\ncurrent_min = min(a)\n\ncount_max = a.count(current_max)\n\ncount_min = a.count(current_min)\n\n# Compute second_max\n\nothers_max = [x for x in a if x != current_max]\n\nif others_max:\n\n    second_max = max(others_max)\n\nelse:\n\n    second_max = current_max\n\n# Compute second_min\n\nothers_min = [x for x in a if x != current_min]\n\nif others_min:\n\n    second_min = min(others_min)\n\nelse:\n\n    second_min = current_min\n\n# Now compute cases\n\ncase1 = float('inf')\n\nif count_max == 1:\n\n    case1 = second_max - current_min\n\ncase2 = float('inf')\n\nif count_min == 1:\n\n    case2 = current_max - second_min\n\noriginal = current_max - current_min\n\nresult = min(original, case1, case2)\n\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but what about the case where removing an element that's neither the max nor the min gives a better result? Like in the earlier example [3,5,5,7], when you remove 5, the new array is [3,5,7], which has the same max and min as the original.\n\nBut according to the code, the case1 and case2 are considered, but the code's result is min(original, case1, case2), which is the same as original.\n\nBut in reality, the instability is same as original, so it's fine.\n\nAnother example: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]. The current_max is10, count1. current_min is1, count1.\n\nothers_max: [1,3,5,7,9] → second_max=9.\n\nothers_min: [3,5,7,9,10] → second_min=3.\n\ncase1:9-1=8.\n\ncase2:10-3=7.\n\noriginal:9.\n\nso the minimal is7.\n\nWhich is correct. If you remove the min, the new min is3, max is10. So instability is7.\n\nWhich is better than original.\n\nSo code correctly captures it.\n\nI think this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7\n\nSample Output: 2.\n\nIn code:\n\ncurrent_max=7, count=1.\n\ncurrent_min=1, count=1.\n\nothers_max = [1,3,3] → second_max=3.\n\nothers_min = [3,3,7] → second_min=3.\n\ncase1:3-1=2.\n\ncase2:7-3=4.\n\noriginal=6.\n\nmin is2.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n1 100000\n\nSample Output:0.\n\nIn code:\n\ncurrent_max=100000, count=1.\n\ncurrent_min=1, count=1.\n\nothers_max=[1] → second_max=1.\n\nothers_min=[100000] → second_min=100000.\n\ncase1:1-1=0.\n\ncase2:100000-100000=0.\n\noriginal=99999.\n\nmin is0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [5,5,5,5], the code returns 0.\n\nAnother test case: [1,2,4,5], code returns3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability of an array is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Key Values**: Compute the global maximum and minimum values of the array, along with their counts.\n2. **Compute Second Max and Min**: Determine the second highest value (second_max) and the second lowest value (second_min) by excluding the global maximum and minimum respectively.\n3. **Evaluate Cases**: Consider three main scenarios:\n   - Removing the global maximum (if it appears only once).\n   - Removing the global minimum (if it appears only once).\n   - The original instability without removing any element.\n4. **Calculate Instability**: For each scenario, compute the instability and select the minimum value among them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_max = max(a)\ncurrent_min = min(a)\n\ncount_max = a.count(current_max)\ncount_min = a.count(current_min)\n\n# Compute second_max\nothers_max = [x for x in a if x != current_max]\nif others_max:\n    second_max = max(others_max)\nelse:\n    second_max = current_max\n\n# Compute second_min\nothers_min = [x for x in a if x != current_min]\nif others_min:\n    second_min = min(others_min)\nelse:\n    second_min = current_min\n\ncase1 = float('inf')\nif count_max == 1:\n    case1 = second_max - current_min\n\ncase2 = float('inf')\nif count_min == 1:\n    case2 = current_max - second_min\n\noriginal = current_max - current_min\nresult = min(original, case1, case2)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Global Max and Min**: We find the highest and lowest values in the array and count how many times they appear.\n3. **Second Max and Min**: By excluding the global max and min, we determine the next highest and lowest values in the array.\n4. **Evaluate Scenarios**: We consider the instability if we remove the global max (if unique), the global min (if unique), and the original array's instability.\n5. **Determine Minimum Instability**: The result is the smallest instability value from the evaluated scenarios.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum possible instability in O(n) time complexity, making it suitable for large arrays up to 100,000 elements.",
