Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Crazy Town,\" and from the description, it seems like it involves lines dividing a plane into regions, and moving between these regions with certain rules.\n\nHmm, the task is to find the minimum number of steps to get from the home block to the university block. Each step is moving from one block to another if they share a common border of non-zero length. So, the key here is understanding how the lines partition the plane and how the regions are connected.\n\nWait, the problem says that two blocks are adjacent if their shared boundary has non-zero length. So, for example, if two regions are separated by a single point (an intersection), that doesn't count as a border. They have to actually share a line segment, I guess.\n\nThe approach here is probably to model each region as a node in a graph, and edges represent whether you can move directly between them. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path in this graph.\n\nBut wait, considering that n can be up to 300, the number of regions could be very large. So building such a graph isn't feasible because the number of regions can be exponential in n. So, we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe each line divides the plane into two parts, and the regions are defined by which side of each line they're on. So perhaps the state can be represented by the signs of the expressions a_i x + b_i y + c_i for each line i. Because for each line, the home and university will lie on either side of it, so the sign of a_i x0 + b_i y0 + c_i is different from that of a_i x1 + b_i y1 + c_i.\n\nSo, for each line, the home and university are on opposite sides. That means that the minimal path must cross each line an odd number of times. Because each crossing toggles the side.\n\nWait, but when moving from one region to another, you have to cross a line that borders both regions. So the minimal path would involve crossing lines in such a way that each required line is crossed exactly once, and others are crossed even times or not at all.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because the order of crossing lines matters. For instance, two lines might intersect each other, creating a situation where crossing one affects the possible regions you can reach next.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of lines whose orientation (sign) changes between home and university. Because each such line must be crossed an odd number of times, but since each step can only cross one line, the minimal steps would be the count of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nWait, let's consider the example provided:\n\nIn the sample input, the home is at (1,1), the university at (-1,-1). There are two roads: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 (the x-axis) and 1x + 0y + 0 = 0 (the y-axis).\n\nFor the first road (y=0), plugging home (1,1): 0*1 +1*1 +0=1>0. University (-1,-1): 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0=-1<0. So different signs.\n\nSecond road (x=0): home gives 1>0, university gives -1<0. Different signs.\n\nSo according to my earlier idea, the minimal steps would be 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: suppose there are three roads. Let's say home and university differ on two roads, but same on the third. Then minimal steps would be 2.\n\nWait, but what if the lines form a more complex arrangement?\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal number of steps is the number of lines that separate home and university. Because each such line must be crossed at least once, and since each step can cross exactly one line, the minimal steps are the count of such lines.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each line that separates home and university must be crossed an odd number of times, but in the minimal path, you can't do more than one per step, so you have to cross each such line once.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. For each of the n lines, compute the value of a_i*x0 + b_i*y0 + c_i and a_i*x1 + b_i*y1 + c_i.\n2. Count how many lines have opposite signs for home and university.\n3. That count is the minimal number of steps required.\n\nBecause, for each such line, you have to cross it once. And since each step can cross exactly one line, the minimal steps are exactly the count of these lines.\n\nThis approach should handle all cases correctly because each separating line must be crossed an odd number of times, and the minimal",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. The town is divided by multiple lines, and each step allows moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - Each line in Crazy Town divides the plane into two regions.\n   - The goal is to find the shortest path from the home block to the university block, considering that each step can only move between blocks sharing a common border of non-zero length.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - For each line, determine if the home and university lie on opposite sides. If they do, crossing this line is necessary.\n   - The minimal number of steps required is equal to the number of such lines where the home and university are on opposite sides. This is because each line must be crossed exactly once to switch from one region to another.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each line, compute the values of the linear expression at the home and university coordinates.\n   - Count how many lines have opposite signs for these values, indicating that the home and university are on opposite sides of the line.\n   - This count gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    x1 = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    y1 = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    x2 = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    y2 = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n        c = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) or (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0):\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the coordinates of home, university, and the coefficients of each road line.\n- **Evaluating Each Line**: For each line, compute the value of the linear expression at both the home and university coordinates.\n- **Counting Opposite Sides**: If the values for home and university have opposite signs, it means they are on opposite sides of the line, and this line must be crossed.\n- **Output Result**: The total count of such lines is printed, representing the minimum number of steps required.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal steps by leveraging the geometric properties of the lines and their impact on the regions they divide.",
