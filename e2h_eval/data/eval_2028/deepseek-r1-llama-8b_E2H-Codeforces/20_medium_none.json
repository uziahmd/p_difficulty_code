For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of ways to choose c_s for each binary string s of length from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a beautiful multiset is. From the description, for every binary string s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix should not exceed c_s. Oh right, and the goal is to find how many ways we can choose these c_s values so that the largest possible beautiful multiset has size exactly f.\n\nSo, the approach here is probably to model this as some kind of combinatorial problem where each choice of c_s affects the structure of the multiset, and we need to count the valid configurations.\n\nLet me think about the constraints. The maximum possible size is determined by the way the c_s values are chosen. So for each possible way of choosing the c_s's, we compute the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset, and then count how many choices result in this maximum being exactly f.\n\nBut wait, considering all possible choices of c_s directly might be computationally expensive because there are 2^n possible strings (since each string is a binary string of length up to n). But n can be up to 15, which gives 2^15 = 32768 strings. So for each string, we have to choose a c_s between 0 and k, inclusive. But k can be up to 2e5, which is manageable because each c_s can be represented with a certain range.\n\nBut even so, enumerating all possible c_s assignments is impossible because for n=15, that's 32768 variables each with 2e5 possibilities—completely infeasible.\n\nHmm, so we need a smarter way. Maybe dynamic programming can help here.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this problem using inclusion-exclusion or Möbius inversion, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of the problem in terms of the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset given the c_s's. For each possible selection of c_s's, the maximum size is determined by the constraints on the prefixes.\n\nWait, but the maximum size is determined by the way the c_s's are set. For each string s, the number of times s appears as a prefix in the multiset can't exceed c_s. So, the total size is constrained by the sum over all s of the number of times s is present, but considering their dependencies.\n\nWait no, that's not quite right. Because the presence of longer strings affects the counts of their shorter prefixes. For example, if I have the string \"00\" in the multiset, then both \"0\" and \"00\" contribute to the count for \"0\".\n\nWait, no. Each string s in the multiset contributes to all its prefixes. So, for s being \"00\", it contributes 1 to the count of \"0\" and 1 to the count of \"00\". Similarly, \"01\" contributes to \"0\" and \"01\".\n\nTherefore, the count for a string t is the number of strings in the multiset that have t as a prefix. So, for the multiset to be beautiful, for each t, the count of strings in the multiset that have t as a prefix must be ≤ c_t.\n\nSo, the constraints are: for each t, the sum over all s in the multiset where t is a prefix of s is ≤ c_t.\n\nWait, no. Because when you have a string s, any t that is a prefix of s will have s contribute 1 to the count of t. So the count for t is the number of strings s in the multiset that have t as a prefix.\n\nSo, the condition is that for every t, the count of s in the multiset where t is a prefix of s must be ≤ c_t.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible size of the multiset under these constraints, and then count the number of c assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nHmm, but how do we model this maximum? It seems like the constraints form a hierarchy: for a string t, the count is influenced by all its superstrings (strings that have t as a prefix). So, perhaps we can model this as a directed acyclic graph where edges represent the prefix relationship.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a tree where each node represents a string, and children are its suffixes. Then, the constraints are that for each node, the sum of the counts of its descendants (including itself) must be ≤ c_t.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed with that.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps we can represent the problem in terms of the Möbius function or inclusion-exclusion, but I'm not seeing it immediately.\n\nWait, another thought: the maximum possible size of the multiset is determined by the sum over all s of min(c_{prefixes of s}), but that might not capture the exact constraints correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size is determined by the minimal value along each path from the root (empty string) to the leaves (all nodes). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem where for each string s, the number of times s appears in the multiset is x_s. Then, for each s, the sum of x_t for all t that are prefixes of s must be ≤ c_s. Because each time you add a string s, it contributes to all its prefixes.\n\nBut this seems more manageable. So, the constraints are that for each s, sum_{t | s is a prefix of t} x_t ≤ c_s. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because for a string t, if s is a prefix of t, then adding t to the multiset increases the count for s by 1. So, for each s, the total count is the sum of x_t for all t that have s as a prefix.\n\nThus, the constraints are sum_{t where s is a prefix of t} x_t ≤ c_s.\n\nSo, our goal is to maximize the sum of x_s (for all s) subject to sum_{t where s is a prefix of t} x_t ≤ c_s for each s.\n\nWe can model this as a linear program, but since the variables x_s are non-negative integers, it's an integer linear programming problem. However, solving this for each possible assignment of c_s is not feasible due to the high computational complexity.\n\nSo, perhaps we can precompute for each possible assignment of c_s's, what is the maximum possible size of the multiset, and then count the number of c assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut again, for n=15, the number of possible c assignments is too big to handle directly.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the maximum size can be expressed in terms of the c_s's. For example, for each s, the maximum x_s can be c_s minus the sum of x_t for t that are proper prefixes of s. Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible x_s is determined by the c's of its prefixes. Because for s, the sum of x_t for all t that are prefixes of s must be ≤ c_s. But x_s is just one of those terms. So, the maximum x_s can be c_s minus the sum of x_t for t that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nHmm, but how does this affect the overall maximum?\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is equal to the sum over all s of min(c_{s}, c_{s's parents}, ...). No, not exactly. Or perhaps it's the sum over all s of the minimum of c_s and the sum of c_t for t that are supersets of s.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let's try to think differently.\n\nSuppose we fix the c_s's. Then, what is the maximum possible sum of x_s's?\n\nEach x_s can be at most c_s minus the sum of x_t for all t that are strict prefixes of s. Because for each s, sum_{t | s is a prefix of t} x_t ≤ c_s → x_s + sum_{t | s is a prefix of t and t ≠ s} x_t ≤ c_s. So, x_s ≤ c_s - sum_{t | s is a prefix of t and t is proper prefix of s} x_t.\n\nBut since x_s is part of the sum for all its prefixes, including s itself, it's a bit tangled.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum is achieved when for each s, x_s is as large as possible, given the constraints. So, for s, x_s can be up to c_s minus the sum of x_t for t that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nThis seems similar to a tree structure where the x's are determined in a certain order, say, from the longest strings to the shortest.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum for each s of the minimum between c_s and the sum of the x's for the supersets of s.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think recursively.\n\nFor the empty string, which isn't considered here, but for the root, perhaps each c_s contributes to the sum. But in our problem, s starts from length 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum can be computed as the sum for each s of min(c_s, sum of c_t for all t that are superstrings of s).\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right. Maybe the maximum is the sum for each s of the minimum between c_s and the sum of x_t for all t that are proper supersets of s.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a tree, where each node s has children that are its proper supersets. Then, for each node s, the maximum x_s is min(c_s, sum of x_t for all t in the subtree rooted at s).\n\nWait, I'm not sure. Maybe I need to find a way to express the maximum sum in terms of the c's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum for each s of the minimum between c_s and the sum of the c_t for all t that are superstrings of s. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet's take the example given:\n\nIn the sample input, n=2, k=3, f=2. The output is 3.\n\nLooking at the example explanation, the c assignments are:\n\n1. c_0=0, c_1=2: the multiset is {1,1}. The maximum size is 2.\n2. c_0=1, c_1=1: the multiset is {0,1}. Size is 2.\n3. c_0=2, c_1=0: multiset is {0,0}. Size is 2.\n\nSo, for each assignment, the maximum size is 2, and we have three such assignments.\n\nHow was the maximum size computed in each case?\n\nIn case 1: For s=0, the count is 2 (both 0s and 00s, but in the multiset, only 1 is present. Wait, no, the multiset is {1,1}.\n\nWait, for s=0, the count is the number of strings in the multiset that have 0 as a prefix. In this case, 0 is a prefix of 0 and 00, but the multiset has 1 and 1. So, the count for s=0 is 0, which is ≤ c_0=0.\n\nSimilarly for s=1, the count is 2 (since each 1 is a prefix of itself, but not of anything else in the multiset). So 2 ≤ c_1=2.\n\nSo the maximum size is 2.\n\nWait, but how is this connected to the c's? It seems that the maximum is the sum of x_s for all s, where x_s is the number of times s appears in the multiset. So, to maximize the sum, each x_s is as large as possible, given the constraints.\n\nSo, for a given c assignment, the maximum sum is the sum of x_s, where x_s is the minimum of c_s and the sum of x_t for all t that are proper supersets of s.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a system of equations. For each s, x_s can be at most c_s minus the sum of x_t for all t that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nBut then, the maximum sum is the sum of x_s, which depends on the c's and the x's.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be approached with dynamic programming, where we process the strings in order of increasing length.\n\nYes! So, the idea is to process the strings in order of their lengths, starting from the shortest (length 1) to the longest (length n). For each string s, the maximum x_s is determined by c_s minus the sum of x_t for all t that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nWait, let's formalize this:\n\nLet S be the set of all binary strings of lengths 1 to n.\n\nFor each s in S, the maximum x_s is the minimum of c_s and (sum of x_t for all t in S where t is a proper prefix of s).\n\nWait, no. Because for s, the sum of x_t for t in S that have s as a prefix is x_s plus the sum of x_t for t in S that are proper supersets of s. So, for s, the constraint is x_s + sum_{t is a proper superset of s} x_t ≤ c_s.\n\nSo, x_s can be at most c_s - sum_{t is a proper superset of s} x_t.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the sum of x_t for t having s as a prefix is equal to the sum of x_t for all t in S where s is a prefix of t. That includes s itself and all of its proper supersets.\n\nSo, the constraint is sum_{t | s is a prefix of t} x_t ≤ c_s.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as x_s + sum_{t | t is a proper superset of s} x_t ≤ c_s.\n\nThus, x_s can be at most c_s minus the sum of x_t for all proper supersets of s.\n\nBut this is a recursive condition because x_s depends on x_t where t is a proper superset of s, which may themselves depend on other x's.\n\nSo, to maximize the sum, we can arrange the processing in reverse order, from longer strings to shorter ones.\n\nWait, yes. Because when processing a string s, all of its proper supersets (which are longer than s) have already been processed, so their x_t values are known.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\n1. Process all strings in order of decreasing length.\n\n2. For each string s, compute x_s as the minimum of (c_s) and (c_s - sum of x_t for t that are proper supersets of s).\n\nWait, but wait: the sum of x_t for t proper supersets of s is the sum that comes from the constraints of t. Because for t, x_t is bounded by c_t minus the sum of its own proper supersets.\n\nSo, for each s, the maximum x_s is min(c_s, c_s - sum_{t proper superset of s} x_t).\n\nBecause the constraint is x_s ≤ c_s - sum_{t proper superset of s} x_t.\n\nBut wait, if the sum is larger than c_s, then x_s must be zero.\n\nWait, let's think with the example:\n\nIn the first case of the sample, c_0=0, c_1=2.\n\nProcessing in order of decreasing length: first process s=\"1\", then s=\"0\".\n\nFor s=\"1\": its proper supersets are none (since it's the longest string), so sum is zero. So x_1 can be up to c_1, which is 2. So x_1 = 2.\n\nThen, process s=\"0\": its proper supersets are \"00\", \"01\", etc., but in the sample n=2, the proper supersets of \"0\" are \"00\" and \"01\". But in the multiset of the sample, neither \"00\" nor \"01\" is present. So x_00 = 0, x_01=0. So sum is 0. Thus, x_0 can be up to c_0=0. So x_0=0.\n\nTotal sum is 2+0=2, which matches.\n\nAnother example: the second case in the sample where c_0=1, c_1=1.\n\nProcess s=\"1\" first: x_1=1.\n\nProcess s=\"0\": sum of x_t for proper supersets is x_00 + x_01. But in this case, the multiset has only \"0\" and \"1\". So x_00=0, x_01=0. Sum is 0. So x_0 can be up to 1. So x_0=1.\n\nSum is 1+1=2.\n\nThird case: c_0=2, c_1=0.\n\nProcess s=\"1\": x_1 can be 0 (since c_1=0).\n\nProcess s=\"0\": sum is 0, so x_0 can be up to 2. So x_0=2.\n\nSum is 0+2=2.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nThus, the maximum sum for a given c assignment is the sum of x_s for all s, where x_s is the minimum of c_s and (c_s minus the sum of x_t for t proper supersets of s).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\n- Enumerate all possible c_s assignments (each c_s can be 0..k).\n- For each assignment, compute x_s for each s in order of decreasing length, setting x_s = min(c_s, c_s - sum of x_t for t proper supersets of s).\n- Sum all x_s to get the total size.\n- Count the number of c assignments where this total is exactly f.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 15, which gives 2^15=32768 strings. For each of these, the c_s can be 0..k, which is up to 2e5. So, directly computing this is impossible.\n\nHmm, so we need a way to model this efficiently.\n\nAlternative idea: group the c_s assignments based on certain properties. Perhaps, for each s, the contribution to the maximum sum can be expressed as a function of the c_s and the c_t of its supersets.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this using a DP approach where for each s, we track the possible x_s values and their contributions, given the x_t values of the proper supersets.\n\nBut even so, for 32768 strings, each with up to 2e5 possible x_s, this is computationally infeasible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum sum is additive across the strings, considering the hierarchy.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum over all s of the minimum between c_s and the sum of c_t for t that are supersets of s.\n\nNo, that's not necessarily the case. For instance, if c_s is very small, it could limit the sum even if higher c_t's exist.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum sum can be determined by a certain subset of the c_s's. For example, the sum is the sum of all c_s minus the sum of overlaps, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of all c_s, minus the sum of the min(c_s, ...) for certain conditions.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is equal to the sum of c_s for all s, but considering that for each s, the x_s can't be larger than c_s minus the sum of x_t for supersets.\n\nSo, the sum x_s is bounded by the sum of (c_s - sum_{proper supersets t} x_t). Which is equivalent to sum x_s = sum c_s - sum (sum x_t for each t proper superset of s).\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAnother angle: the problem is to count the number of c assignments where the maximum sum is exactly f. So, perhaps for each possible c assignment, the maximum sum can be computed, and then we check if it's equal to f.\n\nBut with n=15 and 2^15=32768 strings, and each c_s can be up to 2e5, this is impossible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum sum is determined by a certain function of the c_s's, and we can find a way to represent the possible sums without enumerating all c assignments.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother thought: the maximum sum is the sum over all s of x_s, where x_s is min(c_s, c_s - sum_{t is proper superset of s} x_t).\n\nBut since the x_t's for supersets are determined before x_s, the maximum sum can be computed as follows:\n\nStart with the longest strings, compute x_s as min(c_s, c_s - 0) = min(c_s, c_s) = c_s.\n\nThen, for each shorter string s, x_s is min(c_s, c_s - sum of x_t for t proper supersets of s).\n\nBut this seems manageable if we can model the sum in terms of the c_s's.\n\nWait, let's see: for each string s, the x_s can be either c_s or (c_s minus the sum of x_t for proper supersets of s), whichever is smaller.\n\nBut since the sum for s is determined by the x_t's of its proper supersets, perhaps we can model the maximum sum as a function that depends on the c_s's in a way that allows us to compute the sum quickly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum can be represented as the sum of c_s's minus the sum of (sum of x_t for each s's proper supersets). But again, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of all c_s, minus the sum of (sum of x_t for each s's proper supersets).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nx_s = min(c_s, c_s - sum_{t is proper superset of s} x_t)\n\nSo, x_s = c_s - sum_{t is proper superset of s} x_t', where x_t' is the minimum between x_t and c_t.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of x_s, where x_s is as large as possible given the constraints. So, x_s is the minimum of c_s and (c_s - sum_{t proper superset of s} x_t).\n\nBut since x_t is determined before x_s, we can compute x_s in order from longest to shortest.\n\nWait, but how does this relate to the sum?\n\nLet me think for a moment: for each s, x_s can be up to c_s, but if the sum of x_t for t proper supersets of s is greater than c_s, then x_s must be zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of c_s for all s, minus the sum over s of the sum of x_t for t proper supersets of s.\n\nWait, but that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of c_s for all s, minus the sum of (sum of x_t for t proper supersets of s) for all s.\n\nBut then, this sum would be equal to the sum of x_s for all s, which is the maximum sum.\n\nWait, let me test this with the sample.\n\nSample case 1: c_0=0, c_1=2.\n\nSum of c_s is 0 + 2 = 2.\n\nNow, for each s, sum of x_t for t proper supersets of s.\n\nFor s=0: proper supersets are 00, 01, 10, 11 (but in the sample, n=2, so the proper supersets are 00 and 01). But in the first case, x_00=0, x_01=0, so sum is 0.\n\nFor s=1: proper supersets are none, so sum is 0.\n\nSo, sum of (sum x_t for s) is 0 + 0 = 0.\n\nThus, 2 - 0 = 2, which matches the maximum sum.\n\nAnother test case: in the third case of the sample, c_0=2, c_1=0.\n\nSum of c_s is 2 + 0 = 2.\n\nFor s=0: sum of x_t for proper supersets is 0 (no proper supersets with x_t >0).\n\nFor s=1: sum is 0.\n\nTotal sum of (sum x_t for s) is 0.\n\nSo, 2 - 0 = 2.\n\nSo, the hypothesis seems to hold.\n\nAnother example: suppose n=3, and we have c_000=3, c_001=4, c_010=5, c_011=6, c_100=7, c_101=8, c_110=9, c_111=10.\n\nProcessing in order of decreasing length:\n\nx_111 = min(10, 10) = 10.\n\nx_110 = min(9, 9 - x_111) = min(9, 9-10)= min(9,-1) = 0.\n\nSimilarly, x_101 = min(8, 8 - x_111) = 8-10 is negative, so x_101=0.\n\nx_100 = min(7, 7 - x_111) → 0.\n\nx_011: c=6, but its proper supersets are 111, 110, 101, 100, 011 is not a proper superset of 000. Wait, no, proper supersets of 011 are 111, etc. So, x_011 can be min(6, 6 - (x_111 + x_110 + x_101 + x_100)). Suppose x_111=10, others are 0. So 6 -10 is negative. So x_011=0.\n\nSimilarly, x_010: min(5,5 - (x_111 + ... )) → 0.\n\nx_001: same, 0.\n\nx_000: min(3, 3 - (x_111 + ... )) → 3-10 is negative → x_000=0.\n\nSo the sum is 10 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 +0 +0 =10.\n\nSum of c_s is 3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10=52.\n\nSum of (sum x_t for s) is:\n\nsum over s of sum x_t for t proper supersets of s.\n\nFor s=000: sum x_t for t proper supersets (001, 010, 011, etc.) which are all 0. So sum is 0.\n\nFor s=001: same, sum is 0.\n\nSimilarly, all other s except 111 have x_s=0, so their sum is 0.\n\nOnly s=111 contributes to the sum for its proper supersets, but since it's the longest string, it has no proper supersets.\n\nThus, the sum of (sum x_t for s) is 0.\n\nSo, the maximum sum is 52 -0=52, but wait, that's not matching. Because in reality, the maximum sum is 10.\n\nWait, this suggests that my hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so that idea is wrong.\n\nSo, I'm back to square one. Need to think differently.\n\nAlternative approach: for each string s, the maximum x_s is determined by the c_s and the c_t of its proper supersets.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum for each s of min(c_s, c_s - sum_{t proper supersets of s} c_t).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because x_t depends on c_t and the x's of their proper supersets.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of c_s minus the sum over s of (sum_{t proper supersets of s} c_t).\n\nWait, let's test this with the sample.\n\nSample case 1: c_0=0, c_1=2.\n\nsum c_s = 0+2=2.\n\nsum over s of (sum_{t proper supersets} c_t):\n\nfor s=0: proper supersets are 00, 01. But in this case, n=2, so 00 and 01 are allowed. Their c_t are, say, c_00 and c_01. Wait, but in the sample, the c's are given for all strings up to n=2, including 00, 01, 10, 11.\n\nSo, in the sample, the sum over s of (sum t proper supersets of s) c_t.\n\nFor s=0: sum t proper supersets is c_00 + c_01 + c_10 + c_11. But in the sample, the c's are c_0=0, c_1=2, c_00=1, c_01=2, c_10=2, c_11=3.\n\nWait, no, in the sample description, the c's are given for all possible strings. So, for s=0, the proper supersets are 00, 01, 10, 11.\n\nSo sum c_t for t proper supersets of s=0 is c_00 + c_01 + c_10 + c_11.\n\nIn the first sample case, c_00=1, c_01=2, c_10=2, c_11=3. So sum is 1+2+2+3=8.\n\nSimilarly, for s=1, the proper supersets are 11. So sum is c_11=3.\n\nThus, the total sum over s of (sum t proper supersets of s) c_t is 8 (from s=0) + 3 (from s=1) = 11.\n\nThen, according to the hypothesis, the maximum sum is sum c_s - sum (sum t proper supersets c_t) = (0+1+2+3+2+2+2+3) [wait, wait, I think I'm misunderstanding the sum].\n\nWait, no. In the first sample, n=2, the c's are given for all strings of length up to 2.\n\nWait, perhaps in the sample, the sum of c_s is 0 (c_0) + 2 (c_1) + 1 (c_00) + 2 (c_01) + 2 (c_10) + 3 (c_11) = 0+2+1+2+2+3=10.\n\nThen, sum over s of sum t proper supersets of s of c_t.\n\ns=0: sum t proper supersets is c_00 + c_01 + c_10 + c_11 = 1+2+2+3=8.\n\ns=1: sum t proper supersets is c_11=3.\n\ns=00: sum t proper supersets is none, since it's the longest string? Or wait, no, 00 is of length 2; its proper supersets would be strings longer than 2, which don't exist. So sum is zero.\n\nSame for s=01, 10, 11: their proper supersets are longer than 2, so sum is zero.\n\nThus, the total sum over s of (sum t proper supersets of s) c_t is 8 (s=0) +3 (s=1) + 0+0+0+0 = 11.\n\nSo, according to the hypothesis, the maximum sum is sum c_s - sum (sum t proper supersets c_t) = 10 -11 = -1, which is impossible.\n\nSo, the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so perhaps that approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative Idea: The problem is to count the number of c assignments where the maximum sum is exactly f. So, perhaps we can model the problem as a generating function, where each c_s contributes a certain term, and the product of these terms across all s gives the total number of ways to achieve a certain sum.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, for each s, the maximum x_s is determined by c_s and the c_t of its proper supersets.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum can be represented as the sum of c_s for all s, minus the sum of (sum of c_t for t proper supersets of s). But earlier examples show that this can be negative, which is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of min(c_s, c_s - sum_{t proper supersets of s} x_t), where x_t are the maximum possible for t.\n\nBut since x_t depends on c_t and the x's of their proper supersets, this creates a circular dependency.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe it's helpful to model the problem as a graph where each node is a string, and edges point from a string to its proper supersets. Then, the maximum x_s for each node is determined by the c_s and the sum of x_t for its children.\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the x_s's are determined by the c_s's and the x_t's of the proper supersets, perhaps we can represent the maximum sum as a function of the c_s's, which can be computed in a topological order.\n\nOnce we have this function, we can model the problem as counting the number of c assignments where this function equals f.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let's consider that the maximum sum is a linear function of the c_s's. Then, the function can be represented as sum_a * c_a + sum_b * c_b + ..., where a and b are certain combinations of the strings.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of all c_s, minus the sum of (sum_{t proper supersets of s} c_t). But as seen before, this can be negative, which isn't possible. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of all c_s, minus the sum of the min(c_t, sum of c_s for s that are proper supersets of t).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of all c_s, minus the sum of (sum of x_t for t proper supersets of s), but x_t is determined by their own constraints.\n\nWait, this seems to lead back to the initial problem.\n\nPerhaps I'm stuck, so I should look for hints or think about alternative approaches.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the problem requires the maximum sum to be exactly f, perhaps we can model this as a combinatorial problem where each string's c_s contributes to the sum, but with constraints.\n\nBut again, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to note that the maximum sum is determined by the sum of c_s's, but with certain constraints imposed by the hierarchy of the strings.\n\nThus, the problem can be modeled as a tree, where each node represents a string, and the sum is computed by traversing the tree in a specific order.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nAnother Idea: Since n is up to 15, perhaps we can represent the problem as a bitmask and use memoization for the states.\n\nWait, but for 15 bits, the state space is 32768, which is manageable. But how?\n\nPerhaps we can model the maximum sum for a subset of strings, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using a dynamic programming approach where each state represents the current string and the sum so far, but again, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum can be represented as a sum of the c_s's, but each c_s is adjusted by subtracting the sum of c_t's for t that are proper supersets of s.\n\nBut in the sample case, this didn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of c_s's, minus the sum of the sum of c_t's for each t proper superset of s.\n\nBut in the first sample, sum c_s is 0+2+1+2+2+3=10. Sum of sum c_t for s is 8+3=11. So 10-11 = -1, which is impossible.\n\nSo, that's not correct.\n\nHmm.\n\nAn alternative approach is needed.\n\nLet me think differently: for each string s, the x_s can be up to c_s, but also, x_s can't be larger than the sum of c_t for all t that are proper supersets of s. Because x_s is constrained by the fact that x_s + sum x_t (for proper supersets t) ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, but this is because x_s can be at most c_s - sum x_t, which can't be larger than c_s.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of x_s, which is the sum of min(c_s, c_s - sum x_t for t proper supersets of s).\n\nBut again, this depends on the x_t's.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of c_s minus the sum of (sum x_t for t proper supersets of s). Because x_s = min(c_s, c_s - sum x_t) implies that x_s can be written as c_s - sum x_t, but only if c_s >= sum x_t.\n\nSo, perhaps the sum x_s is the sum of c_s minus the sum of sum x_t for each s.\n\nBut let's test this.\n\nIn the first sample:\n\nsum x_s = 2.\n\nsum c_s = 0+2+1+2+2+3 = 10.\n\nsum over s of sum x_t for t proper supersets of s is 8 (from s=0) + 3 (from s=1) = 11.\n\nSo 10 -11 = -1, which is not equal to 2.\n\nSo that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: The maximum sum is the sum of c_s for all s, minus the sum of (sum of x_t for t proper supersets of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose integers \\( c_s \\) for each binary string \\( s \\) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly \\( f \\). \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to model the problem using dynamic programming (DP) to efficiently count the valid configurations.
