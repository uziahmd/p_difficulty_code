    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Gluttony,\" and the goal is to construct a permutation of a given array such that for every non-empty subset of indices (excluding the empty set and the entire set), the sum of elements in a at those positions is different from the sum in b.\n\nHmm. So, the problem is asking me to rearrange the array into a permutation b where every possible subset sum (for non-empty subsets that aren't the whole array) is unique between a and b. Or wait, no, more precisely, for every non-empty subset S of {1,...,n}, the sum in a on S must differ from the sum in b on S. Because S can be any subset except the empty or full set.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: for every non-empty subset S = {x1, x2, ..., xk} where 0 < k < n, the sums in a and b are different. So, for each subset S, a's sum and b's sum must be different.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? The key is to ensure that for all possible non-empty subsets S (with size between 1 and n-1), the sum in a and the sum in b are different.\n\nWait, but the way it's phrased, it's not just that the sum in a is different from the sum in b for each subset S. Because for each subset S, the sum of a's elements in S and the sum of b's elements in S must differ.\n\nSo, for example, if S is {x1}, then a's sum is a[x1], and b's sum is b[x1]. These two must be different.\n\nSimilarly, for S being {x1, x2}, the sum of a[x1] + a[x2] must differ from b[x1] + b[x2].\n\nAnd this has to hold for all possible subsets S of size 1, 2, ..., n-1.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a permutation b of a such that for all S as described, sum_{s in S} a[s] != sum_{s in S} b[s].\n\nThe challenge is to find such a permutation b, or determine that it's impossible.\n\nNow, what's the strategy here? Let's think about the constraints.\n\nEach element of a is distinct. So, perhaps we can assign the elements of b in such a way that certain properties are met.\n\nLet me consider some small cases to get an idea.\n\nFor example, if n=1, then since the subset size must be less than n, there are no such subsets. So, any permutation is acceptable. But in the problem statement, n starts from 1, but the condition applies only when subsets have size >0 and <n. So for n=1, any permutation is okay, but since there are no such subsets, the output is just the same array.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's mentioned that the second line contains n space-separated distinct integers. So for n=1, it's a single element, and the output is that element.\n\nBut the problem's sample input shows n=4 and another with n=2. Hmm.\n\nLet's think about the sample input:\n\nIn the first sample input, the output is ['2 1'] which is a permutation of [1,2]. So for n=2, the condition is that for the subset {1}, the sum in a is 1, and in b is 2. They are different. For the subset {2}, sum is 2 vs 1. Different. Also, for the subset {1,2}, sum in a is 3, sum in b is 3. Oh wait, but wait! Wait, the subset S must be of size between 1 and n-1. So for n=2, the subset can be of size 1. So in the sample, the sum for S={1} is 1 vs 2; for S={2}, 2 vs 1. Both are different. But what about the full subset {1,2}? It's excluded because it's size n, which is 2.\n\nSo, the problem requires that for all subsets of size 1, 2, ..., n-1, the sum in a and b differ.\n\nSo, the key is to ensure that for each subset S (non-empty, not the entire array), the sum in a and sum in b differ.\n\nHow can we model this?\n\nI think the approach is to generate all possible permutations of a and check whether for each permutation, the condition holds. But for n up to 22, that's 22! permutations, which is way too big (like 1e21 operations). So brute-force is impossible.\n\nTherefore, we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative approach: find a way to construct b such that for each position, the element is chosen such that certain subset sums are avoided.\n\nWait, perhaps it's related to the concept of a \"distinguishing\" permutation, where certain subsets have unique properties.\n\nAnother thought: for each element in b, we can assign it in a way that each individual element is different from its counterpart in a. That is, b[i] != a[i] for all i. But that's not sufficient, because even if that's true, other subsets could have the same sums.\n\nWait, but perhaps if each individual element in b is different from a's corresponding element, then for any singleton subset, the sum will be different. That's necessary but not sufficient for the problem.\n\nBut also, for larger subsets, we need the sums to differ. So, this condition isn't enough, but it's a start.\n\nSo, perhaps the first step is to try to create a permutation where each element is different from a's original position. If that's possible, then at least all singleton subsets are handled.\n\nBut even beyond that, we have to handle larger subsets.\n\nWait, but what if we arrange the permutation such that all elements are in a different order, but their individual values are such that no two subsets have the same sum in a and b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by assigning the permutation in a way that for every element, it's placed in a position such that for all possible subsets, the sum is unique.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model that.\n\nAnother idea: for each subset S, the sum in a and the sum in b must differ. So, the sum in a of S is sum_a(S), and sum_b(S) must not equal sum_a(S).\n\nSo, for each S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S).\n\nBut sum_b(S) is the sum of the elements of b in the positions of S.\n\nSo, for each S, the sum of the elements of b in S is not equal to the sum of the elements of a in S.\n\nThis seems similar to a concept in combinatorics where two sets have distinct subset sums.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be rephrased as: find a permutation b of a such that for every non-empty proper subset S, the sum of b's elements in S is different from the sum of a's elements in S.\n\nHmm. How can we enforce this?\n\nPerhaps, the key is to find a permutation b where for each element, it's placed in a position such that for each possible subset S that includes that position, the sum is not equal to the sum in a.\n\nBut that's vague.\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. For each element, say a_i, when placed in position j in b, it contributes a_i to all subsets that include j. So, if a_i is placed in b_j, then for any subset S that includes j, the sum in a is a_S, and the sum in b is (sum of b's elements in S).\n\nWe need a_S != sum of b's elements in S for all S.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAnother angle: What is the difference between a and b? Let's compute c = b - a (element-wise). Wait, but subtraction isn't defined for each element, but perhaps we can consider the difference as b_i = a_j for some j, and then track the differences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a linear algebra problem, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum of a's subset S is equal to the sum of b's subset S. So, for each S, sum_a(S) - sum_b(S) != 0.\n\nWhich implies that for each S, sum (a_i - b_i) for i in S is not zero.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a permutation b such that for all non-empty proper subsets S, the sum over i in S of (a_i - b_i) is not zero.\n\nHmm, that's an interesting way to look at it.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, let's denote d_i = a_i - b_i. Then, for any non-empty proper subset S, the sum of d_i for i in S is not zero.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: find a permutation b (so that the d's are such that for all non-empty proper S, sum_{i in S} d_i != 0).\n\nAlso, note that since b is a permutation of a, the multiset of a_i and b_i is the same, but their ordering is changed. Therefore, each d_i is a_i - b_i, and the sum of all d_i is zero because the sum of a is the same as the sum of b.\n\nSo, the sum of all d_i is zero. That's important.\n\nSo, our goal is to arrange the d_i such that:\n\n1. For every non-empty proper subset S, sum_{i in S} d_i != 0.\n\n2. The sum of all d_i is zero.\n\nAdditionally, since b is a permutation of a, each d_i can be written as a_j - a_k for some j and k, because b is a rearrangement of a.\n\nWait, because in the permutation b, each element is taken from a, so for each position i, b_i is some a_j. So, d_i = a_i - a_j.\n\nThus, each d_i is a difference of two elements of a.\n\nSo, the problem is to assign to each position i a value d_i = a_j - a_k, such that:\n\n- All d_i are such that they form a permutation (since b is a permutation of a).\n\n- The sum of all d_i is zero.\n\n- For every non-empty proper subset S, the sum of d_i for i in S is not zero.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit abstract.\n\nAn alternative approach: perhaps we can find a permutation where each element is placed in such a way that the difference d_i is non-zero for each i. But that's not sufficient, because the sum over any subset could still be zero.\n\nWait, for example, suppose d_1 = 1 and d_2 = -1. Then, for the subset {1}, the sum is 1, which is non-zero. For subset {2}, the sum is -1, which is non-zero. For subset {1,2}, the sum is zero. But that subset is the entire set, which is not considered. So in this case, it's acceptable.\n\nWait, but if n=2, the problem requires that all subsets of size 1 are checked. So for the sample input, it's allowed.\n\nBut if n=3, suppose d1=1, d2=2, d3=-3. Then, the sum of all three is zero. Now, any subset S of size 1: sum is 1, 2, or -3—all non-zero. For subsets of size 2: 1+2=3, 1-3=-2, 2-3=-1. All non-zero. So, this would satisfy the condition.\n\nSo, in this case, the permutation would be acceptable.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be approached by ensuring that for each element, the difference d_i is non-zero, and that no combination of any subset (excluding the full set) sums to zero.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother observation: for each element i, d_i can be any number, but their sum is zero. Also, for each subset S (non-empty, proper), sum of d_i in S is not zero.\n\nThis is similar to the concept of a \"zero-sum-free\" set, but not exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's helpful to think about the vector space of all possible subsets. Each subset corresponds to a vector where each entry is 1 if the element is in the subset, 0 otherwise. Then, the sum of d_i multiplied by the characteristic vector of S must not be zero.\n\nBut this is getting into linear algebra, which might be complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nSince the problem requires that for every non-empty proper subset S, the sum of d_i for i in S is not zero, perhaps we can model this as a system of equations. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but for each subset S, the sum of d_i in S is not zero. The number of subsets is 2^n - 2 (since we exclude the empty and the full set). For n=22, that's 2^22-2 ≈ 4 million, which is manageable for some approaches but perhaps not for others.\n\nBut solving for each subset is tricky.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nWe can model the problem as a graph. Each node represents a state of the partial assignment of d_i's, and edges represent adding a new d_i. We need to ensure that for any non-empty subset S, the sum is not zero. But this seems too vague.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that each d_i is non-zero, and that for any two elements i and j, d_i ≠ -d_j. Because if d_i = -d_j, then the subset {i,j} would sum to zero. Which is not allowed.\n\nWait, let's see: if d_i + d_j = 0, then for the subset {i, j}, the sum is zero. Which is invalid. So, in order to avoid this, for any i and j, d_i cannot be equal to the negative of d_j.\n\nSo, this gives us a condition: for any i != j, d_i ≠ -d_j.\n\nBut is this sufficient? No, because even if no two elements are negatives of each other, there could be a subset S of size >=3 whose sum is zero.\n\nFor example, consider d1=1, d2=2, d3=-3. The sum of all three is zero. But for any subset of size 1 or 2, the sum is non-zero.\n\nWait, in this case, the subset {1,2,3} is the full set, which is allowed. So, that's okay.\n\nAnother example: d1=1, d2=1, d3=-2. Then, the subset {1,2} sums to 2, which is non-zero. The subset {1,3} sums to -1, non-zero. The subset {2,3} sums to -1, non-zero. So this is acceptable.\n\nBut what if d1=1, d2=1, d3=1, d4=-3. Then, the subset {1,2,3} sums to 3, which is fine. Subset {1,2,3,4} sums to zero, but that's the full set, which is allowed. Subsets like {1,2,3,4} are allowed.\n\nWait, but what about a case where a subset of size 3 sums to zero. Like d1=1, d2=2, d3=-3, d4=0 (but 0 is not allowed because then d_i is zero, which would cause any subset containing i to have sum zero).\n\nWait, but in our problem, d_i can be zero only if all elements are zero, but since a consists of distinct elements, that's impossible. So, no d_i is zero.\n\nWait, because a has distinct elements, and b is a permutation of a, then for each i, d_i = a_i - b_i. Since all a_i are distinct, it's possible that d_i can be zero only if a_i is placed in position i, but that's allowed. However, in that case, for the subset {i}, sum is zero, which is invalid.\n\nSo, in order to satisfy the condition, for any singleton subset, the sum must be non-zero. Which means that for all i, d_i != 0.\n\nAh! So, that's a crucial point. For any singleton subset S = {i}, the sum is d_i, which must not be zero. Therefore, d_i != 0 for all i.\n\nSo, each d_i must be non-zero.\n\nThis gives us a starting condition.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Ensure that for each i, d_i = a_i - b_i != 0.\n\n2. Ensure that for any subset S (non-empty, proper), sum of d_i for i in S is not zero.\n\nAdditionally, the sum of all d_i must be zero because sum(b) = sum(a), as b is a permutation.\n\nSo, how can we construct such a permutation?\n\nIdea: Assign each d_i to be a unique non-zero value such that no subset sum equals zero.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother thought: For n=1, no problem. For n=2, the d_i can be 1 and -1. But wait, the sum of d_i must be zero. So, for n=2, d1=1, d2=-1. This works because the sum is zero. And for subsets:\n\n- S={1}: sum is 1 !=0.\n\n- S={2}: sum is -1 !=0.\n\nSo, this works.\n\nIn the sample input, the output is '2 1', which for a=[1,2], the permutation is [2,1]. So, d1=2-1=1, d2=1-2=-1. So, it satisfies the conditions.\n\nAnother example: n=3. Suppose a = [10, 20, 30]. Then, can we assign d1=1, d2=2, d3=-3? Sum is zero. For each singleton: 1, 2, -3, all non-zero. For any pair: 1+2=3, 1-3=-2, 2-3=-1. All non-zero. So, this works.\n\nSo, the question is, how to construct such a permutation.\n\nApproach:\n\nWe can try to assign d_i's as follows:\n\n- Assign each d_i to a unique non-zero integer, such that their sum is zero, and no subset of them sums to zero.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding a set of numbers with distinct subset sums.\n\nWait, yes. The problem is similar to the concept of a \"Sidon sequence\" or a set with distinct subset sums. But in our case, the subset sums should not only be distinct but also not equal to any subset sum of a.\n\nWait, no. Our problem requires that for any subset S, the sum of d_i in S is not equal to the sum of a_i in S.\n\nWait, but the sum of a_i in S is fixed. So, the sum of d_i in S must be different from that.\n\nBut the sum of a_i in S is known, so for each subset S, we require that the sum of d_i in S is not equal to that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to precompute the sum of a for all subsets S, and then make sure that the sum of d_i in S is not equal to that.\n\nBut that seems difficult.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWe can model this as a system where for each subset S, sum(d_i for i in S) != target_sum(S), where target_sum(S) is the sum of a_i in S.\n\nSo, the problem is to assign d_i = a_p(i) - a_q(i) (where p and q are permutations) such that for all S, sum(d_i for i in S) != target_sum(S).\n\nBut again, this is quite abstract.\n\nAnother Approach:\n\nSince the problem requires that for all non-empty proper subsets S, sum(d_i for i in S) != sum_a(S), perhaps the simplest way is to arrange the permutation such that all d_i are positive. Then, for any subset S, sum(d_i for S) is positive, which is different from sum_a(S) if sum_a(S) is not positive. But this may not always be possible.\n\nWait, but for a subset S, sum(d_i) is positive, which could differ from sum_a(S), which could be negative or positive. So, perhaps if all d_i are positive, then for any subset S, sum(d_i) is positive, which is different from sum_a(S) if sum_a(S) is negative. But if sum_a(S) is positive, it depends on whether sum(d_i) is equal to it.\n\nThis might not always work.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nMaybe we can assign the permutation in such a way that for each i, d_i is greater than zero. Then, for any subset S, sum(d_i) is positive, which must differ from sum_a(S). So, for this to work, sum_a(S) must not be positive for any S. But that's unlikely unless all a_i are negative, which is not the case in the problem.\n\nWait, the problem allows a_i to be zero. So, perhaps this approach isn't feasible.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nPerhaps, for each element in the permutation, we can swap adjacent elements if it helps in creating a d_i that avoids certain sums.\n\nBut without knowing the specific structure of the array, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to try to find a permutation where each element is in a different position than in the original array. Additionally, for each element, the difference d_i is non-zero. Moreover, we can check whether for each subset S, the sum of d_i in S is not equal to the sum of a_i in S.\n\nBut again, for n=22, checking all subsets is computationally expensive.\n\nSo, perhaps, the problem can be approached by trying to find a permutation where the sum of any subset differs from the corresponding sum in a.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea Inspired by the Sample:\n\nIn the sample input, the permutation swaps the two elements. So, for n=2, swapping the two elements ensures that the sum of each singleton subset is different.\n\nBut for larger n, perhaps swapping adjacent elements in a way that creates unique differences might help.\n\nWait, but how to ensure that all subsets' sums are different.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWe can represent the problem as a graph where nodes are the elements, and edges represent whether swapping two elements would create a situation where some subset sums are equal. But this seems too vague.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nPerhaps the problem can be reduced to a problem where each d_i is a distinct power of 2. Because each subset would then have a unique sum, which could differ from the target sums.\n\nWait, for example, if d_i are 1, 2, 4, 8, etc., then the sum for any subset is unique.\n\nIn this case, for any subset S, sum(d_i for i in S) is unique. So, if we can arrange the d_i's such that their subset sums are all unique, and none of them equals the sum of a_i in any subset S.\n\nBut arranging the d_i's in this way is challenging, especially considering that the sum of all d_i must be zero.\n\nWait, but if the sum of all d_i is zero, then the sum of all d_i must be zero. So, for example, if n=3, d1=1, d2=2, d3=-3. Then, the sum is zero. And for any subset S, the sum of d_i is not equal to the sum of a_i in S.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this approach would work for larger n.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps it's best to proceed with the following approach:\n\n1. Generate all possible permutations of the array a.\n\n2. For each permutation b, compute the d_i = a_i - b_i for each i.\n\n3. Check two conditions for this permutation:\n\n   a. For every singleton subset S (size 1), d_i != 0.\n\n   b. For every subset S (non-empty, proper), the sum of d_i for i in S is not equal to the sum of a_i for i in S.\n\nIf such a permutation exists, output it. Otherwise, output -1.\n\nBut for n=22, generating all permutations is impossible due to the factorial time complexity.\n\nThus, we need a more efficient approach.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWe can model this as a problem of finding a permutation b such that for every subset S (non-empty, proper), the sum of b_i in S is not equal to the sum of a_i in S.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the problem differently: for each subset S, the sum of a_i in S must not equal the sum of b_i in S.\n\nSo, for each S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S).\n\nThis can be rewritten as sum_b(S) - sum_a(S) != 0.\n\nLet me define c_i = b_i - a_i for each i. Then, sum_b(S) - sum_a(S) = sum(c_i for i in S) != 0.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a permutation b (i.e., a set of c_i's such that sum(c_i) = 0) and for every non-empty proper subset S, sum(c_i for i in S) != 0.\n\nSo, the problem is now to assign c_i's such that:\n\n- Each c_i = b_i - a_i.\n\n- sum(c_i) = 0.\n\n- For every non-empty proper subset S, sum(c_i for i in S) != 0.\n\nMoreover, since b is a permutation of a, the multiset of a_i's is preserved. So, each c_i is equal to a_j - a_k for some j and k.\n\nWait, because b is a permutation of a, so each b_i is some a_j, so c_i = a_i - a_j.\n\nThus, the c_i's are differences between elements of a.\n\nThis is a crucial insight.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: can we assign to each position i a c_i (which is a difference of two a's) such that:\n\n1. sum(c_i) = 0.\n\n2. For every non-empty proper subset S, sum(c_i for i in S) != 0.\n\nAdditionally, since b is a permutation of a, the c_i's must correspond to a derangement (no element remains in the same position, as c_i = a_i - a_j, so if j=i, c_i=0, which is invalid because for singleton subsets, c_i would be zero, which is not allowed).\n\nWait, wait. For c_i = a_i - a_j, if j=i, then c_i is zero. But for singleton subsets, sum(c_i) = c_i must be non-zero. So, for any i, c_i cannot be zero. Thus, j cannot be equal to i, meaning that b is a derangement of a.\n\nSo, the permutation b must be a derangement.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding a derangement of a such that:\n\n- For each i, c_i = a_j - a_k (j != i, since c_i can't be zero).\n\n- sum(c_i) = 0.\n\n- For every non-empty proper subset S, sum(c_i for i in S) != 0.\n\nSo, the steps for the solution are:\n\n1. Find a derangement of a (i.e., no element is in its original position).\n\n2. For each element in the derangement, compute c_i = a_i - b_i.\n\n3. Ensure that sum(c_i) = 0.\n\n4. Ensure that for every non-empty proper subset S, sum(c_i for i in S) != 0.\n\nIf such a derangement exists, output b. Else, output -1.\n\nThis narrows down the problem to finding a derangement with certain additional constraints.\n\nNow, how to find such a derangement.\n\nFirst, let's consider the sum(c_i) condition.\n\nsum(c_i) = sum(a_i - b_i) = sum(a_i) - sum(b_i) = 0, since b is a permutation of a.\n\nThus, the sum of c_i's is automatically zero.\n\nSo, the main condition to check is whether for every non-empty proper subset S, the sum of c_i's in S is not zero.\n\nThus, the problem is to find a derangement b where for every non-empty proper subset S, sum(c_i for i in S) != 0.\n\nThis seems challenging, but perhaps we can model it as a graph problem or find a way to construct such a derangement.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nWe can model the problem as a binary matrix where each row represents a possible subset, and columns represent elements. Each cell indicates whether the element is included in the subset.\n\nThen, for each subset, the sum of the corresponding c_i's must not be zero.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed with this.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps, for small n (up to 22), we can try to find a derangement where all c_i's are non-zero and the sum of any non-empty proper subset is not zero.\n\nBut even for n=22, trying all derangements is impossible.\n\nThus, perhaps the problem can be approached by looking for a derangement where the c_i's are such that they form a basis for a vector space where no non-trivial linear combinations sum to zero.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea Inspired by Linear Algebra:\n\nIf the c_i's are such that they form a basis for the vector space, then any non-trivial linear combination (subset sum) would be unique and non-zero. But this is only possible if the c_i's are linearly independent, which is not necessarily the case here.\n\nBut perhaps, if the c_i's are such that any non-empty subset has a sum that's unique and non-zero, that would suffice.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to construct such a set of c_i's.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps, the problem can be transformed into finding a permutation where the differences between the elements are such that each c_i is unique and non-zero, and no combination of them adds up to zero.\n\nBut again, this is vague.\n\nAlternative Idea Inspired by the Sample Solution:\n\nIn the sample, the permutation was a simple swap. Let's think about what happens when we swap two elements.\n\nSuppose we have a permutation where only two elements are swapped, and the rest remain in place. Then, for any subset S not containing either of these two elements, the sum remains the same as in a. So, for such subsets, sum_b(S) = sum_a(S), which violates the condition.\n\nThus, this approach won't work for n>2.\n\nThus, a more complex permutation is needed.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nWhat if we arrange the permutation in such a way that the sum of any subset S is different from the sum in a.\n\nOne way to achieve this is to ensure that the sum of any subset S in b is either greater than or less than the sum in a for all S.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps, if we can make sure that for any subset S, the sum in b is greater than the sum in a, then they will differ.\n\nBut how to achieve this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps, if we can arrange the permutation such that for any subset S, the sum in b is always greater than the sum in a. Or always less.\n\nBut how to enforce this.\n\nWait, but the sum in a is fixed for each subset S. So, for each S, we need sum_b(S) != sum_a(S). So, for example, if sum_b(S) is always greater than sum_a(S), then it's sufficient.\n\nBut how to arrange this.\n\nPerhaps, we can sort the elements in a certain way and permute accordingly.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nWe can sort the elements in a in increasing order and then permute them in a way that each element is as different as possible from its original position.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea Inspired by the Problem Constraints:\n\nPerhaps, the problem can be solved by checking whether the array a can be partitioned into two subsets with certain properties.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of linear algebra. The sum of any non-empty proper subset S must not be zero. So, the vector c must not lie in the span of any non-empty proper subset.\n\nBut this is getting too abstract.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the only feasible way is to implement a backtracking approach, trying to assign c_i's for each position, ensuring that the current partial assignment doesn't violate any subset sum condition.\n\nBut for n=22, this is impossible.\n\nThus, perhaps the problem is to realize that the required condition is equivalent to the c_i's being such that their subset sums are all distinct and non-zero for non-empty proper subsets.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nAlternative Idea Inspired by the Sample:\n\nIn the sample, n=2, the permutation is a swap. So, each c_i is 1 and -1.\n\nThe sum of any non-empty subset is either 1 or -1, which are non-zero and different from the sum in a.\n\nSo, perhaps, for even n, we can pair up the elements and swap them in pairs, leading to c_i's that are 1 and -1 for each pair.\n\nBut for larger n, this may not be sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps, for each element, we can assign a c_i that is a unique power of 2, ensuring that any subset sum is unique and thus different from the sum in a.\n\nBut again, the sum of all c_i's must be zero, which complicates things.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps, the problem can be addressed by considering the minimal requirements for the permutation.\n\nThe minimal requirement is that for each singleton subset, the sum of c_i is non-zero. Thus, each c_i must be non-zero.\n\nNext, for any pair of elements, their c_i's cannot be additive inverses. So, if c_i = x, then c_j cannot be -x.\n\nBecause if c_i = x and c_j = -x, then their sum is zero, which would violate the condition for the subset {i, j}.\n\nThus, the c_i's must not have any additive inverses.\n\nMoreover, for any triplet of elements, the sum of their c_i's must not be zero.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nGiven that time is limited, perhaps the best way is to look for a pattern or a way to construct the permutation.\n\nAnother Idea Inspired by Graph Theory:\n\nConstruct a graph where each node represents an element, and edges represent whether two elements can be in the same permutation without causing their c_i's to be additive inverses.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea Inspired by the Problem's Sample:\n\nIn the sample, the permutation is a swap of two elements. So, for n=2, it's easy.\n\nFor n=3, perhaps swapping in a way that each element's c_i is unique and no subset sums to zero.\n\nWait, let's take a=[1000, 100, 10, 1].\n\nSample output is [100, 1, 1000, 10].\n\nSo, the permutation is [100, 1, 1000, 10].\n\nCompute c_i's:\n\nc1 = 100 - 1000 = -900\n\nc2 = 1 - 100 = -99\n\nc3 = 1000 - 10 = 990\n\nc4 = 10 - 1 = 9\n\nSum of c_i's: (-900) + (-99) + 990 +9 = 0.\n\nNow, check all non-empty proper subsets.\n\nFor any subset S, sum(c_i) must not equal the sum of a_i in S.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, consider subset S={1}: sum(c_i)=-900. sum_a(S)=1000. Different.\n\nS={2}: sum(c_i)=-99. sum_a(S)=100. Different.\n\nS={3}: sum(c_i)=990. sum_a(S)=10. Different.\n\nS={4}: sum(c_i)=9. sum_a(S)=1. Different.\n\nNow, for pairs:\n\nS={1,2}: sum(c_i)=-999. sum_a(S)=1100. Different.\n\nS={1,3}: sum(c_i)=-900 +990=90. sum_a(S)=1010. Different.\n\nS={1,4}: sum(c_i)=-900+9=-891. sum_a(S)=1001. Different.\n\nS={2,3}: sum(c_i)=-99 +990=891. sum_a(S)=110. Different.\n\nS={2,4}: sum(c_i)=-99 +9=-90. sum_a(S)=101. Different.\n\nS={3,4}: sum(c_i)=990+9=999. sum_a(S)=11. Different.\n\nTriplets:\n\nS={1,2,3}: sum(c_i)= -900 -99 +990= -9. sum_a(S)=1110. Different.\n\nS={1,2,4}: sum(c_i)= -900-99 +9= -990. sum_a(S)= 100+100+1=201. Different.\n\nS={1,3,4}: sum(c_i)= -900 +990 +9= 99. sum_a(S)=1000+10+1=1011. Different.\n\nS={2,3,4}: sum(c_i)= -99+990+9=900. sum_a(S)=100+10+1=111. Different.\n\nAll four elements: sum(c_i)=0. sum_a(S)=1111. Different, since it's the full set.\n\nSo, in this case, the permutation satisfies all conditions.\n\nThus, the approach used in the sample is to swap certain elements to create c_i's that are non-zero and prevent any subset sum from being zero.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nPerhaps, the solution is to find a derangement where the c_i's are such that no two are additive inverses, and no subset of three or more elements sums to zero.\n\nBut again, how to find such a permutation.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to write a function that tries all possible derangements, computes the c_i's, and checks whether",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to construct a permutation of the given array such that for every non-empty subset of indices (excluding the empty set and the entire set), the sums of elements in the original array and the permutation are different.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to ensure that the differences between corresponding elements in the original array and the permutation are such that no non-empty proper subset of these differences sums to zero.

If any subset sum matches, the permutation is invalid.\n6. **Output Result**: If a valid permutation is found, it is printed.
