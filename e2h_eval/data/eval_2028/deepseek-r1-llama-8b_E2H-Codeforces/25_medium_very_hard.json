При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about determining whether a given string could have resulted from an error in message transmission between servers. The error occurs when two identical messages are sent one after another, and due to a bug, they get concatenated in a specific way. \n\nHmm, the task is to check if the given string t could be such a result. If yes, I need to find one possible original message s that could have caused this error. Otherwise, output NO.\n\nFirst, let's understand the error scenario. When two identical messages are sent, their concatenation happens by overlapping as much as possible. But wait, no, more precisely, the error is that two identical messages are sent consecutively, but due to the bug, they are merged by overlapping as much as possible, but only at the end of the first and the start of the second. So, for example, if the first message is 'abc' and the second is 'abc', the error would merge them into 'abccbc'? Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the example says that sending two 'abrakadabra's might result in 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' or 'abrakadabrakadabra'. Oh right, because the overlapping can vary. So the error is that two same messages are concatenated with maximum possible overlap. Wait no, not necessarily maximum. Because in the first case, the overlapping is 1 character, and in the second, it's 4 characters.\n\nWait, how does the overlapping work? It seems that any possible k (where 1 <= k < len(s)) could be the point where the two messages are overlapped. So when you send two messages s, the result is s + s[k:]. Because the two messages are s followed by s, but during transmission, the two s's are merged by overlapping k characters. So the resulting string is s concatenated with s[k:].\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that when two messages are sent, the result is a concatenation where the end of the first coincides with the beginning of the second. So for example, if s is 'abcd', then sending two s's could produce 'abcd' + 'bcd' = 'abcdd' if they overlap by 2 characters (k=2), or 'abcdab' if overlapped by 3, etc. Wait, no: the first message is s, the second is also s. So the result after merging is s + s[k:], right?\n\nSo the resulting string t must be equal to s + s[k:], where k is at least 1 and less than the length of s. So our task is to find if t can be expressed as s concatenated with some suffix of s, starting at position k.\n\nSo, to find possible s and k, we can think of t being split into two parts: the first part is s, and the second part is s starting from k. So, t must be s concatenated with s[k:].\n\nOur goal is to check whether t can be represented as s + s[k:], for some k >= 1 and k < len(s). Also, since s is the original message, its length must be at least 1, and the total length of t must be equal to len(s) + len(s) - k = 2*len(s) - k. But since k is at least 1, len(t) must be at least 2*len(s) - (len(s)-1) = len(s)+1.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If s has length m, then the merged string is s + s[k:]. So the length of t is m + (m -k) = 2m -k. Since k is at least 1, the minimum possible length of t is 2m -1. Also, k must be less than m, so the maximum possible is m-1. So for a given t, the possible m can vary, but it must satisfy that 2m -k = len(t), with 1<=k <m.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to approach this by trying all possible splits of t into s and s[k:]. For each possible split point, check if the second part is a suffix of the first part, starting at some k.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over possible lengths of s. Since t must be formed by s concatenated with s[k:], the length of t is len(t) = len(s) + len(s) -k = 2*len(s) -k. Since k >=1, 2*len(s) -k >= 2*len(s) - (len(s)-1) )= len(s)+1. So len(t) must be >= len(s)+1. But since len(t) can be up to 100, we can try all possible possible s lengths m where m is at least (len(t)+1)/2, but wait, not exactly. Wait, len(t) = 2m -k. Since k can be up to m-1, len(t) can be as small as m+1. So for a given m, len(t) must be >= m+1. But also, m must be such that 2m -k = len(t) for some k >=1 and k <m.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible m, which is the possible length of s, we can check if there exists a k such that:\n\nt starts with s, and t ends with s[k:]. And len(t) = 2m -k.\n\nSo how do we find m? Well, m must be such that 2m -k = len(t). Rearranged, k = 2m - len(t). But k must be >=1 and <m.\n\nSo, 2m - len(t) >=1 => m >= (len(t)+1)/2.\n\nAnd 2m - len(t) < m => m < len(t).\n\nSo m must satisfy (len(t)+1)/2 <= m < len(t).\n\nSo for example, if len(t) is 10, m must be between 5.5 and 9. So m can be 6,7,8,9.\n\nWait, but m must be integer. So for each possible m in [ceil( (len(t)+1)/2 ), len(t)-1], check if there's a k=2m - len(t) that is >=1 and <m.\n\nOnce we have such m and k, we can check if the first m characters of t form s, and the remaining part of t (from m onwards) matches s starting from k.\n\nIf yes, then s is a possible candidate.\n\nSo the algorithm steps could be:\n\nFor each possible m in the valid range:\n\n   compute k = 2m - len(t)\n\n   if k is not in [1, m-1], skip.\n\n   else:\n\n      check if t[0:m] == s_candidate and t[m: ] == s_candidate[k:]\n\n      if yes, return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf after checking all possible m, none found, output NO.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop through possible m from ceil( (len(t)+1)/2 ) to len(t)-1.\n\nFor each m:\n\n   k = 2*m - len(t)\n\n   if k <1 or k >=m: continue\n\n   s = t[:m]\n\n   check if t[m:] == s[k:]\n\n   if yes, then return YES and s.\n\nIf after all m, nothing found, return NO.\n\nWait, let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'\n\nThe output is 'YES' and 'abrakadabra'.\n\nLet me compute len(t) = len('abrakadabrabrakadabra').\n\nCounting letters: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' is 16 letters.\n\nWait, 'abrakadabra' is 11 letters. So 11 + 11 = 22, but the given t is 16 letters. So wait, how?\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the length correctly.\n\nWait, 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' has:\n\na b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a → let's count:\n\na (1), b(2), r(3), a(4), k(5), a(6), d(7), a(8), b(9), r(10), a(11), b(12), r(13), a(14), k(15), a(16), d(17), a(18), b(19), r(20), a(21). Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the string is 21 letters long. So let me recount:\n\nWait, the string is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nab rakada brakadabra → Wait, perhaps the actual string is longer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 16 letters. But that's just me; perhaps it's better to think in code.\n\nBut regardless, let's proceed.\n\nSuppose t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 16 letters.\n\nThen for m, we consider possible values.\n\nm must be >= (16+1)/2 = 8.5, so m can be 9,10,15, 16-1=15.\n\nWait, len(t) is 16, so m can be from 9 to 15.\n\nFor each m in 9 to 15:\n\nk = 2m -16.\n\nCheck if k is between 1 and m-1.\n\nFor m=9: k=18-16=2. Is 2 <9? Yes.\n\nSo s is t[:9] = 'abrakadabr' (assuming 9 letters).\n\nThen t[m:] is t[9:] → 'akadabrabrakadabra'.\n\nWe need to check if this equals s[k:] → s[2:].\n\ns is 'abrakadabr' → s[2:] is 'rakadabr'.\n\nIs 'akadabrabrakadabra' equal to 'rakadabr'? No, so this m=9 is invalid.\n\nNext m=10: k=20-16=4.\n\ns is t[:10] = 'abrakadabr a' (assuming 10 letters).\n\nt[m:] is t[10:] → 'abrabrakadabra'.\n\ns[4:] is 'kadabra'.\n\nDoes 'abrabrakadabra' equal 'kadabra'? No.\n\nContinue.\n\nm=11: k=22-16=6.\n\ns is t[:11], which is 'abrakadabra'.\n\nt[m:] is t[11:] → 'brakadabra'.\n\ns[6:] is 'dabra'.\n\nDo these match? 'brakadabra' vs 'dabra'? No.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps m needs to be such that 2m -k = len(t). So for m=11, k=6.\n\nSo s is 11 letters. Then t is s + s[6:].\n\nSo t should be s + s[6:] → which is s[0:11] + s[6:11+6?] No, wait, len(t) is 16.\n\nWait, len(s) is 11, len(s[k:]) is 11 -6 =5. So 11+5=16, which matches.\n\nSo t should be s + s[6:] → which is s followed by s starting at index 6, for 5 letters.\n\nIn this case, s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters). s[6:] is 'dabra'.\n\nSo the expected t is 'abrakadabrdabra'? Or wait, no: 'abrakadabra' + 'dabra' → 'abrakadabrdabra'? Or wait, the indexes:\n\ns is indices 0-10.\n\ns[6:] is 6,7,8,9,10 → letters 'd','a','b','r','a'.\n\nSo s + s[6:] is 'abrakadabra' + 'dabra' → 'abrakadabrdabra' which is 16 letters.\n\nBut the sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is longer than 16 letters. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe the sample input isn't matching my current test case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should proceed with code.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each possible m from (len(t)+1)//2 to len(t)-1:\n\n   compute k = 2m - len(t)\n\n   if k <1 or k >=m: continue\n\n   s = t[:m]\n\n   if t[m:] == s[k:]:\n\n       return YES and s.\n\nElse, after all m's, return NO.\n\nSo in code, for a given t, we can loop m from (len(t)+1)//2 to len(t)-1 inclusive.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: t is the same as two copies of s with no overlap. For example, t is 'abcabc' → according to the note, this is not considered an error. Because the error requires that the two messages were sent and then merged, but in this case, it's just two messages without any overlapping.\n\nWait, the note says that if the received message is 'abcabc', it should be considered as no error. Because it's just two messages without overlapping. So the algorithm should not consider this case as a possible error.\n\nSo for 'abcabc' (length 6), the possible m's are (6+1)/2=3.5 → m starts at 4, up to 5.\n\nFor m=4:\n\nk=8-6=2.\n\ns = t[:4] = 'abca'.\n\nt[m:] is t[4:] = 'bc'.\n\ns[k:] is s[2:] → 'ca'.\n\nSo 'bc' != 'ca' → invalid.\n\nFor m=5:\n\nk=10-6=4.\n\ns is 'abcab'.\n\nt[m:] is 'c'.\n\ns[4:] is 'b'.\n\nSo 'c' != 'b' → invalid.\n\nThus, no possible s, so output NO.\n\nWhich aligns with the note.\n\nAnother test case: the sample input 'acacacaca'.\n\nWait, the sample output is 'YES\\nacaca' and another option is 'acacaca'.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nt is 'acacacaca' → len(t)=9.\n\nPossible m's are (9+1)/2=5, so m from 5 to 8.\n\nFor m=5:\n\nk=10-9=1.\n\ns is 'acaca'.\n\nt[m:] is 'cacaca'.\n\ns[k:] is 'acaca'[1:] → 'caca'.\n\nCompare 'cacaca' vs 'caca' → 'cacaca' is longer, so no.\n\nFor m=6:\n\nk=12-9=3.\n\ns='acacac'.\n\nt[m:] is 'acaca'.\n\ns[3:] is 'cac'.\n\n'acaca' vs 'cac' → no.\n\nm=7:\n\nk=14-9=5.\n\ns is 'acacaca'.\n\nt[m:] is 'ca'.\n\ns[5:] is 'a'.\n\n'ca' vs 'a' → no.\n\nm=8:\n\nk=16-9=7.\n\ns is 'acacacac'.\n\nt[m:] is 'a'.\n\ns[7:] is 'ac'.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps for m=4, but no, m starts at 5.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try another approach.\n\nWait, the sample input is 'acacacaca', which is 9 letters.\n\nThe sample output suggests that s could be 'acaca' (5 letters) with k=1.\n\nBecause 'acaca' + 'acaca'[1:] → 'acaca' + 'caca' → 'acacacaca' which is 9 letters. So for m=5, k=1.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo the code would find m=5, k=1, and s is 'acaca', which is t[:5] = 'acaca'.\n\nt[m:] is t[5:] → 'caca'.\n\ns[k:] is 'acaca'[1:] → 'caca'.\n\nThey match. So the code would return YES and 'acaca'.\n\nSo the code should handle this correctly.\n\nAnother test case: 'tatbt'.\n\nThe output is NO.\n\nLet's see.\n\nlen(t)=5.\n\nm must be >= (5+1)/2=3, so m=3,4.\n\nFor m=3:\n\nk=6-5=1.\n\ns='tat'.\n\nt[m:] is 'bt'.\n\ns[k:] is 'at'[1:] → 't'.\n\nSo 'bt' != 't' → invalid.\n\nFor m=4:\n\nk=8-5=3.\n\ns='tatt' → wait, t[:4] is 'tatb'.\n\nt[m:] is 't'.\n\ns[k:] is 'tatb'[3:] → 'b'.\n\nSo 't' != 'b' → invalid.\n\nThus, no solution, output NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, let's think about some other cases.\n\nCase where t is s + s, but with maximum possible k.\n\nLike s='ab', t='abab' (k=1). So code should find m=2, k=2*2 -4=0 → invalid. So no.\n\nWait, but len(t) is 4, m can be from (4+1)/2=2.5 → m=3,4.\n\nFor m=3:\n\nk=6-4=2.\n\ns='aba'.\n\nt[m:] is 'b'.\n\ns[2:] is 'ba'[2:] → 'a'.\n\nSo 'b' != 'a' → invalid.\n\nFor m=4:\n\nk=8-4=4. Which is >=4 → invalid.\n\nThus, no solution. So the code returns NO, which is correct because t is simply two s's without any error.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, such cases are not considered errors. So the code correctly returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: t is 'abababab'.\n\nSample output is 'YES\\nababab'.\n\nLet's see.\n\nlen(t)=8.\n\nm must be >= (8+1)/2=4.5 → m=5,6,7.\n\nFor m=5:\n\nk=10-8=2.\n\ns is 'ababa'.\n\nt[m:] is 'babab'.\n\ns[k:] is 'ababa'[2:] → 'baba'.\n\nCompare 'babab' and 'baba' → no.\n\nm=6:\n\nk=12-8=4.\n\ns='ababab'.\n\nt[m:] is 'abab'.\n\ns[4:] is 'abab'.\n\nSo 'abab' == 'abab' → yes.\n\nThus, the code returns YES with s='ababab'.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the approach is solid.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nRead the input string.\n\nFor each m from (len(t)+1)//2 to len(t)-1:\n\n   k = 2 * m - len(t)\n\n   if k <1 or k >=m: continue\n\n   s = t[:m]\n\n   suffix = t[m:]\n\n   if suffix == s[k:]:\n\n       print(\"YES\")\n\n       print(s)\n\n       exit()\n\nAfter all m's:\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, testing for various edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: t is empty. But according to the input, t is non-empty, so we don't need to handle this.\n\nEdge case 2: t has length 2. So m must be (2+1)/2=1.5 → m=2 (since 2 is len(t)-1=1, wait, no. Wait, len(t)=2, len(t)-1 is 1. So m can't be 2. So m can be 2? Or wait, len(t) is 2, so m must be >= (2+1)/2=1.5 → m starts at 2, but len(t)-1 is 1, so no possible m. So output is NO.\n\nAnother edge case: t is length 3.\n\nm must be >= 2, up to 2.\n\nSo m=2.\n\nk=4-3=1.\n\ns = t[:2].\n\nsuffix is t[2:] → one character.\n\nCheck if suffix equals s[1:].\n\nFor example, t='aaa'.\n\nm=2, k=1.\n\ns='aa'.\n\nsuffix is 'a'.\n\ns[1:] is 'a' → matches.\n\nThus, output is YES and 'aa'.\n\nAnother example: t='aabbaa'.\n\nWait, len(t)=6.\n\nm can be from 4 to 5.\n\nFor m=4:\n\nk=8-6=2.\n\ns='aabb'.\n\nsuffix is 'aa'.\n\ns[2:] is 'bb'.\n\nNo match.\n\nFor m=5:\n\nk=10-6=4.\n\ns='aabba'.\n\nsuffix is 'a'.\n\ns[4:] is 'a'.\n\nSo 'a' == 'a' → yes.\n\nSo output is YES and 'aabba'.\n\nNow, implementing this.\n\nSo the code will be:\n\nRead t.\n\nfor m in range((len(t)+1)//2, len(t)):\n\n    k = 2 * m - len(t)\n\n    if k < 1 or k >= m:\n\n        continue\n\n    s = t[:m]\n\n    suffix = t[m:]\n\n    if suffix == s[k:]:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n        print(s)\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n\nWait, wait, in Python, the range is exclusive on the upper bound. So in the code, for m in range(a, b), m takes a, a+1, ..., b-1.\n\nSo for len(t) =n, the upper limit is len(t)-1.\n\nBut in the code, the range is ((len(t)+1)//2, len(t)), which includes m up to len(t)-1.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\nWait, for the second input 'acacacaca' which is 9 letters.\n\nm ranges from 5 to 8.\n\nAt m=5:\n\nk=10-9=1.\n\ns = 'acaca'.\n\nsuffix is 'cacaca'.\n\ns[k:] is 'acaca'[1:] → 'caca'.\n\nSo 'cacaca' == 'caca'? No.\n\nBut for m=5, the code continues.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, the correct s is 'acaca' with m=5.\n\nWait, why? Because t is 'acacacaca'.\n\nt[:5] is 'acaca'.\n\nt[5:] is 'cacaca'.\n\ns[k:] is 'acaca'[1:] → 'caca'.\n\nSo 'cacaca' != 'caca' → code would not accept.\n\nBut the sample output says it's a possible solution. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, wait in the sample input, the second input is 'acacacaca', which is 9 letters.\n\nWait, the correct s is 'acaca' (5 letters), and t is 'acacacaca'.\n\nBut according to the code, m=5:\n\nt[:5] is 'acaca'.\n\nt[5:] is 'cacaca'.\n\ns[k:] is 'acaca'[1:] → 'caca'.\n\nSo 'cacaca' is 5 letters, 'caca' is 4 letters. So they can't be equal.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So why in the sample, 'acacacaca' is considered a YES with s 'acaca'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, t is 'acacacaca' → letters are a c a c a c a c a.\n\nSo len(t)=9.\n\nm=5: s is 'acaca'.\n\nt[m:] is 'cacaca'.\n\ns[k:] for k=1 is 'caca'.\n\nSo 'cacaca' is 5 letters, 'caca' is 4 letters. They can't be equal.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the code as written wouldn't find this case, but the sample expects it as a solution.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the sample input says that the second input is 'acacacaca', which outputs 'YES\\nacaca'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the len(t).\n\nWait, 'acacacaca' → let's count letters:\n\nLetters are a c a c a c a c a → that's 9 letters.\n\nSo m=5.\n\nk=2*5 -9 =10-9=1.\n\nSo s is 'acaca'.\n\nt[m:] is 'cacaca'.\n\ns[k:] is 'acaca'[1:] → 'c a c a' → 'caca'.\n\nWait, 'cacaca' is 5 letters, 'caca' is 4 letters. So they can't match.\n\nBut the sample expects that this is a solution. So perhaps the code is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should allow for k to be zero? Or perhaps I'm missing a possibility.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the required k.\n\nWait, the formula is k=2m - len(t).\n\nIn this case, len(t)=9, m=5 → k=10-9=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut then s is 'acaca' (5 letters), t[m:] is 'cacaca' (5 letters), s[k:] is 'caca' (4 letters).\n\nSo 'cacaca' != 'caca' → thus, the code would not accept this.\n\nBut the sample expects it as a solution.\n\nHmm, this suggests that perhaps the initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the way the messages are merged.\n\nWait, when two messages s are sent, the first is s, the second is s. Then, during transmission, they are merged by overlapping as much as possible. So the result is s + s[k:], where k is the maximum possible. Or is it any possible k?\n\nWait, no, the problem statement says that when two messages are sent, the result is that the end of the first coincides with the beginning of the second. So the number of overlapping characters k can be any value from 1 to len(s)-1.\n\nSo in the case where s is 'acaca', and two such messages are sent, the resulting t could be 'acaca' + 'acaca'[k:] for any k >=1.\n\nSo for the sample input 'acacacaca', which is 9 letters, it's possible that k=1, and s is 'acaca'.\n\nThen, t would be 'acaca' + 'acaca'[1:] → 'acaca' + 'caca' → 'acacacaca' which is 5+4=9 letters. So yes, it matches.\n\nThus, the code is correct, but in the sample input, the string is 'acacacaca' which is 9 letters.\n\nWait, but wait: 'acaca' is 5 letters, so 'acaca' + 'caca' is 5+4=9 letters, which is 'acacacaca'.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo why did I think that 'acacacaca' is 9 letters? Let's count:\n\na c a c a c a c a → that's 9 letters. So the code would find m=5, k=1, s='acaca', and t[m:] is 'cacaca' which is 5 letters. Wait, but 'acaca'[1:] is 'c a c a' → 'caca' which is 4 letters. So 'cacaca' is 5 letters, which doesn't match 'caca'.\n\nWait, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the code.\n\nWait, no. Because in the case where m=5, len(t)=9.\n\nSo t[:5] is 'acaca'.\n\nt[5:] is 'cacaca' (positions 5-9).\n\ns[k:] is s[1:] → 'caca'.\n\nSo 'caca' is 4 letters, while t[m:] is 5 letters. Thus, they can't be equal.\n\nThis suggests that the sample is wrong, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the letters in the sample.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is 'acacacaca' which is 9 letters.\n\nBut according to the code, for m=5, t[m:] is 'cacaca' which is 5 letters.\n\ns[k:] is 'caca' which is 4 letters. So they can't match.\n\nThus, the code would not find this case, but the sample expects it.\n\nSo perhaps there's a bug in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is incorrect in how it handles the split.\n\nWait, perhaps the way t is constructed is s + s[k:].\n\nBut perhaps the split is done differently. For example, t could be s concatenated with s starting at k, but not necessarily taking the entire s[k:].\n\nWait, no, because the problem states that the entire second message is merged.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that the two messages are sent, and then the error causes them to be merged as much as possible. So the result is s followed by s[k:], for some k.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nBut the sample seems to suggest that in the case of 'acacacaca' (9 letters), the code finds s='acaca' with k=4.\n\nWait, let's try m=5, k=1: no.\n\nWhat about m=4?\n\nWait, but m must be >= (9+1)/2=5.\n\nSo m can't be 4.\n\nThus, in the code, the sample input 'acacacaca' would not be found.\n\nBut according to the sample output, it is considered a solution.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is 'acacacaca', which is 9 letters.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the correct s is 'acaca'.\n\nBut according to the code, for m=5, k=1, the t[m:] is 'cacaca' which is 5 letters, and s[k:] is 'caca' which is 4 letters. So it's a mismatch.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the sample output says that the correct s is 'acaca'.\n\nSo perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is supposed to find s such that t is s + s, but with any possible k.\n\nWait, but the problem states that t must be the result of two messages being merged by overlapping k characters.\n\nSo in the sample, t is 'acacacaca'.\n\nWhich is 9 letters.\n\nSo perhaps s is 'acaca' (5 letters).\n\nThen, t is s + s[1:] → 'acaca' + 'caca' → 'acacacaca' (9 letters).\n\nThus, in this case, m=5, k=1.\n\nSo the code should detect this.\n\nBut according to the code, t[m:] is 5 letters, and s[k:] is 4 letters.\n\nSo they can't be equal.\n\nThus, the code would not find this case, but according to the sample, it is a solution.\n\nThis suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is incorrect in how it slices the string.\n\nWait, len(t) is 9.\n\nm=5 → t[:5] is 'acaca' (indices 0-4).\n\nt[5:] is 'cacaca' (indices 5-8), which is 4 letters.\n\nWait, no, 5 to 8 inclusive is 4 letters, but in Python, t[5:] gives 5,6,7,8 → 4 letters.\n\nWait, no, t[m:] is t[5:], which is from index 5 to the end, which is 4 letters.\n\nBut s[k:] is s[1:], which is 4 letters.\n\nSo t[m:] is 4 letters, and s[k:] is 4 letters.\n\nSo comparing 'cac a' (wait, 'c a c a c a' → no, wait, t is 'acacacaca', indices 5-8 are 'a c a c a' ?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's write the string:\n\nIndices: 0:a,1:c,2:a,3:c,4:a,5:c,6:a,7:c,8:a.\n\nSo t is 'a c a c a c a c a'.\n\nt[:5] is indices 0-4 → 'a c a c a' → 'acaca'.\n\nt[5:] is indices 5-8 → 'c a c a' → 'caca'.\n\ns[k:] is s[1:] → 'c a c a' → 'caca'.\n\nThus, t[m:] is 'caca' and s[k:] is 'caca' → they are equal.\n\nThus, the code would find this case.\n\nAh! So I made a mistake earlier. Because in the code, t[m:] is t[5:], which is 4 letters, and s[k:] is s[1:], which is 4 letters. So they are equal.\n\nThus, the code would find this case and output 'acaca'.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo in the code, for the second sample input, the code would find m=5, k=1, and s='acaca' as a solution.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code should work for all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have resulted from an error in message transmission between servers. The error occurs when two identical messages are sent consecutively and merged by overlapping as much as possible. Our task is to check if the given string can be formed by such a merge and, if so, find one possible original message.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Error**: When two identical messages `s` are sent consecutively, they might be merged by overlapping `k` characters, resulting in a string `t` that is `s` concatenated with a suffix of `s` starting from index `k`. Thus, `t` can be expressed as `s + s[k:]`.\n\n2. **Constraints on k**: The value of `k` must be at least 1 and less than the length of `s` (denoted as `m`). Therefore, for a given `t`, we need to check possible values of `m` (length of `s`) and corresponding `k` to see if `t` can be split into `s` followed by `s[k:]`.\n\n3. **Iterating Over Possible Lengths**: For each possible length `m` of `s`, we compute `k` as `2 * m - len(t)`. If `k` is valid (i.e., between 1 and `m-1`), we check if the substring of `t` from `m` onwards matches the substring of `s` starting from `k`.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: We handle edge cases where the string might not be the result of such an error by ensuring `m` starts from a reasonable lower bound derived from the length of `t`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\n\nn = len(t)\nfound = False\n\nfor m in range((n + 1) // 2, n):\n    k = 2 * m - n\n    if k < 1 or k >= m:\n        continue\n    s = t[:m]\n    suffix = t[m:]\n    if suffix == s[k:]:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(s)\n        found = True\n        break\n\nif not found:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string `t` is read and its length `n` is determined.\n2. **Loop Over Possible Lengths**: For each possible length `m` of the original message `s`, starting from `(n + 1) // 2` up to `n - 1`, we compute `k`.\n3. **Check Validity of k**: Ensure `k` is within the valid range (1 to `m-1`). If not, skip to the next possible `m`.\n4. **Construct Candidate Message**: Form the candidate message `s` from the first `m` characters of `t` and check if the remaining part of `t` matches the suffix of `s` starting from `k`.\n5. **Output Result**: If a valid `s` is found, print \"YES\" followed by `s`. If no valid `s` is found after all iterations, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways the string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages, ensuring correctness and handling edge cases appropriately.",
