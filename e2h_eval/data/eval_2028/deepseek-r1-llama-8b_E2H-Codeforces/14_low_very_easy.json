He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about finding the number of positive integers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeros. And then I have to output all those n's in increasing order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n, because there are usually more 2s than 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is sum of n divided by 5, plus n divided by 25, and so on until n divided by 5^k is zero.\n\nSo, for example, for n=5: 5//5 =1, 5//25=0. So total is 1. For n=6, same as 5, since 6//5 is 1. Wait no, wait, 6//5 is 1, yes. So 6! has one trailing zero.\n\nWait, but in the sample input given, when m is 1, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. Because each of these numbers adds a new 5 factor only at 5, but for 6,7,8,9, the count remains 1 until 10, which would add another.\n\nWait, let's think again. For n from 5 to 9:\n\nn=5: 5/5 =1 → 1 zero.\nn=6: 6/5=1 → 1.\nn=7: same.\nn=8: same.\nn=9: same.\nn=10: 10/5=2, 10/25=0 → 2 zeros.\n\nSo yeah, for m=1, the possible n's are 5,6,7,8,9. So the count is 5, and the output is 5 followed by these numbers.\n\nSo the approach is to find all n where the number of trailing zeros equals m.\n\nHow do I find the range of n that satisfy this condition?\n\nI think I can use binary search to find the smallest n where the number of trailing zeros is >=m, and the largest n where it's <=m. Then all the n's between them (inclusive) will be the solution.\n\nWait, but wait: the function of trailing zeros is non-decreasing as n increases. Because adding a higher number can't reduce the count. So once you pass a certain n, the count doesn't decrease.\n\nSo for a given m, there might be a range of n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. If the next number after n has a higher count, then the current n is part of the solution.\n\nBut how do I find the lower and upper bounds?\n\nLet me think of the process:\n\n1. Find the smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n) == m.\n2. Find the largest n such that trailing_zeros(n) == m.\n3. All n's from the smallest to largest inclusive are the solutions.\n\nBut how do I compute that? Maybe using binary search.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the minimal n where trailing zeros is >=m, and the minimal n where trailing zeros is >m. Then the first n is the starting point, and the second n is the end. So the count is second - first.\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nSo for example, for m=1:\n\n- The minimal n where trailing zeros is >=1 is 5.\n- The minimal n where trailing zeros is >1 is 10.\n\nSo the numbers from 5 to 9 are the answers.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\n- Use binary search to find the lower bound (first occurrence of >=m).\n- Use binary search to find the upper bound (first occurrence of >m).\n- Then the numbers from lower to upper-1 are the solutions.\n\nSo now, the steps are:\n\na) Implement a function to calculate the number of trailing zeros for a given n.\n\nThat function is straightforward: sum n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ... until the division is zero.\n\nb) Implement binary search for lower bound.\n\nWait, but binary search for the lower bound. How?\n\nBecause the trailing zeros function is strictly increasing as n increases.\n\nWait, no. It's non-decreasing. It can stay the same for consecutive n's.\n\nFor example, 5 and 6 have the same trailing zeros.\n\nSo for binary search, when looking for the first occurrence of a trailing zero count >=m, we can adjust accordingly.\n\nSimilarly for the upper bound.\n\nLet's think about how to implement the binary search for the lower bound.\n\nWe need to find the smallest n where trailing_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nThe initial low can be 0, high can be something like m*5, which is an upper estimate. But maybe we can set high to m *5, or even m*5 squared, but",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list all such integers \\( n \\) in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(n) = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5^i} \\right\\rfloor\n   \\]\n   where \\( 5^i \\) continues until \\( 5^i > n \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently find the range of \\( n \\) values that yield exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros, we use binary search:\n   - **Lower Bound**: Find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\).\n   - **Upper Bound**: Find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeros exceeds \\( m \\). The range of valid \\( n \\) values will be between these two bounds.\n\n3. **Generate Results**: Once the bounds are found, the valid \\( n \\) values are all integers from the lower bound to one less than the upper bound.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_lower_bound(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m  # Initial estimate, could be adjusted if necessary\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef find_upper_bound(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m  # Initial estimate\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) > m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\nif m == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    lower = find_lower_bound(m)\n    upper = find_upper_bound(m)\n    result = list(range(lower, upper))\n    print(len(result))\n    if result:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n    else:\n        print()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function `count_trailing_zeros`**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by summing up the contributions from each power of 5.\n\n2. **Binary Search Functions**: \n   - `find_lower_bound(m)` searches for the smallest \\( n \\) where the number of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\).\n   - `find_upper_bound(m)` searches for the smallest \\( n \\) where the number of trailing zeros exceeds \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Main Logic**: After determining the lower and upper bounds, the valid \\( n \\) values are generated and printed. If no such \\( n \\) exists, the output is adjusted accordingly.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring the solution is both optimal and easy to understand.",
