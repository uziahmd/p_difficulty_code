    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Golden Plate,\" and from the description, I need to calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding k rings of gilding.\n\nHmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully. Oh right, each ring is formed by the perimeter of a rectangle that's progressively smaller. The first ring is along the edge, then the next is two cells in, and so on. Each ring is one cell thick.\n\nSo the input gives me w (width), h (height), and k (number of rings). My task is to compute the total number of gilded cells.\n\nLet me think about how to model each ring. For each i-th ring (starting from 1 to k), the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)). Because each ring reduces both width and height by 4 each time? Wait, no—wait, because each ring is two cells away from the previous, which would subtract 2 from each side, so 4 in total for both left and right, and top and bottom. So yeah, each step reduces the size by 4 in each dimension.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify: for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). So for i=1, it's w x h, which is the outermost ring. For i=2, it's (w-4) x (h-4), which is two cells inside on each side. That makes sense.\n\nNow, for each such rectangle, the number of cells in the ring is the perimeter minus the four corners since they'd be counted twice if we just multiply 2*(w + h) but that includes the four corners twice. Or wait, no—the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(w + h - 2), because each side has (length - 1) * 2 (top and bottom) plus the other sides. Wait, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, for a rectangle of size m x n, the perimeter in terms of cells is 2*(m + n - 2). Because each row contributes (n) cells, but the corners are shared with the columns. Wait, perhaps another approach: the perimeter is the sum of all the edges minus the overlaps at the corners.\n\nFor example, a 3x3 grid: perimeter is 3*4 = 12, but wait, that's not correct because each cell is only one. Wait, no, wait. No, the number of cells on the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(width + height - 2). Because for each of the four sides, you have (width for top and bottom, height for left and right), but subtracting 2 because the four corners are each counted twice. Let me test this formula.\n\nTake 3x3: 2*(3+3-2) = 2*(4) = 8. Which matches the first example where the output is 8. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother example: 7x9. For k=1, the perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the second example's output when k=1.\n\nSo, the formula for the number of cells in the i-th ring is 2*( (current_w) + (current_h) - 2 ), where current_w = w - 4*(i-1) and current_h = h -4*(i-1).\n\nBut wait, for each i, we need to make sure that current_w and current_h are at least 3, otherwise the ring wouldn't exist. Because each ring must form a valid rectangle, meaning that the inner dimensions must be >= 3 (since each ring is 1 cell thick, and the minimum is 3x3 for the first ring). Wait, but according to the problem statement, the constraints on k are such that it won't go beyond what's possible. So I don't need to worry about invalid cases; the code can assume that for each i up to k, current_w and current_h are at least 3.\n\nSo the plan is: loop from i=1 to i=k, calculate the perimeter for each ring, sum them all.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read w, h, k from input.\n2. Initialize total = 0\n3. For each i in 1..k:\n   a. Compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n   c. Compute perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n   d. Add perimeter to total\n4. Output total\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me test with the third example, which is 7 9 2.\n\nFirst ring (i=1): 7 and 9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2)= 2*14=28.\n\nSecond ring (i=2): current_w =7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2)=2*6=12. So total is 28+12=40, which matches the sample.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother test case: when w=3, h=3, k=1. The perimeter is 8 as per the first sample.\n\nWhat about when k is larger than possible? Well, according to the problem statement, k is given within the constraints, so we don't need to handle that.\n\nSo now, the code structure is straightforward.\n\nIn Python, I'll read the input line, split into three integers. Then loop from 1 to k inclusive, compute each term and sum.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    cw = w - 4*(i-1)\n    ch = h -4*(i-1)\n    perim = 2*(cw + ch - 2)\n    total += perim\nprint(total)\n\nThat's simple enough.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\nFirst example: 3 3 1 → 8.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1 →28.\n\nThird example:7 9 2 →40.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about another case, say w=5, h=5, k=2.\n\nFirst ring: 5x5 → perim 2*(5+5-2)=16.\n\nSecond ring: 5-4=1 → but wait, that's 1 cell wide. Wait, but the problem says that each ring is one cell thick. So, wait, the inner rectangle must have at least 3 cells in each dimension, right? Because the first ring is 3x3. So if w=5 and h=5, then for i=2, the dimensions are 1x1, which is a single cell. But that's not a valid ring, as the perimeter would be zero?\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the constraints ensure that k is such that all rings are possible. So for w=5, h=5, the maximum possible k is floor( min(5,5)/4 ) +1? Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, the note says: 1 ≤ k ≤ floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). So for w=5, h=5, min is 5. (5+1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can only be 1.\n\nSo in the code, for any k beyond the allowed, it's not passed as input. So our code doesn't need to handle cases where cw or ch become less than 3.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nAnother test: w=11, h=7, k=3.\n\ni=1: 11x7 → 2*(11+7-2) = 2*16=32.\n\ni=2: 11-4=7, 7-4=3 → 7x3 → 2*(7+3-2)= 2*8=16. Total now 48.\n\ni=3: 11-8=3, 7-8= -1 → wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait for i=3, cw =11-4*(3-1)=11-8=3, ch=7-4*(3-1)=7-8=-1. Oh no, that's negative. But according to the problem statement, k is constrained so that this doesn't happen.\n\nSo the code can proceed without worrying about that.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding k rings of gilding. Each ring is formed by the perimeter of an increasingly smaller rectangle inside the plate.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each ring is formed by the perimeter of a rectangle that is 2 cells away from the edge of the previous ring. The i-th ring will have a width and height reduced by 4 cells each (since each side is reduced by 2 cells on both ends).\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells can be calculated using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is \\(2 \\times (width + height - 2)\\). This accounts for all the cells along the border without double-counting the corners.\n3. **Summing Up**: We sum the number of gilded cells for each of the k rings starting from the outermost ring to the innermost possible ring based on the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers representing the width (w), height (h), and the number of rings (k).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, calculate the current width and height by reducing the original dimensions by 4 cells for each subsequent ring.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each ring, compute the perimeter using the formula and add it to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells after processing all k rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by iterating through each ring and summing up the perimeters, ensuring that all edge cases are handled within the given constraints.",
