He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about finding the number of positive integers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeros. And then I have to output all those n's in increasing order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n, because there are usually more 2s than 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is sum of n divided by 5, plus n divided by 25, and so on until n divided by 5^k is zero.\n\nSo, for example, for n=5: 5//5 =1, 5//25=0. So total is 1. For n=6, same as 5, since 6//5 is 1, 6//25 is 0. So 1 trailing zero. But wait, 5! is 120, which has one zero, 6! is 720, also one. Oh right, but when does the count increase?\n\nLike, 24 is 4*5 + 4, so 24//5 is 4, 24//25 is 0. Total 4. 25//5 is 5, 25//25 is 1. So 5+1=6. So 25! has 6 trailing zeros.\n\nWait, but the problem is not just to find the count but to find all n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. So the task is, given m, find all n where the count is equal to m.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Well, I think the key is to find the minimal n that gives exactly m zeros, and then find the next numbers that also give m zeros. But how?\n\nI remember that for a given m, there might be a range of n's where the count remains m. Like, for example, when m is 5, the sample says the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. Because 5! has 1 zero, but wait no. Wait the sample input was 1, and the output was 5, meaning 5! has 1 zero. So maybe I'm mixing something up.\n\nWait the sample input is 1, and the output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. Wait, no, wait the sample input given in the problem is written as ['1', '5'], but the output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'], which I think is a typo. Or maybe the sample is from another problem. Anyway, perhaps the point is that for certain m, there can be a consecutive range of n's that give the same trailing zero count.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Find the smallest n such that the trailing zeros of n! is exactly m.\n2. Then find the largest n such that trailing zeros is exactly m.\n3. If the smallest and largest are the same, then there's only one n.\n4. Otherwise, all n's from smallest to largest inclusive are part of the solution.\n\nSo how do I find the smallest and largest n for a given m?\n\nFor the smallest n, we can perform a binary search. Because as n increases, the number of trailing zeros increases, but sometimes jumps by multiple steps. So binary search can efficiently find the minimal n where the trailing zeros equal m.\n\nSimilarly, the largest n would be the maximum n where the trailing zeros equal m. But wait, after that, the next n will have more zeros. So the largest n is the one before that.\n\nWait, but how to find the upper bound?\n\nAlternatively, once we find the minimal n_min where the count is m, the maximum n_max is the minimal n where the count is m+1 minus one. Because between n_min and n_max, the count remains m.\n\nSo for example, if for some m, n starts at x and ends at y, then for x <= n <= y, n! has exactly m zeros.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Use binary search to find the smallest n where count(n) = m. Let's call this low.\n- Then find the smallest n where count(n) > m. Let's call this high.\n- Then the range is from low to high - 1. So the number of n's is high - low.\n- If the count(low) is not m, then there's no solution, so output 0.\n\nWait, but how to implement this.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, write a helper function to compute the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nYes",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list all such integers \\( n \\) in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{count} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division results in zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently find the range of \\( n \\) values that produce exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros, we use binary search:\n   - **Lower Bound**: Find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly \\( m \\).\n   - **Upper Bound**: Find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the count of trailing zeros exceeds \\( m \\). The largest valid \\( n \\) will be one less than this upper bound.\n\n3. **Determine the Range**: Once the lower and upper bounds are found, all integers between these bounds (inclusive) will have exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros in their factorial.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m  # Initial estimate, could be adjusted if necessary\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        current = count_zeros(mid)\n        if current < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    # Now low is the minimal n where count is >= m\n    if count_zeros(low) != m:\n        return None  # No solution exists\n    return low\n\ndef find_max_n(m):\n    if m == 0:\n        return 0  # Only 0! has 0 zeros, but n must be positive\n    low = 5 * m\n    high = 5 * (m + 1)\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        current = count_zeros(mid)\n        if current <= m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    # After loop, low is the first n with count > m\n    return low - 1\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m = int(input_line)\n    \n    min_n = find_min_n(m)\n    if min_n is None:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    max_n = find_max_n(m)\n    \n    if max_n < min_n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    k = max_n - min_n + 1\n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(min_n, max_n + 1))))\n    else:\n        print()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Helper Function**: `count_zeros(n)` calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by summing the contributions of multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc.\n2. **Binary Search for Minimum \\( n \\)**: `find_min_n(m)` uses binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros.\n3. **Binary Search for Maximum \\( n \\)**: `find_max_n(m)` finds the largest \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros by searching for the point where the count exceeds \\( m \\).\n4. **Main Function**: Reads the input, determines the range of valid \\( n \\) values, and prints the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring that the solution is both optimal and handles edge cases correctly.",
