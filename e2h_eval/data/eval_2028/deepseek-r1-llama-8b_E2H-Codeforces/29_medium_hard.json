Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem statement says that Andrew and Eugene are playing a game where they manipulate a string of digits through a series of substitution queries. After processing all the queries, we need to compute the resulting number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nHmm. So the initial string is s, and each query is of the form di → ti. This means that every occurrence of digit di in the current string is replaced by ti. For example, if s is '123123' and the query is '2→00', then replacing '2's with '00' gives '10031003'. Another example: if the query is '3→', then all '3's are removed, turning '123123' into '1212'.\n\nOur task is to process all these substitutions in the given order and then compute the numerical value of the resulting string modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but how do we handle the substitutions efficiently? Since each substitution could potentially change multiple digits, and the order matters because each substitution affects the next. We can't just apply them in any order; we have to process them as given.\n\nLet me think about the data structures involved here. The key is to represent the transformations in a way that allows us to process each digit in the string according to the current rules.\n\nAn approach that comes to mind is to use a dictionary that maps each digit to its replacement string. But since substitutions can overwrite each other, we need to process the queries in reverse order. Wait, no—wait, the queries are applied in the order they are given. So the first query is processed first, then the second, and so on. Each substitution affects the string as it exists at that moment.\n\nWait, but if we process the substitutions in the given order, each time modifying the string, that could be computationally expensive for large strings. But considering the constraints: the initial string has up to 105 characters, and each substitution's ti can be up to 105 in total across all queries. So for n up to 105, the maximum possible substitutions are manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Because each substitution is a mapping from a specific digit to a string, the problem might be able to be modeled using dynamic programming or some kind of substitution graph.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For each digit d, we can precompute what it would be replaced with after all the queries. But wait, no—because each query is applied in sequence, and each one may change the digits in the string. So the order of the queries is crucial. So, for example, if the first query replaces '2's with 'a's, and the second replaces 'a's with 'b's, then the final result is that '2's become 'b's.\n\nSo the way to model this is to create a substitution map that, for each digit, tells us what it will be replaced with after all the queries. But since the queries are applied in order, each substitution can affect the subsequent ones.\n\nWait, but when you process a substitution, it's modifying the current state of the string. So the substitution for 'd' is dependent on the previous substitutions. Hmm, maybe not directly. Maybe the substitution for each digit can be determined by processing the queries in order, and for each digit, track what it gets replaced with.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can build a substitution function where, for each digit, we determine what it would expand to after all the queries. But since the queries are applied in order, the substitution for a digit depends on all the substitutions that come after it.\n\nWait, let's think about the substitution process step by step. Initially, each digit is present in the string. Then, each query replaces occurrences of di with ti. So for example:\n\n- The first query replaces 'd1' with t1.\n- The second query replaces 'd2' with t2, but if t1 contains 'd2', then after the first substitution, those 'd2's are now part of the string and will be replaced in the second step.\n\nSo to model this correctly, we need to process the substitutions in the given order, and for each substitution, replace all instances of di in the current string with ti.\n\nBut how do we do this efficiently without having to modify the string each time, especially since the substitutions could be many and the string can get quite long?\n\nAn alternative approach is to represent the substitutions as a function that transforms each character in the initial string into another string, considering all the queries that have been applied up to that point.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to go is to model the substitutions as a series of mappings. We can process each query in the given order and update our substitution rules accordingly.\n\nFor example, each query is a rule that says: whenever you encounter 'd', replace it with 't'. But if a later query says to replace 'd' again, then the latest rule takes precedence.\n\nWait, no. Because the queries are applied in order. So the first substitution is applied, then the next. So suppose we have two substitutions: first, replace 'a' with 'b', then replace 'b' with 'c'. So in the initial string, 'a's become 'b's, which are then replaced with 'c's. So the overall effect is that 'a's become 'c's.\n\nSo each substitution potentially changes the mapping for certain digits.\n\nHmm, but how can we model this efficiently? Maybe for each digit, we can track what it gets replaced with after all the substitutions. But since substitutions are done in order, the later substitutions can override earlier ones for certain digits.\n\nWait, no. Because each substitution replaces a particular digit with a string, which may contain other digits. So the substitution of a digit is based on the current state of the substitution rules, not just the initial rules.\n\nThis suggests that the substitution for each digit is built incrementally as each query is processed.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this with a function that, given a digit, returns the string it should be replaced with. But the function can be built dynamically as we process each query.\n\nYes! That makes sense. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Start with an empty substitution map, which initially maps each digit to itself.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial string is s, and each query modifies it. So for each query, we process it by replacing all occurrences of di in the current string with ti.\n\nBut building a substitution map that represents the final transformation for each digit seems tricky because each substitution can depend on prior substitutions.\n\nWait, perhaps we can represent the substitution rules as a dictionary where for each digit d, we have a function that returns the string that d is replaced with. Then, each time a new query comes in (di → ti), we check if di is already in the substitution map. If it is, we replace it with the new ti. Otherwise, we add it. But wait, no—because ti might include other digits that have their own substitution rules. So perhaps the substitution for di is actually the ti string, but any digits in ti would be substituted according to the current substitution rules.\n\nWait, that sounds like a recursive approach. So for example, if di is replaced by ti, which contains dj, and dj is replaced by tj, etc. So each substitution can refer to other substitutions.\n\nSo, to model this, we can have a dictionary called 'substitutions' where each key is a digit, and the value is the string it is replaced with. When processing a new query di → ti, we simply set substitutions[di] = ti. But when we later need to find out what a certain digit expands to, we must recursively substitute any digits within the expansion.\n\nWait, but that's not efficient if we're doing it each time. Alternatively, perhaps during the processing of the substitutions, we can precompute for each digit what it ultimately expands to, taking into account all the substitutions.\n\nWait, but the substitutions are processed in order, so each new substitution can override a previous one. So for each query, we can build a substitution map that represents what each digit is replaced with, considering all the substitutions up to that point.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to process all queries first, and for each digit, determine what it's replaced with after all queries.\n\nBut that's not possible because each substitution depends on the state of the string after previous substitutions. For example, the first substitution replaces 'a' with 'b', and the second substitution replaces 'b' with 'c'. So the overall effect is that 'a' becomes 'c'. But if the first substitution was 'a' → 'b', and the second was 'b' → 'a', then 'a' would become 'a' again.\n\nSo, the substitution for 'a' depends on all the queries that are applied after it.\n\nTherefore, the substitution for each digit must be determined by the entire list of queries, but in the order they are applied.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to model the substitution as a function that, for each digit, returns the string it is replaced with, considering all the substitutions in the order they are applied.\n\nSo, let's say we have a function f(d) that returns the string that digit d is replaced with.\n\nInitially, f(d) = d for all d.\n\nThen, for each query in the order given:\n\n- For the current query di → ti:\n   - For any existing mapping for di, we replace it with ti.\n   - Also, if ti contains other digits, those digits will be substituted according to the current f() function.\n\nWait, but no—ti is a string that may contain digits, and those digits should be substituted according to the current substitution rules. So for example, if di is '2' and ti is '34', then each '3' in ti would be substituted with f('3'), which could be another string.\n\nSo, the substitution for di is ti, but any digits inside ti are further substituted according to the current substitution rules.\n\nSo, the way to model this is to, for each query, update the substitution map for di to be ti, but ensuring that any digits in ti are themselves substituted as per their current substitution rules.\n\nWait, but that's not straightforward. Because when we process a query, the ti string is treated as a literal, except that any digits in it are expanded according to the substitution rules at that point.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to represent the substitution for each digit as a string that is built by expanding all the substitutions at once.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each digit, we can keep a list of substitution rules, and each time a query is processed, the substitution for di is updated. Then, when we need to find the expansion of a digit, we follow the substitution chain until we reach a digit that hasn't been substituted.\n\nWait, that sounds like a linked list approach. Each digit points to the string it's replaced with, which in turn may contain other digits, which also point to their substitution strings.\n\nBut this could lead to infinite loops if substitutions reference each other. For example, if a substitution for 'a' is 'b', and substitution for 'b' is 'a', then trying to expand 'a' would loop infinitely.\n\nHmm, but in the problem statement, each substitution is di → ti, which is a string that can be empty. So such a case is possible, and the program must handle it. But in practice, the code needs to detect such cycles and prevent infinite loops.\n\nWait, but how often would that happen? It's possible, but perhaps the code can process each substitution carefully to avoid infinite recursion.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. For each digit d in '0'-'9', we maintain a substitution function f(d) which returns the string that d is replaced with.\n\n2. Initialize f(d) = d for all d.\n\n3. For each query in order:\n\n   a. Extract di and ti from the query.\n\n   b. Replace the current substitution for di with ti. So, f(di) = ti.\n\n4. Once all queries are processed, for each digit in the initial string, we need to expand it according to f(), recursively substituting any digits within the substitution string.\n\nWait, but wait—this only captures the substitution rules as they are after all queries. But in reality, the substitution is applied in order. So the first substitution may change certain digits, which are then subject to the next substitution, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach isn't sufficient because the substitution rules are built incrementally, and each substitution can only replace di with ti, regardless of any other rules. So, for example, if a substitution is made for di, and ti includes a dj that hasn't been substituted yet, the substitution for di would include dj as it is, not according to any future substitutions.\n\nNo, that's not correct. Because the substitution of di is applied before any other substitutions that come after it. So, the substitution of di is based on the current state of the substitution rules at the time of the query.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to model the substitution as a function that, given a digit, returns the string it's replaced with, considering all the substitutions that have been processed up to that point.\n\nSo, for each query, when we process di → ti, we are setting f(di) = ti. Any digits in ti will be substituted according to the current f() function when the substitution is applied.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure that when we process a substitution, the ti string is expanded according to the substitution rules that exist at that moment.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to process each query and, for each di in the query, replace it with ti, but any digits in ti are themselves substituted according to the substitution rules as they are at the time of the query.\n\nWait, but that's not feasible because ti can be a string that includes digits that haven't been substituted yet.\n\nWait, perhaps we can represent the substitution function f as a function that, for each digit, returns the string that it is replaced with, and when a substitution is made, it's possible that ti contains digits that themselves are to be substituted.\n\nSo, for example, when a query di → ti is processed, we set f(di) = ti. But then, any digits in ti will be substituted according to their current f() value.\n\nWait, but this would require that whenever we use a substitution, we recursively expand any digits in the substitution string.\n\nSo, perhaps for each substitution, when we process a query, we don't just set f(di) = ti, but also process ti to expand any digits, using the current substitution rules.\n\nBut that's not correct either, because the substitution ti is a fixed string. So, for example, if a substitution di → 'a' is processed, and a later substitution 'a' → 'b' is processed, then when we look up the substitution for 'a', it's 'b'. So when we need to expand 'a', it's 'b', and then 'b' would be expanded according to its substitution.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to handle this is that each substitution for a digit is a string that may contain other digits, which in turn have their own substitution rules.\n\nSo, to get the final substitution for a digit d, we need to recursively substitute any digits in the substitution string.\n\nThis suggests that the substitution for d is a tree-like structure, where each substitution can lead to other substitutions.\n\nBut to compute this efficiently, perhaps we can memoize the substitution for each digit. For example, for each digit d, we can compute its substitution string by substituting any digits in the substitution string according to their current substitution rules.\n\nWait, but this could cause issues with memoization if the substitution rules change after the substitution for d has been computed. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each digit d, the final substitution string after all queries are processed.\n\nYes! Because the substitution rules are fixed once all queries are processed. So, for each digit, its substitution is determined by the last query that affects it.\n\nWait, no. Because the substitution for a digit d can be modified by a later query, which may change the substitution string. So, for example, if the first query is d1 → t1, and the second query is d1 → t2, then after processing both, the substitution for d1 is t2.\n\nSo, the substitution for each digit is the last substitution rule for that digit.\n\nWait, that's correct. Because each substitution for a digit overrides the previous one. So, the substitution for d is the string specified in the last query that modifies d.\n\nSo, for each digit d, we can keep track of the last substitution. Then, when processing the substitution, for each d in the initial string, we need to find its final substitution string, which is the ti of the last query that targets d.\n\nBut wait, that's only part of the story. Because the substitution string for d may include other digits, which themselves have their own substitution rules. So, when d is substituted, the resulting string may contain other digits that need to be substituted as well.\n\nSo, to compute the final string, each digit in the initial string is replaced by its substitution string, which in turn may contain other digits, which are replaced by their substitution strings, and so on, until we reach a digit that doesn't have a substitution (i.e., the last substitution for that digit is the digit itself).\n\nSo, the approach is as follows:\n\n1. Process all the queries and build a substitution map, where for each digit d, substitution_map[d] is the string it's replaced with after all queries.\n\n   - For example, if a query is '2→00', substitution_map['2'] = '00'.\n   - If another query is '0→7', substitution_map['0'] = '7'.\n\n2. Now, for the initial string s, each character is a digit. For each digit, we need to replace it with its substitution string, and then expand any digits in that substitution string.\n\n3. To do this, we can represent the substitution as a function that, given a digit, returns the expanded string.\n\nBut since substitution strings can be nested, we need to perform a recursive expansion.\n\nHowever, to avoid redundant computations, we can memoize the expanded substitution strings for each digit.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n- Read the initial string s.\n- Read the number of queries, n.\n- Read each query and build the substitution_map, which for each digit d, stores the last substitution string for d.\n- For each digit in substitution_map, if the substitution string contains other digits, those digits will be substituted according to substitution_map as well.\n\nNow, the main task is to compute, for each digit in the initial string, what it expands to, considering all substitutions.\n\nSo, the plan is to create a helper function that, given a digit, returns its fully expanded substitution string. This function will use memoization to cache the results and avoid redundant calculations.\n\nLet's think about how this helper function would work:\n\ndef expand(d):\n    if d in memo:\n        return memo[d]\n    if d not in substitution_map or substitution_map[d] == d:\n        # No substitution or substitution is self\n        memo[d] = d\n        return d\n    # Get the substitution string\n    s = substitution_map[d]\n    # Now, expand each character in s\n    expanded = []\n    for c in s:\n        expanded.append(expand(c))\n    # Join the expanded parts\n    result = ''.join(expanded)\n    memo[d] = result\n    return result\n\nWait, but this is a recursive approach. So for each digit, we process its substitution string, and for each character in that string, we recursively expand them.\n\nThis way, even if substitution strings contain other substituted digits, they are correctly expanded.\n\nBut what about leading zeros or empty strings? The problem statement says that leading zeros are not removed, and an empty string is considered zero.\n\nSo, for example, if a substitution leads to an empty string, that's allowed, and the resulting string is zero. Also, leading zeros in the resulting string are preserved.\n\nThus, the helper function should return the exact string, including any leading zeros.\n\nOnce we have the expanded string for each digit in the initial string, we can concatenate them all to form the final string s_final.\n\nOnce we have s_final, we need to compute its numerical value modulo 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the length of s_final can be up to 105 * something, which could be very long. So, computing the numerical value directly is impossible due to potential size.\n\nSo, we need an efficient way to compute the value modulo 1e9+7 without storing the entire string.\n\nThe approach here is to compute the value digit by digit, applying the modulo at each step to keep the numbers manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Initialize a variable current_value as 0.\n- For each character in s_final:\n   - current_value = (current_value * 10 + int(char)) % MOD\n- Finally, output current_value.\n\nBut how do we get s_final? Since s_final is the result of expanding each digit in the initial string, we can process each digit in the initial string, expand it using the helper function, and collect all the characters.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Read the initial string s as a list of characters.\n- For each character in s:\n   - Expand it using the helper function.\n   - Append each character in the expanded string to a result list.\n- Once all characters are processed, join the result list into a string s_final.\n- Compute the numerical value of s_final mod 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but the helper function, when expanding a digit, returns the expanded string. So for each character in s, we can call expand(c) and get the string, then append all the characters of that string to the result list.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, the helper function is recursive, which can be a problem for large substitution chains. However, since the substitution_map is built once, and each expansion is memoized, the recursive calls should be efficient.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n\n2. Read n, the number of queries.\n\n3. Read each query and build substitution_map:\n\n   a. For each query, split into di and ti. di is a single character, ti is the substitution string.\n\n   b. Update substitution_map: substitution_map[di] = ti.\n\n   c. Additionally, for any di that's a single character, substitution_map[di] is set to ti.\n\n4. Now, build the helper function with memoization.\n\n5. For each character c in s:\n\n   a. Expand c using the helper function, which returns the expanded string.\n\n   b. Append each character in the expanded string to a list.\n\n6. Join the list into s_final.\n\n7. Compute s_final's value mod 1e9+7.\n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nCase 1: Empty string after substitutions.\n\nFor example, if s is \"0\", and the substitution is \"0→\". Then s_final is empty, which is treated as 0.\n\nCase 2: Leading zeros.\n\nFor example, substitution leads to \"00012\", which is treated as 12 numerically, but the string representation is \"00012\".\n\nBut according to the note in the problem statement, leading zeros should be ignored when computing the numerical value, but the string representation should include them.\n\nWait, no. The note says that when representing s as a decimal number, ignore leading zeros. But in the third sample input, the result after substitution is '777', which is non-zero, but if the substitution had led to '00777', the numerical value would be 777, but the string would be '00777'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the note says: \"when you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.\"\n\nSo, the numerical value is computed by ignoring leading zeros. So, for example, if s_final is '000123', the numerical value is 123. But if s_final is '0', the value is 0. If s_final is empty, it's 0.\n\nWait, but the problem says, \"after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1e9+7\". So, the numerical value is determined by treating s as a number, ignoring leading zeros, and if the entire string is empty, it's 0.\n\nSo, for the purpose of computing the numerical value, we need to process the s_final string as follows:\n\n- If the string is empty, the value is 0.\n\n- Else, strip leading zeros, and if the resulting string is empty, it's 0. Otherwise, it's the integer value of the string.\n\nBut wait, the problem says to ignore leading zeros, but the string s_final may have leading zeros. So, for example, s_final is '00123', which is treated as 123.\n\nSo, in code, after getting s_final, we need to process it to compute the numerical value as follows:\n\nif len(s_final) == 0:\n    value = 0\nelse:\n    # Strip leading zeros\n    stripped = s_final.lstrip('0')\n    if stripped == '':\n        value = 0\n    else:\n        value = int(stripped)\nvalue = value % MOD\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the string is to be treated as a decimal number, ignoring leading zeros. So, yes, that's the correct approach.\n\nBut in the sample input, the third test case:\n\nInput:\n222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7\n\nAfter substitution, s becomes '777' (since each '2' is replaced by '0', which is then replaced by '7').\n\nSo, the numerical value is 777.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\ns is '1000000008', which is beyond the modulus 1e9+7 (which is 1000000007). So the remainder is 1.\n\nSo, the code must correctly compute this.\n\nNow, let's outline the code structure.\n\nFirst, read s, then read n, then read each query.\n\nIn Python, reading the input can be done via input().splitlines(), but sometimes, when the input is provided as a list, it's better to read via sys.stdin.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as a list of strings, but perhaps it's easier to read via standard input.\n\nBut perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\ns = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nsubstitution_map = {str(d): str(d) for d in range(10)}\n# substitution_map is a dictionary mapping each digit character to its substitution string.\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    query = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    di, ti = query.split('->')\n    substitution_map[di] = ti\n\nThen, build the helper function with memoization.\n\nBut in Python, functions can't be defined inside loops, so perhaps we can define a memoization decorator or use a separate memoization dictionary.\n\nAlternatively, we can create a memo dictionary as a global variable.\n\nBut perhaps using a class-based approach isn't necessary. We can manage the memo as a dictionary outside the function.\n\nWait, but recursion in Python can be limited by stack depth, but given that the maximum substitution depth is limited by the number of queries, which is up to 105, it's manageable.\n\nSo, the helper function can be written as:\n\nmemo = {}\n\ndef expand(d):\n    if d in memo:\n        return memo[d]\n    if d not in substitution_map or substitution_map[d] == d:\n        # No substitution or substitution is self\n        memo[d] = d\n        return d\n    s = substitution_map[d]\n    # Now, expand each character in s\n    expanded = []\n    for c in s:\n        expanded.append(expand(c))\n    result = ''.join(expanded)\n    memo[d] = result\n    return result\n\nWait, but in the substitution_map, substitution_map is a dictionary where each key is a digit character, and the value is the substitution string.\n\nWait, in the code above, substitution_map is initialized as {str(d): str(d) for d in range(10)}, which is correct.\n\nSo, for each digit in the initial string, we call expand(c), which returns the fully expanded string.\n\nOnce we have that, we can process each character in s.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\ns_final = []\nfor c in s:\n    expanded = expand(c)\n    s_final.extend(list(expanded))\ns_final_str = ''.join(s_final)\n\nThen, compute the numerical value.\n\nBut wait, in Python, for very long strings, converting to an integer and then mod 1e9+7 could cause issues, but given that the modulus is 1e9+7, which is about 10^9, and the length of s is up to 105, the maximum possible length after substitution is 105 * (average substitution factor). But the average substitution factor is probably small, so the length shouldn't exceed 1e4 or 1e5, which is manageable.\n\nBut to compute the mod correctly, we can process each character one by one, as described earlier.\n\nSo, code for that part:\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\nif len(s_final_str) ==0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    stripped = s_final_str.lstrip('0')\n    if stripped == '':\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        # Compute the number mod MOD\n        num = 0\n        for c in stripped:\n            num = (num *10 + int(c)) % MOD\n        print(num)\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says that when you represent s as a decimal number, you ignore leading zeros. So, if the substitution results in an empty string, it's zero. Otherwise, the leading zeros are stripped.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif not s_final_str:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    stripped = s_final_str.lstrip('0')\n    if stripped:\n        # Compute the number\n        num = int(stripped)\n        print(num % MOD)\n    else:\n        print(0)\n\nBut wait, for the case where s_final_str is '0000', stripped is '', so the output is 0.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the note says: \"When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.\" So yes, that's correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the code would be:\n\nRead s.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n queries, build substitution_map.\n\nCompute s_final_str by expanding each digit.\n\nProcess s_final_str to compute the numerical value mod MOD.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, but the first line is s, the second is n, followed by n lines of queries.\n\nWait, the first sample input in the problem is:\n\nSample Input:\n123123\n1\n2->00\n3->\n\nSo, initial s is '123123'.\n\nn is 1.\n\nThen, the query is 2->00.\n\nSo, substitution_map['2'] = '00', others remain as their digits.\n\nSo, for the initial string '123123':\n\nEach '1' is 1, '2' is '00', '3' is 3.\n\nSo, the expanded string is '1' + '00' + '3' + '1' + '00' + '3' → '10031003'.\n\nWhich is 10031003.\n\nNumerical value is 10031003 mod 1e9+7.\n\nCompute that: 10031003.\n\nWhich is less than MOD, so output is 10031003.\n\nBut wait, in the sample output, the first output is '10031003', which matches.\n\nBut wait, the sample output shows four outputs, perhaps indicating multiple test cases. Or perhaps it's a typo.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement, perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of four strings, each representing a test case.\n\nBut perhaps the code is supposed to process all the test cases in one run.\n\nBut in any case, the code as written should process each test case individually.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the input is a single test case. Because the first line is s, then n, then n lines of queries.\n\nSo, the sample input provided is a bit confusing, perhaps it's a formatting issue.\n\nIn any case, let's proceed.\n\nAnother test case in the note:\n\nSample Input:\n\n222\n2\n2->0\n0->7\n\nSo, substitution_map starts as all digits mapped to themselves.\n\nFirst query: 2→0 → substitution_map['2'] = '0'.\n\nSecond query: 0→7 → substitution_map['0'] = '7'.\n\nSo, expanding '2' would give '7', because substitution_map['2'] is '0', which substitution_map['0'] is '7'.\n\nSo, for the initial string '222', each '2' is expanded to '7', so the final string is '777', whose numerical value is 777.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case:\n\ns is '1000000008'\n\nn=0.\n\nSo, no substitutions.\n\nSo, s_final is '1000000008'.\n\nCompute its numerical value mod 1e9+7.\n\nSince 1e9+7 is 1000000007.\n\nSo, 1000000008 mod 1e9+7 is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle these cases correctly.\n\nNow, let's think about the code's efficiency.\n\nEach digit in the initial string is processed by expand(), which for each digit in the substitution string, recursively expands them.\n\nBut with memoization, each digit's substitution is computed once.\n\nThe maximum number of recursive calls is O(10*105) since each substitution can be at most 105 in total.\n\nBut since the substitution_map is built once, and each expand call is memoized, the code should handle all cases efficiently.\n\nPotential Issues:\n\n1. The helper function expand() may hit maximum recursion depth if substitution strings are too deep. But given the problem constraints, this is unlikely.\n\n2. Substitution strings may lead to loops, causing the expand function to enter an infinite loop. For example, substitution_map['a'] = 'b', substitution_map['b'] = 'a'. In this case, expand('a') would call expand('b'), which calls expand('a'), leading to infinite recursion.\n\nTo prevent this, the code needs to detect such loops and handle them, perhaps by memoizing that a digit is in the process of being expanded and aborting if it's encountered again.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's not specified whether such cases are possible, but the code must handle them.\n\nSo, to prevent infinite recursion, we can add a flag to the expand function indicating whether it's currently processing a digit. If it encounters a digit that's already being processed, it aborts and returns the partially built string.\n\nThis can be done by adding a 'visiting' set that tracks which digits are currently being processed.\n\nModify the expand function as follows:\n\nvisiting = set()\n\ndef expand(d):\n    if d in memo:\n        return memo[d]\n    if d in visiting:\n        # Loop detected, return what's built so far?\n        # Or, perhaps, this indicates a cycle and the substitution is invalid.\n        # In reality, the substitution could form a cycle, but the code should handle it gracefully.\n        # However, since substitution is processed in the order of queries, a cycle would imply that the substitution rules have a loop, leading to an undefined behavior.\n        # But according to the problem statement, substitution rules are given, so perhaps the code can assume that substitution rules do not form cycles.\n        # However, to make the code robust, perhaps we can limit the recursion depth.\n        # For now, let's assume that the substitution rules do not form cycles, but the code can be modified to handle this.\n        raise RecursionError(\"Cycle detected in substitutions.\")\n    visiting.add(d)\n    try:\n        result = super_expand(d)\n    finally:\n        visiting.remove(d)\n    memo[d] = result\n    return result\n\nWait, but in Python, it's not easy to implement this without making the function tail-recursive, which is not supported.\n\nAlternative approach: Use memoization without recursion, perhaps with a stack.\n\nBut that complicates the code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can process the substitution without recursion, using a stack-based approach to avoid stack overflow.\n\nBut for the problem's constraints, perhaps recursion depth won't be an issue.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps the code can limit the recursion depth.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can use memoization without recursion, but that would complicate the expand function.\n\nGiven that the problem's constraints are small, perhaps the code can proceed as is, assuming that substitution rules do not form cycles.\n\nBut in practice, the code may run into maximum recursion depth issues for certain test cases.\n\nSo, perhaps a better approach is to use memoization without recursion, using a stack or queue to process the substitution.\n\nWait, perhaps a BFS-like approach.\n\nWait, for each digit d, its substitution is substitution_map[d], which is a string. Each character in that string may have their own substitution.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nFor each digit, the substitution is a string, which in turn may have other digits that need substitution.\n\nSo, the substitution can be represented as a tree, where each node is a digit, and its children are the digits in its substitution string.\n\nThus, to compute the substitution for a digit, we can process it as follows:\n\nInitialize a list of digits to process. For each digit, if it has not been processed yet, process it by expanding its substitution string, and for each character in that string, add them to the processing list if they haven't been processed.\n\nBut this is similar to BFS.\n\nWait, perhaps the expand function can be rewritten using an iterative approach.\n\nHere's an idea:\n\ndef expand(d):\n    if d in memo:\n        return memo[d]\n    stack = [d]\n    visited = set()\n    while stack:\n        current = stack.pop()\n        if current in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add(current)\n        s = substitution_map.get(current, current)\n        if s == current:\n            memo[current] = current\n            continue\n        for c in reversed(s):\n            if c not in visited:\n                stack.append(c)\n    # Now, s is the substitution string\n    # But wait, this approach may not capture all substitutions.\n    # Perhaps we need to collect all the substitution strings.\n    # Alternative approach: process the substitution string, expanding each character.\n    # But this seems similar to the recursive",
