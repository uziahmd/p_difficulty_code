The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Neko Finds Grapes.\" Hmm, sounds interesting. So, Neko found some treasure chests and keys. The goal is to open as many chests as possible using the keys.\n\nLet me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, each chest has a number a_i and each key has b_j. A key can unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd. That means either one is even and the other is odd because even + odd = odd. Oh right, but wait, no: wait, 1+2=3 which is odd. Yes, that's correct.\n\nEach key can be used once on one chest, and each chest can be opened at most once. So, we need to assign keys to chests such that as many chests as possible are unlocked.\n\nThe input gives n chests and m keys. We have to find the maximum number of chests we can open.\n\nHmm, okay. So, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I think we need to count the number of even and odd a_i and b_j. Because the condition depends on the parity.\n\nLet me think: for a key j and chest i, a_i + b_j must be odd. So, the parities must be different. So, if a_i is even, then b_j must be odd. Or vice versa.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal way is to:\n\n- Find how many keys are even and how many are odd.\n- Similarly, find how many chests are even and how many are odd.\n\nThen, match the even keys with the odd chests, and the odd keys with the even chests.\n\nWait, yes! Because each even key can only unlock an odd chest, and each odd key can only unlock an even chest.\n\nSo, the maximum number of chests we can open is the sum of the minimum between the number of even keys and the number of odd chests, plus the minimum between the number of odd keys and the number of even chests.\n\nBut wait, is that all? Because maybe there's a better way. Like, sometimes you might have more even keys than odd chests, but perhaps after assigning as much as possible, you can't do anything else. So, the sum would be correct.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because any key can only unlock a chest of opposite parity. So, the maximum possible is to take the sum of the two minima.\n\nBut wait, let's test this with the examples given.\n\nIn the first example:\n\nChests: [9,14,6,2,11]\nSo, a_i's are 9 (odd), 14 (even), 6 (even), 2 (even), 11 (odd). So, the number of odd chests is 2, even is 3.\n\nKeys: [8,4,7,20]\nb_j's are 8 (even),4 (even),7 (odd),20 (even). So, even keys: 3, odd keys:1.\n\nSo, even keys can unlock odd chests. Number of even keys is 3, odd chests is 2. So, the minimum is 2. So, 2 chests can be opened via even keys.\n\nOdd keys can unlock even chests. Number of odd keys is 1, even chests is 3. So, 1. So total is 2+1=3, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: second input is 5 1. The chests are 2,4,6,8,10 (all even). The key is 5 (odd). So, the odd key can unlock any even chest. So, 1 chest. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird example: chests are 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So, even key + even chest sum is even, not odd. So, no chests can be opened. Correct.\n\nSo, the logic seems solid.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd in both a and b arrays.\n\n2. Compute the maximum possible by taking the sum of min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nBut wait, wait: let's clarify.\n\nWait, the even keys can be used on odd chests. So, the number of even keys is e_k, and the number of odd chests is o_c. So, the number of pairs here is min(e_k, o_c).\n\nSimilarly, the number of odd keys is o_k, and even chests are e_c. So, the pairs here are min(o_k, e_c).\n\nSo, the total is min(e_k, o_c) + min(o_k, e_c).\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read n, m.\n\n- Read the a array.\n\n- Read the b array.\n\n- Count the number of even and odd in a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the given keys. Each key can unlock a chest if their numbers have opposite parities (i.e., one is even and the other is odd).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count the number of even and odd integers in both the chests and the keys. This helps us determine which keys can unlock which chests based on parity.\n2. **Match Keys and Chests**: Use the counts of even and odd keys and chests to determine how many pairs we can form where a key can unlock a chest. Specifically:\n   - Even keys can unlock odd chests.\n   - Odd keys can unlock even chests.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Pairs**: The maximum number of chests that can be unlocked is the sum of the minimum pairs formed by even keys with odd chests and odd keys with even chests.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    m = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx +=2\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx +=n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+m]))\n    \n    # Count evens and odds for a\n    even_a = 0\n    odd_a = 0\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_a +=1\n        else:\n            odd_a +=1\n    \n    # Count evens and odds for b\n    even_b = 0\n    odd_b = 0\n    for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_b +=1\n        else:\n            odd_b +=1\n    \n    # Calculate the maximum possible\n    use_even_key_on_odd_chest = min(even_b, odd_a)\n    use_odd_key_on_even_chest = min(odd_b, even_a)\n    total = use_even_key_on_odd_chest + use_odd_key_on_even_chest\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of chests, keys, and their respective values.\n2. **Counting Parities**: We iterate through the chests and keys to count how many are even and how many are odd.\n3. **Matching Keys and Chests**: Using the counts from the previous step, we determine the maximum number of valid pairs where a key can unlock a chest. This is done by taking the minimum of the relevant counts and summing them up.\n4. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked using the given keys, considering their parities.",
