For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says that a major triad is when the notes can be ordered such that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones and Y to Z is 3. For a minor triad, it's the opposite: X-Y is 3 and Y-Z is 4. The distance is measured as the number of semitones moving upwards along the scale. So the key is to find all possible orderings of the three notes and check if any of them fit either the major or minor condition.\n\nHmm, but wait, the notes are unordered. So for each possible permutation of the three notes, I need to compute the distances between consecutive notes in that order and see if it matches either pattern.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that the order in which we arrange the notes matters. So for a given set of three notes, say A, B, C, I need to consider all possible orderings (like A-B-C, A-C-B, B-A-C, etc.) and see if any of these orderings result in the correct semitone distances for either major or minor.\n\nWait, but that might be computationally intensive since there are 6 permutations for three elements. But since the input is only three notes, it's manageable.\n\nSo the steps I should follow are:\n\n1. Read the three notes from input.\n2. Convert each note into its corresponding position in the scale. For example, C is position 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc., up to H which is 11. Wait, wait, let me list out the notes correctly.\n\nThe notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, no, wait: H isn't a standard note in Western music. Oh, right, the problem statement says the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Hmm, but wait, in reality, after B comes C again, but the problem includes H before C. So perhaps the list is arranged cyclically, with H following B and then comes C again.\n\nWait, the problem says the notes are repeated cyclically. So the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, and then back to C. So the total number of notes is 12, each representing one semitone step.\n\nSo first, I need to create a mapping from each note to its index in this list. So, let's create a list where the index corresponds to the semitone value.\n\nLet me write down the order:\n\nC → 0\nC# → 1\nD → 2\nD# →3\nE→4\nF→5\nF#→6\nG→7\nG#→8\nA→9\nB→10\nH→11\n\nYes, that's correct. So each note has a position from 0 to 11.\n\nSo step 1: create a dictionary that maps each note to its index.\n\nOnce I have the indices for the three notes, I can compute the distances between them.\n\nBut since the order matters, I need to consider all possible orderings of the three notes and see if any of them satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\nWait, but for each ordering, the distances are calculated as follows: the first two notes must have a difference of 4, and the next two must have a difference of 3 for major. Or, for minor, the first two must differ by 3 and the next by 4.\n\nWait, but the way the distances are computed is as the number of semitones between the lower note and the higher note. So for example, the distance between X and Y is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12, but wait, no: because the distance is always from lower to higher, so if Y is higher than X, it's Y - X; if Y is lower, it wraps around, but the problem states that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper, so for example, between E and C: E is index 4, C is 0. So E to C is (0 + 12 -4) = 8 semitones? Or is it that the distance is (C - E) mod 12?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the distance between X and Z accordingly equals 7 semitones.\" Looking at the example, C, E, G: C is 0",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves converting the notes into their respective positions on a musical scale and then checking all possible permutations of these notes to see if they fit the criteria for either a major or minor triad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: First, map each note to its corresponding index on a cyclic scale of 12 notes. This helps in calculating the distances between notes.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: For the given three notes, generate all possible permutations of these notes. Each permutation represents a potential ordering of the notes.\n3. **Check Triad Conditions**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes. Check if any permutation satisfies the conditions for a major or minor triad:\n   - A major triad has distances of 4 and 3 semitones between consecutive notes.\n   - A minor triad has distances of 3 and 4 semitones between consecutive notes.\n4. **Determine Result**: Based on the checks, determine if the chord is major, minor, or strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read the input notes\nnotes = input().split()\n\n# Create a list of the 12 notes in order to find their indices\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n# Create a dictionary to map each note to its index\nnote_indices = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\n# Extract the indices of the input notes\na, b, c = [note_indices[note] for note in notes]\n\n# Function to check all permutations of (a, b, c)\ndef check_permutation(perm):\n    # Compute the distances\n    d1 = perm[1] - perm[0]\n    d2 = perm[2] - perm[1]\n    # Since the scale is cyclic, but distance is from lower to higher, no modulo needed as we're considering all permutations\n    return (d1 == 4 and d2 == 3) or (d1 == 3 and d2 == 4)\n\n# Generate all permutations of the three indices\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nfor p in permutations([a, b, c]):\n    if check_permutation(p):\n        print(\"major\" if (p[1]-p[0]==4 and p[2]-p[1]==3) else \"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Note Mapping**: Each note is mapped to an index from 0 to 11 based on its position in the musical scale.\n- **Permutations**: We consider all possible orderings of the three notes to ensure we don't miss any potential triad.\n- **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, we calculate the distances between consecutive notes. If a permutation matches the criteria for a major or minor triad, we print the result and exit.\n- **Result**: If no permutation matches the criteria, the chord is classified as strange.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible configurations of the notes to accurately determine the type of triad, if any.",
