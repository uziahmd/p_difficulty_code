He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Check the string,\" and from the description, it seems like we have to verify if a given string meets certain conditions based on how it was built by three friendsâ€”A, B, and C.\n\nHmm. Let me try to break down the problem step by step. \n\nSo, the process goes like this: A creates a string of some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's. After that, C appends some 'c's. But there are specific constraints:\n\n1. The string after each step must be such that:\n   - After A, there's at least one 'a' and no 'b's yet.\n   - After B, there's at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n   - After C, the number of 'c's added must be equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's (or both) in the string before C adds them.\n\nAdditionally, the order of the characters must be correct. So the string should consist of all 'a's first, followed by all 'b's, then all 'c's. No mixing allowed except in the way they are appended.\n\nSo, the input is a string S, and I need to determine if it could have been formed through this process.\n\nLet's think about the steps to check.\n\nFirst, the string must be in the form aaa...bbb...ccc... with no other characters in between. So any 'a's come before 'b's, which come before 'c's. If the string has any 'a' after a 'b' or 'c', it's invalid. Similarly, any 'b' after a 'c' is invalid.\n\nSecond, the counts must satisfy certain conditions. Let's denote:\n\n- count_a = number of 'a's\n- count_b = number of 'b's\n- count_c = number of 'c's\n\nAfter A gives the string to B, the string is just 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, so the string becomes a sequence of 'a's followed by 'b's. So the string must not have any 'c's until after C appends them. Also, during B's step, the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\nThen, when C appends the 'c's, the number of 'c's must equal either count_a or count_b. It can also be equal to both.\n\nBut wait, the 'c's are added only after all the 'a's and 'b's. So the string S must consist of all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's, without any interleaving.\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is check if the string is in the correct order. That is, all 'a's come first, followed by 'b's, then 'c's.\n\nHow can I check that? Well, I can iterate through the string and ensure that once a 'b' is found, there are no 'a's after it. Similarly, once a 'c' is found, there can't be any 'a's or 'b's after it.\n\nSo step 1: Check the order.\n\nIf the order is incorrect, output NO.\n\nIf the order is correct, proceed to check the counts.\n\nNow, for the counts:\n\nAfter A, the string is a bunch of 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's. So the initial string before C adds 'c's has count_a 'a's and count_b 'b's.\n\nC must add exactly count_c letters 'c', and count_c must equal either count_a or count_b.\n\nWait, but wait: when C appends the 'c's, the total string after that would have count_a 'a's, count_b 'b's, and count_c 'c's, where count_c is equal to either count_a or count_b.\n\nBut wait, because C appends some 'c's. So the total count_c could be equal to count_a, or equal to count_b, or equal to both.\n\nWait, but according to the note in the problem statement, it's possible that the number of 'c's equals both. So count_c can be equal to count_a and count_b, as long as that's the case.\n\nSo for the counts, the condition is:\n\ncount_c == count_a OR count_c == count_b.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the process. When C appends the 'c's, he appends some number of 'c's equal to either count_a or count_b in the string before he appends. So after appending, the count of 'c's is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nWait, but the string before C appends is a string that contains all 'a's and 'b's. So the count_a is the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order with certain constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check the Order of Characters**: The string must be in the form of all 'a's followed by all 'b's and then all 'c's. This means once a 'b' appears, no 'a' should come after it, and once a 'c' appears, no 'a' or 'b' should come after it.\n\n2. **Count the Characters**: After ensuring the correct order, count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string.\n\n3. **Check Constraints on Counts**:\n   - The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's (or both).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the order is correct: a's first, then b's, then c's\norder_valid = True\nfor i in range(len(s)):\n    if s[i] == 'b':\n        # After this point, no 'a's allowed\n        for j in range(i+1, len(s)):\n            if s[j] == 'a':\n                order_valid = False\n                break\n        if not order_valid:\n            break\n    elif s[i] == 'c':\n        # After this point, no 'a's or 'b's allowed\n        for j in range(i+1, len(s)):\n            if s[j] == 'a' or s[j] == 'b':\n                order_valid = False\n                break\n        if not order_valid:\n            break\n\nif not order_valid:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n\n    # Check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Order Check**: The code first checks if the string is in the correct order by ensuring that all 'a's come first, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's without any interleaving.\n- **Count Check**: If the order is correct, the code then counts the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n- **Constraints Check**: Finally, it verifies if the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's, ensuring the constraints set by the problem are met.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the order and the count constraints, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.",
