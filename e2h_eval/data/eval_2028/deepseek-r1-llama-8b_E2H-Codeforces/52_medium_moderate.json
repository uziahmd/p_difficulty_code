Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Vasily has some candles and can create new ones from the stubs. The goal is to find out how many hours he can keep the room lit. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nHmm, let's see. The initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for exactly one hour before it goes out. So the first thing that happens is, all 'a' candles burn, adding 'a' hours, and leaving 'a' stubs.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, the problem says he can make b stubs into a new candle. So after burning all a candles, he has a stubs. He can exchange them for (a // b) new candles. Each new candle will then burn for 1 hour each, adding to the total time.\n\nBut also, after making those new candles, the stubs from them will add to the leftover stubs. So it's a loop: while he has enough stubs to make at least one more candle, he does so, burns it, and collects the new stub.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Start with a hours, and a stubs.\n2. While stubs >= b:\n   a. Make as many new candles as possible: new_candles = stubs // b\n   b. Add new_candles to the total hours.\n   c. The new stubs are (stubs % b) + new_candles (since each new candle gives one stub)\n3. Continue until stubs < b.\n\nWait, but initially, the stubs are 'a', right? Because each of the a candles becomes a stub after burning.\n\nLet me test this with the example given.\n\nFirst example: input is 4 2.\n\nInitial a=4, b=2.\n\nTotal hours =4.\n\nStubs =4.\n\nSince 4 >=2, make 4//2=2 new candles. Add 2 to total, now 6.\n\nStubs become 4%2=0 plus 2 (from the new candles), so 2.\n\nAgain, 2 >=2, make 1 new candle. Add 1, total 7.\n\nStubs now 1+1=2.\n\nAgain, 2 >=2, make 1 candle. Add 1, total 8.\n\nWait, wait. Wait in the example, the output is 7. Hmm, maybe I messed up.\n\nWait the example says:\n\nFor the first four hours, he uses four candles. Then he makes two new ones (because 4/2=2). Then he burns those two, adding 2 hours, total 6. Now, he has 0 stubs from the original, plus 2 from the new ones, so 2 stubs. He can make one more candle, burn it, adding 1 hour (total 7), which leaves 1 stub. Since 1 is less than b=2, he stops.\n\nWait, so why in my earlier calculation I thought it would be 8? Oh because I added 2 in the second step, and then another 1.\n\nWait perhaps I'm misunderstanding the process.\n\nWait let me re-examine the sample:\n\nSample Input: 4 2.\n\n- Burn 4 candles: 4 hours, 4 stubs.\n\n- Make 4/2=2 new candles. Burn them: 2 hours. Now, stubs are (4%2=0) + 2 from new candles = 2.\n\n- Now, stubs=2 >=2, make 1 new candle. Burn it: 1 hour. Stubs now 1 +1=2.\n\n- Again, stubs=2 >=2, make 1 new candle. Burn it: 1 hour. Stubs now 1+1=2.\n\nWait this seems like an infinite loop. But that can't be right.\n\nWait no, wait: After the third step, stubs are 2 again. So we make another candle, burn it, stubs become 1+1=2. So this repeats infinitely, adding 1 hour each time.\n\nBut that can't be. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait no, wait. Because each time you make a new candle, you use b stubs, which gives you one candle, which when burned adds 1 hour and creates one stub. So for the case where stubs is exactly equal to b, you can keep going forever, adding 1 hour each time. But that's impossible since the numbers are finite.\n\nWait but in the sample, the output is 7. So perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait maybe I should model it differently.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nEach time, you can collect the stubs, then exchange as many as possible into new candles, which are then burned, contributing their own stubs.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Total = a.\n\n- stubs = a.\n\n- while stubs >= b:\n\n   - new = stubs // b\n\n   - total += new\n\n   - stubs = (stubs % b) + new\n\nSo let's apply this to the first sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal=4, stubs=4.\n\nLoop:\n\nstubs=4 >=2: new=4//2=2. total=4+2=6. stubs=0 +2=2.\n\nNext iteration: stubs=2 >=2: new=1. total=7. stubs=0 +1=1.\n\nNow stubs=1 <2: loop ends.\n\nSo total is 7, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: input is 6 3.\n\nSo a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal=6, stubs=6.\n\nFirst iteration: 6//3=2, total=8. stubs=0 +2=2.\n\nNext, 2 <3: loop ends. So total is 8, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the correct approach is to perform the loop where each time, you take the current stubs, divide by b to get new candles, add to total, and set stubs to (mod + new).\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize total = a.\n\nstubs = a.\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n\n    new = stubs // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    stubs = (stubs % b) + new\n\nSo in code, we can implement this with a loop.\n\nNow, in Python, we can read a and b from input, process, and print.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: a < b.\n\nLike a=5, b=10. Then, stubs=5 <10, so nothing can be done. Total is 5.\n\nCase 2: a is just enough to make one more candle.\n\nLike a=3, b=3: total is 3+1=4.\n\nBecause stubs=3: make 1, add 1 hour. stubs becomes 0 +1=1, which is less than 3.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=2.\n\nInitial stubs=5.\n\nFirst iteration: new=2, total=5+2=7. stubs=5%2=1 +2=3.\n\nNext iteration: new=1, total=8. stubs=3%2=1 +1=2.\n\nNext iteration: new=1, total=9. stubs=2%2=0 +1=1.\n\nLoop ends.\n\nSo total is 9.\n\nWait, what's the breakdown:\n\n5 -> 5 hours.\n\nMake 2 new (from 5 stubs). Burn them: 2 hours, now stubs = 5 mod 2 =1 +2=3.\n\nMake 1 new (from 3): 1 hour, stubs=3 mod 2=1 +1=2.\n\nMake 1 new (from 2): 1 hour, stubs=2 mod 2=0 +1=1.\n\nTotal: 5+2+1+1=9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code needs to handle this correctly.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute as per the algorithm above.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead the input line, split into a and b.\n\nConvert to integers.\n\nInitialize total = a.\n\nstubs = a.\n\nloop while stubs >=b:\n\n   new = stubs // b\n\n   total += new\n\n   stubs = (stubs % b) + new\n\nPrint total.\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 4 2.\n\nProcess: total=4, stubs=4.\n\nLoop:\n\nnew=2, total=6, stubs=0+2=2.\n\nLoop again: new=1, total=7, stubs=0+1=1.\n\nLoop ends.\n\nOutput 7.\n\nSample 2:\n\n6 3.\n\ntotal=6, stubs=6.\n\nnew=2, total=8, stubs=0+2=2.\n\nNo further loop.\n\nOutput 8.\n\nAnother test case: 5 2.\n\nAs above, output 9.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=3.\n\ntotal=3, stubs=3.\n\nnew=1, total=4, stubs=0+1=1.\n\nLoop ends.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2.\n\ntotal=2, stubs=2.\n\nnew=1, total=3, stubs=0+1=1.\n\nLoop ends.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead the input line as a string, split into two parts, convert to integers.\n\nThen compute as per above.\n\nSo the code:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n\n    new = stubs // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes, that should do it.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has and the stubs from burned-out candles. The key is to optimally reuse the stubs to create new candles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with `a` candles, each burning for exactly 1 hour. This gives us `a` hours of light and `a` stubs.\n2. **Recycle Stubs**: For every `b` stubs, we can create a new candle. Each new candle burns for 1 hour, adding to the total hours of light and generating another stub.\n3. **Loop Until Exhaustion**: Continue recycling stubs into new candles until we no longer have enough stubs to make at least one more candle. Each iteration of the loop processes the current stubs, creates new candles, adds to the total hours, and updates the stub count.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial number of candles) and `b` (number of stubs needed to create a new candle).\n2. **Initial Total Hours**: The initial total hours are set to `a` because each candle burns for exactly 1 hour.\n3. **Processing Stubs**: Using a loop, we repeatedly convert stubs into new candles. For each iteration:\n   - Calculate how many new candles can be made (`new = stubs // b`).\n   - Add these new candles to the total hours.\n   - Update the stub count to the remainder of the division plus the new candles just created.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until there are not enough stubs left to create even one new candle, at which point the total hours are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently recycles stubs to maximize the number of hours the room can be lit, ensuring optimal use of resources.",
