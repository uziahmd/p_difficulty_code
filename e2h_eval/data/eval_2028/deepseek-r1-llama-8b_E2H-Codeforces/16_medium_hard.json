Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Crazy Town,\" and from the description, it seems like it involves lines dividing a plane into regions, and moving between these regions with certain rules.\n\nHmm, the task is to find the minimum number of steps to get from the home block to the university block. Each step is moving from one block to another if they share a common border of non-zero length. So, the key here is understanding how the lines partition the plane and how the points are located in relation to these lines.\n\nLet me think about what defines a region in this context. Each line is a road, and the roads divide the plane into blocks. So, each block is a maximal region where any two points within the same block can be connected without crossing a road. \n\nThe problem mentions that neither the home nor the university is on any road. That's important because it means each point lies strictly on one side or the other of every line.\n\nI remember that for a single line, a point is either on one side or the other. So, for multiple lines, each point has a certain sign based on whether it's on the positive or negative side of each line. Wait, maybe we can model the position of a point relative to all lines as a binary vector, where each component indicates which side of the line the point is on. Then, two points are in the same block if their binary vectors agree on all lines—meaning they are on the same side of every line. So, the number of steps needed to go from home to university would depend on how many lines have different signs between the two points.\n\nWait, but wait: each line contributes a condition. For each line, the home and university could be on opposite sides or the same side. If they are on opposite sides of a line, that line must separate them, meaning that they are in different blocks. But how does that affect the minimal steps?\n\nOh right! Because when you cross a line, you can only do so through an intersection. But each line may contribute to the separation between the two points. So, the minimal number of steps required would be equal to the number of lines that separate the home and the university.\n\nBecause each such line acts as a boundary that you have to cross. Since each line can only be crossed once (since each step is a move across a shared boundary), the total steps would be the count of lines where home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each such line creates a boundary that the path must cross. So the minimal steps would be the number of lines that separate the two points.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each of the n lines, determine whether the home and university are on the same side or not.\n2. Count the number of lines where they are on opposite sides.\n3. That count is the minimal number of steps required.\n\nSo, how to compute whether two points are on the same side of a line?\n\nFor each line, given by a x + b y + c = 0, compute the value f(p) = a*x + b*y + c for a point p (x,y). Then, the sign of f(p) tells us which side of the line the point is on.\n\nIf f(home) and f(university) have the same sign, they are on the same side; else, they are on opposite sides.\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, the line equation is a*x + b*y + c = 0. So, for a point (x,y), if a x + b y + c is positive, it's on one side, if negative, on the other.\n\nBut the direction depends on the coefficients. For example, if a=1, b=0, c=-5, then the line is x = 5. Points with x>5 are on one side, x<5 on the other.\n\nSo, for each line, compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c and s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If s1*s2 < 0, then the two points are on opposite sides of the line.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each line, calculate s1 and s2.\n- If s1 * s2 < 0, increment the count.\n- The final count is the answer.\n\nThat's straightforward. So the code would look like this:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1), university (x2, y2), then read n lines each with a, b, c.\n\nInitialize a counter to zero.\n\nFor each line:\n   compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n   compute s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n   if s1 * s2 < 0: increment counter.\n\nFinally, output the counter.\n\nWait, that's it? That seems too simple, but considering the problem statement, perhaps that's the case.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0 --> line is y=0.\n\n1 0 0 --> line is x=0.\n\nCompute for home (1,1):\n\ns1 for first line: 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 >0.\n\ns2 for university (-1,-1): 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0.\n\nSo s1*s2 = -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond line: a=1, b=0, c=0.\n\ns1 = 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1>0.\n\ns2 =1*(-1) +0*(-1)+0 =-1<0.\n\ns1*s2 =-1 → count +=1.\n\nTotal count is 2 → which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSuppose home and university are on the same side of all lines → count is 0.\n\nOr, if they are on opposite sides of k lines, the minimal steps are k.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0.\n\nfor each of n lines:\n\n   a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n   s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\n   s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n   if s1 * s2 < 0:\n\n       count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that's it.\n\nSo the Python code would handle that.\n\nNow, let's think about potential issues.\n\nWhat if a line is something like 0x + 0y + c =0? Oh, but the problem states that ai and bi are not both zero. So no division by zero or anything. So each line is valid.\n\nAnother thing: the points are guaranteed not to lie on any line, so s1 and s2 are non-zero. So s1*s2 cannot be zero, so the condition is safe.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. The town is divided by multiple lines, and each step can only be taken if the blocks share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each road in Crazy Town is defined by a line equation. The goal is to find how many such lines separate the home block from the university block. Each separating line contributes one step because moving across such a line is necessary to reach the destination.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each line, determine whether the home and university are on opposite sides. If they are, this line contributes to the step count as it separates the two points.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the coordinates of the home and university.\n   - For each line, compute the value of the line equation at both the home and university coordinates.\n   - Check if these values have opposite signs, indicating that the points are on opposite sides of the line.\n   - Count the number of such lines, which gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of lines and their respective coefficients.\n- **Line Evaluation**: For each line, the value of the line equation is computed at both the home and university coordinates. This helps determine which side of the line each point is on.\n- **Counting Separations**: If the products of the computed values for the home and university are negative, it indicates they are on opposite sides of the line, thus incrementing the step count.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the geometric properties of lines and their separation of points, ensuring an optimal solution.",
