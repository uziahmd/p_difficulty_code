Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about finding two vouchers that don't overlap, their durations add up exactly to x, and the total cost is as minimal as possible. If no such pair exists, we return -1.\n\nLet me break down the problem. We have n vouchers. Each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost costi. The duration of each voucher is ri - li + 1. We need to choose two different vouchers i and j. These two must not intersect, meaning either the end of i is before the start of j or vice versa. Also, the sum of their durations should be exactly x. And among all such possible pairs, we need the one with the smallest total cost.\n\nHmm, okay. So the first thing I need to do is find all possible pairs of vouchers that meet these conditions. But considering the constraints, n can be up to 2*10^5, which is 200,000. If I try to check every possible pair, that's O(n^2) which would be way too slow—like 4e10 operations. That's definitely not feasible. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, let's think about the properties required for the two vouchers. Let's say the first voucher has duration d1 and the second d2. We need d1 + d2 = x. Also, the vouchers must not overlap in time.\n\nSo maybe for each voucher, I can look for another voucher whose duration is x minus the current voucher's duration, and also ensure that they don't overlap.\n\nBut even then, checking for each voucher and looking up others could be O(n), but how? Maybe by grouping vouchers based on their durations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can pre-process the vouchers into a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each voucher, we can quickly find potential partners by looking up x - d, where d is the current voucher's duration.\n\nBut even that might not directly help because we also need to check if the two vouchers are non-overlapping.\n\nHmm, another idea: for each voucher, we can store its start and end times along with its cost. Then, for each voucher i, we can look for vouchers j where (d_j = x - d_i) and j doesn't overlap with i. But how to do this efficiently?\n\nWait, the non-overlapping condition can be checked by ensuring that either j's end is before i's start or i's end is before j's start. But when we're looking for j's with specific durations, perhaps we can index the vouchers in a way that allows us to quickly find j's that don't overlap.\n\nMaybe we can sort the vouchers based on their end times. Then, for a given voucher i, any voucher j that ends before i starts can be found via binary search. Similarly, for vouchers that start after i ends, we can also look them up.\n\nBut since we're dealing with two different durations, perhaps we can structure this as follows:\n\nFor each voucher i, compute the desired duration d = x - duration_i. Then, for each voucher j in the group with duration d, check if j does not overlap with i.\n\nBut again, the issue is efficiently finding all such j's that satisfy both the duration and non-overlapping condition.\n\nWait, but if I have all vouchers sorted by their end times, then for a given i, any j in the d group that ends before i's start can be considered. Similarly, any j in the d group that starts after i's end can also be considered.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers into a dictionary, where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of tuples (li, ri, costi). Also, sort each list by end time.\n\n2. For each voucher i, calculate the needed duration d = x - duration_i. If d is less than 0, skip.\n\n3. Check if there are any vouchers in the d group. If not, continue.\n\n4. For the group d, find all vouchers j where either j's end <= i's start OR j's start >= i's end.\n\nBut wait, since the group is sorted by end time, for the case where j ends before i starts, we can perform a binary search on the group to find all j's with end <= li. Then, for each of those, check if their end <= li and compute the cost.\n\nSimilarly, for the case where j starts after i ends, which would require j's start > ri. Again, binary search could help here. Since the group is sorted by end, perhaps we can find the first j where j's end >= ri, and then check if their start is > ri.\n\nWait, no. Because j's start is li, which is in the tuple. So for j's in the group, we can have their end times, but to find those whose start is after i's end, we'd need to know their start times.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to pre-sort each group not just by end times but also keep track of the start times. Or, perhaps, for each group, maintain a list of (end, start, cost) sorted by end. Then, for a given i's end (ri), we can find all j's in the group where end <= li using binary search. For the other condition, j's start >= ri, but to find those, we'd need to find j's where start >= ri.\n\nWait, but the group is sorted by end. So if j's end is >= ri, then j's start could be anything. But j's start could be before or after i's end.\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe we need to process each group in a way that allows us to quickly find the j's that satisfy either end <= li or start >= ri.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each group, we can create two separate lists: one sorted by end, and another sorted by start. Or perhaps for each group, we can have the vouchers sorted by their end times, and for each j in the group, have their start time stored.\n\nThen, for a given i, to find j's in the group where end <= li: use binary search on the group's end-sorted list to find all j's with end <= li. For each such j, check if end <= li, and if so, add their cost to i's cost and track the minimum.\n\nFor the other case, j's start >= ri: we can find in the group the j's where start >= ri. How can we do that quickly? Well, if the group is sorted by end, but the start times may not be in order. So binary search based on start may not work. So perhaps for each group, we also have a sorted list of start times. Then, for a given ri, we can find the first j in the group where start >= ri, and iterate from there.\n\nBut maintaining two separate sorted lists for each group might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps for each group, we can sort the vouchers in a way that allows efficient querying for both cases.\n\nWait, maybe it's manageable. Let me think.\n\nEach group is a list of vouchers with the same duration. For each group, we can pre-sort the list by their end time (ri). Then, for each voucher j in the group, we can record their start time (li).\n\nWhen processing a voucher i, for the group d, we can:\n\n- Find all j in the group where j's end <= i's li. This can be done by binary searching the group's end-sorted list for the largest end <= li. All j's before that index in the group are candidates.\n\n- For each such j, check if their end <= li. If yes, compute the total cost. Keep track of the minimal total cost.\n\n- Then, for the other case, find all j in the group where j's start >= i's ri. To find these, since the group is sorted by end, but not necessarily by start, this is tricky. Because j's start could be anywhere. So for example, j's end is 10, but j's start could be 5 or 15. So if i's end is 8, j's start being 15 would satisfy the condition (j starts after i ends).\n\nBut how do we efficiently find j's with start >= ri?\n\nAn alternative approach: for each group, sort the vouchers by their start time. Then, for a given ri, we can find all j's in the group where start >= ri.\n\nWait, but each group is already sorted by end time. So perhaps for each group, we can also sort by start time, and have both sorted lists.\n\nBut this would double the memory, but for 2e5 vouchers, it's manageable.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n1. Read all the vouchers and calculate their durations.\n\n2. Create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of tuples containing (li, ri, costi). For each such list, sort the vouchers by end time (ri) and also by start time (li).\n\n3. For each voucher i in the list, do the following:\n\n   a. Compute d = x - (ri - li + 1). If d < 0, skip.\n\n   b. Check if d exists in the dictionary. If not, continue.\n\n   c. For the group d, get the sorted lists by end and start.\n\n   d. Find all j in the group where j's end <= li. For each such j, if j's end <= li, compute the total cost (i's cost + j's cost). Track the minimum.\n\n   e. Find all j in the group where j's start >= ri. For each such j, compute the total cost. Track the minimum.\n\n4. After processing all vouchers, the minimal cost found is the answer. If no such pair exists, output -1.\n\nBut wait, in step 3d and 3e, for each i, we are looking for j's in the group d. But j cannot be the same as i. So in each case, we need to make sure that j is not i.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, i and j must be different vouchers. So during our checks, when considering j's, we must ensure that j is not the same as i.\n\nBut in the group d, for a given i, if i is part of the group d, then when looking for j's in the group, we need to skip i itself.\n\nHmm, but how can i be part of the group d? Because d = x - duration_i. So duration_i + duration_j = x. So if i's duration is d, then j's duration would be x - d = i's duration. So if i's duration is d, then j's duration is also d. So i is in the group d. So when processing i, the group d includes i. Thus, when we look for j in group d, we have to exclude i.\n\nAh, that's an important point. So in step 3d and 3e, for each j found, we must check that j is not the same voucher as i.\n\nWait, but how? Because in the data structures, the vouchers are stored as tuples, but we don't have an identifier for each voucher. So perhaps we need to include the index of each voucher in the data structure, but that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the group, when we find j's that could be i, we can skip adding their cost.\n\nWait, but how can we know if j is the same as i? Because the vouchers could have the same li, ri, costi, but be different vouchers. So it's not sufficient to just compare the tuples; we need to track the indices.\n\nSo perhaps during preprocessing, each voucher is assigned an index (like 0-based), and stored along with li, ri, costi in the group. Then, when checking j's, we can compare their index to i's index.\n\nYes, that's necessary. So in the data structure, each entry in the group is a tuple (li, ri, costi, index). So when processing i, for each j found in the group, we can check if j's index is different from i's index.\n\nSo, in step 3, when processing voucher i, for each j in the group d, j must have index != i's index.\n\nThis adds some overhead, but it's manageable.\n\nAnother thing to consider: in the group d, the same voucher j cannot be used twice. So when considering j, it's only once, regardless of how many times it appears.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the steps are:\n\nFor each voucher i:\n\n   Calculate d = x - (ri - li + 1). If d < 0, skip.\n\n   If d is not in the groups, continue.\n\n   Else, for the group d, sorted by end:\n\n      Use binary search to find all j's in the group where j.end <= i.li.\n\n      For each such j:\n\n         If j is not i, compute total cost and track the minimum.\n\n      Then, for the group d, sorted by start:\n\n         Use binary search to find all j's in the group where j.start >= i.ri.\n\n         For each such j:\n\n             If j is not i, compute total cost and track the minimum.\n\nBut wait, how do we have the group sorted by start? Because earlier, I thought of sorting the group by end. So perhaps for each group, we need two sorted lists: one sorted by end, another sorted by start.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to sort the group by end, and when we need to find j's starting after i's end, we can loop through the entire group and find j's where start >= i.ri.\n\nBut that would be O(k) for each i, which could be expensive if k is large.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Because for each i, in the worst case, we have to check all j's in the group d, which could be up to 2e5 per i, leading to O(4e10) operations, which is impossible.\n\nSo that approach won't work. So we need a way to find j's in the group d where j.start >= i.ri, but without having to scan the entire group.\n\nWait, but if the group is sorted by end, perhaps we can find a point where the end is beyond i.ri, but that doesn't directly help with the start.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each group, we can have a separate list of start times, and sort that as well.\n\nWait, here's another idea: for each group d, we have two lists:\n\n- sorted_end: sorted by end time.\n\n- sorted_start: sorted by start time.\n\nSo, for a given i:\n\n1. In the group d, for the sorted_end list, find all j's where end <= i.li. For each such j, if j is not i, add to possible candidates.\n\n2. In the group d, for the sorted_start list, find all j's where start >= i.ri. For each such j, if j is not i, add to possible candidates.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, for each group d, we have:\n\nsorted_end = sorted list of (end, ...), and\n\nsorted_start = sorted list of (start, ...).\n\nWait, but the start and end of j's are in the tuples. So, perhaps for each group, we can create two separate lists:\n\n- sorted_end_list: each element is a tuple (end, li, ri, costi, index). Sorted by end.\n\n- sorted_start_list: each element is a tuple (start, li, ri, costi, index). Sorted by start.\n\nWait, but for each group, this requires O(n) space, which is acceptable.\n\nThen, for each i:\n\nd = x - (ri - li + 1)\n\nif d is not in the groups, continue.\n\ngroup = groups[d]\n\nIn group.sorted_end_list, find all j's where end <= li.\n\nThis can be done via binary search on the end values. So, in the sorted_end_list, find the largest end <= li. All elements before that index are candidates.\n\nFor each j in the sublist up to that index:\n\n   if j.index != i.index, compute cost and track min.\n\nSimilarly, for the group.sorted_start_list, find all j's where start >= ri.\n\nSince the sorted_start_list is sorted by start, we can binary search for the first j.start >= ri. All elements from that index onwards are candidates.\n\nFor each j in the sublist from that index:\n\n   if j.index != i.index, compute cost and track min.\n\nThis way, for each i, the operations are O(log k) for the binary searches, and then O(m) for the number of j's in the sublist for each case.\n\nBut the worst case is when m is O(n), which is 2e5, and for each i, that's 2e5 * 2e5 = 4e10 operations. Which is way too slow.\n\nSo this approach isn't feasible.\n\nHmm, I need a better way.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps, for each voucher i, we can precompute all possible j's that have duration x - d_i and do not overlap with i. But again, doing this naively is O(n^2).\n\nWait, but perhaps the non-overlapping condition can be rephrased. Let's see:\n\nThe two vouchers can't overlap, so either j ends before i starts, or i ends before j starts.\n\nWhich means, for a given i and j:\n\nj's end <= i's start, or i's end <= j's start.\n\nBut j has duration d_j = x - d_i.\n\nSo for each i, j must satisfy either:\n\nj_end <= i_li OR i_ri <= j_li.\n\nBut j's duration is d_j = x - d_i.\n\nSo, perhaps for each i, we can collect all j's in the group d_j, and then for each j in that group, check if the two conditions above hold.\n\nBut again, how to do this efficiently.\n\nWait, but perhaps for a given i, j's end is known, and j's start is known. So for each j in group d_j, we can compute whether j's end <= i_li or j's start >= i_ri.\n\nBut again, checking each j is O(n) per i.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be approached differently.\n\nLet me think about the minimal cost. The minimal cost would come from either:\n\n- A j that ends as early as possible before i starts, thus allowing a cheaper j.\n\n- Or a j that starts as late as possible after i ends, allowing a cheaper j.\n\nSo, perhaps for each group d, we can precompute the minimal cost for vouchers that end before a certain time, and vouchers that start after a certain time.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWe can model the problem as finding two intervals [li, ri] and [lj, rj], such that (ri - li + 1) + (rj - lj + 1) = x, and the intervals are non-overlapping.\n\nThe minimal cost is the sum of their costs.\n\nWe need to find the pair with the minimal sum.\n\nNow, for each possible pair of durations d1 and d2 where d1 + d2 = x, we can look for vouchers with these durations that don't overlap.\n\nSo, for each d1 in 1..x-1:\n\n   d2 = x - d1.\n\n   Find all vouchers with duration d1 and all vouchers with duration d2.\n\n   For each voucher i of duration d1, find vouchers j of duration d2 that don't overlap with i.\n\n   Track the minimal sum of i.cost + j.cost.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nWait, but the number of possible d1 and d2 pairs is up to x-1, which is up to 2e5. So for each pair, we need to process O(n) vouchers, which again could be O(n * 2e5) = 4e10 operations. Not feasible.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nLet's pre-sort all vouchers by their end times. Then, for each voucher i, we can find all vouchers j that end before i starts. Similarly, for vouchers that start after i ends.\n\nBut again, for each i, we need to find j's in the correct group (d = x - d_i) and non-overlapping.\n\nWait, perhaps for each voucher i, we can:\n\n1. Find in the group d = x - d_i, all j's that end before i's start. This can be done quickly if the group is sorted by end, and we perform a binary search for i's start.\n\n2. Similarly, find j's in the group d that start after i's end. Again, if the group is sorted by start, we can binary search for i's end.\n\nBut how to handle the group being sorted by end for the first case, and by start for the second.\n\nWait, perhaps for each group, we can have two separate sorted lists:\n\n- sorted by end.\n\n- sorted by start.\n\nSo, for each j in group d, we have:\n\nsorted_end: list of (end, cost, index), sorted by end.\n\nsorted_start: list of (start, cost, index), sorted by start.\n\nThen, for each i:\n\nCompute d = x - d_i.\n\nIf d not present, continue.\n\nElse:\n\n   For group d's sorted_end list, find all j where end <= li. Binary search for li, and find the rightmost j with end <= li.\n\n   For each such j, if j's index != i's index, add to possible candidates.\n\n   Then, for group d's sorted_start list, find all j where start >= ri.\n\n   For each such j, if j's index != i's index, add to possible candidates.\n\nBut again, for each i, this involves O(k) operations for the group, which could be O(n) in the worst case. So, it's still O(n^2), which is not feasible.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps we can pre-process for each possible duration, the minimal cost voucher that ends before a certain time, and the minimal cost voucher that starts after a certain time.\n\nWait, but the time ranges are up to 2e5, so it's unclear.\n\nWait, here's a different approach: for each group d, pre-sort the vouchers in the group by end time. Then, for each voucher i, when looking for j's in group d that end before i's start, we can find the maximum end in the group that is <= li, and take the minimal cost among those j's (since we want the minimal sum, which would be i's cost plus the minimal j's cost). Similarly, for j's in group d that start after i's end, we can find the minimal cost j that starts after ri.\n\nWait, this could be efficient because for each i, we can find the minimal cost j in the group d that meets either condition.\n\nSo, for each group d:\n\n   Sort the vouchers in group d by end time.\n\n   For each position in the sorted list, keep track of the minimal cost up to that point.\n\nSimilarly, sort the group by start time, and for each position, keep track of the minimal cost from that point onwards.\n\nThen, for a given i:\n\n   d = x - d_i.\n\n   If d not present, continue.\n\n   group_d = groups[d].\n\n   In group_d, find all j's where end <= li.\n\n      The best j is the one with the minimal cost in this subset.\n\n   Also, find all j's where start >= ri.\n\n      The best j is the one with the minimal cost in this subset.\n\nSo, for each i, we can compute two possible minimal costs:\n\n   cost1 = i.cost + minimal_cost_j_in_group_d_with_end_leq_li.\n\n   cost2 = i.cost + minimal_cost_j_in_group_d_with_start_geq_ri.\n\n   Then, the minimal between cost1 and cost2 is a candidate for the overall solution.\n\nBut how to find the minimal cost j in group_d where end <= li.\n\nBecause group_d is sorted by end, we can binary search for li, and then in the prefix up to that point, find the j with minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for group_d sorted by start, find the suffix where start >= ri, and find the minimal cost j.\n\nBut how to precompute these prefix and suffix minima.\n\nYes! Here's the plan:\n\nFor each group d:\n\n   Sort the vouchers in group d by end time. Create a list sorted_end.\n\n   Precompute a prefix_min array, where prefix_min[i] is the minimal cost among the first i+1 vouchers in sorted_end.\n\n   Similarly, sort the vouchers in group d by start time. Create a list sorted_start.\n\n   Precompute a suffix_min array, where suffix_min[i] is the minimal cost among vouchers from i to the end of sorted_start.\n\nThen, for each i:\n\n   Compute d = x - d_i.\n\n   If d not in groups, continue.\n\n   group_d = groups[d].\n\n   In group_d.sorted_end, find the largest end <= li. Let this be index k.\n\n   If k >= 0:\n\n      The minimal cost j in the first k+1 vouchers is prefix_min[k].\n\n      So cost1 = i.cost + prefix_min[k].\n\n   Else:\n\n      cost1 = infinity.\n\n   In group_d.sorted_start, find the first start >= ri. Let this be index m.\n\n   If m < len(sorted_start):\n\n      The minimal cost j in the suffix from m is suffix_min[m].\n\n      So cost2 = i.cost + suffix_min[m].\n\n   Else:\n\n      cost2 = infinity.\n\n   Then, the minimal cost for this i is min(cost1, cost2).\n\n   Update the global minimal cost.\n\nThis way, for each i, the operations are O(log k) for the binary searches and O(1) for fetching the min costs.\n\nThis approach reduces the problem from O(n^2) to O(n log n), which is manageable for n=2e5.\n\nSo now, the steps are:\n\n1. Read all vouchers and compute their durations.\n\n2. Group them into a dictionary, where each group is a list of vouchers with the same duration.\n\n3. For each group in the dictionary:\n\n   a. Sort the vouchers by end time, and compute the prefix_min array.\n\n   b. Sort the vouchers by start time, and compute the suffix_min array.\n\n4. Initialize the minimal cost to infinity.\n\n5. For each voucher i:\n\n   a. Compute d = x - (ri - li + 1). If d < 0, skip.\n\n   b. If d is not in the groups, continue.\n\n   c. Get group_d = groups[d].\n\n   d. In group_d.sorted_end, perform a binary search for li. Find the largest end <= li.\n\n      i. If found, get the minimal cost from prefix_min up to that index.\n\n   e. In group_d.sorted_start, perform a binary search for ri. Find the first start >= ri.\n\n      i. If found, get the minimal cost from suffix_min starting at that index.\n\n   f. Compute the possible cost contributions from both cases, if applicable.\n\n   g. Update the global minimal cost.\n\n6. After processing all vouchers, if the global minimal cost is still infinity, output -1. Otherwise, output the minimal cost.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nNow, implementing this.\n\nFirst, the data structures.\n\nEach group will have:\n\n- sorted_end: a list of tuples (end_time, cost, index), sorted by end_time.\n\n- prefix_min: a list where prefix_min[i] is the minimal cost in the first i+1 elements of sorted_end.\n\nSimilarly, sorted_start: a list of tuples (start_time, cost, index), sorted by start_time.\n\nsuffix_min: a list where suffix_min[i] is the minimal cost in the elements from i to the end of sorted_start.\n\nSo, for each group d, after sorting by end_time, we can compute the prefix_min:\n\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0].cost.\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i].cost).\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_start list:\n\nCompute the suffix_min from the end.\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1].cost.\n\nsuffix_min[i] = min(sorted_start[i].cost, suffix_min[i+1]).\n\nBut wait, in Python, lists are 0-based, so for a list of length m, the suffix_min has m elements.\n\nImplementing this.\n\nNow, the binary search for li in sorted_end.\n\nIn Python, the bisect module can be used. For each i's li, we can extract the end_times of the group's sorted_end, and use bisect_right to find the insertion point for li.\n\nThe index k would be bisect.bisect_right(end_times, li) - 1.\n\nBut wait, bisect_right returns the insertion point, so the largest end <= li is at index k = bisect_right(end_times, li) -1.\n\nIf k >=0, then the prefix_min[k] is the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_start list, we need to find the first start >= ri.\n\nSo, extract the start_times from sorted_start, and use bisect_left to find the first index m where start_times[m] >= ri.\n\nIf m < len(start_times), then the suffix_min[m] is the minimal cost.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nvouchers = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    l, r, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    duration = r - l + 1\n\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, c, duration) )\n\ngroups = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor voucher in vouchers:\n\n    l, r, c, d = voucher\n\n    groups[d].append( (l, r, c) )\n\nNow, for each group in groups, process them.\n\ngroup_data = {}\n\nfor d in groups:\n\n    # sort by end time\n\n    sorted_end = sorted(groups[d], key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    end_times = [x[1] for x in sorted_end]\n\n    # compute prefix_min\n\n    prefix_min = []\n\n    current_min = float('inf')\n\n    for x in sorted_end:\n\n        current_min = min(current_min, x[2])\n\n        prefix_min.append(current_min)\n\n    # sort by start time\n\n    sorted_start = sorted(groups[d], key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    start_times = [x[0] for x in sorted_start]\n\n    # compute suffix_min\n\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_start)\n\n    current_min = float('inf')\n\n    for i in reversed(range(len(sorted_start))):\n\n        current_min = min(current_min, sorted_start[i][2])\n\n        suffix_min[i] = current_min\n\n    # store group data\n\n    group_data[d] = {\n\n        'sorted_end': sorted_end,\n\n        'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n\n        'end_times': end_times,\n\n        'sorted_start': sorted_start,\n\n        'start_times': start_times,\n\n        'suffix_min': suffix_min,\n\n    }\n\nWait, but in the group, each voucher is a tuple (l, r, c). So in the group_data, we have to keep track of the original index, or else we can't distinguish between different vouchers.\n\nWait, no. Because each voucher is processed as a separate entity, and in the group, each voucher is a tuple (l, r, c). But when we later process i, which is a voucher (l, r, c, duration), we can't refer back to the group's vouchers by their (l, r, c), because multiple vouchers can have the same l, r, c.\n\nThus, this approach is incorrect because it's possible for two different vouchers to have the same (l, r, c), leading to j being the same voucher as i.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to track the index of each voucher in the group.\n\nThus, when building the groups, each voucher should be stored with its index.\n\nSo, initial code adjustment:\n\nvouchers = []\n\nfor idx in range(n):\n\n    l, r, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    duration = r - l + 1\n\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, c, duration, idx) )\n\ngroups = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor voucher in vouchers:\n\n    l, r, c, d, idx = voucher\n\n    groups[d].append( (l, r, c, idx) )\n\nThen, for each group d in groups:\n\nsorted_end = sorted(groups[d], key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n...\n\nSimilarly, for the group data, each voucher in the group has its index.\n\nThus, when processing i, which is a voucher with index idx_i, when looking for j's in the group, we can compare their idx to idx_i.\n\nThus, in the group_data for each d:\n\nsorted_end contains tuples (l, r, c, idx), sorted by r.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_start.\n\nSo, when processing i:\n\nfor i in vouchers:\n\n    l_i, r_i, c_i, d_i, idx_i = i\n\n    d = x - d_i\n\n    if d not in group_data:\n\n        continue\n\n    group = group_data[d]\n\n    # process group's sorted_end\n\n    end_times = group['end_times']\n\n    k = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, l_i) - 1\n\n    if k >= 0:\n\n        min_cost_j = group['prefix_min'][k]\n\n        if min_cost_j is not None:\n\n            total_cost = c_i + min_cost_j\n\n            if total_cost < global_min:\n\n                global_min = total_cost\n\n    # process group's sorted_start\n\n    start_times = group['start_times']\n\n    m = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, r_i)\n\n    if m < len(start_times):\n\n        min_cost_j = group['suffix_min'][m]\n\n        if min_cost_j is not None:\n\n            total_cost = c_i + min_cost_j\n\n            if total_cost < global_min:\n\n                global_min = total_cost\n\nBut wait, the group's sorted_end and sorted_start have the vouchers sorted by end and start respectively, and each has the index.\n\nThus, in the group's prefix_min, each entry is the minimal cost up to that index in the sorted_end list.\n\nSimilarly, in the suffix_min, each entry is the minimal cost from that index onwards in the sorted_start list.\n\nBut in the group's prefix_min and suffix_min arrays, the minimal cost is stored, not the voucher's index. So, for each j in the group, the minimal cost is the minimal of all possible j's in the required subset.\n\nBut wait, the prefix_min[k] is the minimal cost among the first k+1 vouchers in the sorted_end list. So, for a given i, when we find j's in the group d where end <= l_i, the minimal cost j is the one with the minimal cost among these j's. So, for i, the cost is c_i plus this minimal j's cost.\n\nBut we have to make sure that j's index is different from i's.\n\nWait, but in the group's prefix_min, we have the minimal cost, but we don't know which j it is. So, it's possible that j is i itself. Because, for example, if the group d contains i, and in the subset, i is the minimal cost, then when adding j = i, the cost would be c_i + c_i, but j must be a different voucher.\n\nThus, the approach above would incorrectly count i as a valid j in some cases.\n\nHence, this is a flaw in the approach.\n\nSo, how to handle this?\n\nAh, this is a problem. Because the prefix_min and suffix_min arrays only track the minimal cost, not the voucher's index. So, when the minimal cost comes from j = i, we have to skip it.\n\nThus, the approach needs to be modified to account for this.\n\nSo, the revised approach is:\n\nFor each i, when considering group d:\n\n   For the sorted_end list, find the j's with end <= li.\n\n      Among these j's, find the one with the minimal cost that is not i.\n\n   Similarly for the sorted_start list.\n\nBut this complicates the approach because we can't rely on the prefix_min array anymore.\n\nAlternative Idea: Instead of precomputing the prefix_min and suffix_min, for each i, when looking for j's in the group, iterate through the candidates in the group and find the minimal cost.\n\nBut that's not feasible due to time constraints.\n\nWait, but perhaps the minimal cost can be achieved by including j's that are not i.\n\nBut perhaps we can ignore the case where i and j are the same, and then adjust.\n\nWait, but the problem states that exactly two vouchers are needed, so i and j must be different.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the vouchers are distinct, but it's possible for two vouchers to have the same duration.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, we need exactly two vouchers, so i and j must be different.\n\nThus, in code, we have to ensure that i and j are different.\n\nSo, during the selection, the code must select two vouchers with the same duration and not overlapping.\n\nBut the core issue is that the initial approach may include the same voucher as a candidate for both i and j, which can lead to the same voucher being selected.\n\nWait, but the problem says that we need exactly two vouchers. So, each voucher is independent.\n\nThus, for each voucher, we can use it as i or j, but not both.\n\nSo, the initial approach is to find two vouchers i and j, which don't overlap, with durations adding up to x.\n\nBut the problem is that the initial approach of considering all j's in the group d may include i.\n\nSo, perhaps, the initial approach is to find all possible pairs, but given that the problem requires that the vouchers do not overlap.\n\nBut going back to the problem, perhaps the sample is better.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\n4 5\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 3 4\n\n1 2 5\n\n1 2 5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5 6 1\n\n1 2 4 1\n\n3 5 4\n\nSo, for the first sample, the correct vouchers are the first and third vouchers.\n\nWait, but in that case, the two vouchers are non-overlapping.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the two vouchers can't overlap.\n\nSo, the initial approach may have included cases where i and j are the same voucher, but the problem requires i and j to be different.\n\nThus, the code must avoid selecting the same voucher twice.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers such that their durations sum up exactly to a given value `x` and their combined cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return `-1`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers based on their duration. This helps in quickly finding pairs of vouchers with the required total duration.\n2. **Sort and Precompute Minima**: For each group of vouchers with the same duration, we sort them by their end time and compute the prefix minimum cost array. Similarly, we sort them by their start time and compute the suffix minimum cost array. These arrays help in efficiently finding the minimum cost voucher that does not overlap with the current voucher.\n3. **Binary Search for Non-Overlapping Vouchers**: For each voucher, we use binary search to find potential non-overlapping vouchers in the required duration group. We check both cases where the other voucher ends before the current one starts and where it starts after the current one ends.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(data[idx])\n    x = int(data[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    vouchers = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        l = int(data[idx])\n        r = int(data[idx+1])\n        c = int(data[idx+2])\n        idx +=3\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        vouchers.append( (l, r, c, duration, i) )\n    \n    # Group vouchers by duration\n    groups = defaultdict(list)\n    for v in vouchers:\n        d = v[3]\n        groups[d].append(v)\n    \n    group_data = {}\n    for d in groups:\n        group = groups[d]\n        # Sort by end time\n        sorted_end = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n        prefix_min = []\n        current_min = float('inf')\n        for v in sorted_end:\n            current_min = min(current_min, v[2])\n            prefix_min.append(current_min)\n        \n        # Sort by start time\n        sorted_start = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n        suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_start)\n        current_min = float('inf')\n        for i in reversed(range(len(sorted_start))):\n            current_min = min(current_min, sorted_start[i][2])\n            suffix_min[i] = current_min\n        \n        group_data[d] = {\n            'sorted_end': sorted_end,\n            'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n            'end_times': end_times,\n            'sorted_start': sorted_start,\n            'start_times': start_times,\n            'suffix_min': suffix_min\n        }\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for voucher in vouchers:\n        l_i, r_i, c_i, d_i, idx_i = voucher\n        d_needed = x - d_i\n        if d_needed < 0:\n            continue\n        if d_needed not in group_data:\n            continue\n        group = group_data[d_needed]\n        \n        # Case 1: j ends <= l_i\n        end_times = group['end_times']\n        k = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, l_i) - 1\n        if k >= 0:\n            min_j_cost = group['prefix_min'][k]\n            total_cost = c_i + min_j_cost\n            if total_cost < min_total and idx_i != group['sorted_end'][k][4]:\n                min_total = total_cost\n        \n        # Case 2: j starts >= r_i\n        start_times = group['start_times']\n        m = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, r_i)\n        if m < len(start_times):\n            min_j_cost = group['suffix_min'][m]\n            total_cost = c_i + min_j_cost\n            if total_cost < min_total and idx_i != group['sorted_start'][m][4]:\n                min_total = total_cost\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input and Grouping**: The input is read and vouchers are stored with their duration and index.
