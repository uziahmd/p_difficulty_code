Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Cards.\" Hmm. Let me read the description carefully.\n\nSo, Vanya has some cards with numbers on them. Each number can be positive, negative, or zero, but their absolute value doesn't exceed x. Natasha hid all his cards, but he found n of them. He wants the sum of all the found cards to be zero. But right now, the sum isn't zero. So, he needs to find some more cards (from the infinite supply of -x to x) to add to the found ones so that the total sum is zero. Our task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find.\n\nWait, but how do we determine which cards to add? Because each card can have any value as long as it's within [-x, x]. So the problem reduces to finding the smallest number of integers (each between -x and x) that when added to the current sum, make it zero.\n\nLet me rephrase: We have a current sum S. We need to find the minimal k such that there exists a set of k integers, each in [-x, x], whose sum is -S.\n\nBut wait, no, because the sum after adding those k integers should be zero. So the sum of the found cards plus the sum of the new cards equals zero. So the sum of the new cards must be equal to -S_found.\n\nSo our problem is to find the minimal k where -S_found can be expressed as the sum of k integers, each between -x and x.\n\nHmm. So the first step is to calculate the current sum S of the found cards. Then, we need to find the minimal k such that there exists k numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k, each in [-x, x], such that a_1 + a_2 + ... +a_k = -S.\n\nWhat's the minimal possible k?\n\nWell, let's think about the maximum possible sum for k numbers: each can be at most x. So the max sum is k*x. Similarly, the min sum is -k*x.\n\nWe need -S to be in the interval [-k*x, k*x]. So for a given k, if -k*x <= -S <= k*x, then it's possible.\n\nWait, but since the sum of the new cards is -S, let me denote T = -S. So we need T to be expressible as the sum of k numbers, each in [-x, x].\n\nSo T must satisfy: |T| ≤ k*x.\n\nMoreover, the minimal k is the smallest integer such that |T| ≤ k*x. Because if |T| is less than or equal to k*x, then it's possible to choose the sum. For example, if T is positive, you can have T/x times x, and the rest 0. Or similar.\n\nWait, no. Wait, T is the target sum. So the condition is that |T| ≤ k * x. Because each of the k numbers can contribute up to x towards the sum, either positively or negatively.\n\nSo for each possible k, starting from 1 upwards, check if |T| ≤ k * x. The smallest such k is the answer.\n\nYes! Because if |T| is less than or equal to k*x, then it's possible to find such k numbers.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n2. Compute T = -S. Because the sum of the new cards must be T to make the total sum zero.\n3. Find the minimal k such that |T| ≤ k * x.\n\nWait, but wait. What if T is zero? Then k can be zero. But in the problem statement, the output is the minimal number of cards needed. So if T is zero, then no additional cards are needed.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input ensures that the found cards' sum is not zero. Because Vanya wants to find more cards to make the sum zero. So in the problem, we can assume that T is non-zero.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that Natasha hid all his cards, and Vanya found n of them. So if the sum of the found cards is already zero, then Vanya doesn't need to find any more cards. But according to the input examples, maybe that case isn't covered. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample input: 3 2, cards are -1, 1, 2. Sum is 2. So T is -2. So minimal k is 1, because 2 <= 2*1 → yes.\n\nSecond sample: 2 3, cards are -2, -2. Sum is -4. So T is 4. So 4 <= 3*k → minimal k",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his found cards equals zero. Each card can have a number between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: Compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: The target sum for the additional cards is the negative of the current sum. This is because the sum of the found cards plus the sum of the additional cards must equal zero.\n3. **Find Minimum Additional Cards**: The goal is to find the smallest number of additional cards (k) such that their sum can equal the target sum. This is possible if the absolute value of the target sum is less than or equal to k times x. The smallest such k is the answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\ntarget = -s\n\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    t = abs(target)\n    k = (t + x - 1) // x  # Ceiling division\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of found cards and the maximum absolute value of the cards. It then reads the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed.\n3. **Target Sum**: The target sum for the additional cards is calculated as the negative of the current sum.\n4. **Determine Minimum k**: Using ceiling division, the code calculates the smallest number of cards needed such that their sum can reach the target. This ensures each card's value does not exceed x in absolute value.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of additional cards required by leveraging basic arithmetic operations and properties of integer division.",
