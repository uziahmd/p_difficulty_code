The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Neko Finds Grapes.\" Hmm, sounds interesting. So, Neko found some treasure chests and keys, and she wants to open as many chests as possible using the keys.\n\nLet me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, each chest has a number a_i, and each key has a number b_j. To unlock a chest i with a key j, their sum must be odd. That means a_i + b_j is congruent to 1 mod 2. Which simplifies to (a_i is even and b_j is odd) or (a_i is odd and b_j is even). Oh right, because even plus odd is odd, and odd plus even is also odd.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum number of chests that can be opened by using the keys optimally. Each key can be used only once, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the first thing I think is that we need to count how many chests are even and how many are odd, and similarly for the keys. Then, depending on whether a key is used on an even or odd chest, we can determine the maximum possible matches.\n\nWait, but it's more than just counts. Because when you match a key with a chest, you have to pair them in a way that their parity allows it. But how do we maximize the number of pairs?\n\nLet me break it down.\n\nEach key can be either even or odd. Similarly, each chest can be even or odd. For a key to unlock a chest, the key's parity must be different from the chest's. Because:\n\n- If the chest is even, the key must be odd.\n- If the chest is odd, the key must be even.\n\nSo, suppose we have:\n\n- C_even: number of chests with even a_i\n- C_odd: number of chests with odd a_i\n- K_even: number of keys with even b_j\n- K_odd: number of keys with odd b_j\n\nNow, the total possible pairs would be the minimum between C_even and K_odd, plus the minimum between C_odd and K_even. Because:\n\n- Even chests can be unlocked by odd keys.\n- Odd chests can be unlocked by even keys.\n\nBut wait, that's not exactly correct. Because each key can be used once, and each chest once. So the problem is similar to matching two sets with certain constraints.\n\nWait, but perhaps the optimal approach is to take the maximum possible from these two options.\n\nSo, the maximum number of chests is min(C_even + K_odd, total_chests). Wait, no. Because the sum of those two minima might exceed the total available chests.\n\nWait, let's think again. The maximum number of chests that can be unlocked is the minimum of:\n\n- The number of even chests plus the number of odd keys (since even chests need odd keys, and odd chests need even keys)\nBut no, that doesn't quite capture it. Because each key can only be used once. So perhaps the maximum possible is the sum of the minimum between C_even and K_odd and the minimum between C_odd and K_even. But wait, no, because that sum could be more than the total chests.\n\nWait, for example, if C_even is 5, K_odd is 10, then you can only use 5 keys (the K_odd ones) to open C_even chests. Similarly, if C_odd is 3 and K_even is 4, then you can use 3 keys (from K_even) to open 3 chests.\n\nSo the total would be 5 + 3 = 8 chests, but that's only possible if there are enough keys.\n\nWait, but the sum cannot exceed the total number of keys, because each key is used once. Similarly, it can't exceed the number of chests.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum number of chests is the minimum between (C_even + C_odd) and (K_odd + K_even), but that's always equal to n + m since both are the same as the total chests and keys, respectively. No, wait, n and m can be up to 1e5, but the maximum chests is min(n, ...).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the maximum possible as the minimum of (number of even chests + number of even keys) and the maximum between (C_even + K_odd) and (C_odd + K_even), but I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, let me model this as a bipartite graph where on one side are the chests and on the other are the keys. An edge exists between a chest i and key j if a_i + b_j is odd. We need to find a matching where each key is matched to at most one chest, and each chest is matched to at most one key. The goal is to maximize the number of chests matched",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the keys. Each key can unlock a chest if their sum is odd. The approach involves counting the parities of the chests and keys to maximize the number of possible matches.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count how many chests have even and odd values. Similarly, count how many keys have even and odd values.\n2. **Match Even and Odd**: For each type of chest (even or odd), determine how many keys of the opposite parity can be used to unlock them. This gives us two potential matches:\n   - Even chests can be unlocked using odd keys.\n   - Odd chests can be unlocked using even keys.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Matches**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys. This ensures that we use each key and chest optimally without exceeding their limits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Count the number of even and odd in a and b\nca_even = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nca_odd = n - ca_even\n\ncb_even = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\ncb_odd = m - cb_even\n\n# The maximum possible is the sum of the minimum of each possible pair\nmax_c = min(ca_even, cb_odd) + min(ca_odd, cb_even)\n\nprint(max_c)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Counting Parities**: We count how many chests are even and odd, and similarly for the keys. This helps us quickly determine which keys can unlock which chests based on their parities.\n- **Matching Strategy**: By matching even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys, we ensure that each key is used optimally. The sum of these matches gives the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach efficiently computes the result in linear time, making it suitable for large inputs up to the given constraints.",
