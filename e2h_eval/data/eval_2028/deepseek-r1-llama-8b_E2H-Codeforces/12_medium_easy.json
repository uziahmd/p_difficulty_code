The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, Xenia is in a city with houses arranged in a ring, right? She needs to do some tasks, and each task requires her to be at a specific house. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks.\n\nWait, the problem says that each task i must be done after all tasks j where j < i. Oh, right, because the list is given in order. So for each task ai, she must reach it after completing all previous ones.\n\nHmm, how do I model this? Well, let's think about the movement. The ring road is circular, so moving from house n to 1 takes one unit of time as well, since it's a ring.\n\nSo, Xenia starts at house 1. Then for each task, she has to go to the next required house. But wait, the tasks are given in order, so maybe she can process them sequentially.\n\nBut how does the sequence work? Like, she can't skip a task; each must be done in the order given. So for each task, she must move from her current position to the new ai, and then do all subsequent tasks from there.\n\nWait, but the key here is that for each task i, she must have already done all j < i. So the order of processing is fixed. So the main thing is to calculate the minimal steps to go through each required house in order.\n\nBut considering that the ring is circular, the distance between two points can be computed as the minimum of clockwise or counter-clockwise steps. However, since the traffic is one way and clockwise, she can only move in the clockwise direction. Wait no, the ringroad is one way and clockwise. So she can't move against the flow. That means, when she's at a certain house, she can only move to the next higher-numbered house in a clockwise direction. Oh, wait, the ring is a circle, so after n comes 1 again.\n\nWait, no. The ring is one way and the direction is clockwise. So the movement is always from lower-numbered house to higher, wrapping around. For example, if she's at 4 and the next is 1, she can only move clockwise, which would take her to 1, then 2, etc.\n\nWait, that's not entirely accurate. Because in a ring, each house is connected to two others: the next higher and the previous. But since the ring is one-way and the traffic is clockwise, the only allowed movement is from a house to its next in the clockwise direction. So, for house i, the next is i+1, except for n, whose next is 1.\n\nSo, the path is 1 → 2 → 3 → ... →n →1 →2 and so on.\n\nIn that case, the movement is constrained: she can't go back, she can only move forward in the ring.\n\nSo, to model her movement, she starts at 1. Then for each task ai in the list, she needs to reach ai, but she must also make sure that all previous tasks are done. So perhaps, the minimal path is the sum of the distances between consecutive required houses, considering that she might have to go around the ring.\n\nWait, let's take the example given:\n\nIn the first test case, input is 4 3, with tasks 3,2,3.\n\nShe starts at 1. Then she needs to do the first task at 3. So from 1 to 3: the distance is 2 (1→2→3). Then the second task is at 2. But wait, from 3, she can't go back to 2 because the ring is one-way. So she must go 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps. Then the third task is at 3 again. From 2, she can't go back, so she goes 2→3, which is 1 step. So total steps are 2 + 3 +1 =6.\n\nYes, that's the sample.\n\nSo, the idea is to process the tasks in order, and for each ai, compute the minimal steps needed to get from the previous house to ai, considering the one-way ring movement.\n\nBut wait, what if the next ai is before the previous house in the clockwise direction? Like, suppose you're at house 4, and the next task is at 2. Since the ring is one-way, you can't go back. So you have to go 4→1→2, which is 2 steps.\n\nSo the distance between two points i and j is (j - i) mod n, but since we can't go backwards, that's the correct way.\n\nWait, no. Because the movement is only clockwise, so the distance from a to b is (b - a) % n. Because if a > b, then you have to go around the ring.\n\nFor example, a=3, b=2: (2-3) mod 4 is (-1) mod4=3. So the distance is 3 steps: 3→4→1→2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Sort the tasks in the order they are given. Because each task i must be processed after all j <i.\n\nWait, no, the list is already in order. So the order is a1, a2, ..., am.\n\nSo, for each task in the list, starting from the previous position, compute the minimal steps needed to reach the current a_i.\n\nThe initial position is 1.\n\nThen for each a_i in the list:\n\n- Compute the distance from the previous position to a_i.\n\n- Add that to the total time.\n\n- Update the previous position to a_i.\n\nSumming all these distances gives the total time.\n\nWait, but what if the same a_i appears multiple times? Like in the sample, where the last task is 3 again. So, in that case, she has to go from the previous position (which was 2) to 3, which is 1 step.\n\nSo, yes, the approach is to process each a_i in the list, in order, and for each, compute the steps from the previous position to a_i.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize prev = 1, total_time =0.\n\nFor each a in the list:\n\n   distance = (a - prev) % n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   prev = a\n\nReturn total_time.\n\nWait, but let's test this with the sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=4, m=3, list [3,2,3]\n\nprev starts at 1.\n\nFirst a=3: (3-1)%4=2. So add 2. total is 2. prev is 3.\n\nSecond a=2: (2-3) mod4= ( -1 ) mod4=3. Add 3. total is 5. prev is 2.\n\nThird a=3: (3-2)=1. Add 1. total is 6. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput is 4 3, and list [2,3,3].\n\nProcessing:\n\nprev=1.\n\na=2: (2-1)=1. total=1. prev=2.\n\na=3: (3-2)=1. total=2. prev=3.\n\na=3: 0 steps. total remains 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: what if the list is all 1s?\n\nn=5, m=3, list [1,1,1]. Then each a is 1.\n\nprev=1.\n\na=1: (1-1)=0. No steps added.\n\nSame for the rest. Total time is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, list [2,1].\n\nprev=1.\n\na=2: (2-1)=1. total=1.\n\na=1: (1-2) mod2= ( -1 ) mod2=1. total=2.\n\nBut wait, how? Because the ring is 1→2→1→2... So from 2 to 1, she can't go back. So she must go 2→1, which is one step. So yes, the total is 2.\n\nWait, but in the code, (1-2) mod2 is ( -1 ) mod2=1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Read the list of a's.\n\n- Initialize prev=1, total=0.\n\n- For each a in the list:\n\n   compute distance = (a - prev) % n.\n\n   add to total.\n\n   set prev = a.\n\n- Output the total.\n\nNow, in code, how to handle the modulo operation correctly.\n\nIn Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. So (a - prev) can be negative, but (a - prev) %n will give the correct positive number of steps.\n\nFor example, a=2, prev=3, n=4: (2-3)=-1 mod4=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read the list of a's as integers.\n\nCompute as per above.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All a's are 1.\n\nLike n=5, m=10. Each step adds 0, so total is 0.\n\nCase 2: a's are in increasing order, but wrap around.\n\nE.g., n=5, a's are 1,2,3,4,5,1,2.\n\nEach step is 1,1,1,1,1, (1-5)= -4 mod5=1.\n\nTotal is 5+1=6.\n\nAnother case: a's are 5,4,3,2,1.\n\nStarting at 1.\n\na=5: distance is 4 steps (1→2→3→4→5).\n\na=4: distance is 1 step (5→1 is not possible because movement is clockwise. Wait, no, from 5, next is 1. So from 5 to 4: can't go back. So the path is 5→1→2→3→4: 3 steps.\n\nWait, according to our formula, (4-5) mod5= (-1) mod5=4. So 4 steps. But according to actual movement, it's 5→1 (1 step), 1→2 (another), 2→3, 3→4: 4 steps. Yes, correct.\n\nSo the code would correctly compute 4 steps for this transition.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nWe need to read the input. The first line is n and m. Second line is m integers.\n\nIn code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprev = 1\ntotal = 0\n\nfor a in a_list:\n    distance = (a - prev) % n\n    total += distance\n    prev = a\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what about if the a's are not in order? Like, if the list is not sorted. But the problem says that the list is given in the order of the tasks, meaning that each task i must be done after j <i. So the order is fixed. So the code doesn't need to sort anything.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTesting it with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nCode:\n\nprev=1.\n\na=3: (3-1)=2. total=2.\n\na=2: (2-3)=-1 mod4=3. total=5.\n\na=3: (3-2)=1. total=6. Output 6.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3.\n\nprev=1.\n\na=2: 1 step. total=1.\n\na=3: 1 step. total=2.\n\na=3: 0 steps. total=2.\n\nSo output 2.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a_list=[2,1].\n\nprev=1.\n\na=2: 1 step. total=1.\n\na=1: (1-2)= -1 mod2=1. total=2.\n\nSo output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=5, a_list = [5,4,3,2,1].\n\nprev=1.\n\na=5: (5-1)=4. total=4.\n\na=4: (4-5)= -1 mod5=4. total=8.\n\na=3: (3-4)= -1 mod5=4. total=12.\n\na=2: (2-3)= -1 mod5=4. total=16.\n\na=1: (1-2)= -1 mod5=4. total=20.\n\nSo output is 20.\n\nWhich is correct because the path is 1→2→3→4→5→1→2→3→4→5→1→2→3→4→5→1, which is 20 steps.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, from 1 to 5 is 4 steps (1→2→3→4→5). Then from 5 to4: can't go back. So 5→1→2→3→4: 4 steps. Then 4→3: same way, 4 steps. 3→2: 4 steps. 2→1:4 steps. So 4+4*4= 4+16=20. Yes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks given that she can only move in a clockwise direction around a ring-shaped road. Each task must be completed in the order they are given, starting from house 1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she can only move in a clockwise direction on the ring road. The movement from one house to its next clockwise house takes exactly one unit of time.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each task, calculate the minimum steps required to move from the current house to the next required house. Since the ring is circular, moving from a higher-numbered house to a lower-numbered one will wrap around the ring.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Initialize the starting position at house 1.\n   - For each task in the list, compute the clockwise distance from the current position to the task's house using modulo arithmetic to handle wrap-around.\n   - Sum these distances to get the total time required.\n\n4. **Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(m) time, where m is the number of tasks, making it efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprev = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor a in a_list:\n    distance = (a - prev) % n\n    total_time += distance\n    prev = a\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line reads the list of houses where each task must be completed.\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with a total time of 0.\n- **Processing Each Task**: For each task, calculate the clockwise distance from the current house to the task's house using modulo arithmetic. Update the total time and the current position.\n- **Output**: Print the total time after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ring road.",
