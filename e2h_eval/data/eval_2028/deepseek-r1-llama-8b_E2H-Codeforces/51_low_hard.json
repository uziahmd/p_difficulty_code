Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Amusing Joke\" and from the description, it sounds like we need to determine if a pile of letters can be rearranged to form the guest's name and the host's name without any extra letters. Hmm.\n\nSo the input consists of three lines: the first is the guest's name, the second is the host's name, and the third is the pile of letters found. We need to check if combining the letters of the guest and host names gives exactly the pile, with no extras.\n\nRight, so the approach here is to compare the combined letters of the two names with the letters in the pile. If they match exactly in terms of frequency, then output YES; otherwise, NO.\n\nHow do I do that? Well, one way is to count the frequency of each character in the guest and host names, combine them, and then compare with the frequency of the pile.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Read the three input lines.\n2. Concatenate the first two strings (guest + host) into one string.\n3. Count the frequency of each character in this concatenated string.\n4. Do the same for the pile string.\n5. Compare the two frequency dictionaries. If they are identical, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but how to handle the case where the lengths don't match? Oh right, because if the total number of characters in guest and host is not equal to the pile, then it's immediately a NO. So maybe before even counting, we can check the length.\n\nYes, that's a good point. So step 0: check if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, return NO.\n\nOtherwise, proceed to count the letters.\n\nIn Python, how do I count the frequency? Well, the collections.Counter class is perfect for this. It creates a dictionary-like object where the keys are the characters and the values are their counts.\n\nSo, let's outline the code:\n\n- Read the three lines: guest = input().strip(), host = input().strip(), pile = input().strip()\n- combined = guest + host\n- if len(combined) != len(pile): print 'NO' and exit.\n- create counter_combined = Counter(combined)\n- create counter_pile = Counter(pile)\n- if counter_combined == counter_pile: print 'YES' else 'NO'\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, are there any edge cases? For example, when one of the lines is empty? But the problem statement says all lines are not empty, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nWhat about case sensitivity? Oh, the problem says all lines contain uppercase Latin letters, so no issues there.\n\nAnother edge case: what if the sum of guest and host is longer than the pile? Or shorter? Well, the initial length check takes care of that.\n\nLet me test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first line is the guest, second the host, third the pile. So the output is YES, NO, NO.\n\nWait, the sample output is ['YES', 'NO', 'NO'], but looking at the note, the first sample returns YES because the letters match exactly.\n\nSo according to the code, for the first case, combined length is len(guest) + len(host), which should equal len(pile). Then the counters must match.\n\nI think the code will handle that correctly.\n\nAnother test case: what if the guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", and pile is \"AA\"? Then the code would return YES. If pile is \"AAA\", then it would return NO due to the initial length check.\n\nAnother test: guest is \"AB\", host is \"BC\", pile is \"ABC\". Then combined is \"ABBC\" (wait no, guest is AB, host is BC: combined is ABB C → no, wait wait: guest is \"AB\", host is \"BC\" → combined is \"ABBC\"? No, wait AB + BC is \"ABBC\"? Wait AB concatenated with BC is \"AB\"+\"BC\" = \"ABBC\"? Wait AB is two letters, BC is two letters: combined is four letters: A, B, B, C.\n\nSo the pile would have to have exactly these four letters. So if the pile is \"ABBC\", then yes. If it's \"ABCB\", then no.\n\nSo the code should correctly identify that.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python. Let's see.\n\nWe can read the three lines as follows:\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters can be rearranged to form the names of a guest and a host without any extra letters. The approach involves comparing the frequency of each character in the combined names with the frequency of characters in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the three lines of input which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names:** Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Check Lengths:** Ensure the combined length of the guest's and host's names is equal to the length of the pile. If not, immediately return \"NO\".\n4. **Count Frequencies:** Use a frequency counter to count the occurrences of each character in both the combined names and the pile.\n5. **Compare Frequencies:** If the frequency counters for the combined names and the pile are identical, print \"YES\". Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match of character frequencies, ensuring no extra or missing letters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    if len(combined) != len(pile):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    counter_combined = Counter(combined)\n    counter_pile = Counter(pile)\n    \n    if counter_combined == counter_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The code reads three lines from standard input, stripping any extraneous whitespace.\n- **Combining Names:** The guest's and host's names are concatenated to form a single string.\n- **Length Check:** Before proceeding, the code checks if the total number of characters in the combined names matches the number of characters in the pile. If they don't match, it prints \"NO\" and exits.\n- **Frequency Counting:** Using `collections.Counter`, the code counts the occurrences of each character in both the combined names and the pile.\n- **Comparison:** The frequency dictionaries are compared. If they are identical, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem constraints and ensures correctness by leveraging character frequency comparison.",
