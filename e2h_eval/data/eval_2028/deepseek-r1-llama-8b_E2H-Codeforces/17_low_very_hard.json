He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Prefixes and Suffixes.\" Hmm, Ivan has a string s of length n, and I don't know it. He tells me all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so lengths from 1 to n-1). But he doesn't say which are which—whether they're prefixes or suffixes. My task is to determine for each of the 2n-2 given strings whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the actual string s.\n\nWait, the output is a string of 'P's and 'S's where each character corresponds to one of the input strings. So for each input string, I need to decide if it's a prefix (mark as P) or a suffix (mark as S).\n\nThe first thing I need to figure out is how to determine the correct labels for each string. Since the problem says that the input is such that exactly two strings exist for each length, and that there exists at least one possible string s that satisfies all the conditions, I can work towards building s step by step.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Maybe I can reconstruct the string s based on the given information and then verify each input string's role.\n\nSo, the key idea is to find s such that for each string in the input, if it's a prefix, then s starts with it; if it's a suffix, s ends with it.\n\nBut how do I find s? Well, perhaps I can start by looking for the shortest possible string s that fits all the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this by considering the possible candidates for each position.\n\nWait, another thought: for any string t, if it's a prefix, then any longer string that starts with t is also a prefix. Similarly, if it's a suffix, any longer string ending with t is a suffix.\n\nWait, no. Because in the input, each length from 1 to n-1 has exactly two strings. So for each length l, the two strings could be both prefixes, both suffixes, or one prefix and one suffix.\n\nHmm, but for s of length n, the proper prefixes are those of length 1..n-1. Similarly for suffixes.\n\nSo for each l, there are two strings: let's call them a and b. Now, for a given s, the two strings for length l must satisfy either:\n\n- a is a prefix and b is a suffix,\n\nOR\n\n- a is a suffix and b is a prefix.\n\nWait, no. Because the two strings for each l are both either prefixes or suffixes? Or not necessarily.\n\nWait, no. For example, for l=1, both could be prefixes, or both could be suffixes, or one could be a prefix and the other a suffix.\n\nWait, but for s, the set of all prefixes includes all the shorter prefixes, so for l=2, the two strings may have one being the prefix of the other, or not. Not sure.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe the way to proceed is to find a way to reconstruct s by considering the overlaps between the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nLet me think about the possible structure. For s, the longest prefix and the longest suffix must be of the same length? Or not necessarily. Wait, no. For example, s could be 'ababa', whose longest prefix is 'abab' and the longest suffix is 'aba'.\n\nHmm, but perhaps the entire string can be built by considering the minimal and maximal possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find the correct s by checking for the maximum possible overlaps.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is as follows:\n\nWe can collect all the possible prefixes and suffixes and try to build s step by step.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For each possible length l (from 1 to n), determine what the l-length string could be based on the given inputs.\n\nBut wait, the input gives all the possible prefixes and suffixes for each l. So for each l, there are two possible strings: a and b.\n\nNow, for each l, these two could be either the two prefixes, or one prefix and one suffix, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, the two strings are the two possible prefixes for that length. Or, alternatively, they could be the two possible suffixes. Or, one could be a prefix and the other a suffix.\n\nBut how do I determine which is which?\n\nAnother approach: since s is of length n, the proper prefixes are of length 1 to n-1. So for l = n-1, the two strings must be the two possible prefixes of length n-1. But wait, no: because the proper prefixes include all lengths up to n-1. So for l = n-1, the two strings given are the two possible prefixes of length n-1.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether each of the given strings is a prefix or a suffix of the unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves reconstructing the unknown string `s` and then verifying the roles of each given string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest proper prefix and suffix of `s` can be determined by considering the maximum possible overlaps between the given strings.\n2. **Construct the String**: Using the identified overlaps, construct the string `s` step by step. This involves checking for the longest possible match at each step to ensure consistency with all given prefixes and suffixes.\n3. **Verify Each String**: Once the string `s` is constructed, verify each given string to determine if it is a prefix or a suffix of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nprefixes = {}\nsuffixes = {}\nfor _ in range(2 * n - 2):\n    s = input().strip()\n    l = len(s)\n    if l in prefixes:\n        if s == prefixes[l]:\n            continue\n        else:\n            suffixes[l].add(prefixes[l])\n            prefixes[l].add(s)\n    else:\n        if l in suffixes:\n            suffixes[l].add(s)\n            prefixes[l].add(s)\n        else:\n            prefixes[l] = {s}\n            suffixes[l] = {s}\n\nmax_len = n - 1\npossible_prefixes = prefixes.get(max_len, set())\npossible_suffixes = suffixes.get(max_len, set())\n\nif not possible_prefixes:\n    possible_prefixes.add(list(possible_suffixes)[0])\n\nelif len(possible_prefixes) > 1 and list(possible_prefixes)[0] in possible_suffixes:\n    possible_prefixes.add(list(possible_suffixes)[0])\n\nprefix_candidate = None\nfor p in possible_prefixes:\n    if prefix_candidate is None:\n        prefix_candidate = p\n    else:\n        if p.startswith(prefix_candidate):\n            pass\n        else:\n            break\n\nif prefix_candidate is None:\n    for p in possible_prefixes:\n        prefix_candidate = p\n        break\n\nsuffix_candidate = None\nfor s in possible_suffixes:\n    if suffix_candidate is None:\n        suffix_candidate = s\n    else:\n        if suffix_candidate.endswith(suffix_candidate):\n            pass\n        else:\n            break\n\nif suffix_candidate is None:\n    for s in possible_suffixes:\n        suffix_candidate = s\n        break\n\ns_list = [None] * (n + 1)\ns_list[0] = ''\ncurrent = s_list[n]\n\nfor i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n    candidates = []\n    if i in prefixes:\n        candidates.append((i, prefixes[i]))\n    if i in suffixes:\n        candidates.append((i, suffixes[i]))\n    if not candidates:\n        continue\n    for (l, candidate) in candidates:\n        if current[:l] == candidate:\n            new_s = current[:l] + chr(ord(current[l]) if l < n else 0)\n            s_list[i] = new_s\n            current = new_s\n            break\n\ns = s_list[1]\n\nresult = [''] * (2*n - 2)\nfor idx, s_input in enumerate(all_inputs):\n    if s.startswith(s_input):\n        result[idx] = 'P'\n    else:\n        result[idx] = 'S'\n\nprint(''.join(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of `2n-2` strings, which are read and stored in a dictionary where the keys are the lengths of the strings and the values are sets of strings of that length.\n2. **Identifying Candidates**: For each length from 1 to `n-1`, we identify potential prefixes and suffixes by checking overlaps.\n3. **Constructing the String**: We start from the longest possible prefix and suffix and iteratively build the string `s` by checking for valid extensions.\n4. **Verifying Each String**: After constructing `s`, each input string is checked to see if it is a prefix or a suffix of `s`, and the result is compiled into the final output string.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly identify the roles of each string as either a prefix or a suffix based on the constructed string `s`.",
