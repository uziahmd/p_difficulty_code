The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Rudolf and Snowflakes, hard version. Hmm. From the description, it's about determining whether a certain number of vertices can form a snowflake graph as defined.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step. \n\nThe snowflake is an undirected graph constructed in a specific way. Initially, there's one vertex. Then, each time, we add new vertices in a particular pattern. The initial step connects the single vertex to k new ones, where k is greater than 1. Then, for each vertex that has only one edge (so degree 1), we connect it to k new vertices. This last step must be done at least once.\n\nSo the structure is kind of like a tree, but with each node having k children, except for the leaves which must have been expanded at least once. Wait, no. Wait, the process is: after adding the first layer, every leaf (degree 1 node) must spawn another layer of k nodes. So the snowflake graph is built in layers, and each leaf must have their own expansion.\n\nSo the total number of vertices depends on how many times we do the expansion. But wait, the initial step is adding k nodes, making a total of 1 + k = k+1. Then, each of those k nodes becomes a parent, each adding k children. So the next layer adds k * k nodes, making the total 1 + k + k^2. But wait, because each of the k nodes from the first layer adds k children, so the third layer is k*k. Then, each of those leaves must also add k children, so the next layer would add k^3 nodes. But wait, the problem says that the step of adding new vertices to degree 1 nodes must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake has two steps beyond the initial setup.\n\nWait, let me clarify the process. The initial graph has one node. Then, the first step is adding k nodes connected to it. So now the total is k+1. Then, each of those k nodes is a leaf (degree 1). Now, the process says that each such leaf is connected to k new nodes. This step is done at least once. So the next step would add k * k nodes, leading to a total of 1 + k + k^2. But wait, the problem says that each step where a leaf is added is optional beyond the first? Or perhaps the process is that after the initial setup, each leaf is expanded exactly once. Or maybe each expansion step is done until no more leaves are left?\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the step should be done at least once. So the process starts with the initial node. Then, in the first expansion, it adds k nodes. Then, the next step is to expand each of these k nodes into k children. But this step is done at least once. So the minimal structure is when after adding the first layer, the second layer is added. So the minimal size is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nWait, no. Because the first expansion is adding k nodes. Then, the next step is expanding each of those k nodes into k children. So the total becomes 1 + k + k^2. But perhaps you can choose to expand further beyond that. Like, if you do the expansion again, each of the k^2 nodes will add k children each, leading to 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. And so on.\n\nSo the general structure is that the snowflake has layers, each layer being k^m for m starting from 0. The number of layers is determined by how many times the expansion is done. Since the expansion must be done at least once, the minimal case is two layers beyond the initial node: 1 + k + k².\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me think again. The initial step is adding k nodes, which is the first layer. Then, each of those nodes (the leaves) must add k children. That's the second step, which is done at least once. So the minimal structure is 1 +k +k². But perhaps the expansion can be done multiple times beyond that.\n\nSo, the total number of nodes is the sum of a geometric series. Let me model this.\n\nSuppose the expansion is done m times after the initial setup. Wait, no: the initial setup is just the root. Then, the first expansion adds k nodes (layer 1). Then, each of those nodes expands into k nodes (layer 2). Each expansion step adds a new layer. The process must perform at least one expansion step beyond the initial setup.\n\nSo, the total number of nodes N is:\n\nN = 1 + k*(1 + k + k² + ... + k^{m}) ), where m is at least 1.\n\nWait, no. Let me see: the initial node is 1. Then, each expansion step adds a new layer. So the first expansion adds k nodes, which is layer 1. The second expansion adds k² nodes (layer 2). The third expansion adds k³ nodes, etc. So the total is 1 + k + k² + ... + k^m, but wait, no. Because the initial setup is just 1. Then, each expansion adds a new layer. So if we perform m expansions, each adding a new layer, then the total is 1 + k*(1 + k + k² + ... +k^{m-1} ). Because the first expansion adds layer 1 (k nodes), the second adds layer 2 (k² nodes), etc. So the sum is 1 + k*( (k^m - 1)/(k-1) ) ).\n\nWait, let's think differently. The total number of nodes can be represented as a geometric series.\n\nFor example, in the minimal case, m=1 expansion: after initial node, first expansion adds k, then the second expansion adds k². So N = 1 + k + k².\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial node is 1. The first expansion (step 1) is adding k nodes, so N becomes 1 + k. Then, each of those k nodes must undergo expansion (since they are leaves) — that's step 2. So each adds k children, so N increases by k *k, making N = 1 +k +k².\n\nIf we do another expansion (step 3), each of the k² nodes adds k children, adding k^3 nodes. So N becomes 1 +k +k² +k^3.\n\nSo the general formula is N = 1 + k*( (k^{m} - 1)/(k-1) ), where m is the number of expansion steps beyond the initial setup.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial setup is 1 node. Then, each expansion step adds a new layer. For example:\n\nAfter 0 expansions beyond initial setup, N=1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial setup is the single node. Then, the first expansion step (adding layer 1) gives N=1 +k. The second expansion step adds layer 2, N=1 +k +k². The third adds layer 3, N=1 +k +k² +k³. So the sum is 1 + sum_{i=1 to m} k^i, where m is the number of expansion steps.\n\nWait, that's correct. So the sum is 1 + (k (k^m -1 )) / (k-1), since the sum of a geometric series starting from k and having m terms is k*(k^m -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo N = 1 + k*(k^m -1)/(k-1), for m >= 1.\n\nAlternatively, N = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, 1 + k + k² + ... +k^m is equal to (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So if the expansion steps are m, then N = 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nYes. So for m>=1, N must equal (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nWait, but wait: the initial setup is 1 node. Then, each expansion step adds a new layer. So the number of layers is m+1, including the initial node. So yes, N is the sum from i=0 to m of k^i, which equals (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut the problem says that the expansion step (adding new nodes to leaves) must be done at least once. So m must be at least 1. So the minimal case is m=1, giving N = 1 +k +k² = (k³-1)/(k-1).\n\nSo our task is, given n, determine whether there exists some k>1 and m>=1 such that n equals (k^{m+1}-1)/(k-1).\n\nNow, the problem reduces to checking for each n, whether it can be expressed as such a sum.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need an efficient way to check for all possible k and m.\n\nHmm, how can we approach this?\n\nFirst, note that for a fixed k, the possible values of n are of the form S(k, m) = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), for m >=1.\n\nSo for each n, we can try different k and see if n can be written as S(k, m) for some m>=1.\n\nBut since k can be up to sqrt(n), trying all possible k is not feasible for large n.\n\nAlternative approach: for each possible k, compute possible m's and see if S(k, m) equals n.\n\nBut even that might be too slow for 1e4 test cases.\n\nSo, perhaps, we can find all possible k's up to a certain limit and see if n can be represented in any of their S(k, m) forms.\n\nAlternatively, for a given n, iterate over possible k's and check if n can be represented as S(k, m).\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, the maximum possible k is about sqrt(n), which is 1e9 for n=1e18, but that's way too big to loop through for each test case.\n\nHmm, so perhaps, we can find all possible k's by considering the equation n*(k-1) +1 = k^{m+1}.\n\nWait, rearranged: n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). Multiply both sides by (k-1): n(k-1) = k^{m+1} -1.\n\nSo n(k-1) +1 = k^{m+1}.\n\nSo for each k, we can compute m such that k^{m+1} is equal to n(k-1)+1.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: for each possible k, we can compute the maximum possible exponent m where k^m could be part of the sum.\n\nWait, perhaps for each k, we can compute the maximum possible m such that k^{m} <= n.\n\nBut again, for large k, this isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative plan: Precompute for each possible m, and try to find k such that S(k, m) = n.\n\nWait, perhaps that's manageable.\n\nBecause m can be up to log_k(n), but since k is at least 2, m can't be more than log_2(1e18) which is about 60.\n\nSo for each test case n, iterate m from 2 upwards (since m must be at least 1, but for S(k, m) to be n, m+1 must be such that k^{m+1} is manageable).\n\nWait, let's think: for each possible m (number of expansion steps beyond the initial setup), we can try to find k such that S(k, m) = n.\n\nSo for each m starting from 1, up to a maximum possible value, compute what k would be, and check if it's an integer >1.\n\nSo the steps for each n:\n\nFor m in 1, 2, ..., up to log_2(n):\n\n   Compute possible k as follows:\n\n      Let s = (n*(k-1) +1) = k^{m+1}\n\n      So for a given m, we can compute k by solving for k in the equation.\n\n      But since n is known, perhaps we can binary search for k in the range [2, n^(1/(m+1)) +1].\n\nWait, for each m, we can compute k by solving n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nThis is a function of k, which is a monotonically increasing function for fixed m.\n\nThus, for each m, we can perform binary search on k to see if there exists a k>1 such that the equation holds.\n\nIf for any m, such a k exists, output YES; else, NO.\n\nSo the algorithm for each test case is:\n\nLoop m from 1 to max_m (where max_m is such that for m=1, k^2 <=n):\n\n   Binary search for k in [2, n^(1/(m+1)) + 1] such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) ==n.\n\nIf found, return YES.\n\nElse, after all m's, return NO.\n\nNow, the key is to find the upper limit for m.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible m for a given n?\n\nSince for m=1, the minimal n is when k=2: S(2,1) = 1+2+4=7. So for m=1, n can be 7, 15, etc., depending on k.\n\nWait, for m=1, the sum is 1 +k +k² = (k^3 -1)/(k-1).\n\nFor m=2, sum is 1 +k +k² +k³ = (k^4 -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo for each m, the minimal n is when k=2.\n\nFor m=1: 1+2+4=7.\n\nm=2: 1+2+4+8=15.\n\nm=3: 1+2+4+8+16=31.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo for a given n, the maximum m is such that the minimal n for m is less than or equal to n.\n\nThe minimal n for m is 2^{m+1} -1.\n\nWait, because when k=2, S(k, m) = 2^{m+1} -1.\n\nSo the minimal n for each m is 2^{m+1} -1.\n\nSo for a given n, the maximum possible m is up to log2(n) +1.\n\nBut since m can be up to around 60 for n=1e18, looping m up to 60 is feasible.\n\nSo for each test case, we can loop m from 1 to 60, and for each m, perform a binary search for k.\n\nBut wait, for each m, how do we find the upper bound for k?\n\nIn the equation: (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nWe can approximate this for large k: (k^{m+1})/(k-1) ≈ k^{m}.\n\nSo k^{m} ~ n => k ~ n^{1/m}.\n\nThus, for each m, the upper bound for k is n^(1/m) + 1.\n\nBut since m can be up to 60, for n=1e18, n^(1/60) is about e^(ln(1e18)/60) = e^(41/60* ln10) ≈ e^( (41/60)*2.3026) ≈ e^(1.09) ≈ 2.97. So for higher m, the upper bound for k is small.\n\nThus, for each m, the binary search can be limited to a small range.\n\nSo the steps for each test case are:\n\nFor each m in 1 to 60:\n\n   Compute low=2, high= n^(1/m) + 1.\n\n   Perform binary search on k between low and high:\n\n      For mid = (low+high)//2.\n\n      Compute S = (mid^{m+1} -1)/(mid -1).\n\n      Compare S with n.\n\n      If S <n: need larger k.\n\n      Else: need smaller k.\n\n      Continue until low <= high.\n\n   If any mid satisfies S==n, return YES.\n\nIf none found after all m, return NO.\n\nBut wait, computing mid^{m+1} can be a problem for large mid and m. For example, mid=1e9, m=60, mid^61 is way beyond 1e18, which is beyond the limits of 64-bit integers.\n\nSo we need a way to compute mid^{m+1} without causing overflow.\n\nAn alternative approach is to compute mid^power incrementally and check for overflow during the computation.\n\nSo, for a given mid and exponent e = m+1:\n\nCompute product = 1.\n\nFor i in 1..e:\n\n   product *= mid.\n\n   if product exceeds n, break and return early.\n\nBut this would take O(e) time per computation, which is acceptable since e is up to 60+1=61.\n\nSo, for each mid and e, compute product step by step, and if it exceeds n, we can stop and avoid overflow.\n\nThus, for each m, the binary search can proceed.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the code structure would be:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n   if n < 3: output NO (since minimal is 7 for m=1, k=2)\n\n   else:\n\n      for m in 1 to 60:\n\n          e = m +1\n\n          low = 2\n\n          high = n^(1/e) +1. But since n can be up to 1e18, and e is up to 61, n^(1/e) is manageable.\n\n          while low <= high:\n\n              mid = (low + high) //2\n\n              compute s = (mid^e -1)/(mid -1)\n\n              but compute mid^e carefully, stopping if it exceeds n.\n\n              if s <n: need larger mid.\n\n              elif s >n: need smaller mid.\n\n              else: exact match, return YES.\n\n      after all m, return NO.\n\nBut wait, for m=1, e=2. So for mid^2, compute (mid^2 -1)/(mid-1) = mid +1.\n\nSo for m=1, n must be 1 +k +k² = (k^3-1)/(k-1).\n\nWait, no, earlier analysis showed that for m=1, the sum is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nWhich is (k^3-1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2.\n\nSo for each m, e is m+1, and the sum is (mid^e -1)/(mid-1).\n\nSo, the code can compute s as follows:\n\ndef compute_s(mid, e):\n\n    if mid ==1:\n\n        return 0\n\n    s = 0\n\n    product = 1\n\n    for _ in range(e):\n\n        product *= mid\n\n        if product > n:\n\n            return n +1  # larger than n\n\n        s += product\n\n    return s\n\nWait, but for e=3, mid=2, s would be 1+2+4=7.\n\nWait, product is 1*2=2, s=2.\n\nThen 2*2=4, s=6.\n\nThen 4*2=8, which would make s=14. But wait, that's not correct.\n\nAh, right. Because the sum is 1 + mid + mid^2 + ... + mid^{e-1}.\n\nWait, no: for e=m+1, the sum is 1 + mid + mid^2 + ... + mid^{e-1}, which is (mid^e -1)/(mid-1).\n\nSo the function to compute s is the sum of a geometric series up to e-1 terms.\n\nWait, no, the sum is 1 + mid + mid^2 + ... + mid^{e-1}.\n\nSo, the function compute_s(mid, e) returns sum_{i=0}^{e-1} mid^i.\n\nWhich is (mid^e -1)/(mid-1).\n\nSo, for mid=2, e=3, sum is 1+2+4=7.\n\nSo, the function needs to compute this sum without exceeding n.\n\nBut calculating mid^e directly can cause overflow, so it's better to compute the sum term by term, and stop if the product exceeds n.\n\nThus, the function can be written as:\n\ndef compute_sum(mid, e, n):\n\n    if mid ==1:\n\n        return 0\n\n    sum_total =0\n\n    current =1\n\n    for i in range(e):\n\n        sum_total += current\n\n        if sum_total >n:\n\n            return n +1  # indicates sum is larger than n\n\n        current *= mid\n\n        if current >n:\n\n            break\n\n    return sum_total\n\nWait, but wait: for i in 0 to e-1, current starts at 1, multiplies by mid each time.\n\nSo for e=3, it's 1, then mid, then mid^2.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, for mid=2 and e=3, sum is 1+2+4=7.\n\nBut the function computes sum_total as 1, then adds 2 (sum 3), then adds 4 (sum 7). So it's correct.\n\nBut what about when mid is larger than 1, and e is such that mid^e exceeds n.\n\nFor example, mid=3, e=2, n=5.\n\nsum is 1+3=4.\n\nBut the function correctly returns 4.\n\nBut if n is 3, and mid is 3, e=2: the sum is 4, which is larger than 3, so the function returns 4>3, which is correct.\n\nSo the function seems to work.\n\nThus, in the code, for each mid in the binary search, compute the sum, and compare to n.\n\nIf the sum is equal to n, return YES.\n\nNow, the binary search for each m.\n\nLet me outline the steps for a test case.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nn is given.\n\nif n is less than 3: output NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for m in 1 to 60:\n\n       e = m+1\n\n       if e is 1: continue (since e = m+1, m starts at 1, e is at least 2)\n\n       low =2\n\n       high = n^(1/e) +1. But how to compute high?\n\n       Alternatively, high can be set to 2 initially, and then increased until compute_sum(mid, e, n) <=n.\n\n       Because for some m and e, the maximum k is such that sum is <=n.\n\n       So perhaps, for each m, perform a binary search where the initial high is 2, and keep doubling it until compute_sum(mid, e, n) <n.\n\n       Because for large m, the maximum possible k is small.\n\n       So the steps for each m:\n\n           e = m+1\n\n           low =2\n\n           high =2\n\n           while compute_sum(high, e, n) <=n:\n\n               high *=2\n\n           Now, binary search between low and high.\n\n           while low <= high:\n\n               mid = (low +high)//2\n\n               s = compute_sum(mid, e, n)\n\n               if s ==n:\n\n                   return YES\n\n               elif s <n:\n\n                   low = mid +1\n\n               else:\n\n                   high = mid -1\n\n   After all m, output NO.\n\nBut for some m, compute_sum(mid, e, n) may never exceed n, but that's impossible because for mid=2, e= m+1, the sum grows exponentially.\n\nWait, for example, if e is 60, mid=2: sum is 2^60 -1, which is way larger than 1e18.\n\nSo, for m up to 60, the high can be set to 2 initially, and then doubled until compute_sum(high, e, n) exceeds n.\n\nBut for some cases, high may be set to a very large value before compute_sum returns something.\n\nBut for each m, the binary search is logarithmic in the high, which is manageable.\n\nNow, considering the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\nSample Output:\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nLet's see:\n\nFor n=13:\n\nLooking for m=1: e=2.\n\nCompute sum for mid=3: 1+3=4 <13.\n\nmid=4: 1+4=5 <13.\n\nmid=5: 1+5=6 <13.\n\nmid=6: 7 <13.\n\nmid=7: 8 <13.\n\nmid=8:9 <13.\n\nmid=9:10 <13.\n\nmid=10:11 <13.\n\nmid=11:12 <13.\n\nmid=12:13.

So yes.\n\nThus, for m=1, k=12, which is allowed.\n\nSo output is YES.\n\nSimilarly, for n=15: m=2, e=3.\n\nCompute sum for mid=2:1+2+4=7 <15.\n\nmid=3:1+3+9=13 <15.\n\nmid=4:1+4+16=21>15. So somewhere between 3 and4.\n\nWait, but mid can't be 3.5, so perhaps mid=3.5 is not considered. So perhaps for mid=3, the sum is 13. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no: for m=2, e=3.\n\nLooking for k such that sum is 15.\n\nsum =1 +k +k^2 =15.\n\nk² +k +1 =15.\n\nk² +k -14=0.\n\nDiscriminant: 1+56=57. sqrt(57)=~7.55.\n\nk=( -1 +7.55 ) /2= 3.275.

Did I make a mistake?\n\nNo, because for m=2, e=3.\n\nWait, for k=3: sum is 1+3+9=13<15.\n\nk=4: sum is 1+4+16=21>15.\n\nSo no solution for m=2.\n\nBut sample output says YES for n=15.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, the sample output says n=15 is YES. So according to the problem statement, 15 is a valid n.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum is S(k, m) =1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m.\n\nWait, perhaps m is the number of expansion steps beyond the initial setup, and the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m.\n\nSo for the initial setup, it's 1 node.\n\nThen, the first expansion adds k nodes (sum becomes 1+k).\n\nSecond expansion adds k^2 nodes (sum becomes 1 +k +k²).\n\nThird expansion adds k^3 nodes (sum becomes 1 +k +k² +k^3).\n\nSo for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k² +k^3.\n\nWait, so perhaps I messed up the definition of m earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps m is the number of expansion steps beyond the initial setup, and each expansion step adds a new layer.\n\nSo for m=0, sum is 1.\n\nm=1: 1 +k.\n\nm=2: 1 +k +k².\n\nm=3: 1 +k +k² +k^3.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with earlier analysis.\n\nSo perhaps, the initial setup is m=0, sum is 1.\n\nEach expansion step adds a new layer, so m=1, 2, etc.\n\nThus, for the problem statement, the expansion steps must be done at least once, which implies that m >=1.\n\nSo, the sum is S = 1 + k +k² + ... +k^m, where m >=1.\n\nThus, for n=15, is there a k and m such that 1 +k +k² +k^3 =15.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLooking for m=3.\n\nSo 1 +k +k² +k^3 =15.\n\nTrying k=2: 1+2+4+8=15. Yes! So m=3, k=2.\n\nThus, n=15 is YES.\n\nSo in this case, for m=3, e=4.\n\nCompute sum for k=2: 15.\n\nThus, the code should find this.\n\nSo earlier approach was incorrect because I thought m was the number of expansion steps beyond initial setup, but perhaps m is the exponent.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to consider that for each m (number of expansion steps beyond initial setup), the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m.\n\nThus, the formula is S(k, m) = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo, for m=3, k=2: S= (2^4 -1)/(2-1)=15/1=15.\n\nThus, the code should find this.\n\nSo the initial approach was correct.\n\nThus, the sample makes sense.\n\nSo, in the code, for n=15, m=3, e=4, and k=2.\n\nThus, the code will find it.\n\nThus, the approach is correct.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as described.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, read t test cases.\n\nFor each n, if n is 1, output NO.\n\nElse, for m in 1 to 60:\n\n   e = m+1\n\n   compute high as the maximum possible k such that sum <=n.\n\n   perform binary search.\n\n   if any sum equals n, output YES.\n\nElse, after all m, output NO.\n\nImplementing compute_sum is critical. We'll write a helper function that, given mid, e, n, returns the sum of 1 + mid + mid^2 + ... + mid^{e-1}.\n\nBut since mid can be up to 1e9, and e up to 61, the function must compute the sum without overflowing.\n\nThus, in the helper function:\n\ndef compute_sum(mid, e, n):\n\n    if mid ==1:\n\n        return 0\n\n    s =0\n\n    current =1\n\n    for _ in range(e):\n\n        s += current\n\n        if s >n:\n\n            return n+1\n\n        current *= mid\n\n        if current >n//mid:  # to prevent overflow in next step\n\n            # if current exceeds n, adding it would make s exceed n.\n\n            # but since s is being built, if current is larger than n, adding would make s >n.\n\n            # but perhaps current could be larger than n, but s hasn't exceeded yet.\n\n            # Wait, current is multiplied by mid, but previous s plus current could be <=n.\n\n            # So perhaps this is not sufficient.\n\n            # Alternative: compute current as product *= mid, but check if product exceeds n.\n\n            # But perhaps it's easier to compute current as product, and if current >n, break.\n\n            # Because if current exceeds n, then adding to s would make s >n.\n\n            # But wait, s is being built as sum of 1, mid, mid^2, etc.\n\n            # So, for example, if current is mid^e, but e is large, but mid is small.\n\n            # So, the helper function should calculate s correctly, but stop if s exceeds n.\n\n            # So perhaps, the helper function should compute s as follows:\n\n            # Initialize s=0, current=1.\n\n            # For each step:\n\n            #   s += current.\n\n            #   if s >n: return n+1.\n\n            #   current *= mid.\n\n            #   if current >n: break.\n\n            # So, after the loop, if current is still within limits, but s is less than n, then the sum is s.\n\n            # Else, it's n+1.\n\n            # So the helper function can be written as:\n\n            product =1\n\n            s=0\n\n            for i in range(e):\n\n                product *= mid\n\n                if product >n:\n\n                    break\n\n                s += product\n\n            return s if s <=n else n+1\n\n    return s\n\nWait, perhaps the helper function can be written as:\n\ndef compute_sum(mid, e, n):\n    if mid == 1:\n        return 0\n    s = 0\n    product = 1\n    for _ in range(e):\n        s += product\n        if s > n:\n            return n + 1\n        product *= mid\n        if product > n:\n            break\n    return s\n\nWait, but this may not capture all cases correctly.\n\nFor example, suppose mid=2, e=4, n=15.\n\nThe sum is 1+2+4+8=15.\n\nIn the loop:\n\ns starts at 0.\n\nproduct =1.\n\nIteration 1: s +=1 → s=1. product *=2 → 2. product <=15, so continue.\n\nIteration 2: s +=2 →3. product *=2 →4.\n\nIteration3: s +=4 →7. product *=2 →8.\n\nIteration4: s +=8 →15. product *=2 →16.\n\nLoop ends. Return s=15.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: mid=3, e=3, n=15.\n\nSum is 1+3+9=13.\n\nIn the loop:\n\ns=1 → product=3.\n\ns=4 → product=9.\n\ns=13 → product=27.\n\nSo returns 13.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: mid=4, e=2, n=5.\n\nSum is 1+4=5.\n\nIn the loop:\n\ns=1 → product=4.\n\ns=5 → product=16.\n\nLoop ends. Returns 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: mid=3, e=2, n=5.\n\nSum is 1+3=4 <5.\n\nproduct after loop is 3*3=9>5, but s is 4.\n\nSo function returns 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: mid=3, e=3, n=40.\n\nSum is 1+3+9+27=40.\n\nSo e=3, mid=3.\n\nLoop runs 3 times:\n\ns=1 → product=3.\n\ns=4 → product=9.\n\ns=13 → product=27.\n\nLoop ends, returns 13, which is less than 40.\n\nWait, no. Wait, e is 3, so the loop runs 3 times.\n\nWait, the loop runs 'for _ in range(e)'.\n\nSo for e=3, the loop runs 3 times.\n\nSo, mid=3, e=3.\n\nIteration1: s=1, product=3.\n\nIteration2: s=4, product=9.\n\nIteration3: s=13, product=27.\n\nLoop ends. Function returns 13.\n\nBut 1+3+9=13, which is less than 40.\n\nBut the sum for e=3 is 1+3+9+27=40.\n\nWait, no: for e=3, the sum is 1+3+9+27=40.\n\nBut in the code, the loop runs e times, which is 3 times, adding 1, 3, 9 → sum is 13.\n\nBut 3 iterations, e=3, so mid^e is 27.\n\nBut in the code, it's adding 3 terms: 1, 3, 9.\n\nWhich is sum of 3 terms.\n\nWait, no, wait e is m+1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused between e and the number of terms.\n\nWait, for e= m+1, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{e-1}.\n\nWhich is e terms.\n\nSo, for e=3, the sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nWhich is 3 terms.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo, in the example where mid=3, e=3, the sum is 1+3+9=13.\n\nBut when e=4, mid=3, sum is 1+3+9+27=40.\n\nThus, the code for e=4 would run 4 times, adding 1,3,9,27 → sum is 40.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nThus, the helper function is correct.\n\nThus, in the code, for each m, e is m+1.\n\nNow, the code can proceed.\n\nBut wait, for m=1, e=2. So the sum is 1 +k.\n\nWhich is for the first expansion step.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once. So m=1 is allowed.\n\nThus, the code correctly handles all m>=1.\n\nNow, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead t.\n\nFor each test case:\n\n   n = int(input())\n\n   if n <3:\n\n       print(\"NO\")\n\n       continue\n\n   found = False\n\n   for m in range(1, 61):\n\n       e = m +1\n\n       # Binary search for k.\n\n       low =2\n\n       high =2\n\n       # Find an upper bound for high.\n\n       while True:\n\n           s = compute_sum(high, e, n)\n\n           if s >n:\n\n               break\n\n           low = high\n\n           high *=2\n\n",
