    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Golden Plate,\" and from the description, I need to calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding k rings of gilding.\n\nHmm, let me try to understand the problem step by step. So the plate is divided into w rows and h columns of cells. Each ring is like a border around the plate, getting smaller each time. The first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells inward, and so on. Each ring is 1 cell thick.\n\nWait, the i-th ring is formed by the border of an inner rectangle. The size of that rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). Oh right, because for each ring, we subtract 2 from each side (top, bottom, left, right), so total 4 per dimension, hence multiplied by (i-1). \n\nSo for each ring i from 1 to k, I need to calculate the perimeter of that rectangle. But wait, the perimeter for a rectangle with width W and height H is 2*(W + H) - 4, because the four corners are counted twice when you do 2W + 2H.\n\nWait, let me think again. For a rectangle that's W cells wide and H cells tall, the perimeter is 2*(W + H - 2)*1, but that might not be accurate. Wait no, for example, a 3x3 square has perimeter 8 (each side is 3, so 4*3=12, but subtract 4 because the four corners are counted twice). So 3+3+3+3 =12, but the actual perimeter is 8. So yes, the formula is 2*(W + H) - 4.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, each ring is a single layer. So for each i, the current rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h -4*(i-1)), right? Because for each ring, we're going in 2 cells on each side.\n\nWait, let's take the third example from the input. Input is 7 9 2. So for the first ring, the rectangle is 7x9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 32. Second ring: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. So 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5)-4=16. Total is 32+16=48? But wait the sample output is 40. Hmm, that suggests I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait wait, maybe the formula is different. Let me look at the examples.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → Output 8.\nThe rectangle is 3x3. The perimeter is 3*4 -4 = 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:7 9 1 → Output 28.\nPerimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 32-4=28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3:7 9 2 → Output 40.\nFirst ring is 7x9: perimeter 28. Second ring is (7-4)=3x(9-4)=5. The perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16. 28+16=44. But the sample output is 40. Hmm, that's conflicting. So my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Maybe the second ring isn't 3x5. Or perhaps the way the rings are added is different.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: the i-th ring consists of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w -4*(i-1)) × (h-4*(i-1)). So for i=1, it's w x h. For i=2, it's (w-4) x (h-4). So for i=2, 7-4=3, 9-4=5. So 3x5. The perimeter is 2*(3 +5) -4 = 16. So total is 28+16=44, but the sample output is 40. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, what's the correct way then? Because according to the sample, when k=2, the output is 40 instead of 44.\n\nHmm, maybe I have to account for the fact that some rings may not fit if w or h is too small.\n\nWait, the problem says that k is such that it doesn't exceed floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). So perhaps for the second ring, the dimensions are 3x5, which gives a perimeter of 16, but that adds up to 28+16=44, which doesn't match the sample. So that's confusing.\n\nWait the sample input for the third case is 7 9 2. So the first ring is 7x9, perimeter 28. The second ring is 3x5, which should be 16. But 28+16=44, but the sample output is 40. So something is wrong here.\n\nWait wait, maybe the formula for the perimeter is different. Perhaps for a rectangle of W x H, the perimeter is 2*(W + H) -4, but when either W or H is less than or equal to 1, it's handled differently. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the rings are formed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rings are built in such a way that each ring is one cell thick, but for each ring, the perimeter is computed as 2*(current_w + current_h) -4, but only if current_w and current_h are greater than 2. Because, for example, if the rectangle is 3x3, the next ring would be 1x1, but that's just one cell. Wait, but 1x1 is a single cell, so the perimeter would be 4*1 -4=0, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Perhaps the i-th ring is the perimeter of a rectangle that is (w - 2*(i-1)) in width and (h - 2*(i-1)) in height, but that seems similar to before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each ring is a frame that's 1 cell thick, and the area of each ring is the perimeter of the rectangle minus 4 (because corners are counted once). Wait, but the perimeter formula I used earlier works for the initial rings.\n\nWait, let's think about the third sample:\n\nAfter two rings, the first ring is 7x9: perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 32-4=28.\n\nSecond ring: 7-2*(2-1) = 5? Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.\n\nWait the problem says: the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(i-1))×(h-4*(i-1)). So for i=1, it's w x h. For i=2, it's w-4 x h-4.\n\nWait for 7x9, i=2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. So 3x5. The perimeter is 2*(3+5)-4= 16.\n\nSo 28 +16=44. But the sample output is 40. So clearly, there's a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait perhaps the way the rings are calculated is not adding the perimeters, but rather each ring is the difference between the current outer rectangle and the inner one. Like, for each ring, the number of cells added is (outer_perimeter) - (inner_perimeter).\n\nWait that makes more sense. Because for the first ring, the outer perimeter is 28, and the next ring is inside it, so the new ring adds 28 - (next perimeter) = 28 -16=12. But then 28+12=40, which matches the sample.\n\nOh right! So each ring's contribution is the perimeter of the current outer rectangle minus the perimeter of the inner rectangle. That makes sense because the ring is the area that is added in that layer.\n\nSo for each i from 1 to k, we compute the perimeter of the rectangle before the i-th ring, subtract the perimeter of the rectangle after the i-th ring, and add that to the total.\n\nSo for the third sample:\n\ni=1: outer is 7x9, perimeter 28. After i=1, the inner is 3x5, perimeter 16. So ring 1 contributes 28-16=12.\n\ni=2: outer is 3x5, perimeter 16. After i=2, inner is (3-4) x (5-4) = (-1)x1? Wait that can't be right. So perhaps the maximum number of rings is determined such that the inner rectangle is still positive.\n\nAh, but in the problem statement, k is given such that it's within the allowable range, so for i up to k, the inner rectangle remains valid.\n\nWait for the third sample, k=2: i runs from 1 to 2.\n\nFor i=1:\n\nprev_w = 7, prev_h =9 → perimeter is 2*(7+9)-4= 32-4=28.\n\ncurrent_w = 7 -4*(1-1) =7 → same as before.\n\nThen, the next rectangle is 7-4=3 and 9-4=5.\n\nSo for i=1, the contribution is 28 - 16=12.\n\nFor i=2:\n\nprev_w =3, prev_h=5 → perimeter 16.\n\ncurrent_w =3-4= -1, which is invalid. So perhaps that's why the ring is only considered up to when the rectangle is valid.\n\nWait but the problem states that k is chosen such that it's within the allowable range, so for k=2, the second ring is possible.\n\nWait I'm getting confused. Let me re-calculate the third sample properly.\n\nSample Input 3:7 9 2.\n\nSo for each ring i from 1 to 2:\n\nRing 1:\n\nouter perimeter: 2*(7+9) -4 = 28.\n\ninner rectangle after ring 1: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. Its perimeter is 2*(3+5)-4= 16.\n\nSo ring 1 contributes 28 - 16 =12.\n\nRing 2:\n\nouter perimeter is 3x5: 16.\n\ninner rectangle after ring 2: 3-4= -1, which is invalid. So perhaps the ring is not added? Or maybe the calculation is done differently.\n\nWait that can't be right because the sample output is 40, which is 28+12=40.\n\nWait 28 (ring 1) plus 12 (ring 2) is 40. So ring 2 contributes 12, which is 16 (the perimeter before ring 2) minus 0? Because the inner rectangle after ring 2 is negative, which means that ring 2 is the last possible.\n\nAh, I see. So for the last ring, the inner rectangle is (w-4*(k-1)) x (h-4*(k-1)). If this is valid (i.e., both dimensions are >=1?), then the ring is added. Otherwise, perhaps the ring is not added, but according to the problem statement, k is within the allowable range, so each ring i=1..k will have a valid inner rectangle.\n\nWait wait, the problem says that k is chosen such that it doesn't exceed floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). So for min(w,h) =7 in sample 3, (7+1)/4=2. So k can be 2.\n\nWait for i=2, the inner rectangle is (7-4*(2-1)) =3, (9-4*(2-1))=5. Both are positive. So their perimeter is 16. So the ring contributes 16 - (next perimeter). What's the next perimeter? For i=3, it's 3-4= -1, which is invalid. So perhaps when i=k, the next rectangle is (w -4*k) × (h-4*k). But for i=2, that's 7-8= -1, which is invalid. So the contribution for i=k is the perimeter of the current rectangle minus 0, because there's no next ring.\n\nWait no, that can't be. So perhaps the way to think about it is that for each ring i, the perimeter is the current outer rectangle minus the inner rectangle after removing the ring.\n\nWait let's re-express:\n\nEach ring i is the perimeter of the rectangle before the i-th ring, minus the perimeter of the rectangle after the i-th ring.\n\nSo for each i from 1 to k, the contribution is (perimeter_i - perimeter_{i+1}).\n\nWait but for i=k, the next ring would require the rectangle to be (w -4k) x (h-4k), which may not exist. So perhaps for i=1 to k-1, the contribution is perimeter_i - perimeter_{i+1}, and for i=k, it's perimeter_k.\n\nBecause for the last ring, there is no next ring, so the entire perimeter is added.\n\nLet me test this idea with the sample.\n\nThird sample: k=2.\n\ni=1: perimeter_1 =28, perimeter_2=16. Contribution is 28-16=12.\n\ni=2: since k=2, we add perimeter_2=16.\n\nTotal is 12+16=28. But sample output is 40. No, that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps for each ring i, the contribution is the perimeter of the outer rectangle before the ring is added, minus the perimeter of the inner rectangle after the ring is added.\n\nSo for each i, the contribution is (perimeter_i - perimeter_{i+1}), where perimeter_{i+1} is the perimeter of the rectangle after the i-th ring is added.\n\nIn the third sample:\n\ni=1: perimeter_1=28, perimeter_2=16. Contribution is 28-16=12.\n\ni=2: perimeter_2=16, perimeter_3 is the perimeter of (7-8) × (9-8) → which is invalid. So perhaps for i=2, the contribution is 16 - 0=16?\n\nSo total is 12+16=28. Still not matching sample output.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of another approach.\n\nAlternative idea: each ring is a single layer, so the number of cells in the ring is the perimeter of the outer rectangle minus the perimeter of the inner rectangle (which is the next rectangle after removing this ring). So for each i, the ring is perimeter_i - perimeter_{i+1}.\n\nSo for the third sample:\n\ni=1: 28 -16=12.\n\ni=2:16 - (3-4= -1 → which is 0?), so 16-0=16.\n\nTotal is 12+16=28. Still not matching sample output.\n\nBut the sample expects 40. So I must be missing something.\n\nWait wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect. Let's think about the perimeter for a rectangle of width and height.\n\nWait for a rectangle of W rows and H columns:\n\nThe number of cells in the ring is 2*(W + H) -4, but only if W>1 and H>1. Because if W=1 and H=3, the perimeter is 2*(1+3)-4= 2*4-4=4. But that rectangle is a line, so the ring is the two ends, which is 2 cells. So perhaps the formula holds only when W and H are at least 2.\n\nWait but in the third sample, for i=2, the perimeter is 3x5=15 cells in the ring. Wait no, 3x5 is a rectangle. The perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4=16. So the ring has 16 cells.\n\nSo for i=1, 28 cells. i=2, 16 cells. Total 44. But sample output is 40.\n\nWait maybe the initial approach was wrong, and the rings are actually the perimeter of the current rectangle, but each ring is 2 cells away from the previous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each ring is a frame that is two cells away from the edge of the previous ring. So for the first ring, it's the outermost, the next is two cells inward, etc.\n\nWait, that's a different way of thinking. So each ring is a layer that starts two cells away from the previous ring.\n\nWait that changes everything. Because for each ring i, the current outer rectangle is (w - 2*i) × (h - 2*i). Then the perimeter for each ring is 2*(w - 2*i + h - 2*i) -4.\n\nWait, let me test this with sample 3.\n\nSample 3: 7x9, k=2.\n\ni=1: (7-2*1)=5, (9-2*1)=7. Perimeter is 2*(5+7) -4= 24-4=20.\n\ni=2: (7-4)=3, (9-4)=5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5)-4=16.\n\nTotal is 20+16=36. Still not matching sample output of 40.\n\nHmm, that's not working either.\n\nWait perhaps the ring is defined as being one cell away from the previous ring. So each ring is one cell inwards from the previous. So for i=1, it's the outermost ring, i=2 is one cell in, etc.\n\nIn that case, the formula would be:\n\nFor each ring i, the current rectangle is (w - 2*(i-1)) × (h - 2*(i-1)).\n\nSo for sample 3:\n\ni=1: 7x9 → perimeter 28.\n\ni=2: 7-2=5, 9-2=7 → perimeter 20.\n\nTotal 28+20=48. Not matching sample.\n\nHmm, I'm really stuck. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nFormally, the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w -4(i-1)) × (h -4(i-1)).\n\nSo for i=1: w × h.\n\ni=2: w-4 × h-4.\n\ni=3: w-8 × h-8.\n\nSo each ring is the perimeter of this inner rectangle.\n\nSo for the third sample, i=2, the rectangle is 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5)-4=16.\n\nSo the sum is 28+16=44. But the sample output is 40.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait perhaps the way the rings are calculated is that each ring is the perimeter of the current rectangle, and then subtract the perimeter of the rectangle before the ring, but that's the same as the initial approach.\n\nWait but the sample shows that the sum is 40, not 44.\n\nWait perhaps the problem is that the ring is only the outer perimeter, but not including the corners, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for the perimeter is W*2 + H*2 -4, which is the same as 2*(W + H) -4.\n\nWait, but 3x5 is 3+5=8, 2*8=16, minus 4 is 12. Wait 2*(3+5) is 16, minus 4 is 12. So perimeter is 12. That can't be right because 3x5 has 3+5=8, perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4=12.\n\nWait no, 3x5: 3 columns, 5 rows. So the perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4= 16-4=12.\n\nBut that contradicts what I thought earlier. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, for 3x5:\n\nEach row has 5 cells. The top and bottom rows contribute 3 each, so 6.\n\nEach column has 3 cells, except the top and bottom which are already counted. So for the left and right sides, we have 3-2=1 cell each. So 2*1=2.\n\nSo total perimeter is 6+2=8. Which is different from 12.\n\nWait now I'm really confused.\n\nWhat's the correct way to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle in terms of number of cells?\n\nLet me think of a grid. Suppose W is the number of columns, H is the number of rows.\n\nEach side of the rectangle is W cells long (top and bottom), and H cells long (left and right). But the four corners are counted twice when adding all four sides. So the total number of cells is 2*(W + H) -4.\n\nYes, that's the correct formula.\n\nSo for 3x5, it's 2*(3+5) -4= 16-4=12.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought of 3x5 as a grid, I thought of it as having 3 columns and 5 rows. So the perimeter would be 3 (top) +5 (bottom) +3 (left) +5 (right) → but that counts the four corners twice. So 3+5+3+5=16, minus 4 (the four corners) gives 12.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo for the third sample:\n\ni=1: perimeter is 28.\n\ni=2: perimeter is 12.\n\nTotal is 28+12=40, which matches the sample.\n\nAh! So I was wrong in calculating the perimeter for 3x5 as 16; it's actually 12.\n\nSo the confusion was because I thought the perimeter of 3x5 is 16, but it's actually 12.\n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\nFor each ring i from 1 to k:\n\nCompute the perimeter of the rectangle (w-4*(i-1)) × (h-4*(i-1)).\n\nAdd all these perimeters together.\n\nWait, no. Because each ring is the perimeter of the current rectangle, but the next ring is inside it.\n\nWait no, because each ring is the perimeter of the rectangle at that step.\n\nWait for the third sample, the first ring is 7x9: perimeter 28.\n\nThe second ring is 3x5: perimeter 12.\n\nSo the sum is 28+12=40, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the correct approach is to sum the perimeters of each rectangle for i=1 to k.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because in the first sample:\n\nInput: 3 3 1.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8. Which matches the sample.\n\nIn the second sample:7 9 1.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(7+9) -4=32-4=28. Which matches.\n\nSo the third sample:28 +12=40.\n\nSo the approach is to compute for each i from 1 to k, the perimeter of the rectangle (w-4*(i-1)) × (h-4*(i-1)).\n\nBut wait, in the third sample, i=2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. So 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4=12.\n\nSo the sum is 28+12=40.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSo the formula for each ring is to compute the perimeter of the rectangle at that i-th step and add it.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read w, h, k.\n\n2. For each i from 1 to k:\n\n   a. Compute current_w = w -4*(i-1)\n\n   b. Compute current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   c. Compute perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n   d. Add to the total.\n\n3. Output the total.\n\nWait, but in the third sample, the second ring is 3x5, perimeter 12.\n\nSo why is the second ring contributing 12? Because it's the perimeter of the inner rectangle.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute the sum of the perimeters of each of the k rectangles.\n\nSo the plan is straightforward: loop through each i from 1 to k, compute current_w and current_h, calculate the perimeter, and sum them.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nWe'll read w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total=0.\n\nFor i in 1 to k:\n\n   cw = w -4*(i-1)\n\n   ch = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(cw + ch) -4\n\n   total += perimeter\n\nPrint total.\n\nTesting this with samples:\n\nSample 1:3 3 1.\n\ni=1: cw=3, ch=3. perimeter=8. total=8. Correct.\n\nSample 2:7 9 1.\n\ni=1:7+9=16 → 2*16=32-4=28. Correct.\n\nSample 3:7 9 2.\n\ni=1:28.\n\ni=2:3+5=8 → 2*8=16-4=12. 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=1.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(5+5)-4=20-4=16.\n\nIf k=2: i=1:5x5=16, i=2:5-4=1x1. Perimeter is 2*(1+1)-4=4-4=0. So total is 16+0=16.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nWait, but what if w=5, h=5, k=2. Are the rings 1 and 2 possible?\n\nAccording to the problem statement, k is allowed up to floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). For w=h=5, min is 5. (5+1)/4=1.5 → floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the code won't have to handle that case.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nSo now, writing the Python code.\n\nRead the input as three integers.\n\nLoop from i=1 to k:\n\ncompute current_w and current_h.\n\nCompute perimeter.\n\nSum.\n\nPrint.\n\nSo the code:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    cw = w -4*(i-1)\n\n    ch = h -4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(cw + ch) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if cw or ch becomes less than or equal to zero? According to the problem statement, k is within the allowed range, so it won't happen.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",

The perimeter of a rectangle with width `W` and height `H` is given by 2*(W + H) - 4.\n2. **Summing Perimeters**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the current rectangle and sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n3. **Efficiency**: The approach efficiently computes the required result by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring that the solution is both correct and efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the dimensions of the current rectangle by subtracting 4 from both width and height for each subsequent ring.\n3. **Compute Perimeter**: For each rectangle, compute its perimeter using the formula 2*(width + height) - 4.\n4. **Sum Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly account for each ring's contribution to the total gilded cells, efficiently and accurately solving the problem.",
