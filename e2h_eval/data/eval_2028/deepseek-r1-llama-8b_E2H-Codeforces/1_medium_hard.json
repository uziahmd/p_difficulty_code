    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Golden Plate,\" and from the description, I need to calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding k rings of gilding.\n\nHmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully. Oh right, each ring is formed by the perimeter of a rectangle that's progressively smaller. The first ring is along the edge, then the next is two cells in, and so on. Each ring is one cell thick.\n\nSo the task is, given w (width), h (height), and k (number of rings), compute the total number of gilded cells.\n\nLet me think about how each ring contributes to the total.\n\nFor each ring i (starting from 1 to k), the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, no, wait: the i-th ring is based on the inner rectangle of size (w-4(i-1)) x (h-4(i-1)). So for each ring, we need to find the perimeter of that rectangle, but since each ring is a single cell thick, the perimeter is calculated as the number of cells around it.\n\nWait, but wait—what's the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle in terms of cells? Like, for a rectangle with width w' and height h', the perimeter is 2*(w' + h') - 4. Because each side contributes w' or h', but the four corners are counted once each.\n\nYes, because the perimeter of a grid is like the outer edges. For example, a 3x3 square has 8 cells, which is 2*(3+3) -4 = 8.\n\nSo for each ring i, its contribution is 2*(current_w + current_h) -4, where current_w = w - 4*(i-1), and similarly for current_h.\n\nBut wait, I should also make sure that for each i, the current_w and current_h are at least 3, because otherwise, you can't have a ring. But according to the input constraints, k is such that it won't exceed the possible number of rings. So I don't need to handle cases where the current_w or current_h drop below 3.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Initialize the total gilded cells to 0.\n2. For each i from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n   c. Compute the perimeter for this ring: 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n   d. Add this to the total.\n3. Output the total.\n\nWait, let me test this logic against the examples provided.\n\nLooking at the first example input: '3 3 1'\n\nFor i=1, current_w is 3, current_h is 3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3) -4 = 8. Which matches the output of 8.\n\nSecond example: '7 9 1' → 7 and 9. So perimeter is 2*(7+9)-4 = 2*16-4=32-4=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: '7 9 2'. So for i=1, it's 28 as before. For i=2, current_w is 7 -4 =3, current_h is 9-4=5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4= 16-4=12. So total is 28+12=40, which is correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in Python.\n\nThe steps:\n\n- Read the input line as three integers: w, h, k.\n- Initialize total = 0.\n- Loop for i in range(1, k+1):\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n   total += perimeter\n- Print total as an integer.\n\nWait, but wait: what if for some i, current_w or current_h becomes less than or equal to zero? According to the problem statement, k is chosen such that it doesn't happen. So we can safely proceed.\n\nTesting another case: say w=5, h=5, k=2.\n\ni=1: 5x5 → 2*(5+5)-4=20-4=16\ni=2: 5-4=1? Wait, no: 5-4*(2-1)=1, but that's 1 row or column, but a ring requires at least 3 in both dimensions. Oh wait, maybe my initial understanding was wrong.\n\nWait, the problem says that each ring is formed on the inner rectangle. So for the second ring, the inner rectangle is (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)). So when i=2, it's w-4, h-4.\n\nWait, wait, but for the first ring, it's the entire plate. Then the second ring is 2 cells inward on all sides. So for a 5x5 plate, the second ring would be (5-4) x (5-4) = 1x1. But that's a single cell. So the perimeter would be 4 (all four sides, each of length 1, but wait, 1x1 can't form a perimeter of 4 because each side is just one cell.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the perimeter.\n\nWait, for a 1x1 rectangle, the perimeter is 4. Because each side is one cell, and it's surrounded by nothing, but it's a single cell. So the perimeter counts as 4 cells.\n\nWait, but in our problem, each ring is a single cell thick. So for i=2, the ring is added around the 1x1 rectangle, which is a single cell.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense. Because a 1x1 rectangle's perimeter is 4, but adding a ring around it would require 4 more cells. So the second ring would add 4 cells.\n\nWait, but for the case where w=5, h=5, k=2, the total would be 16 (from i=1) plus 4 (from i=2) → total 20.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, for i=2: current_w=5-4=1, current_h=5-4=1. So perimeter is 2*(1+1) -4 = 4 -4=0. That can't be right.\n\nOh! So this shows that the formula works only when current_w and current_h are at least 3. Because when they're 1 or 2, the perimeter calculation isn't correct.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So perhaps I need to adjust the formula for rings where the current_w or current_h is less than 3.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, k is chosen such that it doesn't go beyond the maximum possible rings. So for a 5x5 plate, how many rings are possible?\n\nThe maximum possible rings is floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). So min(5,5)=5, (5+1)/4=1.5, floor is 1. So k can be at most 1. So the earlier scenario where k=2 is not allowed. So in the problem constraints, the code doesn't have to handle such cases.\n\nAh, okay. So for all k given, current_w and current_h will be at least 3 for each ring up to k. So the formula is safe.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nIn the problem statement, the third parameter k is given as:\n\nk ≤ floor( (min(n, m) + 1)/4 )\n\nWait, for min(n, m) being 3, (3+1)/4=1 → floor is 1, so k can be 1.\n\nFor min(n,m)=5: (5+1)/4=1.5 → floor 1. So max k is 1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for min(w, h)=7: (7+1)/4=2 → floor is 2, so k can be up to 2.\n\nWhich is why in the sample input, 7x9 allows k=2.\n\nSo for any k given, the current_w and current_h are at least 3 for each i up to k.\n\nBecause, for each ring i, current_w = w -4*(i-1). Since the maximum i is floor((min(w,h)+1)/4).\n\nLet me see:\n\nSuppose min(w,h) is m. Then, the maximum i is s = floor( (m+1)/4 )\n\nFor i= s:\n\ncurrent_w = w -4*(s-1) ≥ m -4*(s-1)\n\nWe can see whether this is ≥3.\n\nLet me take m=7, s=2:\n\n7-4*(2-1) =7-4=3≥3.\n\nFor m=9: s=2 (since (9+1)/4=2.5 → floor 2). So current_w for i=2 is 9-4=5≥3.\n\nAnother example: m=3, s=1. So current_w is 3-0=3≥3.\n\nSo yes, for all i up to k, current_w and current_h are at least 3.\n\nThus, the perimeter formula 2*(current_w + current_h) -4 is valid for all i.\n\nSo no issues there.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total=0.\n\nLoop i from 1 to k:\n\n   cw = w -4*(i-1)\n\n   ch = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   perim = 2*(cw + ch) -4\n\n   total += perim\n\nPrint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nSo now, writing the code.\n\nThe input is read as a single line, split into three integers.\n\nIn Python, something like:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    cw = w - 4 * (i-1)\n\n    ch = h -4 * (i-1)\n\n    perim = 2*(cw + ch) -4\n\n    total += perim\n\nprint(total)\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 3 3 1 → 8.\n\nSample 2: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9) -4= 32-4=28.\n\nSample3: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5)-4=28+ 16-4=28+12=40.\n\nWhich matches the outputs.\n\nAnother test case: what if w=5, h=5, k=1.\n\nThen, perim is 2*(5+5)-4=20-4=16.\n\nWhat if w=7, h=7, k=2.\n\ni=1: 7x7 → 2*(7+7)-4=28-4=24.\n\ni=2: 7-4=3, 7-4=3 → 2*(6)-4=12-4=8.\n\nTotal is 24+8=32.\n\nSo code would output 32.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's all. So the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is formed by the perimeter of an increasingly smaller rectangle inside the plate.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The plate is divided into `w` rows and `h` columns.
