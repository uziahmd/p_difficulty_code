There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about maximizing profit by building houses on a street with certain restrictions. \n\nAlright, let me read the problem statement carefully again. So, there are n spots on the street where each house can be built with a height between 0 and h. Each spot contributes a squared value equal to the height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in the range from l_i to r_i (inclusive), the tallest house must be at most x_i.\n\nThe goal is to maximize the total profit after considering all these restrictions.\n\nHmm. So, how do I approach this? Well, thinking about constraints, n, h, m are all up to 50, which is manageable. So maybe a brute-force approach is possible, but perhaps not the most efficient. Alternatively, we can model this as a problem where for each spot, the height is constrained by multiple overlapping restrictions.\n\nWait, each restriction affects a range of spots, and for each such range, the maximum height in that range must be <= x_i. So, the key is that for each spot, its height is determined by the most restrictive restriction that includes it.\n\nSo, for each spot, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of all the x_i's of the restrictions that cover it. Also, since the default maximum height is h, but any restriction that covers the spot will further limit the height. So, for each spot i, the maximum possible height is the minimum of h and the x_j of all restrictions that include i in their [l_j, r_j] interval.\n\nBut wait, no. Because a restriction that covers a spot may have a lower x_j than others. For example, if a spot is covered by two restrictions, one with x=5 and another with x=3, then the maximum height for that spot is min(5,3) = 3, because both need to be satisfied. But also, if the spot isn't covered by any restriction, then the max is h.\n\nSo, the plan is: for each spot, determine the maximum possible height it can have, which is the minimum of h and all x_i of the restrictions that include it in their interval. If a spot is not covered by any restriction, then the maximum is h.\n\nOnce we know the maximum possible height for each spot, the optimal choice is to take the maximum possible height for each spot, because higher is better since we square it. So, the maximum profit is achieved when each spot is set to its maximum allowed height.\n\nWait, does that hold? Because sometimes, setting a spot to a lower height might allow more spots elsewhere to have higher heights. But no, because each spot's contribution is its own height squared. Since the function is strictly increasing, for each spot, the higher the better. So, if a spot can be as high as possible without violating any restriction, it should be set to that maximum.\n\nTherefore, the approach is to compute for each spot the maximum allowed height, and then sum the squares of those heights.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read all the restrictions.\n2. For each spot i (from 1 to n):\n   a. Find all restrictions that include i in their [l, r] range.\n   b. For each such restriction, note the x value.\n   c. The maximum allowed height for spot i is the minimum of all these x's and h.\n   d. If there are no such restrictions, then the maximum is h.\n3. Sum the squares of all these maximum heights.\n\nSo, let's test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\nn=3, h=3, m=3\nRestrictions:\n1-1, x=1\n2-2, x=3\n3-3, x=2\n\nFor spot 1: only the first restriction, x=1. So max is 1.\nSpot 2: second restriction x=3. Max is 3.\nSpot 3: third restriction x=2. Max is 2.\nSum: 1 +9+4=14. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example:\nn=4, h=10, m=2\nRestrictions:\n2-3, x=8\n3-4, x=7\n\nSpot 1: no restrictions. Max is 10.\nSpot 2: covered by first restriction x=8. So max is 8.\nSpot 3: covered by both restrictions. The x's are 8 and7. So min is7.\nSpot4: covered by second restriction x=7. Max is7.\nSum: 100 +64 +49 +49 = 262. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: what if a spot is covered by multiple overlapping restrictions with varying x's. For example, spot 2 is in restrictions [1,3] with x=5 and [2,2] with x=3. Then the max for spot 2 is min(5,3)=3.\n\nSo, the algorithm seems solid.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nWe can represent the restrictions as a list of tuples. For each spot, iterate through all restrictions and check if the spot is within l and r. Collect all x's for that spot, then take the min.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nThen read m lines, each with l, r, x. Convert to 0-based or 1-based? Since the input uses 1-based indices, spots are 1-based. So, for each restriction, for each spot in l..r, add x to the list of that spot.\n\nWait, but for efficiency, for each spot i, collect all x's from the restrictions that include i.\n\nSo, create an array 'max_heights' of size n+1 (since spots are 1-based), initialized to h.\n\nThen, for each restriction (l, r, x):\n\n   for i in l to r:\n\n       current_max = min(max_heights[i], x)\n\n       if current_max < max_heights[i]:\n\n           max_heights[i] = current_max\n\nWait, no. Because for each spot i, the maximum allowed is the minimum of all x's of the restrictions that include i. So, for each restriction, for each spot in l..r, we need to consider x and take the minimum between the existing value and x.\n\nSo, for each spot i, initial max is h. For each restriction that covers i, update the max as min(current_max, x).\n\nSo, in code:\n\nmax_heights = [h]*(n+1)  # index 0 unused\n\nfor each restriction in restrictions:\n\n    l, r, x = ... \n\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n        if max_heights[i] > x:\n\n            max_heights[i] = x\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for each spot in the range, if the current max is higher than x, it gets reduced to x.\n\nSo, that's the way to go.\n\nOnce we have max_heights[1..n], then compute the sum of squares.\n\nSo, the plan is clear.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nIn Python, read n, h, m.\n\nThen, read m lines, each line split into l, r, x. Note that l and r are 1-based.\n\nInitialize max_heights as a list of size n+1, with max_heights[0] unused. All set to h.\n\nFor each restriction, loop over l to r, and for each i in that range, set max_heights[i] to the minimum of current value and x.\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, compute the sum of squares.\n\nLet me test this logic with the first sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1 1 1 → process spot 1: max becomes min(3,1)=1.\n\n2 2 3 → spot 2: min(3,3)=3.\n\n3 3 2 → spot3: min(3,2)=2.\n\nSum 1 +9 +4=14.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=4, h=10.\n\nRestriction 1: 2-3, x=8 → spots 2 and 3 get set to min(10,8)=8 and min(10,8)=8.\n\nRestriction2:3-4, x=7 → spots3 and4: min(8,7)=7 and min(10,7)=7.\n\nSo, max_heights: [10,8,7,7].\n\nSum 100+64+49+49=262.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about a spot covered by multiple restrictions?\n\nLike, n=5, m=2.\n\nRestriction1: 1-5, x=5.\n\nRestriction2: 3-4, x=3.\n\nProcessing:\n\nFor spot1: initial 10. After first restriction, becomes 5.\n\nSpot2: same as 1.\n\nSpot3: first restriction sets to5, then second sets to3.\n\nSpot4: same as 3.\n\nSpot5: first restriction sets to5.\n\nSo, heights are [5,5,3,3,5].\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each spot, process each restriction that covers it. So, for spot3, first restriction (covers 1-5) x=5 → current max is min(10,5)=5. Then, second restriction (3-4) x=3 → min(5,3)=3.\n\nSo, yes.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nmax_heights = [h]*(n+1)\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n        if max_heights[i] > x:\n\n            max_heights[i] = x\n\nsum = sum( (height **2) for height in max_heights[1:] )\n\nprint(sum)\n\nWait, but wait—what about when a spot is covered by multiple restrictions, some with smaller x. For example, a spot is covered by a restriction x=2 and another x=3. So, the maximum allowed is 2.\n\nYes, because in the code, for each spot, for each restriction that covers it, we compare and set the maximum to the minimum.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: no restrictions. Then all spots are h, so sum is h^2 *n.\n\nAnother case: a spot covered by two restrictions, one with x=0. Then the max is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the code with sample 1:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n1 1 1\n2 2 3\n3 3 2\n\nAfter processing:\n\nspot1: 1.\n\nspot2:3.\n\nspot3:2.\n\nSum 1+9+4=14.\n\nSample 2:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8 → spots2-3 become 8 and 8.\n\n3 4 7 → spots3-4 become min(8,7)=7, min(10,7)=7.\n\nHeights:10,8,7,7.\n\nSum 100+64+49+49=262.\n\nYes.\n\nLooks good.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit possible by building houses on a street with given zoning restrictions. Each house can be built at a certain height, and each height contributes to the total profit as the square of its height. The challenge is to maximize this profit while respecting the height restrictions imposed by the city.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We have `n` spots on a street where each house can be built up to a maximum height `h`. There are `m` restrictions, each specifying that within a specific range `[l_i, r_i]`, the tallest house must not exceed a certain height `x_i`.\n\n2. **Constraints Handling**: For each spot, the maximum allowed height is determined by the most restrictive restriction that covers it. If a spot is covered by multiple restrictions, the height is limited by the smallest `x_i` value among those restrictions. If a spot is not covered by any restriction, it can reach the maximum height `h`.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Initialize an array `max_heights` where each element represents the maximum allowed height for the corresponding spot. Initially, all spots can be built up to height `h`.\n   - For each restriction, update the maximum height for each spot in the specified range `[l_i, r_i]` to be the minimum of the current height and the restriction's height `x_i`.\n   - Calculate the total profit by summing the squares of the maximum heights for each spot.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nmax_heights = [h] * (n + 1)  # Using 1-based indexing\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    for i in range(l, r + 1):\n        if max_heights[i] > x:\n            max_heights[i] = x\n\ntotal_profit = sum(height ** 2 for height in max_heights[1: n + 1])\nprint(total_profit)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of spots `n`, the maximum height `h`, and the number of restrictions `m`. Each restriction specifies a range `[l_i, r_i]` and a maximum height `x_i`.\n- **Initialization**: An array `max_heights` is initialized such that each spot starts with the maximum possible height `h`.\n- **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, iterate through each spot in the specified range and update the maximum allowed height to be the minimum of the current height and the restriction's height.\n- **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, compute the total profit by summing the squares of the maximum heights for each spot.\n\nThis approach ensures that all restrictions are respected while maximizing the total profit from building the houses.",
