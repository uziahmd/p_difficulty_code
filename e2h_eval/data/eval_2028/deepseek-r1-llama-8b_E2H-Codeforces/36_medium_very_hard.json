The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem is about radio towers in towns arranged along a coordinate line. The towns are numbered from 0 to n+1. We build a tower in each town from 1 to n with probability 1/2 each, independently. Then, we need to assign signal powers such that:\n\n- Towns 0 and n+1 get no signal.\n- Each of the other towns (1 to n) gets exactly one signal.\n\nOur goal is to compute the probability that after building the towers, it's possible to assign the powers as required.\n\nHmm. So, the key is to find the number of valid configurations (tower placements and power assignments) that satisfy the constraints, divided by the total possible configurations.\n\nWait, but since each tower is built independently with probability 1/2, the total possible configurations is 2^n. But for our problem, we only care about those subsets S of {1, 2, ..., n} where there exists a way to assign powers to each tower in S such that each town 1..n is covered exactly once, and 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nSo, the probability is equal to the number of valid S's multiplied by (1/2)^n, right?\n\nBut wait, the towers are built with probability 1/2 each, so the total is indeed 2^n. So the number of valid S is equal to the number of valid tower sets that allow such a power assignment.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets S of {1,2,...,n} such that S can be assigned powers satisfying the coverage constraints.\n\nNow, the main question is: for a given subset S, when can such an assignment exist?\n\nLet me think about the conditions on S.\n\nEach tower i in S must have a power p_i such that:\n\n- For each j in 1..n, j is covered exactly once.\n\nAnd:\n\n- Town 0 is not covered by any tower. So, no tower i can have p_i >= 1 (since town 0 is at distance 1 from i=1). Wait, no. Because if a tower is at i=1, and has p_i=1, then it covers town 0 (since |0-1| < 1? Wait, no. The condition is |c - i| < p. So for c=0, |0 - i| < p. If i=1 and p=1, then 0 is covered because 1 < 1 is false. Wait, 1 is not less than 1, so no. So for town 0, it should not be covered by any tower. So for any tower i, p_i must be <= i, because otherwise, if p_i > i, then 0 is within |0 -i| < p_i, which would be true if p_i > i.\n\nWait, let's see: For town 0, the distance from i is i. So for 0 to not be covered, p_i must be <= i. Because if p_i > i, then |0 -i| =i < p_i is true, so 0 is covered.\n\nSimilarly, for town n+1, it's located at position n+1. Any tower j can't cover it. So for any j, p_j must be <= (n+1 - j). Because if p_j is larger than (n+1 -j), then |(n+1) - j| = (n+1 -j) < p_j would imply that n+1 is covered.\n\nSo for all j in S, p_j must satisfy:\n\np_j <= i (for town 0)\n\np_j <= (n+1 - j) (for town n+1)\n\nAdditionally, each town k (1<=k<=n) must be covered exactly once.\n\nSo, for each tower i in S, the interval [i - p_i +1, i + p_i -1] must cover some non-overlapping intervals that together cover exactly all towns 1..n, except 0 and n+1.\n\nWait, but each tower's coverage is a range around it. So the ranges must form a partition of 1..n, without overlaps, and each point covered exactly once.\n\nSo, the set S must form a partition of 1..n into intervals, each centered at a tower i in S, with radius p_i such that:\n\ni - p_i +1 to i + p_i -1 is the interval covered.\n\nMoreover, these intervals must not overlap, and their union must be exactly 1..n.\n\nSo, for example, if S is {2}, then p_2 could be 3 (covers 1,2,3), but then 0 and 4 are beyond, but 0 is not covered because p=3>2, so 0 is covered, which violates the constraints. So p_2 must be 2. Because then the coverage is 1,2,3. But wait, 0 is at distance 2 from 2. So |0-2|=2, which is equal to p=2. So 0 is not covered because the condition is |c-i| < p. So 2 < 2 is false. So yes, 0 is not covered.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the condition is |c -i| < p. So for c=0 and i=2, |0-2|=2. So if p=2, 2 < 2 is false, so 0 is not covered. So if S is {2}, then p=2 covers 1,2,3. Then town 0 is not covered, which is good. Town 4 is at distance 2 from 2, so 2 < 2 is false, so 4 is not covered either. So the coverage is 1,2,3. But then, the other towns 4..n may or may not be covered. Wait, but for n=5, this would leave 4 and 5 uncovered. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, no. Because in the problem statement, the towers are in 1..n, so for n=5, 2's coverage is 1-3. Then, for the remaining towns 4 and 5, they must be covered by other towers.\n\nWait, but in the sample input where n=5, S is {2,4,5}. For 2, p=2 covers 1,2,3. For 4, p=1 covers 4. For 5, p=1 covers 5. So that works.\n\nSo for a subset S to be valid, it must be possible to assign p_i's such that the coverage of S forms a partition of 1..n, and none of the coverage includes 0 or n+1.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of subsets S where S is a valid partitioning of 1..n into non-overlapping intervals, each centered at a tower in S, with their p_i's chosen appropriately.\n\nThis seems similar to tiling problems, like tiling a 1D line with certain intervals.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the structure of valid S is such that the towers are placed in a way that their coverage intervals don't overlap and cover exactly 1..n.\n\nSo, how can we model this? It feels like a dynamic programming problem, where for each position, we decide whether to place a tower here and choose its p_i, ensuring that the coverage doesn't extend beyond the current position.\n\nWait, maybe the valid subsets S correspond to certain kinds of independent intervals. Like, for each interval [l, r], we have a tower at some position m in [l, r], and the p_i is set so that it covers exactly [l, r]. Then, the next interval starts at r+1.\n\nSo, for example, if we have a tower at position m, and p_i is chosen such that l = m - (p_i -1), and r = m + (p_i -1). So l = m - (p_i -1), r = m + (p_i -1).\n\nWait, but l can't be less than 1, and r can't exceed n. So for a tower at m, the maximum possible p_i is min(m, n - m +1). Because for p_i, the left boundary is m - (p_i -1) >=1, so p_i <= m. Similarly, the right boundary is m + (p_i -1) <=n, so p_i <= n -m +1.\n\nWait, no. For example, m can be in the middle. Suppose m=3, n=5. Then p_i can be up to 3, but that would cover 1,2,3,4. But 5 is still left. So perhaps for m=3, p_i=3 would cover 1-4, leaving 5 to be covered by another tower.\n\nWait, but in that case, 5 is covered by a tower at 5 with p=1.\n\nSo, the idea is that the entire 1..n must be covered exactly once by the intervals from the towers, each interval being a range around a tower.\n\nSo, for a subset S to be valid, it must be a set of positions such that:\n\n- They are non-overlapping, and their coverage intervals exactly cover 1..n.\n\nEach such S is a collection of positions where each position's coverage interval is determined by the p_i, which is chosen such that the intervals fit perfectly.\n\nSo, how can we model this?\n\nI think it's similar to a tiling problem where each tile is a certain length, and we're trying to cover the entire line.\n\nIn this case, each tile is determined by the position m of the tower and the length of the coverage, which is 2(p_i -1) +1. Or wait, no. The coverage is [m - (p_i -1), m + (p_i -1)], so the length is 2*(p_i -1) +1.\n\nAlternatively, the length is 2p_i -1.\n\nWait, for example, p_i=1: covers just m.\n\np_i=2: covers m-1, m, m+1. So length 3.\n\np_i=3: covers m-2, m-1, m, m+1, m+2. Length 5.\n\nSo, yes, the length is 2p_i -1.\n\nSo, each tile is a segment of length L=2p_i -1, centered at m.\n\nThus, the entire 1..n must be covered by such tiles, without overlapping, and each point covered exactly once.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to tiling the line from 1 to n with tiles of odd lengths, each centered at their starting point, and each tile's length is determined by the tower's p_i.\n\nWait, but the tile is centered at m, which is the tower's position. So, for a tile of length L, the coverage is [m - (L-1)/2, m + (L-1)/2].\n\nWait, but m must be in the middle of the tile. So, for a tile of length L, which is always odd, the center is at m, and the coverage extends (L-1)/2 on both sides.\n\nYes. So, the tile's start is m - (L-1)/2, and end is m + (L-1)/2.\n\nSo, for a tile of length L, it must satisfy that m - (L-1)/2 >=1 and m + (L-1)/2 <=n.\n\nHmm. So, for each tile, the position m must be at least (L+1)/2, because m - (L-1)/2 >=1 => m >= (L+1)/2.\n\nSimilarly, m must be <= (n - L +1) + (L-1)/2? Wait, no. Let me re-express the constraints:\n\nFor a tile of length L, the minimal m is (L+1)/2, because m - (L-1)/2 >=1 => m >=1 + (L-1)/2 +1? Wait, no:\n\nWait, m - (L-1)/2 >=1 --> m >= 1 + (L-1)/2.\n\nSimilarly, m + (L-1)/2 <=n --> m <=n - (L-1)/2.\n\nSo, for a tile of length L, m must be in [ (L+1)/2 , n - (L-1)/2 ].\n\nWait, but L is 2p_i -1, which is always odd.\n\nSo, L is odd, say L=2k-1, where k is p_i.\n\nThen, (L+1)/2 = (2k-1 +1)/2 = k.\n\nSimilarly, n - (L-1)/2 = n - (2k-2)/2 = n - (k-1).\n\nSo, for a tile of length L=2k-1, the position m must be in [k, n -k +1].\n\nBecause m >= k and m <= n -k +1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Because for each tile of length L=2k-1, the possible m's are in [k, n -k +1]. So, the number of possible m's is (n -k +1) -k +1 = n -2k +2.\n\nWait, but that's only if n >= 2k-1.\n\nWait, perhaps this suggests that the tiling is such that the sum of the lengths of the tiles equals n, but each tile must be of odd length, and their positions must fit within the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using dynamic programming where dp[i] represents the number of ways to tile the first i towns.\n\nBut considering the constraints on the tiles, perhaps the state needs to include more information, like the last position used.\n\nHmm, but n can be up to 2e5, so we need an O(n) solution.\n\nWait, perhaps the valid subsets S are exactly those that form a partition of the line into non-overlapping intervals, each of which is centered at a tower, and each interval has an odd length.\n\nBut that might not capture all possibilities correctly.\n\nWait, another approach: consider that for a subset S to be valid, the towers must be placed such that their coverage intervals are non-overlapping and exactly cover 1..n.\n\nEach interval is determined by its center m and its length L=2p_i-1.\n\nSo, the entire 1..n is a union of such intervals, each centered at a tower in S, and their intervals don't overlap.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to selecting a set of non-overlapping intervals, each of odd length, centered at m, covering exactly 1..n.\n\nSo, how can we count the number of such subsets S?\n\nWait, but each such subset S is a collection of centers m, each associated with an odd-length L (which depends on the p_i chosen for that m).\n\nBut the L must be such that the interval [m - (L-1)/2, m + (L-1)/2] does not extend beyond 1..n.\n\nBut each interval is determined by its center and its length, which is determined by the p_i.\n\nHmm. So, for a given m, the possible L's are 1, 3, 5, etc., up to the maximum possible L such that m - (L-1)/2 >=1 and m + (L-1)/2 <=n.\n\nSo, for each m, the maximum possible L is min(2m -1, 2(n -m +1) -1) ?\n\nWait, because m can have up to (m) to the left (so L=2m-1), but also, m can't have more than (n -m +1) to the right (so L=2(n-m+1)-1).\n\nWait, no. Because for m, the maximum possible L is the minimum of (m, n -m +1)*2 -1.\n\nWait, for example, if m is near the beginning, the maximum L is 2m -1. But if m is near the end, the maximum L is 2(n -m +1) -1.\n\nWait, no, let's see:\n\nFor m, the maximum L is such that m - (L-1)/2 >=1 â†’ L <= 2m -1.\n\nAnd m + (L-1)/2 <=n â†’ L <= 2(n -m +1) -1.\n\nSo, the maximum possible L is min(2m-1, 2(n -m +1) -1).\n\nWhich simplifies to min(2m-1, 2n -2m +1).\n\nWait, 2(n -m +1) -1 is 2(n -m) +1.\n\nSo, the maximum L is the minimum of 2m-1 and 2(n -m)+1.\n\nSo, for each m, the maximum possible L is min(2m-1, 2(n -m +1) -1) = min(2m-1, 2(n -m +1) -1).\n\nWait, but 2(n -m +1) -1 = 2(n -m) +1.\n\nSo, for example, if m is exactly in the middle, then both 2m-1 and 2(n-m+1)-1 are equal.\n\nSo, the maximum L for each m is 2 * min(m, n -m +1) * 2 -1? Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that for each m, the maximum possible L is 2 * (the number of steps it can go left and right) +1.\n\nWait, perhaps for m, the maximum L is 2 * d +1, where d is the minimal of the distances to the ends.\n\nWait, d_left = m -1, d_right = n -m.\n\nSo, the maximum L is 2*min(d_left, d_right) +1.\n\nBecause, for example, if m is in the middle, then d_left = d_right, so L can be 2d+1.\n\nIf m is closer to the left, then L can be 2d_right +1, which would extend to the right as much as possible.\n\nSo, for each m, the maximum L is 2*min(m-1, n -m) +1.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nn=5, m=3. d_left=2, d_right=2. So L can be up to 5 (2*2+1=5). So coverage is 3-2=1 to 3+2=5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: m=2 in n=5.\n\nd_left=1, d_right=3. So max L is 2*1 +1=3. Coverage is 0 to 4. But wait, 0 is invalid. So in reality, L can't be 3 for m=2 because that would include 0.\n\nAh, right. So my earlier reasoning was incorrect. Because for m=2, even if the max L is 3, the coverage would include 0, which is invalid.\n\nSo, the L must be chosen such that the coverage doesn't include 0 or n+1.\n\nSo, the L can't be such that m - (L-1)/2 < 1, or m + (L-1)/2 >n.\n\nWhich implies that:\n\n(L-1)/2 < m -1 â†’ L < 2(m-1) +1 = 2m-1.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, for coverage not to include 0: m - (L-1)/2 >=1.\n\nSo, (L-1)/2 <= m-1 â†’ L <= 2(m-1) +1 = 2m-1.\n\nSimilarly, coverage must not include n+1: m + (L-1)/2 <=n.\n\nâ†’ (L-1)/2 <=n -m â†’ L <= 2(n -m) +1.\n\nSo, the maximum possible L is min(2m-1, 2(n -m) +1).\n\nSo, for each m, the possible L's are the odd integers from 1 up to min(2m-1, 2(n -m)+1).\n\nWait, but L has to be an odd integer.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each m, the possible L's are 1,3,5,..., up to the maximum allowed.\n\nSo, for a given m, the number of possible L's is floor( (max_L +1)/2 ).\n\nWait, for example, max_L=3 â†’ L can be 1 or 3 â†’ 2 options.\n\nmax_L=5 â†’ L=1,3,5 â†’ 3 options.\n\nSo, the count is (max_L +1)/2.\n\nBut since max_L can be even or odd? No, because max_L is the minimum of two terms, which could be even or odd.\n\nWait, wait, no: for each m, max_L is the minimum of 2m-1 and 2(n -m)+1. Both terms are odd because 2m is even, minus 1 is odd. Similarly for 2(n-m)+1.\n\nSo, max_L is always odd.\n\nSo, for each m, the number of possible L's is (max_L +1)/2.\n\nWait, for max_L=3: (3+1)/2=2 â†’ correct.\n\nFor max_L=5: (5+1)/2=3 â†’ correct.\n\nSo yes.\n\nThus, for each m, the number of possible L's is (max_L +1)/2, where max_L = min(2m-1, 2(n -m)+1).\n\nNow, the problem is to count the number of subsets S where the intervals [m - (L-1)/2, m + (L-1)/2] for each m in S, with L being any possible value for m, do not overlap, and their union is exactly 1..n.\n\nBut this seems quite complex.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the valid subsets S are exactly those where the towers are placed in such a way that their coverage intervals form a perfect partition of 1..n.\n\nThis structure is similar to a perfect matching where each interval is a block, and the blocks are non-overlapping and cover the entire line.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph, where each position can be a node, and edges represent possible transitions between positions.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the valid subsets S correspond to the set of all possible tilings where each tile is a single square (length 1), or a domino (length 3), etc., but again, this isn't directly applicable.\n\nWait, another thought: the valid subsets S must form a partition of the line into intervals, each of which is of odd length, centered at a tower.\n\nSo, the minimal case is when each interval is a single point (length 1), which corresponds to a tower at each point, each with p_i=1.\n\nBut that's only one possible configuration.\n\nWait, but in the sample input for n=2, the valid S is {1,2}, each with p_i=1. So coverage is [1,1] and [2,2], which covers 1 and 2. Town 0 is not covered (because p_i=1 for 1, so 0 is at distance 1, which is not less than 1). Similarly, town 3 is not covered.\n\nBut wait, n=2, so n+1 is 3. So for m=1, p_i=1: coverage is [1-0, 1+0] = [1], which is correct. For m=2, p_i=1: coverage is [2], which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother sample: n=3.\n\nValid S can be {1,2,3}, each with p_i=1. Or S can be {2}, with p_i=3, which covers [0,4]. But wait, 0 is invalid, so that can't happen. Oh, wait, no: for m=2, p_i=3 would have coverage from 0 to 4, which includes 0, which is invalid. So that's not allowed.\n\nWait, in the note for n=3, it says that when only tower 2 is built, it's assigned p=2, which covers 1,2,3. But 0 is not covered because 2 < 2 is false. And 4 is beyond n=3.\n\nSo, for S={2}, p_i=2, which is allowed.\n\nThus, the coverage is [1,2,3], which is correct.\n\nSo, for S={2}, the coverage is 1-3, which is exactly the entire line.\n\nSo, this is another valid case.\n\nSo, in this case, S is a single tower at 2, with p_i=2.\n\nSo, the problem allows for varying L's as long as they don't include 0 or n+1.\n\nSo, the valid subsets S are those where the coverage of each tower in S does not include 0 or n+1, and the coverage intervals are non-overlapping and exactly cover 1..n.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the key is to model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLetâ€™s define f(k) as the number of valid subsets S for the first k towns.\n\nWe need to compute f(n), which is the number of valid subsets for the entire line.\n\nBase cases:\n\nf(0) = 1 (no towns to cover)\nf(1) = 1 (only tower 1, with p=1, covering 1)\nf(2) = 1 (if S is {1,2}, each with p=1) OR S is empty? No, because S must cover 1 and 2. So only one way.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, for n=2, the valid S is {1,2}, which gives coverage exactly 1 and 2.\n\nSo f(2)=1.\n\nBut wait, for n=2, can we have S={2}? Then, the coverage is [2-1, 2+1-1] = [1,2]. So yes, S={2} is a valid subset. So f(2)=2.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Because for n=2, the sample says the real answer is 1/4, meaning that the number of valid S is 1 (since 2^2 is 4, and 1/4 is the probability). But wait, in the sample explanation, when both 1 and 2 are built, their p's are 1 each. That's one possibility. Are there any others?\n\nWait, if S={2}, then p=2 is allowed, which covers 1,2,3. But 3 is beyond n=2. So 0 is not covered, but 3 is n+1, which is 3, so coverage includes 3, which is invalid.\n\nWait, no. Because for S={2}, p=2 would cover from 2-1=1 to 2+1=3. So town 3 is included, which is n+1. So that's invalid.\n\nAh, right! So for S={2}, p cannot be 2 because it would include town 3, which is n+1.\n\nSo, for S={2}, the maximum L is min(2*2-1=3, 2*(2-2)+1=1). So min(3,1)=1.\n\nSo, for m=2, the maximum L is 1. So p_i can only be 1, which covers only 2. So the coverage is [2], leaving 1 uncovered. So, for n=2, S={2} is not a valid subset.\n\nThus, the only valid S is {1,2}, each with p_i=1.\n\nSo f(2)=1.\n\nBut according to the earlier calculation, for m=2, the maximum L is 1, so p=1.\n\nThus, in this case, S can't have just {2}.\n\nSo, the initial thought that S can be {2} is wrong.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, the problem is more complicated.\n\nSo, to model f(k), perhaps we can think of the following:\n\nf(k) is the number of valid subsets S for the first k towns.\n\nTo compute f(k), we can consider adding a new tower at position k.\n\nBut wait, that's not necessarily the case, because the new tower could be placed somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each position, we can consider whether to place a tower there, and then determine how the coverage extends.\n\nBut this seems tricky.\n\nAnother approach: think recursively. For a line of length k, the last interval could be of length L, ending at k.\n\nSo, for each possible L (odd), we can find the earliest position where this interval starts, and then add the number of ways to cover the remaining part.\n\nBut for large n, this approach would be too slow unless optimized.\n\nWait, but for each k, the possible L's are limited.\n\nSpecifically, for the last interval, L can be any odd integer such that 1 <= L <=k.\n\nBut L must be such that the coverage doesn't extend beyond k.\n\nSo, for L, the coverage must be [k - (L-1)/2, k], and k - (L-1)/2 >=1.\n\nSo, for the last interval, L can be any odd integer where L <=k and (L-1)/2 <=k-1.\n\nBut since L is odd, we can express L as 2t+1, where t >=0.\n\nSo, t can range from 0 to (k-1).\n\nBut for each L, the starting position is s = k - (L-1)/2.\n\nWe need to ensure that s >=1.\n\nSo, for each possible L (as 2t+1), the starting position s is k - t.\n\nWhich must be >=1 â†’ t <=k-1.\n\nSo, for each possible L, we can compute s, and then the number of ways to cover the first s-1 towns.\n\nThus, the recurrence is:\n\nf(k) = sum_{t=0}^{t_max} f(s-1), where s = k -t.\n\nt_max is such that s >=1 â†’ t <=k-1.\n\nBut t can be from 0 to k-1, but L must be at least 1, which is 2*0+1=1.\n\nWait, but for each L=2t+1, t can be 0,1,... up to (k-1), but also, the starting position s=k -t must be >=1.\n\nSo, t can be up to k-1.\n\nThus, the recurrence is:\n\nf(k) = sum_{t=0}^{k-1} f(k-t-1).\n\nWait, because s =k -t â†’ s-1= k-t-1.\n\nSo, f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) + ... + f(0).\n\nBut wait, for k=1, t can be 0.\n\nf(1) = f(0) =1.\n\nFor k=2:\n\nt can be 0: f(1)=1.\n\nt=1: s=2-1=1, s-1=0 â†’ f(0)=1.\n\nt=2-1=1: s=2-2=0 <1, so invalid.\n\nWait, no, for k=2, t can be 0 and 1.\n\nWait, for t=0: L=1, s=2-0=2 â†’ s-1=1 â†’ f(1)=1.\n\nt=1: L=3, s=2-1=1 â†’ s-1=0 â†’ f(0)=1.\n\nSo, f(2)=f(1) + f(0) =1+1=2.\n\nBut earlier, for n=2, the valid subsets are only S={1,2}, each with p=1. So, the count is 1.\n\nWait, but according to this recurrence, f(2)=2.\n\nSo, something is wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach counts more subsets than are actually valid.\n\nBecause when we add a tower at position k with L=1, it's just a single point. But perhaps that tower's coverage is allowed, but other constraints are not considered.\n\nWait, in the case of k=2, when t=1, L=3. So, s=2-1=1, which is 1, and the coverage is 1-3, which includes 3, which is n+1=3 for n=2. So, that's invalid.\n\nSo, this approach is overcounting, because it doesn't check whether the coverage extends beyond n.\n\nAh, right! So, the previous approach doesn't account for the fact that when the coverage goes beyond k, it's invalid.\n\nThus, the recurrence is incorrect.\n\nSo, the problem is more complex because the coverage must not extend beyond k (n).\n\nSo, for the last interval, when choosing L, the coverage must be entirely within 1..k.\n\nThus, for L=2t+1, the coverage starts at s = k -t, and ends at s + L -1 = (k -t) + (2t+1) -1 = k + t.\n\nWait, wait no: coverage is [s, s + L -1] = [k -t, k -t + (2t+1) -1] = [k -t, k + t].\n\nBut for this to be entirely within 1..k, the end must be <=k.\n\nSo, k + t <=k â†’ t <=0.\n\nBut t is >=0.\n\nSo, t can only be 0.\n\nThus, for k>=1, the only possible L is 1, leading to s=k, coverage [k, k], which is valid.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because for k=2, the sample shows that S can be {1,2}, each with L=1.\n\nBut earlier, the recurrence suggested f(2)=2, but according to the actual problem, that's not the case.\n\nWait, this suggests that the problem is more constrained than previously thought.\n\nSo, perhaps the only way to have a valid subset S is when each tower is placed exactly at a position, and their coverage intervals don't extend beyond 1..n.\n\nThus, for the last interval, L can only be 1, because any larger L would cause the coverage to extend beyond k.\n\nWait, but in the sample where n=3, S={2}, p=2, which covers 1,2,3. So, the coverage for k=3 is [1,3], which is within 1..3. So, in that case, L=3 is allowed.\n\nSo, why is that allowed?\n\nBecause for k=3, L=3 implies s=3-1=2, and coverage is 2-1=1 to 2+2=4. Wait, no: L=3, which is 2t+1, t=1.\n\nSo, s=3 -t=3-1=2. Coverage is [2, 2+2=4], which includes 4, which is beyond n=3. Thus, that's invalid.\n\nWait, but in the sample, it's allowed. So, perhaps my understanding is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, in the sample, n=3, S={2}, p=2. So, the coverage is 2-1=1 to 2+1=3. Because p=2, the coverage is [2-1, 2+1] = [1,3]. Which is exactly 1..3. So, for k=3, L=3 is allowed.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier formula, L=3 is 2t+1, t=1. So, s=3 -t=3-1=2. Coverage is 2 to 4, which is beyond 3. So, why is it allowed?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in how L relates to the coverage.\n\nWait, L is 2p_i-1, and p_i can be 2 for m=2, making L=3.\n\nSo, the coverage is m - (L-1)/2 =2 -1=1 to m + (L-1)/2=2+1=3. So, the coverage is [1,3], which is exactly 1..3. So, in this case, the coverage is within 1..3.\n\nSo, for k=3, L=3 is allowed.\n\nSo, the earlier approach is flawed because it didn't correctly compute the coverage.\n\nThus, the issue is that when considering the last interval, the coverage must be [s, e], where e <=k.\n\nSo, for a given L=2t+1, s =k -t, e= s + (L-1)/2 = (k -t) + t =k.\n\nThus, for any L, the coverage ends at k.\n\nThus, for any L, the coverage is [k -t, k], which is within 1..k.\n\nThus, the coverage does not extend beyond k.\n\nSo, for the last interval, any L is allowed as long as s >=1.\n\nSo, s =k -t >=1 â†’ t <=k-1.\n\nThus, the recurrence is correct.\n\nBut then, in the case of n=3, S={2} is allowed, which is counted as f(3) += f(3-1-1)=f(1)=1.\n\nThus, for n=3, the recurrence would give f(3) = sum_{t=0}^{2} f(3-t-1).\n\nWhich is f(2) + f(1) + f(0) = 2 +1 +1=4.\n\nBut in the sample, the correct answer for n=3 is 2 valid subsets: {1,2,3} and {2}",
