The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem is called \"The Number Games.\" Hmm. The setup is that there are n districts connected in such a way that each pair has exactly one path between them. So it's a tree structure.\n\nEach district's contestant has a number of fans equal to 2^i, where i is the district number. The president wants to remove k contestants, but when he does, the districts they're from become inaccessible. So all the remaining districts must form a connected component. Oh right, because otherwise, how would someone travel through the districts that were removed?\n\nWait, no. Wait: the problem says that the removed districts will not allow anyone to cross through them. So the remaining districts must be such that their paths do not go through any removed district. That means the remaining districts form a connected subgraph where all the roads connecting them are still intact, except for those leading into the removed districts.\n\nSo the idea is to choose a set S of k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component. And among all possible choices, we need to maximize the sum of 2^i for each i in the remaining districts. Then, output the list of the k districts to remove, in increasing order.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tree. Since it's a tree, removing a node can split the tree into multiple components. But since we are allowed to remove k nodes, the optimal selection of which nodes to remove will determine which subtrees remain connected.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that after removing k nodes, the remaining districts form a single connected component. So the remaining districts must form a connected subtree of the original tree.\n\nBut wait, no. Because if you remove a node, then any edges connected to it are effectively cut. So the remaining districts must form a connected subtree without going through the removed nodes.\n\nSo the task reduces to finding a connected subtree (which is a connected induced subgraph) of size (n - k), and within all such possible subtrees, select the one with the maximum sum of 2^i for its nodes.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think is that we want to keep as many high-value nodes as possible while ensuring that the kept nodes form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, the value of each node is 2^i, which increases exponentially with i. So higher-numbered nodes have much higher values. Therefore, to maximize the sum, we want to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut the challenge is that these high-numbered nodes might form a subtree that's connected. So perhaps the optimal strategy is to find a path (a chain) that includes the highest possible nodes, and then include all the necessary lower nodes to make sure the path is connected.\n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is to find the minimal set of nodes to remove such that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree, and the sum is maximized.\n\nBut given that the sum is determined by the nodes' indices, perhaps the optimal way is to select a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, forming a connected path.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal solution is to find a path in the tree where the sum of 2^i is maximized, and then remove all other nodes except those on the path.\n\nBecause a path is a connected subtree, and by including all the nodes in the path, the sum would be the sum of 2^i for each node in the path.\n\nWait, but wait: in a tree, any two nodes have exactly one path between them. So if we select a path that starts at some node and goes through several others, and then remove all nodes not on this path, the remaining nodes form a connected subtree.\n\nYes! So the problem reduces to selecting a path in the tree such that the sum of 2^i for the nodes in the path is as large as possible, and then remove all other nodes.\n\nBut since the sum is 2^i, which is exponential, the larger the node numbers, the better. So the optimal path would be the one that includes the largest possible numbers.\n\nWait, but the path can vary in length. For example, including more nodes may give a higher sum. But each node adds 2^i, so adding a node with i=100 is better than adding ten nodes with smaller i.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal path is a simple path that goes through as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nWait, but in a tree, the longest path is the diameter. But perhaps the sum is maximized not necessarily by the longest path, but by the path that includes the largest possible nodes.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes all the nodes in some connected path, and then we remove all other nodes.\n\nSo the approach is: find a path P in the tree, and remove all nodes not in P. The sum is the sum of 2^i for i in P. We need to find the P with the maximum sum, and then return the nodes not in P as the ones to remove.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that the president wants to remove k contestants, so the remaining n -k must form a connected subtree. So the optimal is to find a connected subtree T of size n -k, which has maximum sum of 2^i for its nodes. Then, the nodes not in T are the ones to remove.\n\nBut considering that 2^i is exponential, the sum is maximized when the subtree T contains as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo the plan is: find the subtree T of size m = n -k, which is connected, and has the maximum possible sum of 2^i. Then, the nodes not in T are to be removed.\n\nSo the key is to find such a subtree T.\n\nHow can we model this? Well, perhaps the optimal subtree is a chain where the nodes are as high as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is a path that starts at some node, and includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, in a straight line.\n\nSo the steps I need to perform:\n\n1. Find a path P in the tree, such that the sum of 2^i for nodes in P is as large as possible.\n\n2. The size of P must be m = n -k.\n\n3. Once P is found, the nodes not in P are the ones to remove.\n\nWait, but the sum of P's nodes is 2^i summed over all i in P. To maximize this sum, we need to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nIn a tree, the subtree that includes the highest possible nodes is probably the one that starts from the root and goes down, but that depends on the tree structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that is a path from the node with the highest number down to some lower nodes, but in a way that the path is as long as possible.\n\nBut how do I compute this efficiently?\n\nAn alternative approach is to consider the tree's structure and find the subtree that includes all the nodes above a certain level, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to find the subtree that includes the m largest nodes, and check if they form a connected subtree. If yes, then that's our T. Otherwise, find the next best.\n\nBut with n up to 1e6, we can't do anything O(n^2). So we need an efficient way.\n\nAnother approach: the subtree must form a connected component, so it's a subtree. The subtree with the maximum sum is the one that includes the largest possible nodes arranged in a way that forms a connected subtree.\n\nIn a tree, the subtree with maximum sum is likely the one that is a path that includes the largest possible nodes.\n\nWait, let me think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n6 3\nRoads:\n\n2-1\n\n2-6\n\n4-2\n\n5-6\n\n2-3\n\nSo the tree looks like:\n\n1 is connected to 2.\n\n2 is connected to 3, 4, 6, and 1.\n\n6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo the structure is:\n\n1 is the leftmost, connected to 2.\n\n2 has children 3,4,6.\n\n6 has child 5.\n\nIn the sample, the optimal is to remove 1,3,4. So the remaining districts are 2,5,6.\n\nSum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 +64 = 100.\n\nBut why not include 2,5,6, and 3? Because 3 is 2^3=8, which is less than 4+32+64. So including 3 would add 8, but exclude 4, which is 16. So the sum is 4+32+64=100 vs 8+32+64+4=108. Wait, that's a better sum.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the sample output says they remove 1,3,4. So the remaining nodes are 2,5,6. Their sum is 4+32+64=100.\n\nBut if we don't remove 3, but remove 1 and 4, then the remaining nodes are 2,3,5,6. Their sum is 4+8+32+64=108, which is higher. So why isn't that the case?\n\nAh, but wait: the problem allows us to remove exactly k=3 nodes. So in the sample, the optimal choice is to remove 1,3,4. But another option is to remove 1,4, something else. Or perhaps another selection.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the sample explanation says that the maximum sum is achieved by removing 1,3,4. So the remaining nodes are 2,5,6. Sum is 4+32+64=100.\n\nBut why not also include 3? Because including 3 would require that the subtree remains connected. If we include 3, then we can't have 4, because 2 is connected to both 3 and 4. So if we have 3 and 4, but not 2, then 3 and 4 are not connected. So to have a connected subtree, if we include 3, we must include 2. But 2 is connected to 6 and 5.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from the fact that the subtree must be connected. So including 3,5,6,2 gives a connected subtree, but that's four nodes, which would require removing 1,4, and perhaps another node. But in the sample, k=3, so n-k=3. So the remaining nodes must be three.\n\nSo the sample's optimal solution is to have a subtree of three nodes: 2,5,6. Their sum is 100.\n\nIf we try to include 3, then we'd have to include 2, but then perhaps we can only have three nodes. So perhaps including 3,2,5: sum is 4 +8 +32=44, which is worse than 100.\n\nSo the optimal is indeed to remove 1,3,4.\n\nHmm. So the approach is to find a connected subtree of size m = n -k, and the sum of 2^i is maximum.\n\nNow, the question is how to find this subtree efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the optimal subtree.\n\nSince 2^i grows exponentially with i, the optimal subtree will include as many of the highest-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nIn a tree, the subtree that includes the highest possible nodes is probably a path that starts from the highest node and goes down, including as many high nodes as possible.\n\nAlternatively, it's similar to the problem of finding a subtree that is a chain and includes the largest possible nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that is a path that includes the node with the highest number, and as many as possible nodes in the direction towards the root.\n\nWait, but it's unclear. Another approach is to realize that the subtree must form a connected component, so it's a subtree. The subtree that includes the maximum sum is the one that has the highest possible nodes.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal subtree is a chain that starts from the node with the highest number and extends downwards towards the root, including all possible nodes along that path.\n\nWait, but in a tree, the path from the highest node to the root is unique. So perhaps that's the optimal path.\n\nFor example, in the sample input, the highest node is 6. The path from 6 to the root is 6-2-1. So including nodes 6, 2, and 1. But that's a sum of 64 +4 +2=70. Which is less than 100.\n\nWait, but wait: the sample's optimal is 2,5,6. So that's a different path.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal path isn't necessarily the one starting from the highest node.\n\nHmm, so maybe the approach is to find the path that includes the most valuable nodes, regardless of their position.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother angle: the problem is to find a connected subtree T of size m =n-k, such that the sum of 2^i for i in T is maximum.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the m nodes with the highest 2^i values that form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true because sometimes including a slightly lower node can allow including a much higher node.\n\nWait, but 2^i is exponential, so including even one higher node is worth including many lower nodes.\n\nSo the optimal subtree will consist of a set of nodes that includes the top m highest-numbered nodes, provided they form a connected subtree.\n\nBut if the top m nodes are not connected, then we have to find the next best.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes as many high nodes as possible, in a connected way.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to find the minimal set of nodes to remove such that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree, and the sum is maximum.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative approach: the subtree T must be connected. So, perhaps the subtree T is a path where the sum of 2^i is maximized.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a path in the tree such that the sum of 2^i along the path is maximum, and the length of the path is m =n-k.\n\nBut how to find such a path.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum of a path is the sum of 2^u for u in the path.\n\nWe can model this as a dynamic programming problem, where for each node, we track the maximum sum for paths of various lengths ending at that node.\n\nBut with n up to 1e6, that's not feasible in terms of time.\n\nAlternative idea: since the sum is maximized by including the largest possible 2^i, the optimal path will be a straight line that includes the largest possible nodes in sequence.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that is a straight path, and includes the m largest nodes.\n\nBut how to find such a path.\n\nAnother idea: the subtree T must be connected, so it's a tree itself. The sum is the sum of 2^i for all nodes in T.\n\nWe need to maximize this sum, with |T| =m.\n\nBut 2^i is an exponential function, so the sum is dominated by the largest i in T. So the sum is maximized when T contains as many of the largest i's as possible.\n\nThus, the optimal T is the subtree that includes the m largest i's and is connected.\n\nBut how to find such a T.\n\nIn a tree, the subtree that includes the m largest nodes may not be connected. So perhaps we need to find the minimal number of nodes to remove so that the remaining m nodes are connected.\n\nWait, but the problem is to remove exactly k nodes, so the remaining is m=n-k.\n\nSo, the problem is to find a connected subtree of size m, and the sum is maximized.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Find all possible connected subtrees of size m.\n\n- Among these, find the one with the maximum sum of 2^i.\n\nBut with n up to 1e6, enumerating all possible connected subtrees is impossible.\n\nSo, we need a smarter approach.\n\nAn alternative idea is to realize that the optimal subtree will be a chain that includes the m largest nodes, but possibly with some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the path that includes the m largest nodes. If that's possible, then that's the answer.\n\nOtherwise, we need to find the next best.\n\nSo, perhaps the algorithm is:\n\n1. Sort all nodes in descending order of their value (2^i).\n\n2. Find the earliest point in this sorted list where the first m nodes form a connected subtree.\n\n3. These are the m nodes to keep, and the rest are removed.\n\nBut how to efficiently check whether the first m nodes form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, the m largest nodes may be spread across the tree in such a way that they aren't connected.\n\nSo, the next step is to find the minimal subset of nodes to remove such that the first m nodes form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is a path that includes the largest node, and then as many as possible of the next largest nodes that lie on the path from the largest node to somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to find a path that starts at the largest node and includes as many of the next largest nodes as possible in a straight line.\n\nBut again, the exact method is unclear.\n\nAnother angle: For each node, we can compute the size of the subtree rooted at that node. Maybe the largest subtree in terms of sum 2^i is the one that includes the largest possible nodes.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem as finding a subtree T where the sum of 2^i for all i in T is maximum, and |T|=m.\n\nWe can model this as a priority queue where we greedily add the next highest node, checking if it's connected to the current subtree.\n\nBut again, the implementation is unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal solution is to find a subtree that consists of a path, and the nodes on this path are the m highest-numbered nodes.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n- Find the m highest-numbered nodes.\n\n- Check if they form a connected subtree.\n\n- If yes, then keep them, else find the next best.\n\nBut how to check if they form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, but how to represent the tree for quick look-up of connectivity.\n\nPerhaps using a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure.\n\nBut for m up to 1e6, and checking whether a set of nodes is connected, it's manageable.\n\nWait, here's an idea:\n\n1. Sort all the nodes in descending order of i.\n\n2. Take the first m nodes. Check if they form a connected subtree.\n\n   a. If yes, then we're done.\n\n   b. If no, then remove the smallest node in this initial set and include the next node in the sorted list, and repeat until the set is connected.\n\n3. Once the connected set is found, the remaining nodes are the ones to remove.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the set of m nodes may not be connected, so we have to adjust.\n\nBut how to efficiently manage this.\n\nAlternatively, the process could be:\n\n- Start with the m largest nodes.\n\n- Check if they form a connected subtree.\n\n- If not, remove the smallest node in the current set and add the next node in the sorted list.\n\n- Repeat until the current set is connected.\n\nThis way, each step tries to include the next largest possible node, ensuring that the set is connected.\n\nBut this is a greedy approach and may not always find the optimal solution.\n\nBut considering the problem constraints, perhaps this is the way to go.\n\nBut implementing this may be tricky.\n\nLet me think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n6 3\n\nNodes are 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nSorted in descending order:6,5,4,3,2,1.\n\nm =6-3=3.\n\nTake the top 3:6,5,4.\n\nCheck if they form a connected subtree.\n\nIn the tree, 6 is connected to 2, which is connected to 4. So 6 and 4 are connected via 2. But 5 is connected to 6. So 6,5,4 are connected via 6 and 2, but 4 is connected via 2.\n\nSo 6,5,4 are connected. So the sum is 64 +32 +16=112.\n\nWhich is higher than the sample's 100.\n\nBut in the sample, the output was 1,3,4 being removed, leaving 2,5,6 with sum 100.\n\nSo why is this the case?\n\nAh, because perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait, in the sample, the optimal is to remove 1,3,4, leaving 2,5,6.\n\nSum is 4 +32 +64=100.\n\nBut according to the approach I suggested, the top 3 nodes are 6,5,4, which sum to 64+32+16=112.\n\nBut in the actual tree, 4 is connected to 2, and 2 is connected to 6. So 6,5,4 are connected. So why isn't that the optimal choice?\n\nBecause the sample's output is to remove 1,3,4, which leaves 2,5,6.\n\nSo the sum of the sample's kept nodes is 4+32+64=100, but the sum of 6,5,4 is 112, which is higher.\n\nSo why isn't the sample output removing 4 instead of 3 and 1?\n\nAh, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says that the removed districts are those whose contestants are removed. So the remaining districts must form a connected component.\n\nBut in the initial approach, including 6,5,4 would require that 4 is kept, but 2 is in the subtree.\n\nWait, no, because 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6. So 4,6,2 form a connected subtree. So if we include 4,6,5, the subtree is connected via 6-5 and 6-2-4. So the subtree 4,5,6 is connected.\n\nSo the sum is 16+32+64=112, which is better than the sample's 100.\n\nSo why is the sample output different?\n\nAh, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the tree structure.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the roads are:\n\n2 1\n\n2 6\n\n4 2\n\n5 6\n\n2 3.\n\nSo the tree is:\n\n1 is connected to 2.\n\n2 is connected to 1,3,4,6.\n\n6 is connected to 2,5.\n\nSo the subtree consisting of 4,5,6 is connected as follows:\n\n4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which is connected to 5.\n\nSo the subtree 4,5,6 is connected.\n\nThus, including 4,5,6 would be a connected subtree, which is better than the sample's solution.\n\nSo why is the sample's output not keeping 4,5,6?\n\nBecause the problem requires to remove exactly k=3 districts. So n=6, m=3.\n\nWait, in the sample, the output is to remove 1,3,4, keeping 2,5,6. That's correct because those three are connected.\n\nBut according to the initial approach, the top 3 nodes (6,5,4) form a connected subtree, so why not remove 1,2,3?\n\nWait, no: if we remove 1,2,3, then the remaining nodes are 4,5,6, which are connected. That's a valid solution.\n\nSo why isn't that the case in the sample?\n\nBecause the sample's output is to remove 1,3,4, but why not remove 1,2,3?\n\nBecause 4,5,6 are higher in value than 2,5,6.\n\nSo perhaps the sample's explanation is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the sample input's output is '1 3 4' meaning those three are removed. So the kept nodes are 2,5,6. Their sum is 4+32+64=100.\n\nBut why isn't the optimal to remove 1,2,3, keeping 4,5,6, which sum to 16+32+64=112.\n\nThat would be a better sum.\n\nSo perhaps the sample's explanation is wrong, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that 4,5,6 form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which is connected to 5. So yes, 4,5,6 are connected via 2 and 6.\n\nSo why isn't that the optimal solution?\n\nAh, perhaps because 2 is in the subtree, but when 2 is kept, it's part of the kept subtree. So in that case, the kept nodes are 4,5,6,2. That's four nodes, but m is 3. So that's invalid.\n\nAh! Right. Because m is n -k = 3, the kept subtree must have exactly 3 nodes.\n\nSo in the sample, when trying to include 4,5,6, that's three nodes, but in reality, 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which is connected to 5. So 4,5,6 are connected via 2 and 6. Wait, no: 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which is connected to 5. So 4,5,6 are connected via 2 and 6, but that's a longer path. So 4,5,6 are connected via 2, but 2 is not included in the set. So 4,5,6 form a connected subtree? Or not?\n\nWait, no. Because 4 is connected to 2, but 2 is not in the subtree. So 4 is only connected to 2, which is not in the subtree. So 4,5,6 are connected through 2, but since 2 is not in the subtree, 4 is isolated.\n\nSo 4,5,6 form a connected subtree only if 2 is also included.\n\nSo if the kept subtree is 4,5,6, then 4 is connected via 2, but 2 is not in the subtree. So 4 is disconnected from 5 and 6.\n\nThus, 4,5,6 are not connected.\n\nOh! So that explains why the sample's output is correct.\n\nSo including 4,5,6 would require that 2 is also included, but that would make the subtree size 4, which is more than m=3.\n\nSo the initial approach is flawed because when considering a subset of nodes, just checking if they are connected without considering the actual connections is not enough.\n\nThus, the problem is more complex.\n\nSo, what's the correct approach?\n\nWe need to find a connected subtree T of size m, and the sum of 2^i for nodes in T is maximum.\n\nTo find such a T, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- Find a subtree T where the sum is maximum, and |T|=m.\n\n- T must be connected.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative idea is to model the problem as finding a subtree that is a path. Because a path is a connected subtree, and the sum is maximized when it includes the largest possible nodes.\n\nSo, the optimal solution is to find a path in the tree that includes as many of the largest nodes as possible, with the total length m.\n\nThus, the approach is:\n\n1. Find all possible paths in the tree.\n\n2. For each path, if its length is m, compute the sum of 2^i for the nodes in the path.\n\n3. Choose the path with the maximum sum.\n\n4. The nodes not in this path are the ones to remove.\n\nBut with n up to 1e6, enumerating all paths is impossible.\n\nThus, we need an efficient way to find the optimal path.\n\nAnother observation: the sum is maximized when the path includes the largest possible nodes. So the optimal path is likely a path that starts at the highest node and goes through as many high nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to find such a path.\n\nAn alternative approach inspired by the problem of finding the diameter of a tree:\n\nThe diameter is the longest path between any two nodes.\n\nBut in this problem, the sum is more important than the length.\n\nSo, perhaps for each node, we can compute the maximum sum of a path starting at that node.\n\nThen, the global maximum is the maximum of these values.\n\nBut even this seems computationally expensive for n=1e6.\n\nBut perhaps, since the sum is based on 2^i, which is monotonic, the maximum sum path is one that starts at the highest node and extends as far as possible, collecting as many high nodes as possible.\n\nThus, perhaps the optimal path is the one that starts at the highest node and includes as many of the next highest nodes as possible in a straight line.\n\nThus, the algorithm could be:\n\n- Find the highest node, say H.\n\n- Traverse the tree from H towards the leaves, collecting nodes in a path.\n\n- Count the number of nodes in this path, say L.\n\n- If L >= m, then the path is H, plus the next L-1 nodes in the direction that gives the maximum sum.\n\nWait, perhaps this is the way.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, the approach is to find the path that starts at the highest node and includes the next highest nodes in a way that forms a path.\n\nThus, the steps could be:\n\n1. Find the node with the highest index, H.\n\n2. Then, find the path that starts at H and goes down towards the root, collecting nodes in the direction that maximizes the sum.\n\n3. Continue until the path reaches m nodes.\n\nBut how to determine which direction to go.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node, we can precompute the two directions (left and right, assuming a binary tree, but in general, it's arbitrary) and choose the direction that leads to the higher sum.\n\nBut for a general tree, it's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, for each node, we can track the sum of the path from that node to the root, but that's not sufficient.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nSince the sum is based on 2^i, which is exponential, the best possible path is to have as many as possible high i's in a connected path.\n\nThus, the optimal path is the one that starts at the highest i and includes as many of the next highest i's as possible in a straight line.\n\nThus, the algorithm can be:\n\n- Identify the highest node, H.\n\n- Then, in all possible directions from H, collect nodes in descending order of i, adding them to the path until the path reaches m nodes.\n\n- Among all possible directions, choose the one that gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut again, how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, for the highest node H, we can perform a BFS or DFS, collecting nodes in the order of their i, and stopping once the path reaches m nodes.\n\nBut for n=1e6, this can be done in O(n) time.\n\nThus, the steps would be:\n\n1. Find H, the node with the highest i.\n\n2. Perform a BFS or DFS starting from H, traversing in a way that prioritizes higher i's.\n\n3. Collect nodes in the order of their i, descending.\n\n4. Once the collected path has m nodes, stop.\n\n5. The path is the optimal.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet's test this approach on the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nNodes 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nH is 6.\n\nFrom 6, the adjacent nodes are 2 and 5.\n\n5 has i=5, which is next highest.\n\nSo, we can go to 5, then from 5, perhaps back to 6, but that's already in the path.\n\nWait, no. Once we choose a direction, we proceed in that direction.\n\nWait, perhaps the traversal is along a path.\n\nWait, perhaps the path is 6→2→4.\n\nBut 4 has i=4, which is lower than 5.\n\nSo, the sum would be 64 (6) +32 (5) +16 (4)= 112.\n\nBut earlier, when we tried to include 6,5,4, the sum is higher than the sample's 100.\n\nBut according to the sample, including 6,5,4 is not possible because they are not connected.\n\nWait, but according to the tree structure, 6 is connected to 2 and 5.\n\n5 is connected only to 6.\n\n2 is connected to 6, 1,3,4.\n\nSo, the path 6→5 is a direct edge.\n\n6→2→4 is another edge.\n\nSo, 6,5,4 are connected via 6 and 2.\n\nWait, but in the path 6→5→6→2→4, that's a cycle, but in a tree, there are no cycles.\n\nWait, no, the tree has no cycles. So 6 is connected to 5 and 2. 2 is connected to 4.\n\nSo 6 is connected to 5, and 6 is connected to 2, which is connected to 4.\n\nThus, the path 6 →2 →4 is a separate branch from 6→5.\n\nSo 6,5,4 are not all connected in a single path. Because 5 is connected to 6, but 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6.\n\nThus, the path from 5 to 4 is 5-6-2-4.\n\nSo, including 6,5,4 in a single connected subtree requires that the path is 5-6-2-4, which is a path of 4 nodes.\n\nBut m is 3, so including 4 nodes is not allowed.\n\nThus, the maximum path that can be formed from H is either 6→5 (sum 64+32=96) or 6→2→4 (sum 64+4+16=84). Or 6→2→3 (sum 64+4+8=76).\n\nSo the best among these is 6→5, sum 96.\n\nBut wait, what about the path 6→2→5? No, because 2 and 5 are not directly connected.\n\nWait, no, 2 and 5 are connected via 6. So the path 6→2→5 is 6→2 (connected) and 2→5 is not directly connected. So that's not a path.\n\nThus, the best path starting at 6 is either 6→5, or 6→2→4, etc.\n\nSo the maximum sum is 96 for 6→5, but that's only two nodes.\n\nBut m=3.\n\nSo, perhaps the next best is to take 6→5→... but there's no further nodes beyond 5.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal is to take 6→2→4, which is three nodes, sum 64+4+16=84.\n\nBut in the sample, the kept nodes are 2,5,6, which sum to 4+32+64=100.\n\nSo that's better.\n\nThus, the initial approach is not sufficient.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the approach of starting at the highest node and extending in a single direction may not capture all possibilities.\n\nThus, perhaps the problem requires finding a subtree that is connected and has the maximum sum, but how?\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe optimal subtree T must be such that it includes the node with the highest i, and as many as possible of the next highest i's, but in a way that they are all connected.\n\nThus, the approach is:\n\n1. The subtree must include the highest node, H.\n\n2. Then, include as many as possible of the next highest nodes, provided they are connected to the current subtree.\n\n3. Continue until the subtree has m nodes.\n\nThus, the steps would be:\n\na. Start with H.\n\nb. Add the next highest node that is connected to the current subtree.\n\nc. Continue until the subtree has m nodes.\n\nd. The nodes in the subtree are the ones to keep; the rest are removed.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nImplementation Steps:\n\n1. Sort all nodes in descending order of i.\n\n2. The first node is H.\n\n3. We need to collect m nodes.\n\n4. For each next node in the sorted list, check if it is connected to any node in the current subtree.\n\n5. Once we find such a node, add it to the subtree.\n\n6. Continue until m nodes are collected.\n\nBut how to efficiently check if a node is connected to the current subtree.\n\nWe can use a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure.\n\nHere's how:\n\n- Initialize DSU with all nodes.\n\n- The current subtree is initially just H.\n\n- Mark H as part of the current subtree.\n\n- For each node in the sorted list (after H), check if it is connected to any node in the current subtree.\n\n   - To do this, for each node, find its parent in the DSU. If any parent is in the current subtree, then this node is connected.\n\n   - Once such a node is found, add it to the current subtree.\n\n   - Union this node with the current subtree.\n\n- Once the current subtree has m nodes, stop.\n\nThus, the algorithm works as follows:\n\n- Start with H.\n\n- For each next node in the sorted list, check if it's connected to any node in the current subtree.\n\n- If yes, add it to the subtree.\n\n- Repeat until m nodes are added.\n\nOnce the subtree is built, the nodes not in it are the ones to be removed.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nGiven that n can be up to 1e6, the DSU operations must be efficient.\n\nBut checking for each node whether it's connected to the current subtree can be done in O(1) per node, using the DSU's find function.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n- Sort all nodes in descending",
