    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Golden Plate,\" and from the description, I need to calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding k rings of gilding.\n\nHmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully. Oh right, each ring is formed by the perimeter of a rectangle that's progressively smaller. The first ring is along the edge, then the next is two cells in, and so on. Each ring is one cell thick.\n\nSo the input gives me w (width), h (height), and k (number of rings). My task is to compute the total number of gilded cells.\n\nLet me think about how to model each ring. For each i-th ring (starting from 1 to k), the dimensions of the rectangle are (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, why 4? Because when you add a ring, you subtract 2 from both sides for width and height—since each side reduces by 2 cells. So each ring reduces both dimensions by 4 units because we take off 2 from each side.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's see: for the first ring, it's the perimeter of the original rectangle. Then, the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. So the inner rectangle would be (w-4) x (h-4), right? Because for each side, we're removing 2 cells (left and right for width, top and bottom for height). So each ring reduces the size by 4 in both dimensions.\n\nSo for each ring i, the current width is w_i = w - 4*(i-1), and similarly for h_i = h -4*(i-1). But wait, if i is 1, then w_i is w, which makes sense. But for i=2, it's w-4*1 = w-4, etc.\n\nNow, for each ring, the number of cells is the perimeter of the rectangle minus 4, because the corners are counted twice otherwise. Wait, how do I calculate the perimeter?\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(width + height) - 4. Because the four corners are counted once each in both the width and height. So for example, a 3x3 square has a perimeter of 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8, which matches the first example.\n\nSo for each ring i, the number of cells is 2*(w_i + h_i) -4. But we have to make sure that w_i and h_i are at least 3, but since the constraints say that k is such that all rings can be formed, perhaps I don't need to worry about that.\n\nSo the approach is: for each ring from 1 to k, calculate 2*(w_i + h_i) -4, sum all these values.\n\nWait, let's test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example: input is 3 3 1. So for i=1, w_i=3, h_i=3. The perimeter is 2*(3+3)-4= 12-4=8. Which matches the output of 8.\n\nSecond example: input is 7 9 1. So for i=1, 2*(7+9)-4= 32-4=28. Which is the output.\n\nThird example: input is 7 9 2. So for i=1, it's 28, and for i=2, the dimensions are 7-4=3 and 9-4=5. So perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4= 16-4=12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the output.\n\nGreat, that seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read w, h, k from input.\n2. Initialize a total to 0.\n3. For each i from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n   c. Compute perimeter as 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n   d. Add this to total.\n4. Output the total.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that for each i, current_w and current_h are at least 3. Because the ring can only be formed if the rectangle is at least 3x3. Otherwise, the ring wouldn't exist.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input k is constrained such that all rings can be formed. So I don't have to handle cases where current_w or current_h drop below 3 before processing all k rings.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as three integers. So, something like:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, initialize total = 0.\n\nLoop from i=1 to i=k:\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n    current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) -4\n    total += perimeter\n\nPrint(total)\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nLet me test it with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\nInput: 3 3 1\nLoop runs once:\ncurrent_w=3, current_h=3\nperimeter = 2*(6) -4 = 8. Total is 8. Output is 8.\n\nSample 2:\n7 9 1 → 28.\n\nSample 3:\n7 9 2:\ni=1: 7+9*2 → 2*(16) -4=32-4=28.\ni=2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. 3+5=8 → 2*8=16-4=12. 28+12=40.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: let's think of a larger k.\n\nSuppose w=5, h=5, k=2.\n\ni=1: 5x5 → perimeter is 2*(10) -4=20-4=16.\ni=2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. But wait, 1x1 is not enough for a ring. But according to problem statement, k will not exceed the maximum possible. So in this case, maybe k can be up to (min(5,5)+1)/4 = (5+1)/4=1.5 → floor is 1. So k=2 is invalid. So our code doesn't have to handle that.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input k is constrained such that it's within the allowed maximum. So in the code, we can safely process all i from 1 to k without checking.\n\nWhat if w and h are different? Like w=4, h=6, k=1.\n\ni=1: 4x6 → perimeter is 2*(10)-4=16. So 16 cells.\n\nAnother test: w=11, h=15, k=3.\n\ni=1: 11x15 → 2*(26) -4=52-4=48.\ni=2: 11-4=7, 15-4=11 → 2*(18)-4=36-4=32. So total is 80.\ni=3: 7-4=3, 11-4=7 → 3x7: 2*(10) -4=20-4=16. Total becomes 96.\n\nSo yes, the code works.\n\nSo the code is simple. Now, write it in Python.\n\nMake sure to read the input correctly, compute the sum, and print as integer.\n\nNo edge cases beyond what's given, since k is constrained.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead the input, split into w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total=0.\n\nLoop over i from 1 to k:\n\nCompute current_w = w -4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\nAdd 2*(current_w + current_h) -4 to total.\n\nFinally, print(total)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → 8.\n\nSample Input 2:7 9 1 →28.\n\nSample Input3:7 9 2 → 28+12=40.\n\nAll correct.\n\nSo the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding k rings of gilding. Each ring is formed by the perimeter of an increasingly smaller rectangle inside the plate.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each ring is formed by the perimeter of a rectangle that is 2 cells away from the edge of the previous ring. The i-th ring reduces the width and height of the rectangle by 4 units each (2 cells from each side).\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells is given by the perimeter of the current rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle with dimensions w and h is calculated as \\(2 \\times (w + h) - 4\\), where we subtract 4 to avoid double-counting the corners.\n3. **Summing Up**: We sum the number of gilded cells for each of the k rings starting from the outermost ring to the innermost ring.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers w (width), h (height), and k (number of rings).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, calculate the current width and height by reducing the original dimensions by 4 units for each previous ring.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each ring, compute the perimeter and add it to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells after processing all k rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by iterating through each ring and summing up the perimeters, ensuring that all constraints are met as specified in the problem statement.",
