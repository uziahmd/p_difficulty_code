The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a Rock-Paper-Scissors game between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They play n rounds, and in each round, the winner gives the loser a pinch, which leaves a red spot. We need to calculate how many red spots each has after all the rounds.\n\nHmm, let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n- Each player has their own sequence of moves that they cycle through.\n- For each round, both choose the next move in their respective sequences. So, for the i-th round, Nikephoros uses A[i % m], where m is the length of his sequence. Similarly for Polycarpus with B[i % k].\n- Then, we determine who wins each round. If it's a draw, no one gets a spot. Otherwise, the winner gets a point, and the loser adds a spot.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that the loser gets pinched. So each round, if there's a winner (not a draw), the loser gets a spot. So for each round, exactly one person gets a spot unless it's a draw.\n\nSo our task is to simulate each round, determine the outcome, and count the number of times each loses.\n\nBut simulating each round for n up to 2e5 (200,000) is manageable because 2e5 is not too big for Python.\n\nWait, but wait. The sequences A and B can be up to 1000 characters each. So for each round, we have to find the current choice of each player based on their cyclic sequences.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFor each round i from 0 to n-1:\n\n- a = A[i % len(A)]\n- b = B[i % len(B)]\n- Determine the winner between a and b.\n\nIf a beats b: then Polycarpus loses, so he gets a spot. Or wait, no—wait, the winner is the one who pinches the loser. So if a beats b, then a's player (Nikephoros) is the winner, so Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\nSimilarly, if b beats a, then Polycarpus is the winner, so Nikephoros gets a spot.\n\nIf it's a draw, no one gets a spot.\n\nSo for each round, we have to compare a and b and decide who wins.\n\nWe can precompute for all possible pairs which one wins. Since the number of possible pairs is 3*3=9, we can create a function that returns the winner for any pair.\n\nAlternatively, during each round, we can compute whether a beats b, etc.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize two counters, nike and poly, to 0.\n\nFor each round from 0 to n-1:\n\n- Get a from A's (i mod lenA)th position.\n- Get b from B's (i mod lenB)th position.\n- Compare a and b:\n   - If a == b: continue.\n   - Else, determine who wins.\n   - Increment the appropriate counter.\n\nAt the end, output the two counts.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement the comparison.\n\nIn Rock-Paper-Scissors:\n\n- Rock beats Scissors.\n- Scissors beats Paper.\n- Paper beats Rock.\n\nSo, for two choices x and y:\n\nx beats y if:\n\n(x is R and y is S) or\n(x is S and y is P) or\n(x is P and y is R)\n\nIf this condition is true, then x's player wins, so the other gets a spot.\n\nElse, if y beats x, then y's player wins, so the other gets a spot.\n\nSo for each a and b, check if a beats b. If yes, poly +=1 (since Poly lost). Else, if b beats a, then nike +=1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in each round, the winner is the one whose choice beats the other. So the winner is the one who gets to give the pinch. So the loser is the one getting the spot.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nIf a beats b: then a is the winner, so b's player (Poly) gets a spot. So Poly's count increases.\n\nIf b beats a: then a's player (Nikephoros) loses, so his count increases.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif a beats b:\n    poly += 1\nelse:\n    if b beats a:\n        nike += 1\n\nWait, no. Because if a doesn't beat b, then either b beats a or it's a draw.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nif a != b:\n   if (a beats b):\n       poly +=1\n   else:\n       nike +=1\n\nBecause if a and b are different, someone must win.\n\nSo now, the main thing is to figure out whether a beats b.\n\nLet's represent the beats relationships as a dictionary or a function.\n\nAlternatively, for given x and y, return True if x beats y.\n\nSo for x in ['R', 'S', 'P'] and y in same:\n\ndef beats(x, y):\n    if (x == 'R' and y == 'S') or (x == 'S' and y == 'P') or (x == 'P' and y == 'R'):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nSo in each iteration, for a and b:\n\nif a == b:\n   continue\nelse:\n   if beats(a, b):\n       poly +=1\n   else:\n       nike +=1\n\nWait, no. Because if a beats b, then a's player (Nikephoros) wins, so Poly gets a spot.\n\nSo for a beats b:\n\npoly +=1\n\nIf b beats a:\n\nnike +=1\n\nYes.\n\nSo putting it together.\n\nSo now, the steps:\n\nRead n, then A, then B.\n\nCompute lenA = len(A), lenB = len(B).\n\nLoop i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   a = A[i % lenA]\n   b = B[i % lenB]\n\n   if a == b:\n       continue\n   if (a beats b):\n       poly +=1\n   else:\n       nike +=1\n\nFinally, print(nike, poly)\n\nWait, but wait. What is the initial state? Both start with zero red spots. So for each loss, we add 1.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n7\nRPS\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\" (length 3)\nB is \"RSPP\" (length 4)\n\nRounds:\n\ni=0: A[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R → same, no spots.\n\ni=1: A[1%3]=P, B[1%4]=S → P vs S. Does P beat S? No, because S beats P. So a is P, b is S. Does P beat S? No. So since a is P, b is S: does P beat S? No, because S beats P. So b's choice is S, which beats P. So a is P, b is S. So b beats a. So the winner is b's player (Polycarpus), so a's player (Nikephoros) gets a spot. So nike +=1.\n\ni=2: A[2%3] = S, B[2%4] = R. S vs R. Does S beat R? Yes. So a's player wins, poly +=1.\n\ni=3: A[3%3]=R, B[3%4]=P. R vs P. R beats P? No, P beats R. So a is R, b is P. So R does not beat P. So b's player (Polycarpus) wins, so a's player (Nikephoros) gets a spot. So nike +=1.\n\ni=4: A[4%3]=P, B[4%4]=P. Same, no spot.\n\ni=5: A[5%3]=R, B[5%4]=S. R vs S. R beats S. So a's player wins, poly +=1.\n\ni=6: A[6%3]=P, B[6%4]=R. P vs R. P beats R. So a's player wins, poly +=1.\n\nWait, but in the note, the sample output is 3 and 2. So let's recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order.\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → P loses (so S wins, meaning Poly's choice beats Nike's. So Poly gets a spot? Or wait, in that case, since P is beaten by S, the winner is Poly's choice (S) because S beats P. So Poly would lose, because he chose S and won? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says the loser gets pinched.\n\nSo when a player's choice beats the other's, that player is the winner, the other is the loser, so the loser gets a spot.\n\nSo for each round, if a beats b: then a's player is the winner, so b's player (Poly) gets a spot.\n\nWait, no: if a is the winner, then Poly lost, so he gets a spot.\n\nSo for each round, if a beats b → Poly's spot count increases.\n\nIf b beats a → Nike's spot count increases.\n\nSo in the sample:\n\nRound 1: both R → no change.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → P is a, S is b. Does P beat S? No, S beats P. So b beats a. So Nike's spot increases.\n\nRound 3: S vs R → S beats R. So a is S, b is R. So a beats b → Poly's spot increases.\n\nRound 4: R vs P → R is a, P is b. R beats P? No, P beats R. So b beats a. So Nike's spot increases.\n\nRound 5: P vs P → no change.\n\nRound 6: R vs S → R beats S. So a beats b → Poly's spot increases.\n\nRound 7: P vs R → P beats R. So a beats b → Poly's spot increases.\n\nSo after 7 rounds:\n\nNike has 2 spots (rounds 2 and 4).\n\nPoly has 3 spots (rounds 3,6,7).\n\nWhich matches the sample output of 3 2.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier code logic, for each round where a beats b, poly +=1.\n\nWait, let me re-examine.\n\nIn the code, if a beats b: poly +=1.\n\nElse, if b beats a: nike +=1.\n\nWait, in Round 2: a is P, b is S. Does P beat S? No. So b beats a. So in code, else clause is triggered, and since b beats a, we do nike +=1.\n\nWhich is correct because Poly's choice S beats P, so Poly is the winner. So Nike loses, so he gets a spot.\n\nSimilarly, in Round 3: a is S, b is R. S beats R. So code will do poly +=1.\n\nRound 4: a is R, b is P. R is beaten by P. So in code, a doesn't beat b. So else clause: b beats a, so code will do nike +=1.\n\nRound 6: a is R, b is S. R beats S. So code: poly +=1.\n\nRound 7: a is P, b is R. P beats R. So code: poly +=1.\n\nSo total for poly: 3 (rounds 3,6,7). For nike: 2 (rounds 2 and 4).\n\nSo the counts are 3 and 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling the input correctly.\n\nWait, the input is given as three lines: first line is n, second is A, third is B.\n\nWait, in the example, the input is written as ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR'], but that's probably a typo in the way the user presented it. So in reality, the input is three lines: first line is n, second is A, third is B.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo, the code is manageable.\n\nNow, considering edge cases.\n\nCase where n is zero: but according to the problem statement, n is at least 1.\n\nAnother case: when all rounds are draws. Then both have zero.\n\nAnother case: when the sequences are such that every time a certain choice is made.\n\nE.g., A is RRR, B is PPP. So for each round, a is R, b is P. R is beaten by P. So in each round, b beats a. So for n rounds, each time, b wins, so a's player (Nike) gets a spot. So after n rounds, Nike has n spots, Poly has zero.\n\nWait, no. Because for each round, a is R, b is P. So b beats a. So the winner is b's player (Poly), so a's player (Nike) gets a spot. So for each round, Nike gains one.\n\nSo for n=3, output is 3 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A is 'R', B is 'S'. So a is R, b is S. R beats S. So poly +=1. Output is 0 1.\n\nAnother case: n=1, A='S', B='R'. Then a is S, b is R. S beats R. So poly +=1.\n\nWait, in code, a is 'S', b is 'R'. So a beats b, so poly +=1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, considering performance. For n up to 2e5, and for each iteration, it's O(1) operations, it's acceptable.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nInitialize nike = 0, poly = 0.\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a = A[i % len(A)]\n    b = B[i % len(B)]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    # determine who wins\n    a_beats = (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R')\n    if a_beats:\n        poly +=1\n    else:\n        nike +=1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code against the sample:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\nRPS\nRSPP\n\nAs before, the code should output 3 2.\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\nLoop i from 0 to 6.\n\ni=0: a=R, b=R → same.\n\ni=1: a=P, b=S → P vs S. Does P beat S? No, S beats P. So a does not beat. So else clause: nike +=1.\n\ni=2: a=S, b=R → S beats R. So a beats. poly +=1.\n\ni=3: a=R, b=P → R vs P. R doesn't beat P. So else clause: b beats a → nike +=1.\n\ni=4: a=P, b=P → same.\n\ni=5: a=R, b=S → R beats S → poly +=1.\n\ni=6: a=P, b=R → P beats R → poly +=1.\n\nSo total:\n\npoly is 3, nike is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A='R', B='P'.\n\na is R, b is P. R is beaten by P. So a does not beat, so else clause: nike +=1.\n\nSo output is 1 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A='P', B='R'. a is P, b is R. P beats R → poly +=1.\n\nOutput is 0 1.\n\nSo code handles this.\n\nI think this covers all cases. Now, the code can be written accordingly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, after they play a series of Rock-Paper-Scissors games. Each round is played according to cyclic sequences of moves chosen by each player.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game is played in rounds where each player follows a cyclic sequence of moves. The winner of each round gives the loser a pinch, resulting in a red spot. The goal is to count the number of red spots each player accumulates over `n` rounds.\n2. **Intuition**: For each round, both players choose their next move from their respective sequences. The outcome of each round is determined by the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules. If the same move is chosen, it's a draw, and no one gets a spot. Otherwise, the move that wins according to the rules results in the loser getting a spot.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the input values for the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` (for Nikephoros) and `B` (for Polycarpus).\n   - Initialize counters for the red spots of both players.\n   - For each round, determine the move of each player based on their cyclic sequences.\n   - Check if the moves result in a win for either player and update the respective counter.\n4. **Complexity**: The solution efficiently handles up to 200,000 rounds with constant time operations per round, making it suitable for large inputs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nnike = 0\npoly = 0\n\nlenA = len(A)\nlenB = len(B)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a = A[i % lenA]\n    b = B[i % lenB]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    a_beats = (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R')\n    if a_beats:\n        poly += 1\n    else:\n        nike += 1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of rounds `n` and the sequences `A` and `B`.\n- **Initialization**: Counters `nike` and `poly` are initialized to zero to keep track of the red spots.\n- **Loop Through Rounds**: For each round, the current move of each player is determined using modulo operations to cycle through their sequences.\n- **Determine Winner**: For each round, the code checks if the current move of one player beats the move of the other. If so, the respective counter is incremented.\n- **Output Result**: After processing all rounds, the counts of red spots for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and correctly handles all edge cases, providing the correct counts of red spots after each round of the game.",
