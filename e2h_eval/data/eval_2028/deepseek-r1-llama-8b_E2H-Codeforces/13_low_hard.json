For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. Let's think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem defines a major triad as having two intervals: 4 semitones and 3 semitones when the notes are ordered in a specific way. Similarly, a minor triad has 3 and 4 semitones. The notes can be in any order initially, but we need to check all possible orderings to see if they fit either category.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Generate all possible permutations of the three notes.\n2. For each permutation (X, Y, Z), calculate the distances between X and Y, Y and Z, and X and Z.\n3. Check if any of these permutations satisfy the major or minor conditions.\n4. Once a condition is met, classify the chord accordingly.\n5. If none of the permutations meet either condition, classify it as strange.\n\nBut wait, how do I represent the notes and calculate the distances? Hmm.\n\nThe notes are given as strings like 'C', 'C#', etc. So I'll need to map each note to its position in the scale. Let's list out the order and their indices:\n\nThe sequence is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait—wait, no, in the problem statement, after H comes C again. But the list seems to have 12 notes, including H as the last. Or did I misread?\n\nWait, the problem says there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's 12 notes. So the order is as listed, and after H is C again.\n\nWait, but wait: in the problem statement, the note after H is C. So in the scale, it's cyclic.\n\nSo I should create a list of the notes in order, then each note can be assigned an index from 0 to 11. Then, for any two notes, the distance is calculated by finding their positions, then the minimal number of steps in the circle.\n\nWait, but the distance is measured from lower to higher. So for two notes, say X and Y, the distance is (Y - X) mod 12, multiplied by 1 semitone per step. Because each consecutive note is one semitone apart.\n\nWait, the problem says that between two consecutive notes is exactly one semitone, which is 0.5 tone. But when measuring the distance from X to Y, it's the sum of semitones between them when moving upward.\n\nSo, for example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones because C → C# → D → D# → E: four steps. And E to C is 8 semitones because E → F → F# → G → G# → A → A# → B → H → C. Wait, but wait, H is followed by C. Wait, H is the 11th note, then C is 0. So from H to C is 1 semitone. So the total from E to C is 8 semitones.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the distance is taken from the lower tone to the upper tone. So for X and Y, if X is lower than Y, the distance is Y - X; else, it wraps around.\n\nSo, to calculate the distance between two notes correctly, I should compute (y_index - x_index) mod 12, but if the result is negative, add 12. Because, for example, E (position 4) to C (0): (0 -4) mod12 is 8, which is correct.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: E is at index 4, C is at 0. The distance from E to C is 8 semitones. How is that computed? Because when you move upwards from E, you go E→F→F#→G→G#→A→A#→B→H→C, which is 8 semitones.\n\nSo the calculation is (12 - (E's index - C's index)) % 12. Wait, E is 4, C is 0. 4-0=4, so 12-4=8. Which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, the distance can be calculated as (y_pos - x_pos + 12) %12. Because if y_pos < x_pos, adding 12 ensures it's positive before mod.\n\nSo for two notes X and Y, their distance is (y_pos - x_pos) %12. Because if X is earlier than Y, the distance is positive. If X is later, the mod 12 will wrap around",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of the notes to see if they fit the defined intervals for major or minor triads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Mapping**: First, map each note to its position in the musical scale. This helps in calculating the distances between notes.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: Since the order of notes can vary, generate all possible permutations of the three notes.\n3. **Calculate Distances**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes and check if they match the required intervals for major or minor triads.\n4. **Check Conditions**: For each permutation, check if the distances match the criteria for a major (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) or minor (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones) triad.\n5. **Classify the Chord**: Based on the checks, classify the chord as major, minor, or strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ndef calculate_distance(x, y):\n    return (y - x) % 12\n\ndef is_major(X, Y, Z):\n    d_xy = calculate_distance(note_to_index[X], note_to_index[Y])\n    d_yz = calculate_distance(note_to_index[Y], note_to_index[Z])\n    return d_xy == 4 and d_yz == 3\n\ndef is_minor(X, Y, Z):\n    d_xy = calculate_distance(note_to_index[X], note_to_index[Y])\n    d_yz = calculate_distance(note_to_index[Y], note_to_index[Z])\n    return d_xy == 3 and d_yz == 4\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_notes = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    notes = input_notes[:3]\n    \n    from itertools import permutations\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n        X, Y, Z = perm\n        \n        if is_major(X, Y, Z):\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        if is_minor(X, Y, Z):\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    \n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: Each note is assigned an index based on its position in the musical scale. This allows us to compute distances easily.\n2. **Permutations**: By generating all permutations of the three notes, we ensure that we consider every possible ordering to find the correct intervals.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n4. **Condition Checks**: For each permutation, we check if the distances match the criteria for a major or minor triad. If either condition is met, the chord is classified accordingly.\n5. **Efficiency**: The approach efficiently checks all possible orderings using permutations and ensures that we correctly identify the type of chord based on the given intervals.",
