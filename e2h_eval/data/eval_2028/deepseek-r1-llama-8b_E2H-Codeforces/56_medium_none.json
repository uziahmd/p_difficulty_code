Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Guard Duty,\" and from the description, I understand that we need to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases in such a way that each base has exactly one spaceship, and vice versa. But there's a catch: the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship shouldn't intersect any other paths. So, no two straight lines connecting a base to its spaceship should cross each other in the galaxy plane.\n\nHmm, right. So first, the input consists of R rebel spaceships and B bases. Both R and B can be up to 10, which isn't too bad for computation. The output is either \"Yes\" or \"No\" depending on whether such an assignment is possible.\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to take.\n\nThe first thing is that the assignment must be a perfect matching between R and B. Wait, but wait—wait, the problem says R is the number of Rebel spaceships and B is the number of bases. So if R != B, then it's impossible. Oh, but the problem statement says that each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base and vice versa. So R must equal B, otherwise, it's immediately impossible. Oh, but looking at the sample input, in the second example, R=2, B=3, so the output is No. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the first check I need to perform is whether R equals B. If not, output No.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first case is R=3, B=3, so it's possible. So yeah, R must equal B.\n\nSo step one: check if R == B. If not, output No.\n\nThen, assuming R = B, we need to find a permutation of the bases such that when each base is connected to its assigned spaceship, none of these lines intersect.\n\nWait, how do we model this? It sounds like a bipartite matching problem where we have to find a perfect matching, and also ensure that the edges (which represent the lines) don't cross each other.\n\nHmm, but how do we determine if any two edges cross?\n\nEach edge connects a base point to a spaceship point. So for each pair (base i, spaceship j), we can compute the line segment between them and check whether any two such segments cross.\n\nBut since we're trying all possible permutations, perhaps the approach is to generate all possible permutations of the bases and their corresponding spaceships and check for each permutation whether the segments are non-crossing.\n\nBut wait, with R=10, the number of permutations is 10! which is about 3.6 million. Hmm, that's manageable in Python, especially since each permutation can be checked quickly.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Check if R != B. If so, output No.\n2. Otherwise, collect the positions of the spaceships and the bases into two separate lists.\n3. Generate all possible permutations of the bases. For each permutation:\n   a. Create a list of pairs where each base is matched to a spaceship in the order of the permutation.\n   b. For each pair, create a line segment between the base's coordinates and the spaceship's coordinates.\n   c. Check if any two line segments intersect.\n   d. If a permutation exists where no two segments intersect, output Yes.\n4. If none of the permutations satisfy the condition, output No.\n\nBut wait, the bases and spaceships can be in any order. So for each permutation of the bases, we pair each base in the order of the permutation with the spaceships in the same order. So the i-th base in the permutation is paired with the i-th spaceship.\n\nWait, no, perhaps that's not correct. Because the spaceships are fixed. So the permutation represents a mapping from each base to a spaceship. So for each permutation, the i-th element is the index of the base, and the j-th element is the index of the spaceship. So base 0 is mapped to spaceship p[0], base 1 to p[1], etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting the permutation wrong. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the bases are [b0, b1, b2] and the spaceships are [s0, s1, s2]. A permutation is a list like [2,0,1], which would mean b0 is matched with s2, b1 with s0, and b2 with s1.\n\nSo for each permutation, we need to match each base in the order of the permutation to the spaceships in the same order. So the first element of the permutation determines which spaceship is assigned to the first base, and so on.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nFor each possible permutation of the bases (since the bases are fixed, perhaps the permutation represents a way to match each base to a spaceship, but that might not be the case). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is as a bipartite graph where the left nodes are the bases and the right nodes are the spaceships. An edge exists between a base and a spaceship if the line connecting them doesn't cross any other edges. But that's dynamic and depends on the other edges, which makes it difficult to model directly.\n\nAlternatively, considering all possible perfect matchings and checking for each if the segments are non-crossing.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a perfect matching in a bipartite graph where the edges are those between a base and a spaceship, and such that all the selected edges' line segments don't cross each other.\n\nBut how do we efficiently check if all selected edges are non-crossing?\n\nThis seems computationally expensive because for each permutation (perfect matching), we need to check all O(R^2) pairs of edges to see if any intersect.\n\nBut given that R is small (up to 10), even 10! is manageable. Let's compute 10! = 3,628,800. For each permutation, we need to check C(10,2) = 45 pairs of line segments. So total operations are around 3.6e6 * 45 = 162 million. That's acceptable for Python, right? Because each operation is simple—comparing line segments for intersection.\n\nWait, but line segment intersection checking can be done efficiently.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read R and B. If R != B, output No.\n- Read R spaceship coordinates, store in a list.\n- Read B base coordinates, store in a list.\n- Generate all possible permutations of the B bases (since each base must be matched to exactly one spaceship, and each spaceship to exactly one base).\n- For each permutation:\n   - For each i from 0 to R-1:\n      - The i-th base in the permutation is matched to the i-th spaceship.\n   - Now, for this matching, create all the line segments between the bases and their assigned spaceships.\n   - Check if any two line segments intersect.\n   - If none intersect, then output Yes.\n- If after checking all permutations none work, output No.\n\nWait, but wait: the permutation is of the B bases. So for each permutation, the i-th element is the index of the base to assign to the i-th spaceship. Or perhaps it's better to permute the list of spaceships and assign each to the bases in order.\n\nAlternatively, for each permutation of the spaceships, assign the i-th spaceship to the i-th base. Or perhaps not, because the order in which the bases are considered may vary.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to permute the list of spaceships and then match each spaceship in the permutation to the corresponding base in the original order. So for each permutation, we have a list where the i-th element is the spaceship assigned to the i-th base.\n\nWait, perhaps the permutation is of the spaceship indices. So for each permutation, we have a list where the i-th element is the spaceship index, and thus the i-th base is matched to that spaceship.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo for example, if the spaceship indices are [0,1,2], a permutation [2,0,1] would mean:\n\nBase 0 → spaceship 2\n\nBase 1 → spaceship 0\n\nBase 2 → spaceship 1\n\nSo the code can proceed by generating all possible permutations of the spaceship indices, and for each, check if the corresponding line segments don't cross.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B: print 'No' and exit.\n\nRead R spaceships: s_list = [ (x1,y1), ... ]\n\nRead B bases: b_list = [ (x1,y1), ... ]\n\nGenerate all possible permutations of range(R) (i.e., 0..R-1).\n\nFor each permutation in permutations:\n\n   create a list of pairs, where for each i, the i-th base is matched to s_list[permutation[i]]\n\n   collect all these line segments.\n\n   check if any two segments in this collection intersect.\n\n   if none intersect, output 'Yes' and exit.\n\nAfter all permutations, if none worked, output 'No'.\n\nNow, the key part is implementing the line segment intersection check.\n\nHow do we check if two line segments AB and CD intersect?\n\nI remember that the standard approach is to use the cross product to determine if the segments intersect.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nGiven two line segments AB and CD, where A and B are points, and C and D are points.\n\nCompute the orientation of the four points to determine if the lines cross.\n\nBut perhaps a more efficient way is to check if the segments intersect by seeing if the endpoints of one segment lie on opposite sides of the other segment.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the separating axis theorem, which checks for each axis (x and y) whether the projections of the segments onto that axis do not overlap.\n\nWait, let me think.\n\nTwo line segments AB and CD intersect if and only if they straddle each other. So, for each of the x and y axes, the projections of the two segments must overlap.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The separating axis theorem states that two convex shapes do not overlap if there exists an axis along which their projections do not overlap. So for line segments, which are convex, if there exists an axis where their projections do not overlap, the segments do not intersect. Conversely, if for all axes, the projections overlap, then the segments intersect or are coincident.\n\nBut in our case, we want to find if two segments intersect. So, for each pair of segments, we can compute the axis (either x or y) where the projections do not overlap, which would indicate that the segments do not intersect.\n\nWait, but for line segments, the axis to consider is the direction perpendicular to the segments. Alternatively, we can compute for each pair of segments whether the two line segments intersect by checking if they cross each other.\n\nSo perhaps the best way is to implement a function that takes two line segments and returns True if they intersect.\n\nI recall that the method involves computing the orientation of the points.\n\nLet me try to write a helper function.\n\nFunction: segments_intersect(a, b, c, d) -> bool\n\nWhere a, b are the endpoints of segment 1; c, d are the endpoints of segment 2.\n\nImplement using the cross product method.\n\nHere's a method:\n\nCompute the cross product of (c - a) and (d - b). If it's zero, the lines are collinear, so check if the segments overlap.\n\nIf it's not zero, the lines don't intersect.\n\nElse, for each segment, compute whether the two points lie on opposite sides of the other segment.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to refer to a known algorithm.\n\nLooking up, the standard method is to compute the orientation of the points.\n\nThe orientation can be determined using the cross product.\n\nOrientation of three points p, q, r:\n\nCompute the value (q.x - p.x)*(r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y)*(r.x - p.x).\n\nIf the result is positive, the points are counter-clockwise; if negative, clockwise; if zero, colinear.\n\nUsing this, the function can determine if two line segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n\nSegments AB and CD intersect if:\n\n1. General case:\n\n   a. The orientations of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) are different, and\n\n   b. The orientations of (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) are different.\n\nOR\n\n2. Colinear case:\n\n   a. One of the segments is contained within the other.\n\nIn the colinear case, we need to check if one segment is entirely on the line of the other, and if their projections on x or y axes overlap.\n\nBut for our purposes, since the problem statement says that no three points are colinear, perhaps the segments can't be colinear unless the points are in the same line, but the problem says no three points are on the same line. Wait, the problem statement says that no three points are on the same line. So, any two points can be on a line, but three cannot.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\" So for any two points, their line could contain a third point, but not three in a row.\n\nWait, no. The problem statement says that no three points are on the same line. So, for any two points, their line contains only those two points.\n\nWait, no, because the problem statement says that no three points are on the same line. So, any two points can be on a line, but adding a third would make three on the same line, which is not allowed. So, any line can contain at most two points from all the bases and spaceships.\n\nSo, for any two line segments, the points are either all four distinct, or some overlap, but if any two are the same, the problem statement says that no two points coincide. So, all points are unique.\n\nSo, in our case, when checking two line segments, the four points are all distinct, and the segments can't be colinear because that would require three points on the same line, which is prohibited.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem statement says no three points are on the same line. So, any two points can form a line, but adding a third would make it invalid. So, in our scenario, when we have two line segments, the four points (A, B, C, D) are all distinct, and no three are on the same line.\n\nTherefore, in the case of line segments AB and CD, they can't be colinear, so the general case applies.\n\nSo, the helper function can be written as:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    # Compute orientation\n    def ccw(A, B, C):\n        return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\n    # Check if points are colinear\n    if ccw(a, b, c) == 0 and ccw(a, b, d) == 0:\n        # Check if they are overlapping\n        # Since they are colinear, and no three points are on the same line, they can't be the same line.\n        # So, the segments must overlap.\n        # How?\n        # We can check if a is between c and d, and b is also between c and d, or something similar.\n        # Alternatively, since all points are distinct, we can check if the projections on x or y axis overlap.\n        # For simplicity, let's just compute the bounding boxes and see if they overlap.\n        min_x1 = min(a[0], b[0])\n        max_x1 = max(a[0], b[0])\n        min_x2 = min(c[0], d[0])\n        max_x2 = max(c[0], d[0])\n        if (max_x1 < min_x2) or (max_x2 < min_x1):\n            return False\n        # Similarly for y-axis\n        min_y1 = min(a[1], b[1])\n        max_y1 = max(a[1], b[1])\n        min_y2 = min(c[1], d[1])\n        max_y2 = max(c[1], d[1])\n        if (max_y1 < min_y2) or (max_y2 < min_y1):\n            return False\n        # Now, check if any point of AB is inside CD, or vice versa.\n        # Since all are colinear and distinct, if the segments' projections overlap, they must intersect.\n        # Wait, no, perhaps the segments could be arranged in a way that they don't overlap but project onto each other.\n        # Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to consider that in the general case, since the points are not colinear, the segments must cross if the orientations are different.\n        # Wait, but since the problem statement ensures that no three points are colinear, and all four points are distinct, if the segments are colinear, the only way they can intersect is if they are overlapping on the same line. But in that case, the projections would overlap, but the segments could be ordered differently.\n\n        # Alternatively, since the segments are colinear, to check for intersection, we can see if the intervals on the x or y axis overlap and if the points are in the same order.\n\n        # For example, if a and b are both between c and d, then the segments overlap.\n        # So, another approach: check if a is between c and d, and b is between c and d, but in the same direction.\n\n        # However, this might be time-consuming, but with R up to 10, it's manageable.\n\n        # So, let's check if the projections on x or y axis overlap, and that the order is consistent.\n\n        # Let's compute the x projections.\n        # If the x-projections overlap, and the order of a and b is the same as that of c and d, then the segments intersect.\n\n        # For example, if a.x <= c.x <= b.x <= d.x, then the segments overlap.\n\n        # So, let's get the x-coordinates.\n\n        # Compute the order of a, b, c, d on the x-axis.\n\n        # But perhaps it's easier to compute whether the segments' projections on the x and y axes overlap.\n\n        # So, for x-axis:\n        if (min(a[0], b[0]) > max(c[0], d[0])) or (max(a[0], b[0]) < min(c[0], d[0])):\n            return False\n        # Similarly for y-axis.\n        if (min(a[1], b[1]) > max(c[1], d[1])) or (max(a[1], b[1]) < min(c[1], d[1])):\n            return False\n        # So, in this case, the projections overlap, but since the segments are colinear, they must intersect.\n\n        # Wait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, if one segment is to the left of the other, their projections on x-axis might overlap, but the segments themselves don't intersect.\n\n        # Wait, no, because if two line segments are colinear and their projections on x or y axis overlap, then the segments must intersect.\n\n        # Because if the projections on x overlap, that means that the two segments share a common x interval, implying that the segments cross each other.\n\n        # Wait, no. Suppose two colinear segments that are parallel but on the same line. But in that case, they are the same line, but according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear, so two segments can't be on the same line unless they are the same segment, which is not the case here.\n\n        # So, perhaps in the case where the projections on x overlap, the segments must intersect.\n\n        # Therefore, in this case, the segments do intersect.\n\n        return True\n    else:\n        # General case: segments are not colinear.\n        # Check if the two segments cross each other.\n        # Check if points are on opposite sides of each segment.\n\n        # Compute orientations.\n\n        ccw1 = ccw(a, b, c)\n        ccw2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n        ccw3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n        ccw4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n\n        # If one is positive and the other is negative, then the points are on opposite sides.\n        # So, if (ccw1 and ccw2) have different signs, and (ccw3 and ccw4) have different signs, then the segments cross.\n\n        if ((ccw1 > 0 and ccw2 < 0) or (ccw1 < 0 and ccw2 > 0)) and \\\n           ((ccw3 > 0 and ccw4 < 0) or (ccw3 < 0 and ccw4 > 0)):\n            return True\n\n        # Also, handle the case where one of the segments is completely inside the other.\n        # But since all four points are distinct and no three are colinear, this shouldn't happen.\n\n        return False\n\nWait, but wait. There's a mistake here. The condition for the segments to cross is that the orientations of (a,b,c) and (a,b,d) are different, and orientations of (c,d,a) and (c,d,b) are different. So, the general case.\n\nSo, in the function, if the four points are in a certain order, the segments cross.\n\nSo, the function should return True in that case.\n\nBut in the code above, I have:\n\nif ((ccw1 > 0 and ccw2 < 0) or (ccw1 < 0 and ccw2 > 0)) and \\\n   ((ccw3 > 0 and ccw4 < 0) or (ccw3 < 0 and ccw4 > 0)):\n\nSo, if (ccw1 and ccw2) have opposite signs, meaning c and d are on opposite sides of AB, and similarly for a and b being on opposite sides of CD, then the segments intersect.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the helper function will correctly return True if the segments intersect.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut perhaps I should test this function with some examples.\n\nFor example, let's say we have two segments:\n\nSegment 1: A(0,0) to B(2,0)\n\nSegment 2: C(1,1) to D(3,0)\n\nDo these intersect?\n\nYes, because the line from C to D crosses the line from A to B at (1,0).\n\nSo, let's compute the ccw values.\n\nccw(A,B,C) is (2-0)(1-0) - (0-0)(3-0) = 2*1 - 0*3 = 2 > 0.\n\nccw(A,B,D) is (2-0)(0-0) - (0-0)(3-0) = 0.\n\nWait, no, D is (3,0). So, for ccw(A,B,D):\n\n(B.x - A.x) is 2, (D.y - A.y) is 0.\n\n(B.y - A.y) is 0, (D.x - A.x) is 3.\n\nSo, (2)(0) - (0)(3) = 0.\n\nSo, in the function, since ccw(A,B,C) is positive and ccw(A,B,D) is zero, the function falls into the colinear case.\n\nWait, but in this example, the points are colinear, which is against the problem constraints. So, this example won't occur.\n\nAnother example: two segments that cross.\n\nSegment 1: A(0,0) to B(1,1)\n\nSegment 2: C(1,0) to D(0,1)\n\nThese segments cross at (0.5, 0.5).\n\nCompute ccw(A,B,C): (1-0)(0-0) - (1-0)(1-0) = 0 - 1*1 = -1 < 0.\n\nccw(A,B,D): (1-0)(1-0) - (1-0)(0-0) = 1*1 - 1*0 = 1 > 0.\n\nSo, (ccw1, ccw2) are (-1, 1), which are different signs.\n\nSimilarly, ccw(C,D,A) is computed as (0-1)(0-0) - (1-0)(1-1) = (-1)(0) - (1)(0) = 0.\n\nWait, no. Let's compute C, D, A: points are C(1,0), D(0,1), A(0,0).\n\nccw(C,D,A) is (D.x - C.x) * (A.y - C.y) - (D.y - C.y) * (A.x - C.x).\n\n(D.x - C.x) is -1, (A.y - C.y) is 0.\n\n(D.y - C.y) is 1, (A.x - C.x) is -1.\n\nSo, (-1)*0 - 1*(-1) = 0 +1 = 1.\n\nccw(C,D,B): B is (1,1).\n\nccw(C,D,B) is (0-1)*(1-0) - (1-0)*(1-1).\n\n(-1)*1 - 1*0 = -1 -0 = -1.\n\nSo, ccw3 is 1, ccw4 is -1: different signs.\n\nThus, the function returns True, which is correct.\n\nSo, the helper function seems to correctly return True when the segments cross.\n\nAnother test case: two segments that don't cross.\n\nSegment 1: A(0,0) to B(2,0)\n\nSegment 2: C(0,1) to D(0,2)\n\nThese are parallel and do not cross.\n\nCompute ccw(A,B,C): (2-0)(1-0) - (0-0)(0-0) = 2*1 -0 = 2>0.\n\nccw(A,B,D): (2-0)(2-0) - (0-0)(0-0) = 2*2 =4>0.\n\nccw(C,D,A): (0-0)(0-1) - (2-1)(0-0) = 0 - 1*0 = 0.\n\nWait, no: C is (0,1), D is (0,2), A is (0,0).\n\nccw(C,D,A) is (D.x - C.x)*(A.y - C.y) - (D.y - C.y)*(A.x - C.x).\n\n(D.x - C.x) is 0, (A.y - C.y) is -1.\n\n(D.y - C.y) is 1, (A.x - C.x) is 0.\n\nSo, 0*(-1) -1*0 = 0.\n\nccw(C,D,B): B is (2,0).\n\nccw(C,D,B) is (0-0)(0-1) - (2-1)(2-0) → 0 - 1*2 = -2.\n\nSo, ccw3 is 0, ccw4 is -2.\n\nSo, in the function, since the segments are colinear (because all four points are on the y-axis?), but wait, no: A is (0,0), B is (2,0), C is (0,1), D is (0,2). All are on the y-axis except B, which is on x=2. So, the segments are not colinear.\n\nWait, wait, no: A is (0,0), B is (2,0) → this is a horizontal line.\n\nC is (0,1), D is (0,2) → vertical line.\n\nThese two lines are perpendicular and cross at (0,0), but wait, no. Wait, the first segment is from (0,0) to (2,0). The second is from (0,1) to (0,2). These two segments meet at (0,0), but (0,0) is point A. So, the second segment starts at (0,1), goes to (0,2)—so it doesn't include (0,0). So, the segments don't cross.\n\nSo, the function should return False.\n\nIn the helper function, since the two segments are not colinear, we check the orientations.\n\nccw1 = ccw(A,B,C) = (2)*(1-0) - 0*(0-0) → 2*1 -0 = 2>0.\n\nccw2 = ccw(A,B,D) = 2*2 -0*0 → 4>0.\n\nSo, both are positive. So, the condition (ccw1 and ccw2 have different signs) is not met. Thus, the function returns False.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the helper function seems to work.\n\nNow, back to the main problem.\n\nWe need to generate all possible permutations of the spaceship indices, and for each, check if the corresponding segments don't cross.\n\nBut wait, the permutation is of the spaceship indices, right? Because for each base, we assign a spaceship. So the permutation represents a bijection from base indices to spaceship indices.\n\nSo, for example, if we have R=3 spaceships, a permutation [2,1,0] would mean:\n\nbase 0 → spaceship 2\n\nbase 1 → spaceship 1\n\nbase 2 → spaceship 0\n\nSo, for each permutation, we can generate the list of segments as follows:\n\nsegments = []\nfor i in range(R):\n    base_point = b_list[i]\n    ship_point = s_list[perm[i]]\n    segments.append( (base_point, ship_point) )\n\nThen, for all pairs of segments in 'segments', check if any two intersect.\n\nIf any pair intersects, this permutation is invalid. Else, it's a valid solution.\n\nSo, the code needs to loop through all permutations of the spaceship indices, and for each, generate the list of segments and check for intersections.\n\nBut wait, wait. The 'bases' are fixed as a list, but the permutation is of the spaceship indices. So for each permutation, we're assigning spaceship 0 to base 0, spaceship 1 to base 1, etc.—no, wait, no. Because the permutation is of the spaceship indices, so for each base index i, the spaceship assigned is permutation[i].\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nimport itertools\n\nR, B = map(int, input().split())\ns_list = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(R)]\nb_list = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(B)]\n\nif R != B:\n    print(\"No\")\n    exit()\n\nspaceships = list(range(R))\n\nfound = False\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(spaceships):\n    # Create the list of segments\n    segments = []\n    for i in range(R):\n        base = b_list[i]\n        ship = s_list[perm[i]]\n        segments.append( (base, ship) )\n    # Check all pairs of segments\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(len(segments)):\n        a, b = segments[i]\n        for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):\n            c, d = segments[j]\n            if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n    if valid:\n        found = True\n        break\n\nprint(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nBut wait, the code above is incorrect in one aspect: the 'spaceships' variable is a list of integers from 0 to R-1, but when we take a permutation of them, it's a tuple of these integers. So, for each permutation, it's a way to assign each base to a spaceship.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the order of the bases? Because in the problem statement, the bases are fixed, and the permutation is of the spaceship indices.\n\nWait, no. Because the bases are in a fixed order (the first B lines after R and B). So, base 0 is the first one, base 1 the second, etc.\n\nSo, for each permutation of spaceship indices, base i is assigned to spaceship perm[i], and the segments are from base i to spaceship perm[i].\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nSo, R=3, B=3.\n\nSpaceships are:\n\n(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)\n\nBases are:\n\n(2,1), (1,0), (2,2)\n\nSo, the first permutation that works is [2,0,1], but wait, the sample says it's possible. So, the code should find a permutation where the segments don't cross.\n\nWait, but in the code, the permutation is of the spaceship indices. So, for R=3, the spaceships are 0,1,2. So, a permutation [2,0,1] would assign:\n\nbase 0 → spaceship 2 (3,1)\n\nbase 1 → spaceship 0 (0,0)\n\nbase 2 → spaceship 1 (2,0)\n\nSo, the segments are:\n\nbase 0 (2,1) → (3,1)\n\nbase 1 (1,0) → (0,0)\n\nbase 2 (2,2) → (2,0)\n\nSo, let's compute the segments:\n\nseg0: (2,1) to (3,1)\n\nseg1: (1,0) to (0,0)\n\nseg2: (2,2) to (2,0)\n\nDo any of these segments intersect?\n\nCheck seg0 and seg1: seg0 is a horizontal line at y=1 from (2,1) to (3,1). Seg1 is a line from (1,0) to (0,0), which is a horizontal line at y=0. They are on different y levels, so no intersection.\n\nSeg0 and seg2: seg0 is from (2,1) to (3,1). Seg2 is from (2,2) to (2,0). Seg2 is a vertical line at x=2. Seg0 is to the right of x=2, so no intersection.\n\nSeg1 and seg2: seg1 is from (1,0) to (0,0); it's a horizontal line at y=0. Seg2 is a vertical line at x=2. They don't intersect.\n\nSo, this permutation is valid, and the code should find it.\n\nThus, the sample input's first case would output Yes.\n\nIn the second sample input, R=2, B=3, so R != B, output is No.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, considering the edge cases.\n\nWhat about R=1, B=1. Then, there's only one possible permutation, and the two points are connected. Since no three points are colinear, and R=1, B=1, it's valid.\n\nAnother edge case: R=2, B=2, and the two spaceships and two bases form a cross, leading to two segments that cross each other.\n\nFor example:\n\nSpaceships: (0,0), (1,1)\n\nBases: (1,0), (0,1)\n\nPermutation [1,0]: base 0 → spaceship 1 (1,1); base 1 → spaceship 0 (0,0).\n\nSo, the segments are (1,0)→(1,1) and (0,1)→(0,0). These two segments cross at (0.5, 0.5), so the function should return False.\n\nBut another permutation would be [0,1], which maps base 0 to (0,0), base 1 to (1,1). So, the segments are (1,0)→(0,0) and (0,1)→(1,1). These two segments also cross.\n\nThus, for R=2, B=2, it's impossible to have a non-crossing assignment, so the code should output No.\n\nWait, no. Because for R=2, B=2, the permutation is of the two spaceships. So, for the two possible permutations:\n\nCase 1: [0,1]\n\nSegments:\n\nbase 0 (1,0) → (0,0)\n\nbase 1 (0,1) → (1,1)\n\nThese two lines cross.\n\nCase 2: [1,0]\n\nSegments:\n\nbase 0 (1,0) → (1,1)\n\nbase 1 (0,1) → (0,0)\n\nThese two lines also cross.\n\nThus, in both permutations, the segments cross, so the code would output No.\n\nBut is there any other possibility? No, because R=2, B=2, and only two permutations.\n\nThus, the code correctly returns No.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2, but the two spaceships are on opposite ends of the base line.\n\nFor example:\n\nSpaceships: (0,0), (2,0)\n\nBases: (1,1), (1,2)\n\nSo, for permutation [1,0]:\n\nbase 0 (1,1) → spaceship 1 (2,0): line from (1,1) to (2,0).\n\nbase 1 (1,2) → spaceship 0 (0,0): line from (1,2) to (0,0).\n\nThese two segments cross somewhere.\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\nsegment 1: (1,1) → (2,0). The equation of this line is y = -x + 3.\n\nsegment 2: (1,2) → (0,0). Equation is y = 2x.\n\nThey intersect when -x +3 = 2x → 3 =3x → x=1, y=2.\n\nSo, they cross at (1,2),",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. Additionally, the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship should not intersect in the galaxy plane.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Perfect Matching**: First, we check if the number of Rebel spaceships (R) is equal to the number of bases (B). If R != B, it is impossible to form a perfect matching, so we immediately return \"No\".\n\n2. **Generate Permutations**: Since R and B are guaranteed to be up to 10, we can afford to generate all permutations of spaceship indices. Each permutation represents a potential assignment of spaceships to bases.\n\n3. **Check for Segment Intersection**: For each permutation, we create segments connecting each base to its assigned spaceship. We then check if any two segments intersect using a helper function that determines if two line segments cross each other based on their orientation.\n\n4. **Helper Function for Intersection Check**: The helper function uses the cross product to determine the orientation of three points. If two segments intersect, their orientations will indicate that one segment starts inside the area bounded by the other segment.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    def ccw(A, B, C):\n        return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - A[0])\n    \n    # Check if points are colinear\n    if ccw(a, b, c) == 0 and ccw(a, b, d) == 0:\n        # Check if projections on x or y axis overlap\n        min_x1 = min(a[0], b[0])\n        max_x1 = max(a[0], b[0])\n        min_x2 = min(c[0], d[0])\n        max_x2 = max(c[0], d[0])\n        if max_x1 < min_x2 or max_x2 < min_x1:\n            return False\n        min_y1 = min(a[1], b[1])\n        max_y1 = max(a[1], b[1])\n        min_y2 = min(c[1], d[1])\n        max_y2 = max(c[1], d[1])\n        if max_y1 < min_y2 or max_y2 < min_y1:\n            return False\n        return True\n    else:\n        # General case: check if segments cross each other\n        ccw1 = ccw(a, b, c)\n        ccw2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n        ccw3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n        ccw4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n        if ((ccw1 > 0 and ccw2 < 0) or (ccw1 < 0 and ccw2 > 0)) and \\\n           ((ccw3 > 0 and ccw4 < 0) or (ccw3 < 0 and ccw4 > 0)):\n            return True\n        return False\n\n# Read input\nR_B = input().split()\nR = int(R_B[0])\nB = int(R_B[1])\n\nif R != B:\n    print(\"No\")\n    exit()\n\ns_list = []\nfor _ in range(R):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    s_list.append((x, y))\n\nb_list = []\nfor _ in range(B):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    b_list.append((x, y))\n\nspaceships = list(range(R))\nfound = False\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(spaceships):\n    segments = []\n    for i in range(R):\n        base = b_list[i]\n        ship = s_list[perm[i]]\n        segments.append( (base, ship) )\n    # Check all pairs of segments\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(len(segments)):\n        a, b = segments[i]\n        for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):\n            c, d = segments[j]\n            if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n    if valid:\n        found = True\n        break\n\nprint(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into lists of spaceship and base coordinates.\n- **Permutation Generation**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible ways to assign spaceships to bases.\n- **Segment Intersection Check**: For each permutation, we create segments and check if any two segments intersect using the `segments_intersect` function.\n- **Output Result**: If a valid permutation is found where no segments intersect, we print \"Yes\".
