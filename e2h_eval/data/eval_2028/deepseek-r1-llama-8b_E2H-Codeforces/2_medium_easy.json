Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X'. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe grid is n x n, where n is odd. The conditions for it being an 'X' are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same character.\n2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same character, which is different from the diagonal ones.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to check the two main diagonals. Then, check that all non-diagonal cells have the same character and that this character is different from the diagonal.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is n, followed by n lines each containing n characters. So in Python, I can read n, then read each line, stripping any leading/trailing whitespace, since sometimes when you copy-paste, there might be extra spaces or newlines.\n\nWait, but in the example input provided, the way it's written seems to have each string as a separate line. So perhaps each of the next n lines is a row of the grid. So for example, in the first sample input, the first line after n is 'xooox', which is the first row.\n\nSo I'll store the grid as a 2D list.\n\nOnce the grid is read, I need to check the two diagonals. Let's find out what each cell in the diagonals should be.\n\nThe main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) consists of cells where row index equals column index. The other diagonal is top-right to bottom-left, where row + column equals n-1 (since indices start at 0).\n\nSo, for each cell in these diagonals, we need to collect their values.\n\nThen, check if all the main diagonal cells have the same character, say 'd_char'. Similarly, check if all the other diagonal cells also have 'd_char'.\n\nIf both diagonals are the same, proceed. Otherwise, it's not an X.\n\nOnce the diagonals are confirmed to be the same, we need to check the rest of the grid.\n\nFor all cells that are not on either diagonal, they must be the same character, let's call it 'o_char', which must be different from 'd_char'.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n2. Check the main diagonal: collect all characters, see if they're all the same. Also do the same for the other diagonal.\n3. If both diagonals have the same character, proceed. Else, output NO.\n4. Now, check all the non-diagonal cells. They must all be the same, and different from the diagonal's character.\n5. If all conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation details.\n\nHow to get the main diagonal? For each i from 0 to n-1, grid[i][i] is part of the main diagonal.\n\nThe other diagonal is for j = 0 to n-1, grid[i][n-1 - i], but wait, for each row i, the column is n-1 -i.\n\nWait, no: for the other diagonal, each row i has cell (i, n-1 -i). So yes, for each i, j is n-1 -i.\n\nSo I can loop through each cell and check if it's on either diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, I can collect all the diagonal characters into two separate lists.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is:\n\n- Collect all the main diagonal characters into a set. If the size is more than 1, the diagonals are not uniform. Same for the other diagonal.\n\nWait, no. Because both diagonals must consist of the same character. So the main diagonal's characters must all be the same, and the other diagonal's must also be the same, and equal to the main's.\n\nSo first, check the main diagonal: all elements must be equal. Similarly for the other diagonal.\n\nIf main_diag_char != other_diag_char, then it's invalid.\n\nSo:\n\nmain_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\nif len(set(main_diag)) != 1:\n    return NO\nother_diag = [grid[i][n-1 - i] for i in range(n)]\nif len(set(other_diag)) != 1:\n    return NO\nif main_diag[0] != other_diag[0]:\n    return NO\n\nWait, but maybe the main diagonal and other diagonal can have different characters. So even if both are single characters, but different between each other, then it's invalid.\n\nYes.\n\nOnce that's done, then we need to check all the non-diagonal cells.\n\nThese cells should all be the same character, and different from the diagonal's.\n\nSo, create a variable o_char. Initially, it's None.\n\nLoop through each cell (i,j):\n\nif (i == j) or (i + j == n-1):\n    continue\nelse:\n    current_char = grid[i][j]\n    if o_char is None:\n        o_char = current_char\n    else:\n        if current_char != o_char:\n            # mismatch, return NO\n            return NO\nAlso, after collecting all o_char, it must be different from main_diag_char.\n\nSo, after this loop, check if o_char is None. That would mean that all cells are on the diagonals. But n is at least 3, so for n=3, the center is on both diagonals. Wait, but for n=3, the center is part of both diagonals. So in that case, the number of non-diagonal cells is zero. So if o_char remains None, then the condition is that all non-diagonal cells (which are none) are same. Which is automatically satisfied, but in that case, the non-diagonal is empty, so the code needs to handle that.\n\nWait, let's think about n=3.\n\nIn n=3, the center cell is (1,1), which is on both diagonals. The other cells are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0), (2,2). So the main diagonal has (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). The other diagonal has (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So the non-diagonal cells are (0,2), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0) is on the main diagonal, etc. Wait, no: for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are the four corners, because (0,0) is on main diagonal, (0,2) on other, (2,0) on other, (2,2) on main. So the non-diagonal cells are only the four edges, but wait, no— (0,1) and (1,2) are not on either diagonal. Oh right! So for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). So for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are four cells.\n\nWait, that's correct. So for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are four in number.\n\nSo, in the code, for n=3, when we process each cell, (0,0) is diagonal, (0,2) is other diagonal, (2,0) is other diagonal, (2,2) is diagonal, (1,1) is both. The other cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). So those four cells must be the same, and different from the diagonal.\n\nSo, back to the code: for each cell, if it's on either diagonal, skip. Else, collect its character. If any cell on the non-diagonal has a different character than o_char, or if any cell is something else, then it's invalid.\n\nWait, but what if n is larger, like 5?\n\nIn that case, the non-diagonal cells are all except the two diagonals.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nAfter confirming that both diagonals have the same character, loop through every cell in the grid. For each cell, if it's on either diagonal, skip. Else, check if it matches o_char. If not, return NO. Also, after all, check that o_char is not equal to d_char.\n\nWait, but what if all non-diagonal cells are the same, but equal to d_char? Then that's invalid, because the problem says the non-diagonal must be different.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nCheck main and other diagonals:\n\n- Both must consist of same characters, and those characters must be the same across both.\n\nThen, for all other cells:\n\n- They must be the same, and different from d_char.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead the grid.\n\nCompute main_diag and other_diag.\n\nCheck if both are uniform and same character.\n\nIf not, output NO.\n\nElse, collect all non-diagonal cells.\n\nCheck if all are same, and different from d_char.\n\nIf both conditions hold, output YES, else NO.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    grid.append(list(line))\n\nThen, check the diagonals.\n\nmain_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    main_diag.append(grid[i][i])\nif len(set(main_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nother_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    other_diag.append(grid[i][n-1 - i])\nif len(set(other_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif main_diag[0] != other_diag[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nd_char = main_diag[0]\n\n# Now check non-diagonal cells\no_char = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n            continue\n        current = grid[i][j]\n        if o_char is None:\n            o_char = current\n        else:\n            if current != o_char:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit()\nif o_char is None:\n    # This means all non-diagonal cells are same as diagonal? Or what?\n    # Wait, if o_char is None, then all non-diagonal cells are same as each other, but wait, if all non-diagonal cells are same as each other, but what if they are same as d_char?\n\n    # Wait, in the case where all non-diagonal cells are same as d_char, then it's invalid.\n\n    # Because the condition says the non-diagonal must be different.\n\n    # So, if o_char exists, then check it's different from d_char.\n\n    # But if o_char is None, meaning there are no non-diagonal cells, then what?\n\n    # Like when n=1, but n is >=3.\n\n    # For n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 4 in number.\n\n    # So, for any n>=3, the non-diagonal cells exist.\n\n    # So, o_char will never be None, because for any n>=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nWait, n is at least 3, and n is odd. So for n=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is 4.\n\nWait, let's compute for n=3:\n\nTotal cells:9. Diagonals: 3 (main) +3 (other) but overlapping at (1,1). So total unique diagonal cells: 5. Non-diagonal:4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for n>=3, the non-diagonal cells are present.\n\nSo in the code, o_char will always be assigned a value, because for n>=3, the loop will hit at least one non-diagonal cell.\n\nWait, for n=3, when i=0, j=1: it's non-diagonal.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in the code, o_char will not be None.\n\nSo, after the loop, check if o_char == d_char.\n\nIf yes, then it's invalid.\n\nBecause the non-diagonal must be different.\n\nSo:\n\nif o_char == d_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nElse, print \"YES\".\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nLet me test this logic with some examples.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nLet me think about the grid.\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nMain diagonal: positions (0,0)=x, (1,1)=x, (2,2)=x, (3,3)=x, (4,4)=x. So main_diag is all 'x's.\n\nOther diagonal: (0,4) is 'x', (1,3) is 'x', (2,2) is 'x', (3,1) is 'x', (4,0) is 'x'. So other_diag is all 'x's. So d_char is 'x'.\n\nNow, non-diagonal cells: let's look at (0,1): 'o', (0,2): 'o', (0,3): 'o', (1,0): 'o', (1,2): 'o', etc.\n\nWait, but in the first row, (0,1) is 'o', (0,2) is 'o', (0,3) is 'o'? No, wait the first row is 'xooox'— indexes 0: x, 1:o, 2:o, 3:o, 4:x.\n\nSo non-diagonal cells in row 0: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3). All 'o's.\n\nSimilarly, in row 1: (1,0) is 'o', (1,2) is 'o', (1,3) is 'x'— wait, no, (1,3) is on the other diagonal. So for row 1, non-diagonal cells are (1,0), (1,2), (1,4) — wait, no. Wait, for i=1, j can be 0, 2, 3, 4. Wait, j=3 is other diagonal because i + j = 4, which is n-1 (since n=5, n-1=4). So (1,3) is on the other diagonal.\n\nSo for row 1, non-diagonal cells are (1,0), (1,2), (1,4). Wait, (1,4) is in row 1, column 4. Is that on the other diagonal? Because i + j = 1+4=5, which is equal to n, which is 5, not n-1 (4). So no, (1,4) is not on the other diagonal. Wait, wait, the other diagonal is when i + j = n-1. For n=5, n-1 is 4. So for i=1, j=3: 1+3=4. So (1,3) is on the other diagonal. (1,4) is i=1, j=4: 1+4=5 !=4, so it's not on the other diagonal. So (1,4) is a non-diagonal cell.\n\nWait, so for row 1, j=0: non-diagonal. j=1: main diagonal. j=2: non. j=3: other diagonal. j=4: non.\n\nSo in row 1, non-diagonal cells are j=0,2,4.\n\nLooking at the values:\n\n(1,0) is 'o', (1,2) is 'o', (1,4) is 'o' → all 'o's.\n\nSame for other rows.\n\nSo o_char is 'o', which is different from 'x' → so it's valid.\n\nWait, but the sample output for this case is 'NO'. Hmm, why?\n\nWait, sample input 1's output is 'NO' according to the given sample.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the main_diag and other_diag are not all 'x's.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the first sample:\n\nSample Input 1 is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nSo main diagonal: positions (0,0)=x, (1,1)=x, (2,2)=x, (3,3)=x, (4,4)=x → all x's.\n\nOther diagonal: (0,4)=x, (1,3)=x, (2,2)=x, (3,1)=x, (4,0)=x → all x's.\n\nSo main and other diag are same.\n\nNow, non-diagonal cells: for example, (0,1) is 'o', (0,2) 'o', (0,3) 'o'; (1,0)'o', (1,2)'o', (1,4)'o'; (2,0)'s', (2,1)'o', (2,3)'o', (2,4)'o'; (3,0)'o', (3,2)'o', (3,4)'o'; (4,1)'o', (4,2)'o', (4,3)'o'.\n\nWait, in row 2, column 0 is 's' → which is not 'o'. So this is a problem. So the non-diagonal cells are not all the same.\n\nAh, right! So the code will detect that, because in row 2, column 0, it's 's', which is different from o_char 'o'. So the code will output 'NO', which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code correctly handles that case.\n\nAnother sample: second input is 3, grid wsw, sws, wsw.\n\nWait, the second sample input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,2)=w → all w.\n\nOther diagonal: (0,2)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,0)=w → all w.\n\nSo d_char is 'w'.\n\nNon-diagonal cells: (0,1)=s, (1,0)=s, (1,2)=s, (2,1)=s.\n\nAll are 's', which is different from 'w' → so output is 'YES'.\n\nThird sample:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0)=x, (1,1)=p, (2,2)=e → not all same. So code returns 'NO'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nTest case: n=3, all cells are same as diagonal.\n\nFor example:\n\nrow 0: a b a\n\nrow 1: b a b\n\nrow 2: a b a\n\nHere, main diagonal is a, a, a. Other diagonal is a, a, a. So d_char is 'a'.\n\nNon-diagonal cells: (0,1)=b, (1,0)=b, (1,2)=b, (2,1)=b. So o_char is 'b', which is different from 'a' → valid, output 'YES'.\n\nAnother test case: n=3.\n\nRow 0: a a a\n\nRow 1: a a a\n\nRow 2: a a a\n\nDiagonals are all a. Non-diagonal cells are all a → o_char is a. So o_char == d_char → invalid, output 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, non-diagonal cells have same as each other but same as diagonal.\n\nRow 0: a b a\n\nRow 1: a c a\n\nRow 2: a b a\n\nDiagonals: a, a, a → d_char a.\n\nNon-diagonal cells: (0,1)=b, (1,0)=a, (1,2)=a, (2,1)=b → o_char starts as 'b' then sees 'a' which is different → invalid.\n\nSo code correctly outputs 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\nRows:\n\nx o o o x\n\no x o x o\n\no o x o o\n\no x o x o\n\nx o o o x\n\nDiagonals are x's. Non-diagonal cells are o's except for (2,0) which is 'o' → all same. So output 'YES'.\n\nWait, no: in row 2, column 0 is 'o' which is same as others.\n\nYes, so code will output 'YES'.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, diagonals are 'x', non-diagonal cells are 'x's.\n\nLike:\n\nx x x\n\nx x x\n\nx x x\n\nDiagonals are 'x's. Non-diagonal cells are 'x's. So o_char is 'x', which is same as d_char → invalid, output 'NO'.\n\nSo code correctly outputs 'NO'.\n\nNow, time to write the code.\n\nI think the code is manageable.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nRead n, grid.\n\nCompute main_diag and other_diag.\n\nCheck if both are uniform and same.\n\nIf not, output NO.\n\nElse, check non-diagonal cells.\n\nCollect o_char, if any non-diagonal cell is different → NO.\n\nAlso, if o_char is same as d_char → NO.\n\nElse, output YES.\n\nSo the code in Python:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [list(input().strip()) for _ in range(n)]\n\nCheck main diagonal.\n\nmain_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n\nif len(set(main_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nother_diag = [grid[i][n-1 -i] for i in range(n)]\nif len(set(other_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif main_diag[0] != other_diag[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nd_char = main_diag[0]\n\no_char = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n            continue\n        current = grid[i][j]\n        if o_char is None:\n            o_char = current\n        else:\n            if current != o_char:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit()\n\nif o_char == d_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n\nThis should cover all cases.\n\nTesting with the samples:\n\nSample 1: o_char is 'o' and d_char is 'x' → o_char != d_char. But in the sample, there's a cell (2,0) which is 's', which is different from 'o' → the code detects this and outputs 'NO'.\n\nSample 2: non-diagonal cells are 's's, which is different from 'w' → output 'YES'.\n\nSample 3: main_diag is x, p, e → not uniform → output 'NO'.\n\nSo the code should work.\n",
