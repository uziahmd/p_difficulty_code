Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Vanya and Cards.\" Hmm. Let me read the description carefully.\n\nSo, Vanya has some cards with numbers on them. Each number can be positive, negative, or zero, but their absolute value doesn't exceed x. Natasha hid all his cards, but he found n of them. He wants the sum of all the found cards to be zero. But right now, the sum isn't zero. So, he needs to find some more cards (from the infinite supply of -x to x) to add to the found ones so that the total sum is zero. The goal is to find the minimum number of additional cards required.\n\nThe input gives us n and x, followed by the list of found card numbers. We need to output the minimal number of cards needed.\n\nWait, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I need to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. The target is to make the total sum zero, which means we need the additional cards to contribute a sum of -S. Because adding their sum to S should give zero.\n\nBut each additional card can have a value between -x and x. So, for each additional card, the maximum it can contribute towards reducing the sum is x (if it's negative, say -x), and the minimum is -x (if it's positive, say x). Wait, no: each card can contribute up to x in absolute value. So, for example, if S is 5, and x is 3, then one card can contribute at most -3, leaving 2 still needed. So, maybe two cards, each contributing -1, but wait, since each card can contribute up to x, perhaps using more efficient values.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify. Each new card can have a value in [-x, x]. So, to reach a certain total sum, the minimal number of cards is determined by the absolute value of the required sum divided by x, rounded up.\n\nWait, because each card can contribute up to x towards the target. For example, if the required sum is 10, and x is 3, then 4 cards are needed (each contributes 3: 3*3=9, but 10 is 3+3+3+1, but wait, each card can be 3, so 3*3=9, but 10-9=1. So you'd need another card with 1. So total of 4 cards. Wait, but that's 4 cards, each contributing 3, 3, 3, 1. The sum is 10. Alternatively, maybe 4 is correct.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The required sum is the sum of the found cards (say current_sum). We need to make the total sum zero, so the sum of the additional cards should be (-current_sum). Let me denote the required sum as T = -current_sum.\n\nEach additional card can contribute up to x towards T (if the card is T_i, which is as large as possible). So, the minimal number of cards is ceil(abs(T) / x). Because each card can contribute at most x towards the required sum.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each card can contribute at most x, so the minimal number is the ceiling of |T| divided by x.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. What if T is exactly divisible by x? Then it's exactly |T|/x cards.\n\nYes. So, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the given cards.\n2. Compute T = -sum.\n3. If T is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. Else, compute the minimal number of cards as ceil(|T| / x).\n\nWait, but why?\n\nBecause each card can contribute at most x towards reducing the sum. So, for example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then two cards of 2 each would give 4, which is less than 5. So we need a third card of 1. Wait, but wait, that's 3 cards, each contributing 2, 2, 1. Total is 5. Alternatively, could we do better? No, because 5 divided by 2 is 2.5, so ceiling is 3.\n\nWait, another example: T is 6 and x is 3. Then 6/3=2, so two cards of 3 each.\n\nSo, yes, the minimal number is the ceiling of |T| / x.\n\nBut wait, what if T is negative? Like T is -5. Then |T| is 5, same as before.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate sum of found cards.\n\nCompute T = -sum.\n\nIf T is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute |T|, divide by x, round up.\n\nThat's the minimal number of cards.\n\nWait, but what if T is not possible to reach with that many cards? Because each card can only contribute up to x towards the sum.\n\nNo, because each card can be any value within -x to x. So, for example, if T is 10 and x is 3. Then 10 /3 is 3.333, so 4 cards. How?\n\nWell, 3 cards can contribute 3 each, sum is 9. Then the fourth card contributes 1, making total 10. So yes, that works.\n\nAnother example: T is 7, x is 3. 7/3 is ~2.333, so 3 cards. 3+3+1 =7.\n\nSo, the formula holds.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Sum the given cards.\n- Compute T = -sum.\n- If T is zero, return 0.\n- Else, compute the minimal number as (abs(T) + x -1) // x. Because that's how to compute the ceiling without using floating points.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test this with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nSum is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. So T is -2. So |T|=2. x is 2. 2 /2 is 1. So output is 1.\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nSum is -4. T is 4. x is 3. 4/3 is 1.333, so ceiling is 2. So output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=5. Found card is 3. Sum is 3. T is -3. So |T|=3. x=5. 3/5 is 0.6, so ceiling is 1. So output is 1.\n\nWhat if sum is zero? Then output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x=1. Then T is -5. |T|=5. x=1. 5/1=5. So 5 cards each contributing 1.\n\nWait, but the cards can be any value up to 1. So each can contribute 1, so 5 cards.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nWe need to read the input from stdin. The first line is n and x. The second line is n integers.\n\nCompute sum of those integers. Compute T = -sum.\n\nIf T is zero, print 0.\n\nElse, compute minimal cards as (abs(T) + x -1) // x.\n\nPrint that number.\n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? That's when the sum of found cards is zero. So no need for any additional cards.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, now, writing the Python code.\n\nWe can read the input as follows:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_cards = sum(cards)\n\nt = -sum_cards\n\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    min_cards = (abs(t) + x -1) // x\n    print(min_cards)\n\nWait, but the problem says that the initial set of cards is such that each number is between -x and x. So the found cards are already valid, but for the additional cards, we can choose any in that range.\n\nYes, that's handled.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, x=2\n\ncards = [-1, 1, 2]\n\nsum is 2. t=-2. abs(t)=2. 2+2-1=3//2=1.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, x=3\n\ncards = [-2,-2], sum is -4. t=4. 4+3-1=6//3=2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput:\n1 5\n5\n\nSum is 5. t=-5. abs(t) is 5. x=5. 5/5=1. So output 1.\n\nAnother case where t is 0:\n\ncards sum to 0. So output 0.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and additional) equals zero. Each card has a value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: First, compute the sum of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: The target sum for the additional cards is the negative of the sum of the found cards. This is because we need the total sum of all cards to be zero.\n3. **Compute Minimum Number of Additional Cards**: The minimum number of additional cards required is determined by how much the target sum can be covered using each card's maximum possible contribution (which is x). This is calculated as the ceiling of the absolute value of the target sum divided by x.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_cards = sum(cards)\nt = -sum_cards\n\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    min_cards = (abs(t) + x - 1) // x\n    print(min_cards)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value on any card), followed by `n` integers representing the values on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the found cards.\n3. **Target Sum**: Calculate the target sum needed to balance the total sum to zero, which is the negative of the found sum.\n4. **Determine Minimum Cards**: Use integer arithmetic to compute the ceiling of the division of the absolute target sum by `x`, which gives the minimum number of additional cards needed. This avoids floating-point operations and ensures efficiency.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures that the solution is optimal and runs in constant time.",
