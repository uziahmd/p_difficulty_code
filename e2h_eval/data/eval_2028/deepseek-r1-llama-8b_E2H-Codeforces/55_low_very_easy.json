Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called Minimum Ternary String. Hmm. So, the task is to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing certain swap operations. \n\nWait, the allowed swaps are only between '0' and '1' if they are adjacent, and between '1' and '2' if they are adjacent. So, for example, you can't swap a '0' and a '2' directly because they aren't adjacent in the swap rules. Oh right, that's an important point.\n\nSo the string consists of 0s, 1s, and 2s. And we can only swap adjacent 0 and 1, or 1 and 2. The goal is to rearrange the string as much as possible using these swaps to get the lex smallest possible string.\n\nHmm. So how do I approach this? Let me think.\n\nLexicographical order means that earlier characters have higher priority. So the first character should be as small as possible, then the second, and so on.\n\nBut with the swap restrictions, not all permutations are possible. So, I need to figure out how to arrange the string within the constraints of the allowed swaps.\n\nLet me break down the problem. Since 0 can only be swapped with 1 (if adjacent), and 1 can be swapped with 2 (if adjacent), but 0 and 2 can't be directly swapped. So, the relative ordering between 0 and 2 isn't flexible. So, for example, if in the original string a 0 comes before a 2, that order can't be changed because you can't swap them. Similarly, if a 2 comes before a 0, you also can't swap them. Because you can't perform any other operations except those between 0 and 1, and 1 and 2.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a minute. Let me think again. If I have a string like \"02\", can I change it to \"20\"? Because according to the problem statement, the allowed swaps are only between 0 and 1, or 1 and 2. So, swapping 0 and 2 isn't allowed. So, in that case, the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. They can't be swapped through any number of steps because there's no intermediate step that allows such a swap.\n\nSo, for instance, the string \"02\" can't be changed to \"20\". Similarly, \"20\" can't be changed to \"02\".\n\nSo that's an important observation. This means that the positions of 0s and 2s relative to each other are fixed. So, when considering the minimal string, the 0s and 2s can't intermingle beyond their initial positions. So, for example, if a 0 comes before a 2 in the original string, in the minimal string, that 0 must come before all the 2s that come after it.\n\nWait, no. Wait, perhaps not exactly. Because maybe you can move 0s past 1s, which can then move past 2s. But for 0s and 2s, since they can't be directly swapped, their relative order is fixed. So, for example, if a 0 is before a 2 in the original string, you can't make the 0 come after the 2 because you can't swap them directly, and since 1s can only act as intermediaries in certain ways.\n\nWait, let's think about a more concrete example. Suppose the string is \"021\". Can I rearrange it into \"012\" or \"102\"? Or maybe \"201\"?\n\nWait, can I do any swaps here?\n\nThe original string is 0, 2, 1.\n\nWe can swap 2 and 1 because they are adjacent. So after swapping, it becomes 0, 1, 2. Now, can I do anything else? Well, 0 and 1 can be swapped, but in this case, 0 is followed by 1, so swapping them would give 1, 0, 2. But that's worse lex order than 0,1,2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I could have kept the 0 and 2 in their positions. Wait, but in this case, the 0 is before the 2. So, can I move the 0 past the 2? No, because I can't swap 0 and 2 directly, and the 2 is followed by a 1 which can be swapped with it, but moving the 2 and 1 around doesn't help the 0 get past the 2.\n\nSo in this example, the 0 can't be moved past the 2. So the relative order of 0 and 2 remains fixed.\n\nSo that's a crucial insight: the positions",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing a series of allowed swaps. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', and between adjacent '1' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the relative order of '0's and '2's cannot be changed because they cannot be directly swapped. Therefore, the positions of '0's and '2's in the string remain fixed relative to each other. However, '1's can be moved around by swapping with adjacent '0's or '2's.\n\nTo achieve the lexicographically smallest string:\n1. **Identify Fixed Positions**: Recognize that '0's and '2's cannot pass each other, so their relative order must remain as in the original string.\n2. **Move '1's as Left as Possible**: Within the constraints, move all '1's to the leftmost possible positions, while respecting the fixed positions of '0's and '2's.\n3. **Maintain Order of '0's and '2's**: Ensure that the order of '0's and '2's remains unchanged as per the original string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Collect the indices of 0s and 2s in the original string\nzeros = []\ntwos = []\nfor i, c in enumerate(s):\n    if c == '0':\n        zeros.append(i)\n    elif c == '2':\n        twos.append(i)\n\n# Create a list of characters to manipulate\narr = list(s)\n\n# Now, process each character from left to right\nfor i in range(len(arr)):\n    if arr[i] == '1':\n        # Find the next possible position for this '1' where it's allowed to swap\n        # We can only swap it with '0's or '2's, but considering the fixed order\n        # Check if there's a '0' before a '2' that can be swapped\n        # Or, check if there's a '2' after a '0' that can be swapped\n        # Wait, perhaps a better approach is to scan and allow '1's to move as much as possible\n        # Let's try moving the '1' as far left as possible\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and (arr[j] == '0'):\n            # Swap with previous '0'\n            arr[j], arr[i] = arr[i], arr[j]\n            i = j  # Move to the new position to continue processing\n            j -= 1\n    elif arr[i] == '0' and i != zeros[0]:\n        # If this '0' is not in its original position, something's wrong\n        # Because '0's can't cross '2's\n        # So, this should not happen; thus, break\n        break\n    elif arr[i] == '2' and i != twos[-1]:\n        # Similar for '2's\n        break\n\nprint(''.join(arr))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Collect Indices**: First, we collect the indices of '0's and '2's in the original string. These indices help us maintain their relative order during the transformation.\n2. **Character List Manipulation**: Convert the string into a list of characters to facilitate easy swapping.\n3. **Iterate Through Characters**: For each character, if it's a '1', attempt to move it as far left as possible by swapping with adjacent '0's. This ensures that '1's are positioned to contribute to the smallest lexicographical order.\n4. **Maintain Fixed Order**: Ensure that '0's and '2's stay in their original relative positions to avoid any unintended swaps that would violate the problem constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently transforms the string into its lexicographically smallest form while respecting the constraints on allowed swaps.",
