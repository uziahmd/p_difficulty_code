A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Soft Drinking,\" and from the description, I need to calculate how many toasts each friend can make given certain resources.\n\nHmm. Let me try to break down the problem step by step.\n\nThe input consists of several integers. Let's list them out:\n\nn: number of friends.\nk: number of bottles bought.\nl: milliliters per bottle.\nc: number of limes.\nd: slices per lime.\np: grams of salt.\nnl: milliliters needed per toast per friend.\nnp: grams of salt needed per toast per friend.\n\nEach toast requires each friend to have nl ml of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. So for each toast, all n friends must have their requirements met.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the total resources available and then determine how many toasts are possible based on each resource, then take the minimum.\n\nLet me think about each resource separately.\n\n1. Drink:\nEach bottle has l ml. So total drink is k * l. Each toast requires n * nl (because each of the n friends takes nl). So the maximum toasts possible from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\nWait, but wait—what if n * nl exceeds the total? Then that would be zero. So yeah, integer division makes sense here.\n\n2. Lime Slices:\nThey cut c limes into d slices each. So total slices are c * d. Each toast needs n slices (one per friend). So maximum toasts from lime is (c*d) // n.\n\n3. Salt:\nTotal salt is p grams. Each toast needs n * np grams. So maximum toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nSo the overall maximum number of toasts is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the example given:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nCompute each:\n\nDrink: 4*5=20. Each toast needs 3*3=9. 20//9 is 2 (since 2*9=18 <=20, 3*9=27>20). So drink allows 2 toasts.\n\nLime: 10*8=80 slices. Each toast needs 3. 80//3 is 26. So 26 toasts allowed.\n\nSalt: 100 grams. Each toast needs 3*1=3. 100//3 is 33. So 33.\n\nThen the minimal among 2,26,33 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the approach is clear.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read the input line as a list of integers. So in Python, something like:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute each resource's limit:\n\ntoast_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\ntoast_lime = (c * d) // n\ntoast_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three.\n\nBut wait, what if any of these computations result in zero? Like if there's not enough for even one toast? Then the minimum will correctly pick zero.\n\nSo the plan is solid.\n\nNow, code-wise, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, let's test against the sample inputs.\n\nAnother sample input from the user is '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10: total drink is 1000.\n\nEach toast needs 5 *4=20. 1000 /20=50.\n\nLime: c=1, d=19 → 19 slices. Each toast needs 5 slices. 19//5=3.\n\nSalt: p=90, each toast needs 5*3=15. 90//15=6.\n\nMinimum is 3. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\nn=10.\n\nDrink: 1000 *1000 = 1,000,000. Each toast needs 10*50=500. 1e6 /500 = 2000.\n\nLime: 25 *23=575 slices. Each toast 10: 575//10=57.\n\nSalt: 1 gram. Each toast needs 10*1=10. 0. So min is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo code should handle these correctly.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\nCase where any of the resources are zero.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, lime slices, and salt per friend. The solution involves calculating the maximum number of toasts possible based on each resource and then taking the minimum of these values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: First, compute the total amount of each resource available.\n2. **Determine Resource Limits**: For each resource (drink, lime slices, and salt), calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total available quantity.\n3. **Compute Toast Limits**: For each resource, compute the maximum number of toasts possible by dividing the total available quantity by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n4. **Find Minimum Toasts**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is determined by the minimum value from the computed toast limits for each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Calculate total resources\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\ntotal_salt = p\n\n# Compute how much each resource allows in terms of toasts\ntoasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntoasts_lime = total_lime_slices // n\ntoasts_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\n# The answer is the minimum of these values\nmax_toasts = min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, toasts_salt)\n\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into respective variables.\n2. **Total Resources Calculation**: \n   - `total_drink` is the product of the number of bottles and milliliters per bottle.\n   - `total_lime_slices` is the product of the number of limes and slices per lime.\n   - `total_salt` is simply the given grams of salt.\n3. **Toast Limits Calculation**:\n   - `toasts_drink` is the total drink divided by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n   - `toasts_lime` is the total lime slices divided by the number of friends.\n   - `toasts_salt` is the total salt divided by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n4. **Determine Maximum Toasts**: The minimum value among `toasts_drink`, `toasts_lime`, and `toasts_salt` gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently use all resources to determine the maximum number of toasts possible while ensuring all friends can toast the same number of times.",
