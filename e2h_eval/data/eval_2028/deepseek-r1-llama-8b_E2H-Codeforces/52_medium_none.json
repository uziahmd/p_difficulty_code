Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Vasily has some candles and can create new ones from the stubs. The goal is to find out how many hours he can keep the room lit. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nHmm, let's see. The initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for exactly one hour before it goes out. So the first thing that happens is, all 'a' candles burn, adding 'a' hours, and leaving 'a' stubs.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, the problem says he can make 'b' stubs into a new candle. So after burning 'a' candles, he has 'a' stubs. How many new candles can he make from them? It's a // b, right? Because each new candle requires 'b' stubs.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says \"he can make b went out candles into a new candle.\" Oh right, so each new candle takes 'b' stubs. So for example, if he has 4 stubs and b is 2, he can make 2 new candles.\n\nSo the process is: while the number of stubs is >= b, he can make more candles. Each time, the new candles are added, and when they burn, they produce more stubs which can be used again.\n\nSo the steps would be something like:\n\n1. Total hours = a (since all initial candles burn)\n2. Stubs = a\n3. While stubs >= b:\n   a. Make new_candles = stubs // b\n   b. Add new_candles to total_hours\n   c. stubs = (stubs % b) + new_candles * 1 (because each new candle burns for an hour and becomes a stub)\n   \nWait, yes. Because each new candle, when burned, adds one stub. So after making new_candles, he burns them, contributing new_candles to the total hours, and also adding new_candles stubs.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\ntotal = a\ncurrent_stubs = a\n\nwhile current_stubs >= b:\n    new = current_stubs // b\n    total += new\n    current_stubs = (current_stubs % b) + new  # because the new candles are now stubs after burning\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 4 2\n\nInitial total =4, stubs=4.\n\nLoop:\n4 >=2 → new=2. total becomes 6. stubs =0 +2=2.\n\nNow 2>=2 → new=1. total 7. stubs=0+1=1.\n\nNow 1 <2, loop ends. So output is 7. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:6 3.\n\nTotal starts at6, stubs=6.\n\nLoop:6//3=2 → total 8. stubs=0 +2=2.\n\nNow 2 <3. So output is 8. Which matches the second sample.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: a=1, b=2. He burns 1 hour, stubs=1. Can't make any more. So total is1.\n\nCase 2: a=5, b=5. Initial total 5. stubs=5. Then 5//5=1, total 6. stubs=0+1=1. No more. So total is6.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=3.\n\nStubs start at10.\n\nFirst iteration: 10//3=3 → total=13, stubs=1 (10%3=1) +3=4.\n\nNext:4//3=1 → total14, stubs=1+1=2.\n\nNo more. So total is14.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is to implement this loop.\n\nNow, in Python, how to read the input? The input is a single line with two integers, a and b.\n\nSo read the input line, split into a and b as integers.\n\nCompute the total as per the steps above.\n\nThen print the total as a string.\n\nSo code outline:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nThat should do it.\n\nTesting this with the samples:\n\nSample 1:4 2 →7.\n\nYes.\n\nSample 2:6 3→8.\n\nYes.\n\nEdge cases seem to work.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has. Each candle burns for exactly one hour before going out, and Vasily can create new candles from the stubs of burned-out ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a`, which will burn for `a` hours.\n2. **Stub Collection**: After burning all initial candles, collect the stubs. Each burned candle leaves a stub.\n3. **Recycling Stubs**: Use the collected stubs to create new candles. Each new candle requires `b` stubs. For every new candle created, it will add an additional hour to the total burn time and leave another stub when burned.\n4. **Iterative Process**: Continue creating new candles from the stubs until there are not enough stubs left to make another candle. Each iteration updates the total burn time and the number of remaining stubs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial number of candles) and `b` (number of stubs needed to create a new candle).\n2. **Initial Burn**: All initial candles burn, contributing `a` hours to the total.\n3. **Stub Recycling Loop**: While there are enough stubs to create at least one new candle:\n   - Calculate the number of new candles that can be made from the current stubs.\n   - Add the number of new candles to the total burn time.\n   - Update the stub count to reflect the remainder of stubs after making new candles plus the new stubs from the newly burned candles.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total number of hours the room can be illuminated.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the stubs in a loop, ensuring all possible hours from recycled candles are accounted for, and handles edge cases where stubs are insufficient to create new candles.",
