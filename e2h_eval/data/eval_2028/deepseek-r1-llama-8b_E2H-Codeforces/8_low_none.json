Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Flawed Flow,\" and the task is to determine the direction of each edge in a graph such that certain conditions are met. Hmm.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again carefully. We have an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges. Each edge has a flow volume. We need to assign a direction to each edge so that:\n\n1. For every vertex v (not the source or sink), the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows.\n2. The source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges.\n3. The resulting directed graph has no cycles.\n\nOh right, because the original graph is connected, a solution exists.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Well, I remember that in max-flow problems, especially for bipartite graphs, there's something called a BFS-based approach to find augmenting paths. But wait, this is a general graph, not necessarily bipartite.\n\nWait, but the way the directions are assigned must form a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), because there can't be any cycles. So the directed graph is a DAG, which implies that the flow can only go from the source to the sink through a path without any cycles.\n\nHmm, maybe I can model this as building a flow network where each edge's direction is determined based on some criteria, perhaps related to the residual capacities.\n\nAnother thought: the given graph is undirected, but once we assign directions, the flow must satisfy certain balance conditions. So for each vertex (except the source and sink), the sum of outgoing edges equals the sum of incoming edges. This is similar to the conservation of flow in a network.\n\nWait, that's exactly like the condition for a flow network to be in a state where all intermediate nodes are balanced. So perhaps, the direction assignment should create a flow where each node (except source and sink) is balanced.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nI recall that in the context of max-flow algorithms, especially for finding the maximum flow, the residual graph is built, and then BFS is used to find augmenting paths. Maybe I can model this as a problem where each edge's direction is determined by whether it's part of the residual graph or not.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem requires the directed graph to have no cycles, it must be a DAG. And since the source has no incoming edges, the entire graph is a DAG with the source as the root.\n\nWait, maybe the solution is to construct a directed acyclic graph where each edge is oriented in such a way that the flow respects the balance conditions. \n\nLet me think about the structure of the graph. Since the source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges, all edges leaving the source must point away from it. Then, for each other node, the sum of outgoing and incoming must be equal. So for each node v (not 1 or n), the total flow into v equals the total flow out of v.\n\nBut how does this translate to individual edges' directions?\n\nPerhaps the way to do this is to perform a BFS starting from the source, and assign directions accordingly. Wait, but BFS would give a topological order, right? Because the graph must be a DAG, so a topological sort exists.\n\nYes, that's it! If I can compute a topological order of the graph, then I can direct the edges in a way that ensures the flow goes from earlier nodes to later nodes in the topological order. But wait, the edges are undirected, so I have to choose their direction in a way that the overall flow satisfies the balance conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a problem where each edge (u, v) is directed either u->v or v->u. The direction choice must ensure that for every node except the source and sink, the sum of incoming and outgoing edges are equal.\n\nHmm, another approach: let's consider the given graph as a flow network and compute the maximum flow. Then, for each edge, determine whether it's saturated or not, and based on that decide the direction.\n\nWait, but the problem is not just about the maximum flow. It's about assigning directions such that the flow is maximized and the conditions are satisfied.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model this as a problem of finding a flow that satisfies certain constraints, and then determine the direction based on that flow.\n\nLet me think differently. For each edge (u, v) with capacity c, we need to decide whether it's u→v or v→u. Once that's decided, the sum of flows on edges leaving u must equal the sum of flows on edges entering u, except for the source and sink.\n\nSo, for each node except source and sink, the in-degree multiplied by the capacities must equal the out-degree multiplied by their capacities in some way.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be approached by considering the flow conservation at each node. For each node",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the direction of each edge in an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies specific flow conditions. The goal is to ensure that the flow from the source to the sink is maximized while maintaining balance at each intermediate node.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph using adjacency lists where each edge is stored with its flow capacity.\n2. **Topological Sorting**: Use a BFS-based approach to perform a topological sort starting from the source (vertex 1). This ensures that we process nodes in an order where all dependencies (edges) are respected.\n3. **Direction Assignment**: For each edge, determine its direction based on the topological order. If traversing an edge leads from an earlier node to a later node in the topological order, direct it accordingly. This ensures that the flow respects the balance conditions and avoids cycles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        ai, bi, ci = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges.append((ai, bi, ci))\n    \n    # Assign unique indices to nodes starting from 0\n    node_map = {1: 0, 2: 1}\n    for i in range(3, n+1):\n        node_map[i] = len(node_map)\n    \n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n    reverse_adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n    for u, v, c in edges:\n        if u not in node_map or v not in node_map:\n            continue  # skip if u or v is 1, which are already mapped\n        u_idx = node_map[u]\n        v_idx = node_map[v]\n        adj[u_idx].append((v_idx, c))\n        reverse_adj[v_idx].append((u_idx, c))\n    \n    visited = [False] * n\n    result = [0] * m\n    directions = [0] * m\n    \n    q = deque()\n    q.append(0)\n    visited[0] = True\n    topo_order = []\n    \n    while q:\n        u = q.popleft()\n        topo_order.append(u)\n        for v, c in adj[u]:\n            if not visited[v]:\n                visited[v] = True\n                q.append(v)\n    \n    # Now assign directions\n    for i in range(m):\n        ai, bi, ci = edges[i]\n        if ai == 1 or bi == 1:\n            if ai == 1:\n                directions[i] = 0  # must be outgoing from source\n            else:\n                directions[i] = 1  # must be incoming to source\n            continue\n        \n        u, v = ai, bi\n        if u in node_map and v in node_map:\n            u_idx = node_map[u]\n            v_idx = node_map[v]\n            if u_idx < v_idx:\n                directions[i] = 0\n            else:\n                directions[i] = 1\n        else:\n            pass\n    \n    print('\\n'.join(map(str, directions)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Construction**: The input is read and converted into a graph representation using adjacency lists.
