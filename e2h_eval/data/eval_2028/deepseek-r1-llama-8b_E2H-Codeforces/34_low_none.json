And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Average Sleep Time.\" Hmm.\n\nThe task says that Polycarp has been keeping track of his sleep times for n days. But a week in Berland is k days long. So the idea is to consider all possible consecutive k-day windows in these n days and calculate the average sleep time over all those weeks.\n\nWait, right. So for each window of k days, we sum up the sleep hours and then find the average across all such windows. Oh, but wait—no, because the problem says to compute the average per week, which is the sum of each week's sleep divided by the number of weeks. So, for example, if there are m = n - k + 1 weeks, each contributing a certain amount of total sleep, the average is the total sum divided by m.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and k.\n2. Read the array of sleep times.\n3. Compute the sum for each sliding window of size k.\n4. Sum all those k-length window sums.\n5. Divide by the number of windows (m) to get the average.\n6. Output the result with at least six decimal places, ensuring precision.\n\nBut wait, how do I efficiently compute the sum of each window? Because if n is up to 2e5, a naive approach of adding elements each time would be O(nk), which would be too slow for 2e5 * 2e5 operations—like 4e10, which is way beyond acceptable limits.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way. Oh right, the sliding window technique can be used here. We can use a prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of any window.\n\nLet me think: the prefix sum array allows us to get the sum from i to j in O(1) time. So for a window starting at index s (0-based) and ending at s+k-1, the sum is prefix_sum[s + k] - prefix_sum[s].\n\nYes, that makes sense. So first, we'll compute the prefix sum array. Then iterate through each possible starting position, compute the sum for the current window, add it to a running total, and finally divide by the number of windows to get the average.\n\nLet's outline the steps more concretely:\n\n- Compute the prefix sum array:\n   - prefix[0] = 0\n   - prefix[i] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i-1]\n   So for window starting at s, ending at e = s + k -1, the sum is prefix[e+1] - prefix[s].\n- Initialize total_sum to 0.\n- For s from 0 to n - k:\n   - e = s + k - 1\n   - sum_window = prefix[e+1] - prefix[s]\n   - total_sum += sum_window\n- average = total_sum / m, where m = n -k +1.\n- Output average with sufficient precision.\n\nWait, but when implementing this in Python, I need to handle the indices correctly. Also, since the input could be large (up to 2e5 elements), using a list for the prefix sum is manageable because it's O(n) space, which is acceptable.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the data types. Since the numbers can be up to 1e5, and n is up to 2e5, the maximum possible sum is 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10. When multiplied by m, which can be up to 2e5, the total sum could be up to 4e15, which fits into a 64-bit integer, but Python handles big integers well, so no issues there.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation steps:\n\n1. Read n and k from the first line. Wait, but looking at the sample inputs, sometimes the second line is a single string. Oh, but in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So in code, perhaps read the entire input as a string, split into lines.\n\nAlternatively, in Python, I can read the first line as n and k, and the second line as the list of a's.\n\nWait, for example, the first sample input is:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nWhich is two lines. So code-wise:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBut need to make sure that the second line has exactly n elements.\n\nOnce a is read, compute the prefix sum.\n\nCompute prefix as follows:\n\nprefix = [0]\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    prefix.append(prefix[-1] + num)\n\nThen, for each window starting at s (from 0 to n -k), compute the sum.\n\nWait, but in the loop, s can go up to n -k",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of size k days from a given sequence of sleep times. The goal is to efficiently calculate this average using a sliding window technique to handle large input sizes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: Read the number of days `n` and the week size `k`, followed by the sleep times for each day.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of any subarray. This allows us to efficiently calculate the sum of each k-day window in constant time.\n3. **Sliding Window Technique**: Iterate through each possible starting position of the window and use the prefix sum array to compute the sum of the current window. Accumulate these sums to get the total sleep time across all windows.\n4. **Compute Average**: Divide the total sleep time by the number of windows to find the average sleep time per week.\n5. **Output**: Print the result with a precision of at least six decimal places.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    k = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr + n]))\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums\n    prefix = [0]\n    for num in a:\n        prefix.append(prefix[-1] + num)\n    \n    m = n - k + 1\n    total = 0\n    for s in range(m):\n        e = s + k\n        total += prefix[e] - prefix[s]\n    \n    average = total / m\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Prefix Sum Array**: The prefix sum array helps in calculating the sum of any subarray in constant time. For an array `a`, `prefix[i]` contains the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`.\n- **Sliding Window Sum Calculation**: By iterating through each possible starting index of the window, we use the prefix sum array to compute the sum of the current window in constant time, avoiding the need for nested loops which would be too slow for large inputs.\n- **Efficiency**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 200,000 days. This ensures that the solution is efficient and handles edge cases effectively.",
