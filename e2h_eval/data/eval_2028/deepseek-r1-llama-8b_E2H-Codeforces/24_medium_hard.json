She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a browser with several tabs open, and Luba needs to close all the tabs except those in a specific range [l, r]. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds she needs to spend doing this.\n\nHmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully. So, she starts with n tabs open, from 1 to n. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She can perform certain actions each second: either move the cursor left or right, but not beyond the currently available tabs (since some might be closed), or she can close all the tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nWait, so when she moves the cursor, it's constrained by the current a and b, which are the minimum and maximum indices of unclosed tabs. Initially, a is 1 and b is n. But as she closes tabs, a and b change. For example, if she closes some tabs on the left, a increases, and similarly for the right.\n\nThe key is to model the steps she takes optimally to minimize the time. So, what do we need to compute?\n\nFirst, let's think about the initial setup. We have to decide whether she needs to close tabs on the left, on the right, or both.\n\nLet me break down the process into steps:\n\n1. Determine which tabs need to be closed. That is, any tab less than l or greater than r must be closed.\n2. Decide the order in which she should close these tabs.\n3. Calculate the minimal steps required for each possible scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal approach is to first move the cursor to a position where she can close all the necessary tabs on one side, then move to another position to close the other side. Or maybe she can do both closures in a way that minimizes the total steps.\n\nSo, let's outline the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: No tabs need to be closed. This is when l=1 and r=n, meaning all tabs are already in the desired range. Then, the answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: Only left tabs need to be closed. So, she needs to close all tabs before l.\n\nCase 3: Only right tabs need to be closed. She needs to close all after r.\n\nCase 4: Both left and right tabs need to be closed.\n\nEach of these cases will require a different approach.\n\nBut wait, how do we determine if left or right tabs need to be closed? It depends on whether l > 1 or r < n.\n\nSo, for example, if l > 1, then we need to close some tabs on the left. Similarly, if r < n, we need to close some on the right.\n\nNow, let's model each case.\n\nStarting with the initial position pos.\n\nIf both left and right need to be closed, then she has to perform two closing operations. Between them, she may need to move the cursor to the correct positions.\n\nWait, but the movement steps can vary. So the minimal steps would involve moving as efficiently as possible between the points where she can close the left and right tabs.\n\nLet me think about each possible scenario.\n\nFirst, let's compute whether left or right needs to be closed.\n\nleft_needed = (l > 1)\nright_needed = (r < n)\n\nIf neither is needed, output 0.\n\nElse, for each possible combination:\n\n- left_needed and right_needed.\n\nWe need to find the minimal steps to close both.\n\nSo, how do we calculate the steps for each part?\n\nFor the left closure:\n\nShe needs to get to a position where she can close all tabs to the left. The optimal position for this is l. Because once she's at l, closing left will close all tabs before l. So the steps to reach l from pos, considering the current a and b.\n\nWait, but wait: initially, a is 1, but as she closes tabs, a changes. So when she moves towards l, but hasn't closed any tabs yet, her movement is limited by the current a and b.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the a and b change only when she performs a close operation. So before any closing, a is 1, b is n.\n\nSo, for the left closure, she can move the cursor to l, then close left. The movement steps from pos to l, then +1 step to close.\n\nSimilarly, for the right closure, she can move to r, then close right. Steps: movement to r, then +1 step to close.\n\nBut wait, sometimes she can do better. For example, maybe she can close the left first, then move to the right position and close.\n\nSo, the total steps would be steps_to_move_to_left_close_pos + 1 (for closing left) + steps_to_move_from_left_close_pos_to_right_close_pos + 1 (for closing right).\n\nAlternatively, she could go to the right first, close, then move to the left and close.\n\nWhich approach is better? It depends on the distance between the two closure points and the starting position.\n\nSo, perhaps we need to consider all possible orders and choose the minimal.\n\nBut considering all possibilities might complicate things. Let's model each scenario.\n\nAnother thing to note is that when she closes the left, she can't have any tabs left of l anymore. So, after that, a becomes l. Similarly, closing the right makes b become r.\n\nSo, during movement, after each close operation, the available tabs change.\n\nWait, but when she's moving, the available tabs are determined by a and b, which are updated only when she closes.\n\nSo, for example, suppose she is at position 3, and wants to go to position 5. If she hasn't closed anything yet, a is 1, b is n. So she can move freely.\n\nBut if she has already closed some tabs, a and b are smaller.\n\nSo, when she moves, the movement is constrained by the current a and b. So, the path she takes must be within the current a and b.\n\nThis complicates things because the available tabs change as she performs actions.\n\nHmm, that adds a layer of complexity. So, the order in which she does the movements and closures affects the a and b, which in turn affect the possible movements.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to model this as a state space, where each state consists of the current position and a and b, along with the tabs that have been closed. But since n is small (up to 100), maybe a BFS approach is feasible.\n\nBut given that the problem requires code submission, perhaps a BFS-based solution is manageable.\n\nWait, but let's think about the possible states.\n\nEach state can be represented by:\n\n- current position (i)\n- a: the minimum index of open tabs\n- b: the maximum index of open tabs\n\nThe initial state is (pos, 1, n). The goal is to reach a state where all tabs outside [l, r] are closed, i.e., a = l and b = r.\n\nWait, no. Because after closing, the a and b may change. So, after closing the left, a becomes l, and the new b remains the same unless she also closes the right.\n\nWait, no. When she closes the left, all tabs before current position are closed. So, for example, if she is at position l, closing left would close all tabs less than l. So, a becomes l.\n\nSimilarly, closing the right would close all tabs after current position, so b becomes i.\n\nSo, after closing left, a becomes the current position's index. After closing right, b becomes the current position's index.\n\nSo, the state transitions are as follows:\n\nFrom state (i, a, b):\n\n- Move left: new_i = max(a, i-1). Steps increase by 1.\n- Move right: new_i = min(b, i+1). Steps increase by 1.\n- Close left: new_a = i; new_b = b. Steps increase by 1. This is allowed only if i <= b (since you can't close left beyond the current available).\n- Close right: new_b = i; new_a = a. Steps increase by 1. This is allowed only if i >= a.\n\nEach of these transitions represents a possible action, and we need to find the minimal steps to reach a state where a = l and b = r.\n\nYes, this seems manageable.\n\nSo, the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node is a state (i, a, b), and edges represent the possible actions (moving or closing). The goal is to find the shortest path from the initial state (pos, 1, n) to the state (any i, a=l, b=r).\n\nWait, but when a is l and b is r, regardless of the current position i, that's the desired end state.\n\nSo, the target is any state where a == l and b == r. The current position doesn't matter at that point because she's done closing all unnecessary tabs.\n\nSo, the approach is to perform a BFS, exploring all possible actions, keeping track of visited states to avoid loops.\n\nEach state is (current_position, a, b). Since n is up to 100, the possible a and b can be up to 100 as well. So the number of possible states is manageable.\n\nThe initial state is (pos, 1, n). We can use a priority queue (like Dijkstra's algorithm) or a deque for BFS, as each action takes exactly one step, so BFS is appropriate.\n\nWait, but since each action takes exactly 1 step, BFS is suitable because the first time we reach a state is the minimal number of steps to get there.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Use BFS, starting from the initial state.\n- For each state, generate all possible next states by performing all four possible actions (move left, move right, close left, close right), ensuring that the action is possible (e.g., cannot move left beyond a, etc.).\n- Keep track of visited states to avoid processing the same state multiple times.\n- Once we reach a state where a == l and b == r, return the number of steps taken.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible actions and their validity.\n\nWhen moving left:\n\nnew_i = max(a, current_i - 1)\nThis is allowed only if new_i >= a (but that's always true since current_i >= a, and subtracting 1 won't make it less than a).\n\nWhen moving right:\n\nnew_i = min(b, current_i + 1)\nAgain, allowed only if new_i <= b.\n\nClosing left is allowed only if current_i > a (because you can't close when you're at a, as there are no tabs to close on the left). Or wait, no—closing left would close all tabs to the left of current_i. If current_i is a, then there are no tabs to the left, so closing is a no-op. So, to close left, the current_i must be > a.\n\nSimilarly, closing right is allowed only if current_i < b.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says: \"if the cursor is currently at i, she can close all the tabs to the left of i, which are [a, i-1], or to the right of i, which are [i+1, b].\"\n\nSo, if a is already equal to i, then [a, i-1] is empty, so closing left doesn't do anything. So, the action is allowed, but it's a waste of a step.\n\nBut since our goal is to reach a = l and b = r, perhaps sometimes we have to perform a close operation even when it doesn't change anything, just to allow further movement.\n\nWait, no. Because after closing, a becomes i, which could be higher than before. So, in some cases, closing left when a is already i is not useful, but it's an option.\n\nSo, in our BFS, for each state, we can try all four actions, but need to check whether they are possible.\n\nFor each action:\n\nMove left:\n\nPossible if current_i > a. Because if current_i is a, then moving left isn't possible (since max(a, a-1) is a). So, the condition is current_i > a.\n\nSimilarly, moving right is possible only if current_i < b.\n\nClose left is possible if current_i > a.\n\nClose right is possible if current_i < b.\n\nWait, no. Wait, according to the problem statement, she can close left or right regardless of a and b, but the effect depends on current position.\n\nWait, no: the description says, when she is at i, she can close all the tabs to the left of i, which are [a, i-1], or to the right, [i+1, b]. So, if she's at i, and a is 3, i is 4, then [a, i-1] is 3-3, so nothing to close. So, closing left is allowed, but it doesn't change anything.\n\nBut in terms of the state, it's still allowed to perform the action.\n\nSo, in the BFS, when considering closing left, the condition is simply that current_i > a? Or can it be any i >= a+1?\n\nWait, the problem says she can close all tabs to the left of the cursor, regardless of a. So, for example, if a is 3 and i is 3, then [a, i-1] is empty, so closing left does nothing. So, she can perform the action, but it's a wasted step.\n\nSimilarly, if a is 3 and i is 4, then [3, 3] is closed, but that's just tab 3. So, a becomes 4.\n\nSo, for the action 'close left', it's allowed whenever i > a.\n\nWait, no. Because if i is a, then i-1 is a-1, which is less than a, so [a, i-1] is empty. So, closing left is possible, but it has no effect.\n\nSo, in terms of the BFS, we can model the 'close left' action as always being possible, regardless of current position, but it may not change the state.\n\nHmm, but that's a bit tricky. Because for a state where a = i, performing 'close left' will set a to i, which is the same as before. So, that's redundant.\n\nSo, in the BFS, for each state, we can generate four possible next states:\n\n1. Move left: new_i = max(a, i-1)\n   Conditions: i > a. Because if i is a, then moving left is not possible (since max(a, a-1) is a). So, if i > a, then moving is allowed.\n\n2. Move right: new_i = min(b, i+1)\n   Conditions: i < b.\n\n3. Close left: new_a = i\n   Conditions: i >= a (since if i is a, nothing happens).\n\n4. Close right: new_b = i\n   Conditions: i <= b (if i is b, nothing happens).\n\nSo, in the BFS, for each current state, we generate all possible next states based on these conditions.\n\nWait, but the movement actions can only be performed if the resulting position is within the current a and b. So, when moving, we have to ensure that the new_i is within [a, b].\n\nWait, yes, because a and b are the min and max of the open tabs. So, after moving, the new_i must be >= a and <= b.\n\nSo, for the movement actions:\n\n- new_i after move left: max(a, i-1) must be >= a and <= b.\n\nWait, because a is the current min, so max(a, i-1) is >= a. And since i was <= b, i-1 could be as low as a-1, but the new_i is clamped to a. So, the new_i is within [a, b].\n\nSimilarly, for moving right, new_i is min(b, i+1), which is <= b and >= a (since i+1 could be up to b).\n\nSo, the movement actions are always allowed as long as the conditions for moving are met.\n\nBut for the close actions, the conditions are whether the action is possible, regardless of whether it changes the state.\n\nSo, for each action, we need to:\n\n- Check if the action is possible (based on current state)\n- Compute the new state\n- Add it to the queue if not visited\n\nSo, now the plan is solid. Now, the code.\n\nWe'll model the state as a tuple (i, a, b). We'll use BFS, as each step takes 1 unit of time.\n\nWe can represent the visited states as a set of tuples, or perhaps a 3D array.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read input: n, pos, l, r.\n\n2. Check if l == 1 and r == n: if yes, output 0.\n\n3. Else, proceed.\n\n4. Initialize a queue for BFS. Each element is (current_i, a, b, steps). Start with (pos, 1, n, 0).\n\n5. Create a visited set to track visited states.\n\n6. While queue is not empty:\n\n   a. Dequeue the front element.\n\n   b. If a == l and b == r: return steps.\n\n   c. For each possible action:\n\n      i. Move left: new_i = max(a, i-1). Check if i > a (so that moving is possible). Also, new_i must be >= a and <= b.\n\n         So, if i > a, compute new_i. Then, create new_state = (new_i, a, b). If this state is not in visited, add to queue and mark as visited.\n\n      ii. Move right: similar. new_i = min(b, i+1). Check if i < b. So, if i < b, compute new_i.\n\n      iii. Close left: new_a = i. new_b = b. Check if i >= a. So, if i >= a, then the new state is (i, i, b). But wait, after closing left, a becomes i. So, the new state is (current_i, i, b). But wait, no: closing left closes all tabs to the left of i, so the new a is i.\n\n      So, after closing left, the new a is i, and b remains the same.\n\n      So, new_a is i, new_b is b.\n\n      So, the new state is (current_i, new_a, new_b). But wait, the current_i can change after moving. No, wait, the action is to close, so the current_i remains the same. So, the new state is (i, new_a, new_b).\n\n      So, the condition is i >= a.\n\n      iv. Close right: new_b = i. new_a remains a.\n\n      So, new state is (i, a, i). Condition is i <= b.\n\n7. Once a state is found where a == l and b == r, return the steps.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n6 3 2 4\n\nInitial state: (3, 1, 6, 0 steps).\n\nWe need to reach a=2, b=4.\n\nIn the sample explanation, the steps were:\n\nShift to 2 (1 step), close left (step 2). Then shift to 3, 4 (steps 3,4), close right (step 5). Total 5 steps.\n\nLet's see how the BFS would handle this.\n\nFrom state (3,1,6,0):\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- Move left: 3>1, so new_i is 2. new state (2,1,6). Steps 1.\n\n- Move right: 3<6, new_i is 4. new state (4,1,6). Steps 1.\n\n- Close left: 3>=1, new state (3,3,6). Steps 1.\n\n- Close right: 3<=6, new state (3,1,3). Steps 1.\n\nSo, these four states are added to the queue.\n\nThen, when processing each state:\n\nFor state (2,1,6,1):\n\nCheck if a=2 and b=6. Not yet.\n\nActions:\n\nMove left: 2>1. new_i =1. state (1,1,6). Steps 2.\n\nMove right: 2<6. new_i=3. state (3,1,6). Steps 2.\n\nClose left: 2>=1. new state (2,2,6). Steps 2.\n\nClose right: 2<=6. new state (2,1,2). Steps 2.\n\nBut wait, after closing right from (2,1,6), the new state is (2,1,2). Now, a=1, b=2. So, the new state is (2,1,2). But our target is a=2, b=4. So, that's not helpful.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal path is to close left first.\n\nLet's see another path.\n\nTake the state (2,1,6,1):\n\nIf we close left here, the new state is (2,2,6). Steps 2.\n\nIn this state, a=2, b=6.\n\nNow, from here, we can move right to 3,4, etc.\n\nAt state (2,2,6,2):\n\nPossible actions:\n\nMove right: 2<6. new_i=3. Steps 3.\n\nMove right again: 3<6. new_i=4. Steps 4.\n\nClose right: 4<=6. new state (4,2,4). Steps 3.\n\nBecause when you close right at 4, the new_b is 4.\n\nSo, state (4,2,4,3).\n\nAt this state, a=2, b=4, which is the target. So, steps taken is 3.\n\nWait, but the sample expects 5 steps. Hmm, why is that?\n\nWait, no. Because in this scenario, the steps taken would be 3, but the sample says 5.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no. Because in the sample explanation, she shifts to 2 (step 1), closes left (step 2). Then, she shifts to 3,4 (steps 3,4), and closes right (step 5).\n\nIn my alternative path, she took 3 steps: moving to 2, close left (2 steps), then moving to 4 and close right in 3 steps.\n\nWait, perhaps my alternative path is more efficient. So why is the sample expecting 5 steps?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the BFS analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps in the alternative path, the steps are:\n\nStep 1: move to 2.\n\nStep 2: close left. Now a=2, b=6.\n\nStep 3: move to 3.\n\nStep 4: move to 4.\n\nStep 5: close right. Now b=4.\n\nTotal 5 steps.\n\nAh, right. Because in the state (2,2,6), moving to 3 and 4 takes two steps, plus the close right step.\n\nSo, the alternative path I thought of earlier was incorrect because the steps to reach 4 would take more steps.\n\nWait, perhaps in the state (2,2,6,2 steps):\n\nMoving right once brings us to 3 (step 3). Then moving right again brings us to 4 (step4). Then close right (step5).\n\nSo, the total steps are 5.\n\nSo, the BFS would find the minimal steps correctly.\n\nHmm, so the BFS approach is correct, but the manual calculation earlier was wrong.\n\nThus, the BFS approach correctly captures the minimal steps.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n['6 3 1 3']\n\nHere, l=1, r=3. So, she needs to close all tabs to the right of 3, which are 4,5,6.\n\nSo, initial state is (3,1,6,0).\n\nThe optimal steps: close right (from 3, which is b=6. Closing right will set b=3. So, steps 1.\n\nSo, she doesn't need to move anywhere. So, the output is 1.\n\nThird sample: ['5 2 1 5'].\n\nHere, l=1, r=5. So, all tabs are in the desired range. So, output 0.\n\nSo, the BFS approach works.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: All tabs are to the left of l.\n\nFor example, n=5, pos=3, l=4, r=5.\n\nShe needs to close tabs 1-3.\n\nWhat's the minimal steps?\n\nShe can move to 4, close left, then move to 5, close right.\n\nSteps:\n\nMove from 3 to 4: 1 step.\n\nClose left: step 2. Now a=4.\n\nMove to 5: step 3.\n\nClose right: step4. So, total 4 steps.\n\nIs there a better way?\n\nAlternatively, she can close left directly from pos=3, but that's not possible because l=4.\n\nWait, initial state is (3,1,5).\n\nShe needs to reach a=4, b=5.\n\nSo, options:\n\n- Close left: from 3, which is >=1. So, new state is (3,3,5). Steps 1.\n\nThen, she can close right from 3, but since 3 <5, closing right would set b=3, which is too early.\n\nAlternatively, move to 4, then close left.\n\nSo, from (3,1,5), move to 4 (step 2). Close left (step3, new a=4). Then, move to 5 (step4). Close right (step5). Total steps:5.\n\nSo, the first approach is better.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, after closing left, a=3, b=5.\n\nSo, she can move to 4 (step 2?), but wait:\n\nAfter step 1: state is (3,3,5). Steps=1.\n\nFrom here, she can move to 4 (step2: state (4,3,5)), then close left (step3: a=4, steps=3). Then, move to 5 (step4), close right (step5). So, 5 steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another path.\n\nWait, perhaps she can close right first.\n\nNo, because she needs to close left and right.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal steps are 4.\n\nWait, perhaps she can:\n\nMove to 4 (step1), close left (step2, a=4). Then, move to 5 (step3), close right (step4). So, 4 steps.\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nWait, in this case, the steps are:\n\n1. Move from 3 to 4.\n\n2. Close left: a becomes4.\n\n3. Move to5.\n\n4. Close right: b becomes5.\n\nSo, total steps:4.\n\nSo, the BFS approach would find this path.\n\nAnother Edge Case: All tabs are to the right.\n\nn=5, pos=1, l=3, r=5.\n\nShe needs to close tabs 1 and 2.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nClose left (from pos=1, but wait, can she close left when at 1?\n\nWait, according to the problem statement, when she is at i, she can close left if i> a.\n\nInitially, a=1, so i=1 is not greater than a. So, she can't close left.\n\nSo, she needs to move to a position where a is less than i.\n\nBut in the initial state, a=1, and she's at 1.\n\nShe can't close left.\n\nSo, she must move right first.\n\nSo, move to 2 (step1), then close left (step2, a becomes2).\n\nThen, move to 3 (step3), close right (step4, b becomes5).\n\nSo, total steps:4.\n\nIs there a better way?\n\nAlternatively, she could move to 3, close left (but that's impossible because a is 1 and i=3>1, so she can close left, which would set a=3.\n\nBut then she's at 3, and needs to close right as well.\n\nSo, steps:\n\nMove to3 (step1), close left (step2, a=3), close right (step3, b=5). So, 3 steps.\n\nThat's better.\n\nWait, why didn't that occur to me earlier.\n\nBecause in this scenario, she can close left while at 3, which sets a=3, thus closing tabs 1 and 2.\n\nBut then, she needs to close the right tabs, which are 4 and5.\n\nSo, she is at 3, and needs to close right.\n\nShe can move to 4 (step3), then close right (step4). So, steps:4.\n\nAlternatively, she can close right directly from 3: because at 3, b=5, so closing right will set b=3, but that's not enough.\n\nWait, no. Because she needs to close all tabs after 3.\n\nSo, she can't close right at 3, because that would close 4 and5. So, when she is at 3, and b=5, closing right would set b=3, which is exactly what she needs.\n\nWait, because after closing right, all tabs after 3 are closed.\n\nSo, in this case, after moving to 3, she can close right (step2) to set b=3, which leaves tabs 3,4,5. Wait, no: closing right from 3 would close all tabs after 3, which are 4 and5. So, b becomes3.\n\nBut then, she needs to close tabs 1 and2 as well.\n\nSo, to close left, she needs to be at a position where a < i.\n\nSo, she can move to 2, but in the state where a=3, that's not possible.\n\nWait, no: after closing right, a remains 1 (since she didn't close left). So, a=1, b=3.\n\nSo, she can move to 2 (from 3, move left to 2, step3), then close left (step4, a becomes2). But that's not sufficient.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the BFS approach is the way to go.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that implementing the BFS approach is the correct way to model the problem, as it handles all possible scenarios.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nImplementing the BFS in Python.\n\nWe can represent the state as a tuple (current_i, a, b).\n\nWe can use a deque for the BFS queue.\n\nWe'll start with the initial state (pos, 1, n), with steps=0.\n\nWe'll keep a set of visited states to avoid revisiting.\n\nFor each state, we generate all possible next states by moving left, moving right, closing left, closing right, as per the conditions.\n\nEach transition is considered as a separate action, leading to a new state.\n\nOnce a state is generated where a == l and b == r, we return the steps taken.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, handle the special case where l ==1 and r ==n.\n\nif l ==1 and r ==n:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nInitialize the queue.\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\nqueue = deque()\nvisited = set()\n\ninitial_a = 1\ninitial_b = n\n\nqueue.append( (pos, initial_a, initial_b, 0) )\nvisited.add( (pos, initial_a, initial_b) )\n\ndirections = [\n    ('left', lambda i, a: max(a, i-1)),\n    ('right', lambda i, b: min(b, i+1)),\n    ('close_left', lambda a, i: i),\n    ('close_right', lambda b, i: i)\n]\n\nfound = False\n\nwhile queue:\n    current_i, a, b, steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    if a == l and b == r:\n        print(steps)\n        found = True\n        break\n    \n    # Generate all possible next states\n    # Move left\n    if current_i > a:\n        new_i = max(a, current_i -1)\n        new_state = (new_i, a, b)\n        if new_state not in visited:\n            visited.add(new_state)\n            queue.append( (new_i, a, b, steps +1) )\n    \n    # Move right\n    if current_i < b:\n        new_i = min(b, current_i +1)\n        new_state = (new_i, a, b)\n        if new_state not in visited:\n            visited.add(new_state)\n            queue.append( (new_i, a, b, steps +1) )\n    \n    # Close left\n    if current_i >= a:\n        new_a = current_i\n        new_state = (current_i, new_a, b)\n        if new_state not in visited:\n            visited.add(new_state)\n            queue.append( (current_i, new_a, b, steps +1) )\n    \n    # Close right\n    if current_i <= b:\n        new_b = current_i\n        new_state = (current_i, a, new_b)\n        if new_state not in visited:\n            visited.add(new_state)\n            queue.append( (current_i, a, new_b, steps +1) )\n\nif not found:\n    # This should not happen as per the problem statement.\n    print(-1)\n\nWait, but in the code above, the initial a is 1, but after some closes, a can be higher.\n\nWait, in the code, the initial state is (pos, 1, n, 0). So, when she's at 3, a=1, b=6.\n\nWhen she closes left, a becomes 3, which is the current_i.\n\nSo, the code correctly models that.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4.\n\nThe code should find a state where a=2 and b=4.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the steps would be 5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: ['6 3 1 3'].\n\nIn this case, the initial state is (3,1,6,0). She can close right (since 3 <=6), setting b=3.\n\nSo, the new state is (3,1,3,1). Now, a=1, b=3, which is l=1, r=3. So, steps=1.\n\nThus, the code would output 1.\n\nAnother test case: ['5 2 1 5']: output is 0.\n\nSo, the code handles all cases.\n\nWhat about when l=1 and r is not n?\n\nLike, n=5, l=1, r=3. So, she needs to close 4 and5.\n\nSo, initial state: (pos, 1,5,0). Let's say pos=3.\n\nShe can close right from 3, setting b=3. Steps=1. Now, a=1, b=3. Which is the desired state. So, steps=1.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because she hasn't closed 4 and5. Oh, no, because after closing right, all tabs to the right of 3 are closed. So, yes, it's correct.\n\nSo, the code correctly returns 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=3.\n\nShe needs to close 4 and5.\n\nShe can move to 3, close right (steps 2), then move to 4 (step3), close right (step4). So, 4 steps.\n\nAlternatively, she can close right from 2, but that's not allowed because 2 <5.\n\nWait, no: from pos=2, she can close right, setting b=2. So, a=1, b=2. Then, she needs to close right again from 2, but 2 is equal to b, so closing right does nothing. So, she can't close 4 and5 that way.\n\nThus, she needs to move to 3, close right, then move to 4, close right.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. move to3 (step1), 2. close right (step2, b=3), 3. move to4 (step3), 4. close right (step4, b=4). But wait, that's not enough. Because she needs to close 5.\n\nHmm, no. Because after step4, b=4, but 5 is still open.\n\nSo, she needs to move to5, but can't because b=4.\n\nWait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, in the state after closing right at 3, b is 3.\n\nSo, she can't move to4, because from 3, b is3, so min(b, 3+1)=3.\n\nSo, she can't move right beyond 3.\n\nSo, she's stuck.\n\nWait, that suggests that the approach is wrong.\n\nBut that can't be, because in reality, she can close right from 3, which would set b=3, but then she can't move to4 because it's closed.\n\nWait, but no: when she closes right from 3, the tabs 4 and5 are closed. So, the new b is3.\n\nThus, she doesn't need to close right again, because 4 and5 are already closed.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the closing of right would close all tabs to the right of current_i. So, in the initial state, after closing right from 3, the new b is3. So, tabs 4 and5 are closed.\n\nSo, the desired state is a=1, b=3. So, she doesn't need to do anything else.\n\nWait, no, because she needs to leave [1,3] open. So, closing right from3 would close 4 and5, which is correct.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nMove to3 (step1),",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible states efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Luba can move the cursor left or right and close tabs on either side of the cursor. The goal is to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r]. The solution must account for all possible movements and closures efficiently.\n\n2. **State Representation**: Each state is represented by the current position of the cursor, the minimum index of open tabs (`a`), and the maximum index of open tabs (`b`). This helps in tracking the progress towards the target state where only the segment [l, r] remains open.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: We use BFS to explore all possible actions (moving left, moving right, closing left, closing right) from each state. Each action leads to a new state, which is enqueued for further exploration if it hasn't been visited before.\n\n4. **Transitions**: For each state, we consider four possible actions:\n   - Move left\n   - Move right\n   - Close all tabs to the left of the cursor\n   - Close all tabs to the right of the cursor\n\n5. **Termination Condition**: The BFS terminates when we reach a state where the minimum index `a` is `l` and the maximum index `b` is `r`, indicating that all unnecessary tabs have been closed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\ninitial_a = 1\ninitial_b = n\n\nqueue = deque()\nvisited = set()\n\nqueue.append((pos, initial_a, initial_b, 0))\nvisited.add((pos, initial_a, initial_b))\n\nfound = False\n\nwhile queue:\n    current_i, a, b, steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    if a == l and b == r:\n        print(steps)\n        found = True\n        break\n    \n    # Generate all possible next states\n    # Move left\n    if current_i > a:\n        new_i = max(a, current_i - 1)\n        new_state = (new_i, a, b)\n        if new_state not in visited:\n            visited.add(new_state)\n            queue.append((new_i, a, b, steps + 1))\n    \n    # Move right\n    if current_i < b:\n        new_i = min(b, current_i + 1)\n        new_state = (new_i, a, b)\n        if new_state not in visited:\n            visited.add(new_state)\n            queue.append((new_i, a, b, steps + 1))\n    \n    # Close left\n    if current_i >= a:\n        new_a = current_i\n        new_state = (current_i, new_a, b)\n        if new_state not in visited:\n            visited.add(new_state)\n            queue.append((current_i, new_a, b, steps + 1))\n    \n    # Close right\n    if current_i <= b:\n        new_b = current_i\n        new_state = (current_i, a, new_b)\n        if new_state not in visited:\n            visited.add(new_state)\n            queue.append((current_i, a, new_b, steps + 1))\n\nif not found:\n    print(-1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution uses BFS to explore all possible states efficiently. Each state transition is checked for validity, and new states are enqueued for further exploration. The process continues until the target state (where only the segment [l, r] remains open) is reached, ensuring the minimum number of steps are taken. This approach guarantees that the optimal solution is found by exploring all possible actions level by level.",
