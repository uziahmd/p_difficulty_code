The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about counting the number of permutation pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q, and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And then return this count modulo a given mod. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem statement again. We have two permutations p and q of 1..n. We need to find all pairs where p < q lex-wise, and inv(p) > inv(q). Then sum all such pairs modulo mod.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Well, the constraints are n up to 500, which isn't too bad. So maybe a dynamic programming approach is possible here.\n\nWait, but for each pair (p, q), checking if p is lex smaller than q would take O(n) time, which could be expensive if done naively. But with n=500, that's 500 * 500 = 250,000 operations per pair, which multiplied by the number of pairs (which is huge) is impossible. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the properties of p and q. Maybe we can model the problem using some state representation that captures both the inversion count and the lex order.\n\nAnother thought: since p and q are permutations, their inversion counts can vary. The total number of inversions across all permutations is something, but I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute for each possible permutation p, the number of q's that are lex larger than p and have a lower inversion count. Then sum over all p the count of such q's. That might work.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently. For each p, we need to consider all q's that are lex >= p (since p < q in lex order), but wait no, p must be lex smaller than q. So for each p, we need to find q's where q is lex greater than p, and inv(q) < inv(p).\n\nHmm, but how to model this without enumerating all possible q's for each p.\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible pair of permutations (p, q), we can represent their relation in terms of the inversion counts and lex order. But again, n=500 makes this impossible as the number of permutations is way too big.\n\nSo we need a way to model the problem with DP, considering the inversion count and lex order.\n\nLet's think about the lex order condition first. Two permutations p and q are compared lex-wise by the first position where they differ. So for p to be lex smaller than q, at the first differing index i, p[i] < q[i].\n\nNow, considering that, perhaps we can build the permutations step by step, keeping track of certain parameters that allow us to compute the required count.\n\nWhat parameters do we need? Well, for each position, the current choice affects both the lex order and the inversion count.\n\nWait, perhaps the DP state can include:\n\n- The current position we're building the permutation up to.\n- The current prefix of p and q (but that's probably too much).\n- The inversion count of p and q so far.\n- Some other state variables.\n\nBut that seems complicated. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows: the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q in lex order, and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nLet me denote S as the set of all permutations. Then, the answer is the sum over p in S of the number of q in S where q > p (in lex order) and inv(q) < inv(p).\n\nHmm, but computing this for each p is still tricky.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this as a DP where for each possible state, we track the minimal inversion count so far and some information about the lex order.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider all possible pairs (a, b) where a is a permutation and b is another permutation. We need to count all such pairs where a < b (lex) and inv(a) > inv(b).\n\nThis seems similar to a problem where we have to compute for each a, the number of b's that are larger than a and have inv(b) less than inv(a). Summing this over all a gives the answer.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nPerhaps, for each possible a, we can find the number of b's that are lex larger than a and have inv(b) < inv(a). Adding these numbers for all a gives the desired result.\n\nSo, how to compute for a particular a, the count of b's that are lex larger than a and have lower inversion counts.\n\nBut for each a, the number of b's is equal to the number of permutations lex larger than a (call this L(a)) minus the number of permutations lex larger than a with inv(b) >= inv(a) (call this M(a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lexicographically smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than the number of inversions in q. The result should be returned modulo a given value.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Permutations and Inversions**: A permutation of size n has certain properties, including the number of inversions it can have. An inversion is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and p[i] > p[j].\n\n2. **Lexicographical Order**: Two permutations are compared lexicographically by the first position where they differ. If p has a smaller element at the first differing position, p is considered lexicographically smaller than q.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We use dynamic programming (DP) to efficiently compute the required count without explicitly enumerating all permutations, which would be computationally infeasible for large n.\n\n4. **State Representation**: The DP state is defined as `dp[i][j][k]`, representing the number of ways to build the first i elements of p and j elements of q such that the inversion count of p is k. This allows us to track both the inversion count and the lexicographical order.\n\n5. **Transition**: For each position, we consider the possible choices for the next element in p and q, updating the DP state accordingly. We ensure that the lexicographical order condition is maintained by comparing elements at each step.\n\n6. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we take results modulo 1e9 + 7 at each step to prevent overflow and ensure efficiency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn = int(input().split()[0])\nmod = int(input().split()[1])\n\n# Precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo mod\nfact = [1] * (n+1)\ninv_fact = [1] * (n+1)\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % mod\n# Fermat's little theorem for inverse factorial calculation\ninv_fact[n] = pow(fact[n], mod-2, mod)\nfor i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n    inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % mod\n\ndef main():\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    # dp[i][j]: state after placing i elements of p and j elements of q\n    # j can't exceed i, since p must be lex smaller than q\n    dp = [[defaultdict(int) for _ in range(n+1)] for __ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    # Base case: no elements placed\n    dp[0][0][0] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(0, i+1):\n            # Current possible states for i elements in p and j elements in q\n            current_p = dp[i-1][j]\n            if not current_p:\n                continue\n            \n            # Consider adding the next element to p and q\n            # We need to choose the next elements in p and q such that p is lex smaller\n            # So, for the next element in p, it must be less than the next element in q, or equal\n            # but if p's next is less, then q's next can be any >= it; else, if p's next is greater,\n            # q's next must be greater than p's next to maintain lex order\n            # Wait, no.
