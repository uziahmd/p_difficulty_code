For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. Let's think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem defines a major triad as having two intervals: 4 semitones and 3 semitones when the notes are ordered in a specific way. Similarly, a minor triad has 3 semitones and then 4 semitones. The order is such that the distances add up correctly to form the triad.\n\nSo, for any given set of three notes, I need to consider all possible orderings (permutations) of these three notes. For each permutation, I calculate the distances between consecutive notes and see if it matches either the major or minor pattern.\n\nWait, but wait—how do I calculate the distance between two notes? Oh right, the notes are arranged in a cycle of 12, with each consecutive note being a semitone apart. So the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but since the distance is always taken from lower to higher, I think the correct calculation is (Y's position - X's position) modulo 12. Because the distance is the number of semitones you step up from X to reach Y.\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance is from the lower to the upper note. So for example, C to E is 4 semitones because C → C# → D → D# → E. But E to C would be 8 semitones because E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, C. Wait, no, that's 8 steps, but wait, let me count:\n\nE to C: E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, C. That's 8 semitones. So the distance is 8 in that direction. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but only if Y is after X in the scale. Otherwise, perhaps it's (Y + 12 - X) mod 12. Or maybe I should represent each note with its index, then compute the distance as (y - x) % 12 if y >=x, else (y + 12 -x). Or maybe just compute (y - x) % 12, because if x is larger than y, mod will give a positive value.\n\nWait, let's think about the positions. Let's assign each note a number. Let's say C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, D# is 3, E is 4, F is 5, F# is 6, G is 7, G# is 8, A is 9, B is 10, H is 11. So the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, and then back to C.\n\nSo the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12. Because if X is after Y, then Y - X would be negative, and mod 12 would wrap around to the correct positive distance.\n\nFor example, E is 4, C is 0. Distance from E to C is (0 -4) mod 12 = 8 mod12=8, which is correct.\n\nSo yes, the distance between two notes can be computed as (y - x) mod 12, but since we take the distance from lower to higher, that's exactly what this gives.\n\nNow, the problem is: for a given triad of three notes, determine if any permutation of these three notes forms a major or minor triad.\n\nSo, for each possible permutation of the three notes (there are 3! =6 permutations), I need to check the distances between the first and second, then second and third. If any of these permutations yields the major or minor pattern, then the chord is classified accordingly.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the triad is an unordered set. So the order in which we arrange them matters for checking the pattern.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Assign each note a numerical value based on the list [C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H]. So create a dictionary mapping each note to its position.\n\n2. For the given three notes, generate all possible permutations of these three notes. Each permutation represents a possible ordering for X, Y, Z.\n\n3. For each permutation, compute the distances between X-Y and Y-Z.\n\n   a. For a major triad: the X-Y distance is 4 semitones, Y-Z is 3. So total is 7.\n\n   b. For a minor triad: X-Y is 3, Y-Z is 4. So total is 7 again.\n\n4. If any permutation satisfies either condition, then classify the chord accordingly.\n\n5. Since the problem states that the answer is unambiguous (no chords can be both major and minor), once a matching condition is found, we can return that result without further checking.\n\n6. If none of the permutations satisfy either condition, output 'strange'.\n\nSo now, the steps to code this:\n\nFirst, create the note_to_pos dictionary. Let's list the notes in order:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nSo, note_to_pos = {'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n\nWait, but wait, what about the case where the input is written differently, like 'H' instead of 'B'? No, according to the problem statement, the input uses the same notation as the given list, so H is 11, B is 10.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNext, read the input: the input is a single line with three space-separated notes. So for example, in the sample input, the first test case is ['C', 'E', 'G'], which is a major triad.\n\nSo, code-wise, read the input line, split into three strings, say, notes = input().split()\n\nThen, for each of the 6 possible permutations of these three notes, calculate the distances.\n\nWait, but generating all permutations might be time-consuming, but since there are only 3 elements, 6 permutations is manageable.\n\nSo in Python, import itertools.permutations.\n\nSo for each perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n\n   x, y, z = perm\n\n   pos_x = note_to_pos[x]\n\n   pos_y = note_to_pos[y]\n\n   pos_z = note_to_pos[z]\n\n   d_xy = (pos_y - pos_x) % 12\n\n   d_yz = (pos_z - pos_y) % 12\n\n   if d_xy ==4 and d_yz ==3:\n\n       return 'major'\n\n   elif d_xy ==3 and d_yz ==4:\n\n       return 'minor'\n\nIf none found, return 'strange'\n\nWait, but wait: in the sample input, the first test case is ['C E G'] which becomes the notes C, E, G.\n\nIn their permutation, C, E, G: the distances are 4 (E-C is 4?) Wait, no, C is 0, E is 4. So d_xy is 4-0=4 mod12 is 4. Then E to G is 7-4=3 mod12 is 3. So yes, that's a major triad.\n\nAnother permutation could be C, G, E. Let's see: d_xy is (7-0)=7 mod12=7, d_yz is (4-7) mod12= (-3) mod12=9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nSo, the code needs to check all 6 permutations, and see if any of them leads to a major or minor condition.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read the three notes.\n\n- Generate all 6 permutations.\n\n- For each permutation, compute the two distances.\n\n- Check for major or minor condition.\n\n- As soon as one is found, return the corresponding classification.\n\nNow, let's test some cases.\n\nSample Input 1: C E G\n\nAs discussed, one permutation (C, E, G) gives major.\n\nSample Input 2: C# B F\n\nWhich is C#, B, F.\n\nWait, the sample output says it's a minor triad. Let's see.\n\nLet me assign their positions.\n\nC# is 1, B is 10, F is5.\n\nWe need to find a permutation where the first two notes are 3 apart, then the next two are 4 apart.\n\nLooking at permutation B, C#, F.\n\nB is 10, C# is1, F is5.\n\nd_xy = (1-10) mod12 = ( -9 ) mod12=3.\n\nd_yz = (5-1)=4 mod12=4.\n\nSo that's 3 and 4. So that's a minor triad.\n\nSo code would find this permutation and return 'minor'.\n\nThird sample input: A B H.\n\nPositions: A is9, B is10, H is11.\n\nCheck all permutations.\n\nPermutation A, B, H:\n\nd_xy=1, d_yz=1. Not 3 or4.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H.\n\nd_xy= (9-10) mod12= 11, which is not 3 or4.\n\nWait, wait, no, wait: no, the permutation is B, A, H. So x is B (10), y is A (9). So d_xy is (9-10) mod12= -1 mod12=11. Which is more than 4, so not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: B, H, A.\n\nx is B (10), y is H (11): d_xy is (11-10)=1.\n\ny is H (11), z is A (9): d_yz is (9-11)= -2 mod12=10. Not matching.\n\nHmm, so perhaps none of the permutations satisfy the condition. So output is 'strange'.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nSo the plan is solid.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nWhat about a triad where the notes wrap around the 12-note scale?\n\nFor example: E, G, C.\n\nE is4, G is7, C is0.\n\nCompute all permutations.\n\nOne permutation is E, G, C.\n\nd_xy:7-4=3, d_yz:0-7= -7 mod12=5. Not 4.\n\nAnother permutation: G, E, C.\n\nd_xy:4-7= -3 mod12=9. Not 3 or4.\n\nWait, another permutation: C, E, G.\n\nd_xy=4, d_yz=3. So that's a major triad.\n\nYes, so in this case, the code would correctly identify it as major.\n\nAnother case: C, D#, G.\n\nC is0, D# is3, G is7.\n\nCheck permutations.\n\nC, D#, G: d_xy=3, d_yz=4. So that's a minor triad.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: the same note appears multiple times. But wait, the problem says it's a set, so all three must be distinct. But according to the problem statement, it's an unordered set of exactly three notes. So the input will have three distinct notes.\n\nSo no problem there.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nImport necessary modules: itertools.\n\nRead the three notes.\n\nCreate the note_to_pos dictionary.\n\nGenerate all permutations.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   get x, y, z.\n\n   get their positions.\n\n   compute d_xy and d_yz.\n\n   if d_xy is 4 and d_yz is3 → major.\n\n   elif d_xy is3 and d_yz is4 → minor.\n\nIf any of these conditions met, print accordingly and exit.\n\nElse, after all permutations, print 'strange'.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nWait, but how to handle the permutations. So, for each note in the input, it's a string. So for example, in the input 'C E G', the individual elements are 'C', 'E', 'G'.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    px = note_to_pos[x]\n    py = note_to_pos[y]\n    pz = note_to_pos[z]\n    d_xy = (py - px) % 12\n    d_yz = (pz - py) % 12\n    if d_xy == 4 and d_yz ==3:\n        print('major')\n        exit()\n    elif d_xy ==3 and d_yz ==4:\n        print('minor')\n        exit()\n\nprint('strange')\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first case is 'C E G', which is correctly handled.\n\nAnother test: the second sample input is 'C# B F'. Let's see.\n\nC# is 1, B is10, F is5.\n\nThe permutation B, C#, F: px is B (10), py is C# (1), pz is F (5).\n\nd_xy: (1 -10) mod12= ( -9 ) mod12=3.\n\nd_yz: (5-1) mod12=4.\n\nSo this permutation triggers 'minor' condition.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: ['A','B','H'].\n\nEach permutation:\n\nA, B, H: px=9, py=10, pz=11.\n\nd_xy=1, d_yz=1 → no.\n\nB, A, H: px=10, py=9, pz=11.\n\nd_xy= (9-10) mod12=11 → not 3 or4.\n\nd_yz= (11-9) mod12=2 → no.\n\nB, H, A: px=10, py=11, pz=9.\n\nd_xy=1, d_yz=(9-11) mod12=10 → no.\n\nH, A, B: px=11, py=9, pz=10.\n\nd_xy= (9-11) mod12=10 → no.\n\nH, B, A: px=11, py=10, pz=9.\n\nd_xy= (10-11) mod12=11 → no.\n\nA, H, B: px=9, py=11, pz=10.\n\nd_xy=2, d_yz= (10-11) mod12=11 → no.\n\nSo none trigger, so output 'strange'.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: ['E', 'G', 'C'].\n\nAs before, the permutation E, G, C gives d_xy=3, d_yz= (0-7)=5 mod12=5 → no.\n\nWait, wait, no, E is4, G is7, C is0.\n\nSo d_xy=7-4=3 → yes.\n\nd_yz=0-7= -7 mod12=5 → not 4.\n\nWait, but another permutation: C, E, G.\n\nd_xy=4, d_yz=3 → major.\n\nSo code returns 'major'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: ['F', 'A', 'C'].\n\nF is5, A is9, C is0.\n\nIn permutation F, A, C:\n\nd_xy=4, d_yz= (0-9) mod12=3.\n\nSo that's 4 and 3 → major.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, but what about a minor triad.\n\nTest case: ['B', 'D#', 'F'].\n\nB is10, D# is3, F is5.\n\nPermutation B, D#, F.\n\nd_xy=3-10= -7 mod12=5 → no.\n\nWait, no, because 3 is less than 10, so (3-10) mod12 is ( -7 ) mod12=5.\n\nNot 3 or4.\n\nAnother permutation: D#, B, F.\n\npx=3, py=10, pz=5.\n\nd_xy= (10-3)=7 mod12=7 → no.\n\nWait, but another permutation: B, F, D#.\n\npx=10, py=5, pz=3.\n\nd_xy=5-10= -5 mod12=7 → no.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the minor triad is formed by a different permutation.\n\nWait, wait, let's see: the minor triad requires the first two steps to be 3 semitones, then 4.\n\nSo looking for a permutation where d_xy=3, d_yz=4.\n\nLet me see: suppose the permutation is D#, F, B.\n\nD# is3, F is5, B is10.\n\nd_xy=5-3=2 → no.\n\nAlternatively, F, B, D#.\n\nF is5, B is10, D# is3.\n\nd_xy=10-5=5 → no.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm not thinking of the right permutation.\n\nWait, maybe the minor triad is when the steps are 3 and 4, but perhaps the order is different.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the minor triad is E, G#, C.\n\nE is4, G# is8, C is0.\n\nPermutation E, G#, C.\n\nd_xy=8-4=4 → no.\n\nWait, but what about the permutation G#, E, C.\n\nG# is8, E is4, C is0.\n\nd_xy=4-8= -4 mod12=8 → no.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's easier to rely on the code to handle all permutations.\n\nSo the code should correctly find whether any permutation meets the conditions.\n\nSo, in code, for all permutations, check the two distances.\n\nNow, in terms of code efficiency, for 3 elements, 6 permutations is nothing. So no problem.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Case sensitivity: the problem statement shows the inputs as uppercase letters, but what if the input is in lowercase? Like 'c e g'? The code would fail.\n\nAh, the problem statement says \"the following is a competitive programming problem.\" So the input is probably given in the same format as the examples, which are in uppercase.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps in the code, we should convert the input notes to uppercase.\n\nBecause, for example, if the input is 'c e g', the code as written would not find the note 'c' in the dictionary.\n\nSo, in the code, after reading the input, convert each note to uppercase.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nnotes = [n.upper() for n in input().split()]\n\nThat way, even if the input has lowercase letters, they are converted to uppercase, and the note_to_pos dict will still map correctly.\n\nThat's a crucial point.\n\nSo, the code should process the notes in uppercase.\n\nAnother thing: the note_to_pos should be built correctly, including all 12 notes, in the correct order.\n\nSo, the code should have the correct note_order list.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the code should be:\n\nImport itertools.\n\nRead the notes, uppercase.\n\nCheck each permutation.\n\nThus, the final code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\n# Read input notes, converting to uppercase\ninput_notes = input().split()\ninput_notes = [n.upper() for n in input_notes]\n\n# Check each permutation of the three notes\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(input_notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    px = note_to_pos[x]\n    py = note_to_pos[y]\n    pz = note_to_pos[z]\n    d_xy = (py - px) % 12\n    d_yz = (pz - py) % 12\n    if d_xy ==4 and d_yz ==3:\n        print('major')\n        exit()\n    elif d_xy ==3 and d_yz ==4:\n        print('minor')\n        exit()\n\nprint('strange')\n\nI think this should handle all cases correctly.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: C E G → major.\n\nSample Input 2: C# B F → minor.\n\nSample Input 3: A B H → strange.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: ['E', 'C', 'G']: Wait, E, C, G.\n\nE is4, C is0, G is7.\n\nPossible permutation: E, C, G.\n\nd_xy: 0-4= -4 mod12=8 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: C, E, G.\n\nd_xy=4, d_yz=3 → major.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: ['F', 'A', 'C'].\n\nF is5, A is9, C is0.\n\nIn permutation F, A, C: d_xy=4, d_yz= (0-9) mod12=3 → major.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: ['B', 'D#', 'F'].\n\nB is10, D# is3, F is5.\n\nCheck all permutations.\n\nLooking for a permutation where the first two are 3 apart, then 4.\n\nLet me see permutation B, D#, F.\n\nd_xy: (3-10) mod12=7 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: D#, F, B.\n\nd_xy:5-3=2 → no.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Or maybe this isn't a triad.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to run the code with this input.\n\nBut in any case, the code will process all permutations and correctly classify based on the conditions.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of the notes to see if they fit the defined intervals for major or minor triads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Representation**: Each note is assigned a numerical value based on its position in the musical scale. The notes are ordered as ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H'], with each subsequent note being one semitone higher.\n2. **Permutations Check**: For the given three notes, generate all possible permutations (6 permutations in total). For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated as the difference modulo 12, ensuring it wraps around correctly for cyclic scales.\n4. **Triad Classification**: A major triad is identified if the distances are 4 and 3 semitones respectively. A minor triad is identified if the distances are 3 and 4 semitones respectively.\n5. **Edge Cases**: Convert input notes to uppercase to handle any case sensitivity issues and ensure correct mapping.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\ninput_notes = [n.upper() for n in input_notes]\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(input_notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    px = note_to_pos[x]\n    py = note_to_pos[y]\n    pz = note_to_pos[z]\n    d_xy = (py - px) % 12\n    d_yz = (pz - py) % 12\n    if d_xy == 4 and d_yz == 3:\n        print('major')\n        exit()\n    elif d_xy == 3 and d_yz == 4:\n        print('minor')\n        exit()\n\nprint('strange')\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Representation**: Each note is converted into a numerical index using a predefined order, allowing easy calculation of semitone distances.\n2. **Permutations**: Using itertools.permutations, we generate all possible orderings of the three notes to check each potential arrangement.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is computed using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Classification**: For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are checked against the criteria for major and minor triads. If a match is found, the result is printed immediately.\n5. **Efficiency**: The approach efficiently checks all possible configurations (6 permutations) in constant time, ensuring quick determination of the triad type.\n\nThis solution ensures that all edge cases and possible configurations are handled correctly, providing an accurate classification of the given musical triad.",
