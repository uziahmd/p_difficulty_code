He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Prefixes and Suffixes.\" Hmm, Ivan has a string s of length n, and I don't know it. He tells me all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so from lengths 1 to n-1). But he doesn't say which are which—whether they're prefixes or suffixes. My task is to determine for each of the 2n-2 given strings whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the actual string s.\n\nWait, the output is a string of 'P's and 'S's where each character corresponds to one of the input strings. So for each input string, I need to decide if it's a prefix (mark as P) or a suffix (mark as S).\n\nThe first thing I need to figure out is how to determine, for each possible string in the input, whether it's a prefix, a suffix, or both. Because some strings could be both a prefix and a suffix of the original string s.\n\nBut since the input is given as a list of 2n-2 strings, each of length from 1 to n-1, and exactly two of each length, but without knowing which are prefixes and which are suffixes, I need to find a way to assign 'P' or 'S' correctly.\n\nLet me think about the structure here. The original string s must have certain properties based on its prefixes and suffixes. For example, the shortest prefix (length 1) should also appear somewhere as a suffix, perhaps.\n\nWait, no, maybe not. It depends on the string. Like, if s is \"ababa\", then the prefixes are \"a\", \"ab\", \"aba\", \"abab\". The suffixes are \"a\", \"ba\", \"aba\", \"baba\". So the string \"a\" appears as both a prefix and a suffix. Similarly, \"aba\" is both a prefix and a suffix.\n\nSo for each string in the input, I need to check whether it can be a prefix, a suffix, or both.\n\nBut how do I find out which ones are which?\n\nHmm. Let's think about the possible approach. Since the original string s has a unique set of prefixes and suffixes, the correct assignment must satisfy that the entire string s can be constructed by following the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nWait, but the problem allows multiple possible s strings as long as the prefixes and suffixes match. So my solution needs to find an assignment of P and S such that at least one possible s exists.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each possible string in the input, determine whether it could be a prefix or a suffix of some s that satisfies all the constraints.\n\n2. Assign 'P' or 'S' based on whether the string is a prefix or suffix in the correct s.\n\nBut how do I model this? Maybe by finding a way to build s step by step, ensuring that the prefixes and suffixes fit.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: for each possible candidate for the prefix of length k, and for each possible candidate for the suffix of length k, check if they agree on the overlapping part. Because the k-length prefix must match the k-length suffix if they overlap.\n\nWait, that might work. Because in the original string s, the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k must be the same if k ≤ n/2, but wait, no. For example, s = \"ababa\" (n=5). The prefix of length 3 is \"aba\", the suffix of length 3 is \"aba\". So they match. But in the case where n is even, like n=4, s = \"abab\", the prefix of length 2 is \"ab\", suffix of length 2 is \"ab\"—they match. So for each k from 1 to n-1, the k-length prefix and the k-length suffix must be equal.\n\nAh! That's a crucial point. So for each k, the prefix_p[k] and suffix_s[k] must be the same string. Because the k-length prefix is the first k characters, and the k-length suffix is the last k characters of s. So they must be equal.\n\nWait, yes! Because when you have s = p_1 p_2 ... p_n, then the prefix of length k is p_1...p_k, and the suffix of length k is p_{n-k+1} ... p_n. For these two to be equal, their characters must be the same in each position.\n\nSo for each k, the k-length prefix and the k-length suffix must be equal. Therefore, in the input, for each k, there are two strings of length k. One must be the prefix, the other the suffix. But wait, no. Because the two strings could be the same. But in that case, they can't both be the prefix and suffix because that would imply the prefix and suffix are the same, which is possible only if the string is a palindrome up to that point.\n\nWait, no. For example, in the sample input 1, the output was \"SPPSPSPS\". Let's see: the original string is \"ababa\".\n\nFor k=1: the two strings are \"a\" and \"c\"? Wait, no, looking back at the sample input. Oh wait, the sample input seems to have three groups. So perhaps in that case, for each k, one of the two strings is the prefix, the other the suffix.\n\nWait, but in the second sample, the output was \"PPSS\". So for k=1, both strings are 'a', so both must be prefix and suffix. But wait, no. Because if the string is \"aaa\", then the prefix of length 1 is 'a', and the suffix of length 1 is 'a'. So both are present as both. So in that case, both could be marked as 'P' and 'S', but the problem says that the output must have the same number of 'P's and 'S's. So in this case, since there are two strings of length 1, one is 'a' and the other is 'a' again. So in the output, both would be marked as either 'P' or 'S', but that's not possible because the output requires exactly n-1 * 2 / 2 = n-1 'P's and 'S's. Wait, no. Wait, the output is of length 2n-2, which is equal to the number of input strings. Each position is 'P' or 'S'.\n\nIn the second sample, the output is \"PPSS\". So for the two strings of length 1, both are 'a's. So for each, we can choose whether to mark as 'P' or 'S'. But according to the note, the answer can have any possible configuration as long as it's consistent with some s.\n\nIn that case, for each k, the two strings of length k must include the prefix and suffix of s. So for each k, the two strings of length k must be equal if the prefix and suffix are the same, or different otherwise.\n\nWait, no. Because for k=2, suppose the string is \"aabba\". Then the prefix of length 2 is \"aa\", the suffix of length 2 is \"a\". So for k=2, the two strings of length 2 in the input will include \"aa\" as the prefix and another string, which may be \"bb\" or something else.\n\nWait, no, because the input for each k includes exactly two strings of that length, which must be the prefix and suffix for some s.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem statement says that the input contains exactly 2 strings of each length from 1 to n-1. So for each k, there are two strings of length k. These two must be the prefix and suffix of some string s.\n\nSo for each k, the two strings of length k are the prefix and suffix of s. So for each k, the two strings of length k must be compatible in that the prefix and suffix of s for that k are those two. But wait, that's not necessarily true because for a given k, the two strings could be the same, implying that the prefix and suffix are the same. For example, in the case of s being \"aaaa\", for k=2, the prefix is \"aa\" and the suffix is \"aa\".\n\nWait, but how do I determine which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix for each k?\n\nHmm, perhaps for each k, the two strings must form a chain that allows the construction of s. So for example, for k=1, the two strings are a and b. Then for k=2, the two strings must be a + something and b + something, etc. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to find, for each k, which string is the prefix and which is the suffix, ensuring that for each k, the prefix of k-1 is a prefix of the current prefix, and the suffix of k-1 is a suffix of the current suffix.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the prefix of length k must start with the prefix of length k-1, and similarly, the suffix of length k must end with the suffix of length k-1.\n\nSo the idea is to build the prefixes and suffixes in a way that for each step, the new prefix starts with the previous prefix, and the new suffix ends with the previous suffix.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. For each k from 1 to n-1, collect all the possible candidates for the k-length prefix and suffix.\n\n2. Sort these candidates in a way that builds a chain. For each k, the prefix must be an extension of the prefix from k-1, and the suffix must be an extension of the suffix from k-1.\n\nSo, for each k:\n\n   a. The prefix must be formed by adding one character to the (k-1)-length prefix.\n\n   b. Similarly, the suffix must be formed by adding one character to the end of the (k-1)-length suffix.\n\nSo, for each k, we can process the possible candidates and see which pair (prefix_candidate, suffix_candidate) can be built upon the previous step.\n\nThis sounds manageable.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n- We'll process the input and group the strings by their lengths.\n\n- For each k from 1 to n-1, we have two strings: s1 and s2.\n\n- We need to decide for each k whether s1 is the prefix and s2 the suffix, or vice versa, such that for each k, the prefix is an extension of the previous prefix, and the suffix is an extension of the previous suffix.\n\nSo, the algorithm can proceed as follows:\n\nInitialize for k=1:\n\nWe have two options: s1 is prefix, s2 is suffix; or s2 is prefix, s1 is suffix.\n\nBut for k=1, since the next step is k=2, the prefix must start with the k=1 prefix, and the suffix must end with the k=1 suffix.\n\nWait, perhaps for each k starting from 1, we can determine the possible candidates for prefix and suffix by checking the possible extensions.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think recursively.\n\nAt k=1, the two options are:\n\nOption A: prefix is s1, suffix is s2.\n\nOption B: prefix is s2, suffix is s1.\n\nThen, for each option, we check if it can be extended to k=2.\n\nFor Option A, to proceed to k=2, the prefix for k=2 must start with s1, and the suffix for k=2 must end with s2.\n\nSimilarly for Option B.\n\nBut in reality, for each k, the prefix must be the concatenation of the (k-1) prefix plus a new character, and the suffix must be a new character plus the (k-1) suffix.\n\nSo, for each k, for each possible pair (prev_prefix, prev_suffix), we can generate the next possible pairs.\n\nWait, but that's computationally feasible since n is up to 100, and for each step, the number of possibilities is limited.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Group the input strings by their lengths into a dictionary, where key is the length and value is a list of two strings.\n\n2. For each k from 1 to n-1, sort the two strings to have possible candidates for prefix and suffix.\n\n3. Use dynamic programming to track possible (prefix, suffix) pairs for each k.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to process each k in order, and for each possible way to assign the two strings as prefix and suffix, ensure that they can be built upon the previous step.\n\nWait, let's think of it as building a chain.\n\nAt k=1, the two possible options are:\n\n- prefix is s1, suffix is s2.\n\nOr\n\n- prefix is s2, suffix is s1.\n\nWe can represent this as two possible states.\n\nFor each state, we can then consider k=2.\n\nAt k=2, the new prefix must be the previous prefix plus a character, and the new suffix must be a character plus the previous suffix.\n\nSo for each state at k=1, we can try to see if the two strings for k=2 can be arranged as (s1 + c, d + s2), or similar, depending on the previous state.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model this as a graph where each node represents a possible (prefix, suffix) pair at a certain k, and edges represent transitions between k.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too abstract.\n\nAnother approach: the correct assignment must form a chain where each k's prefix is a superstring of the (k-1) prefix, and similarly for the suffix.\n\nSo, for each k, the two possible strings can be considered as the prefix and suffix, but only if they can extend the previous k-1 step.\n\nSo, for each k, for each possible way to assign the two strings as prefix and suffix, we check if they can follow the previous assignments.\n\nWait, but for each k, the two strings must be the only possible options, so perhaps for each k, the correct assignment is determined by the previous step.\n\nLet me think of an example.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=5.\n\nThe input is:\n\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\nWait, wait, the input is given as a list of lines, each line is a string followed by its length. Or perhaps the first line is n, then the next 2n-2 lines are the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nWait, the problem statement says:\n\nThe next 2n-2 lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from 1 to n-1 consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.\n\nSo for n=5, 2n-2 is 8, so there are 8 strings provided.\n\nThese 8 strings consist of 4 strings of length 1, 4 of length 2, 3 of length 3, etc., but wait no—each length from 1 to n-1 has exactly two strings.\n\nWait, n=5: 1,2,3,4.\n\nEach has two strings.\n\nSo the input has 8 strings, grouped into four groups of two.\n\nSo, for each k from 1 to 4, we have two strings.\n\nSo, for each k, we have two options: which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nBut for each k, the choice depends on the previous choices.\n\nSo, for each k, the two strings must be such that the prefix is an extension of the previous prefix and the suffix is an extension of the previous suffix.\n\nSo, let's try to model this.\n\nWe can represent the state as (current_prefix, current_suffix), and for each step k, we can transition to the next state based on the possible options.\n\nSo, starting at k=1:\n\nPossible states are:\n\nstate1: (s1, s2)\n\nstate2: (s2, s1)\n\nThen, for k=2:\n\nFor state1, the new prefix must be state1.prefix + c, where c is some character.\n\nSimilarly, the new suffix must be d + state1.suffix.\n\nBut the two strings for k=2 are fixed: they are the two strings of length 2.\n\nSo, for each state at k=1, we can see if the two k=2 strings can be arranged as new_prefix and new_suffix, where new_prefix starts with state1.prefix, and new_suffix ends with state1.suffix.\n\nIf yes, then we can proceed to the next state.\n\nWait, this seems manageable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- For each k from 1 to n-1:\n\n   a. Collect the two strings of length k.\n\n   b. For each possible state from the previous step (k-1), check if the two strings can be assigned as new prefix and suffix, such that new_prefix starts with the previous prefix, and new_suffix ends with the previous suffix.\n\n   c. If a transition is possible, keep track of this state for the current k.\n\n- Once all k's are processed, the final state gives the correct assignment of prefix and suffix for each string.\n\nWait, but for each k, the two strings are known. So for each k, after processing, we can determine which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nBut how? Because for each k, the two strings are the ones that must be the prefix and suffix of the original s.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- For each k, the two strings must be compatible with the previous step.\n\n- So, for each possible state (from the previous step), check if the current two strings can be arranged as new_prefix and new_suffix, where new_prefix starts with the previous prefix, and new_suffix ends with the previous suffix.\n\n- If yes, then this is a valid state for the current k.\n\nSo, the algorithm proceeds step by step, keeping track of possible states at each k.\n\nBut since the problem requires that the assignment is consistent across all k's, the algorithm must find a path through the possible state transitions.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, group the input strings by their lengths.\n\nWe can create a dictionary where the key is the length, and the value is a list of two strings.\n\nOnce that is done, for each k from 1 to n-1, we can process the two strings of that length.\n\nThen, for each k, we can track possible states, i.e., possible (prefix, suffix) pairs.\n\nAt each step k, for each possible state from the previous step (k-1), we can attempt to assign the two current strings as the new prefix and suffix, ensuring that the new prefix starts with the previous prefix, and the new suffix ends with the previous suffix.\n\nWait, but for each k, the two strings can be arranged in two ways: s_a and s_b, where s_a is the new prefix and s_b is the new suffix, or vice versa.\n\nBut perhaps the order matters, so for each possible state (prev_p, prev_s), we can check both possibilities for the current k's two strings.\n\nWait, let's formalize this.\n\nAt step k, we have two strings: s1 and s2.\n\nFor each possible state (prev_p, prev_s) from step k-1:\n\n- Consider assigning s1 as the new prefix and s2 as the new suffix.\n\n   Check if s1 starts with prev_p, and s2 ends with prev_s.\n\n   If yes, then this is a valid state transition.\n\n- Consider assigning s2 as the new prefix and s1 as the new suffix.\n\n   Check if s2 starts with prev_p, and s1 ends with prev_s.\n\n   If yes, then this is another valid state transition.\n\nSo, for each possible previous state, we can generate new states for the current step.\n\nWe can model this as a BFS or using dynamic programming, keeping track of possible states at each step.\n\nIf, for a particular k, no state transitions are possible from any of the previous states, then the problem is unsolvable. But the problem statement says that the input is guaranteed to correspond to some s, so this won't happen.\n\nOnce all steps are processed, the final state will give us the correct assignments for all the strings.\n\nOnce we have the final state (the prefix and suffix for k=n-1), we can then assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string.\n\nWait, but the problem requires us to assign 'P' or 'S' to each of the 2n-2 input strings, not just the k-length strings.\n\nBecause each string in the input is either a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nSo, for each string in the input, we need to determine whether it is a prefix, a suffix, or both.\n\nBut how?\n\nWell, for each string t in the input, determine whether it is the prefix of s, or the suffix of s, or both.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nOnce we have the final state, which gives the correct prefix and suffix for each k, we can build the entire string s.\n\nBecause the prefix for k=1 is the first character, the prefix for k=2 is the first two, etc.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix for k=1 is the last character, the suffix for k=2 is the last two, etc.\n\nWait, but the final state gives the correct prefix and suffix for k = n-1.\n\nBut how to reconstruct s?\n\nHmm, because s is built by the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nWait, perhaps we can reconstruct s as follows.\n\ns is the concatenation of the prefix for k = n-1 and the suffix for k = n-1, but only if the prefix and suffix match in their overlapping part.\n\nWait, but that's always the case because for k = n-1, the prefix and suffix are the same.\n\nWait, no. Because for s, the prefix of k = n-1 is the first n-1 characters, and the suffix of k = n-1 is the last n-1 characters. So they must be equal.\n\nYes, because for s, the (n-1)-length prefix is s[0..n-2], and the (n-1)-length suffix is s[1..n-1]. So they must be equal.\n\nWait, no. For example, s = 'abcde', the prefix of length 4 is 'abcd', the suffix of length 4 is 'bcde'. These are not the same. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that for each k, the prefix and suffix of k must be equal. But in this example, for k=4, the prefix is 'abcd' and suffix is 'bcde', which are different.\n\nSo my earlier assumption was wrong. Therefore, that approach is incorrect.\n\nSo that idea is flawed.\n\nHmm, now I'm stuck. How else can I model this?\n\nAlternative approach: once I have the correct assignments for each string as P or S, I can build s as follows.\n\nThe correct s is the minimal string that includes all the prefixes and suffixes as per the assignments.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, the correct s must have all the prefixes as per the 'P' assignments and all the suffixes as per the 'S' assignments.\n\nSo the string s can be built by taking the longest prefix and the longest suffix and merging them, ensuring that they match in the overlapping part.\n\nWait, perhaps.\n\nLet me think of the sample input 1.\n\nThe output was \"SPPSPSPS\".\n\nWhich means:\n\nLooking at the input, the first string is 'ba' (length 2), which is marked as S. So it's a suffix.\n\nThe second string is 'a' (length 1), marked as P. So it's a prefix.\n\nThe third string is 'abab' (length 4), marked as P. So it's a prefix.\n\nThe fourth string is 'a' (length 1), marked as P. Prefix.\n\nThe fifth string is 'aba' (length 3), marked as S. So it's a suffix.\n\nThe sixth string is 'baba' (length 4), marked as S. Suffix.\n\nThe seventh string is 'ab' (length 2), marked as P. Prefix.\n\nThe eighth string is 'aba' (length 3), marked as P. Prefix.\n\nWait, but the original s is \"ababa\".\n\nThe prefixes are: a, ab, aba, abab.\n\nThe suffixes are: a, ba, aba, baba.\n\nSo in the input, the two strings of length 1 are 'a' and 'c' (but wait, in the sample input, perhaps the first group is 'a' and 'c'? Or maybe not. Let me recheck the sample input.\n\nWait, the sample input's third group is for n=2: 'a' and 'c'. So for k=2, the two strings are 'ac' and 'ca' perhaps? Or wait, the input is a bit unclear.\n\nBut regardless, the process remains the same.\n\nSo, the correct s can be reconstructed by taking the longest prefix and the longest suffix, ensuring that they match in the overlapping part.\n\nSo, for each k from 1 to n-1:\n\n   - if the string is a prefix, it contributes to the beginning of s.\n\n   - if the string is a suffix, it contributes to the end of s.\n\nBut the problem is overlapping, so the correct way is to build s as the combination of the maximum possible prefix and the maximum possible suffix, making sure they agree.\n\nSo, for example, if the maximum prefix is 'ababa' (length 5), but since n is 5, it's not allowed. So perhaps the maximum prefix is the longest possible prefix, and the maximum suffix is the longest possible suffix, and they must match in the overlapping part.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to have a solution. So the reconstruction is possible.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Determine for each string whether it's a prefix, a suffix, or both.\n\n2. Build the full string s by taking the maximum possible prefix and suffix, ensuring they match.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n- For each k, the correct assignment of P and S is determined.\n\n- For each k, the correct prefix is the one that is part of the overall s, and similarly for the suffix.\n\nSo, the algorithm needs to first determine which of the two strings of each k is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nOnce that is done, s can be built as follows:\n\ns = prefix_{n-1} + suffix_{n-1}, where prefix_{n-1} is the (n-1)-length prefix, and suffix_{n-1} is the (n-1)-length suffix. Since they must be the same, this works.\n\nWait, no. Because for k = n-1, the prefix is s[0..n-2], and the suffix is s[1..n-1]. So they must be equal. Therefore, the (n-1)-length prefix is equal to the (n-1)-length suffix.\n\nThus, s can be built as prefix_{n-1} + last_char, where last_char is the last character of the (n-1)-length suffix.\n\nAlternatively, s can be built as the (n-1)-length prefix followed by the last character of the (n-1)-length suffix.\n\nBut how do I get the last character?\n\nWait, the (n-1)-length suffix is equal to the (n-1)-length prefix. So the last character of the suffix is the same as the last character of the prefix.\n\nWait, but that may not be the case.\n\nWait, for example, s = 'ababa' (n=5). The (n-1)-length prefix is 'abab', and the (n-1)-length suffix is 'baba'. Are they the same? No. So this contradicts my earlier assumption.\n\nAh, right. So my earlier assumption was wrong. So for k = n-1, the prefix and suffix can be different.\n\nSo that approach won't work.\n\nHmm, this complicates things.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the correct assignment of P and S, and then build s by combining the prefixes and suffixes in a way that the maximum possible prefix and suffix agree.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAnother Idea: For each k, the correct assignment must allow the construction of s, such that for each k, the prefix of length k is the first k characters of s, and the suffix of length k is the last k characters of s.\n\nTherefore, the correct assignment must satisfy that for each k, the prefix of k is a prefix of the suffix of k, or vice versa, depending on the way they overlap.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, in the string 'abcde', the prefix of 2 is 'ab', the suffix of 2 is 'de'. These are different and have no overlapping except perhaps in the middle.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to model this is to find a s that satisfies all the P and S assignments, but since the problem allows any correct assignment as long as it's consistent with some s, perhaps we can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce we have the correct assignment of P and S, we can construct s as follows:\n\n- Start with the longest possible prefix (the one that is a prefix of s), then append the longest possible suffix that matches the remaining part.\n\nWait, that might work.\n\nBut how do I find the longest possible prefix and suffix?\n\nAlternatively, since for each k, the prefix is the first k characters, and the suffix is the last k characters, perhaps the correct s can be built by starting with the longest possible prefix, and then appending the suffix that starts at position len(prefix).\n\nBut perhaps that's not directly applicable.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to build s is to take the maximum possible prefix and maximum possible suffix, ensuring that they match in the overlapping part.\n\nBut how to find the maximum possible prefix and suffix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct s can be found by starting with the longest possible prefix, and then adding characters until all suffixes are satisfied.\n\nBut this feels vague.\n\nPerhaps, instead of trying to build s directly, I can use the correct assignment of P and S to determine s.\n\nFor example, for each string in the input, if it's marked as P, it's a prefix of s. If it's marked as S, it's a suffix of s.\n\nSo, the maximum possible prefix is the longest string that is a prefix of s. Similarly, the maximum possible suffix is the longest string that is a suffix of s.\n\nThe correct s must then be the concatenation of the maximum prefix and the maximum suffix, but only if the maximum prefix ends with the maximum suffix's first (length of suffix - (n - len(prefix))) characters.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, for s, the maximum prefix is the longest possible string that is a prefix of s, and the maximum suffix is the longest possible string that is a suffix of s. These two must overlap in the middle.\n\nSo, for example, in 'ababa', the maximum prefix is 'abab', and the maximum suffix is 'aba' or 'baba'?\n\nWait, no. Let's see.\n\ns is 'ababa' (length 5).\n\nThe maximum prefix of length 4 is 'abab'.\n\nThe maximum suffix of length 4 is 'baba'.\n\nSo, the maximum prefix is 'abab', and the maximum suffix is 'baba'.\n\nThese two must form s when combined, but how?\n\nBecause 'abab' is the first four characters, and 'baba' is the last four, but the total length is 5.\n\nWait, 'ababa' can be seen as 'abab' + 'a' (the fifth character), but the suffix of length 4 is 'baba'.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to have the maximum prefix and the maximum suffix, and then s is the concatenation of the maximum prefix and the remaining part to reach the required length.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct s is the maximum prefix concatenated with the maximum suffix, and the overlapping parts must match.\n\nSo, for example, the maximum prefix is 'abab' (length 4), and the maximum suffix is 'aba' (length 3). The last two characters of the prefix must match the first two characters of the suffix.\n\nIn 'abab' + 'aba', the overlapping part is 'ba' and 'ab'—which don't match. So that's invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me think of the problem differently.\n\nOnce I have the correct assignment of P and S for each string, I can build s as follows:\n\nStart by building s as the maximum prefix.\n\nThen, for each suffix in decreasing order, check if it is a suffix of the current s. If yes, append the necessary characters to s to make it longer.\n\nWait, that could work.\n\nFor example, in the sample input 1, the maximum prefix is 'abab' (length 4), and the maximum suffix is 'baba' (length 4). But 'abab' does not end with 'baba's first 4 - (5 -4) = 3 characters. Wait, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the correct s is the maximum possible prefix followed by the maximum possible suffix, but ensuring that the last (k-1) characters of the prefix match the first (k-1) characters of the suffix, where k is the length of the suffix.\n\nWait, for k=4, the suffix is 'baba' (length 4). The prefix is 'abab' (length 4). So the last 3 characters of the prefix are 'bab', and the first 3 characters of the suffix are 'bab'. So they match. Therefore, s can be built as 'abab' + 'a' (since the suffix is 'baba', which is 'abab' with a change in the last character).\n\nWait, no. 'abab' + 'a' would make 'ababa', which has a suffix of length 4 'baba'—correct.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. Find the maximum possible prefix of s.\n\n2. Find the maximum possible suffix of s.\n\n3. Ensure that the last (length of suffix -1) characters of the prefix match the first (length of suffix -1) characters of the suffix.\n\n4. Then, s is the prefix followed by the suffix's last character.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, s is the prefix followed by the suffix, but the overlapping part must match.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nIn the example above, the maximum prefix is 'abab' (4 chars), the maximum suffix is 'baba' (4 chars). The last 3 chars of the prefix are 'bab' and the first 3 of the suffix are 'bab'—so they match.\n\nSo, the s is 'abab' + 'a' (the last character of the suffix). Which is 'ababa'—correct.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n- Find the longest prefix (max_p) and the longest suffix (max_s) such that the last (len(max_s) - 1) characters of max_p equal the first (len(max_s) - 1) characters of max_s.\n\nOnce that is done, s is max_p + last_char_of_max_s.\n\nSo, to find max_p and max_s:\n\n- For each possible length k from n-1 down to 1:\n\n   a. Check if the two strings of length k can be arranged such that one is a prefix and the other is a suffix, and that the suffix starts with the prefix's last (k-1) characters.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nFor each k, from high to low:\n\n   For each possible pair of strings (s1, s2) of length k:\n\n      Assume s1 is the prefix, s2 is the suffix.\n\n      Check if the last (k-1) characters of s1 match the first (k-1) characters of s2.\n\n      If yes, then this is a candidate for max_p and max_s.\n\n      Once found, set max_p = s1, max_s = s2, and break.\n\n   If no such pair is found, try swapping s1 and s2:\n\n      Check if s2 is the prefix, s1 is the suffix.\n\n      Check if the last (k-1) characters of s2 match the first (k-1) of s1.\n\n      If yes, set max_p = s2, max_s = s1.\n\n      Break.\n\nIf found, proceed to build s.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each k from n-1 down to 1:\n\n   a. Take the two strings of length k.\n\n   b. For both possible orderings (s1 as prefix, s2 as suffix; and vice versa):\n\n      i. Check if the suffix starts with the prefix's last k-1 characters.\n\n      ii. If yes, set max_p = the prefix, max_s = the suffix.\n\n      iii. Proceed to build s as max_p + last character of max_s.\n\n      iv. Break the loop.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor k in reversed(range(1, n)):\n    for s1, s2 in [(strings[k][0], strings[k][1]), (strings[k][1], strings[k][0])]:\n        if s1[-(k-1):] == s2[:k-1]:\n            max_p = s1\n            max_s = s2\n            break\n    else:\n        continue\n    break\n\nOnce max_p and max_s are found, s = max_p + max_s[-1]\n\nWait, but why add the last character of max_s? Because the length of max_p is k, and the length of s is n.\n\nWait, no. Because the length of max_p is k, and the length of max_s is k.\n\nBut the total length of s is n.\n\nSo, the max_p is of length k, and the max_s is of length k.\n\nBut the sum is k + k = 2k, which may exceed n.\n\nSo, this approach isn't correct.\n\nWait, no. Because in the example, the max_p is 'abab' (k=4), max_s is 'baba' (k=4), and s is 'ababa' (length 5).\n\nSo, the max_p is 4, max_s is 4, and s is ",
