There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about maximizing profit by building houses on a street with certain restrictions. \n\nAlright, let me read the problem statement carefully again. So, there are n spots on the street where each house can be built with a height between 0 and h. Each spot contributes a squared value equal to the height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in the range from l_i to r_i (inclusive), the tallest house must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit.\n\nHmm. So, the constraints are that for each of the m ranges, the maximum height in that range doesn't exceed x_i. And I want each spot's height as high as possible to maximize the sum of squares.\n\nI think this is a dynamic programming problem because the optimal choice for one spot depends on the choices of previous spots, especially when considering overlapping restrictions.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Maybe we can model the state as the current position and the maximum allowed height up to that point. Wait, but the restrictions can span multiple positions, so we need to track the maximum heights in various intervals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent the state as the current position and the last position where a restriction was applied, along with the maximum height in that interval. Or maybe another approach is to precompute all the necessary constraints and find the minimal maximum height that each spot must have based on overlapping restrictions.\n\nWait, another idea: For each spot i, the maximum height it can have is determined by all the restrictions that include it. So for spot i, the maximum possible height is the minimum of all x_j for all restrictions j where l_j <= i <= r_j, and also not exceeding h. Because if any restriction includes i and has x_j less than h, then i's height can't exceed x_j.\n\nBut wait, that might not be correct. Because some restrictions could have overlapping ranges, and their x_j could influence each other. For example, if two restrictions overlap on a spot, both x_j's must be considered, but the maximum height for that spot is the minimum of those x_j's.\n\nNo, wait, that's not exactly right. Because each restriction is a separate condition. For instance, if a spot is covered by two restrictions, say one says max 3 and another says max 5, then the spot's height can be up to 3. But if a spot is covered by two restrictions that say max 2 and max 3, then it can be up to 2.\n\nSo for each spot i, the maximum possible height is the minimum of all x_j for which i is in [l_j, r_j], and also not higher than h. If there are no restrictions covering i, then it can be up to h.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true because the restrictions are about the maximum in a range. So, for example, suppose i is covered by multiple ranges. The maximum allowed height is the minimum of all the x_j's for those ranges, but only if that's less than h. Otherwise, it's h.\n\nWait, no. Because each restriction is an independent condition. For example, if two ranges include i, and one requires the maximum in its range to be <=3 and another requires the maximum in its range to be <=5. Then for i, it can be up to min(3,5) =3. But if another restriction covers i with x=2, then i's height is limited to 2.\n\nSo the maximum possible height for each spot i is the minimum of all x_j where the restriction j's range includes i, and also not exceeding h.\n\nIs that correct? Let me think with an example.\n\nIn the first sample input, the first restriction is [1-1] with x=1. So spot 1 can be at most 1. The second restriction is [2-2] x=3, so spot 2 can be 3. Third restriction is [3-3] x=2, so spot 3 can be 2. So the heights are [1,3,2], which aligns with the sample.\n\nAnother example: suppose a spot is covered by two restrictions. Like, one says for [1-3], x=2, and another says [2-4], x=3. Then for spot 2, the maximum is min(2,3) = 2. Similarly, spot 3 is min(2,3) =2. So each spot's height is limited by the minimal x_j across all applicable restrictions.\n\nWait, but what if a spot is covered by multiple overlapping ranges, each with different x_j. So the maximum height for that spot is the minimum of all x_j's that apply to it. Because each restriction imposes a condition that in their specific range, the maximum is not more than x_j.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street with given height restrictions. Each spot can have a house of maximum height `h`, and each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a certain range must not exceed a given height.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Restrictions**: For each spot, the maximum height it can be built is constrained by all the restrictions that include it. The height is determined by the minimum value of all applicable restrictions' heights.\n2. **Determine Maximum Height for Each Spot**: For each spot, compute the maximum allowed height based on the restrictions that cover it. If a spot is not covered by any restriction, its height can be up to `h`.\n3. **Calculate Profit**: Once the maximum allowed heights for each spot are determined, compute the total profit by summing the squares of these heights.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nheights = [0] * (n + 1)  # 1-based indexing\n\n# Initialize all heights to h, then apply restrictions\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    heights[i] = h\n\n# Process each restriction\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n        if x < heights[i]:\n            heights[i] = x\n\n# Compute the profit\nprofit = sum(h * h for h in heights[1:])\n\nprint(profit)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of spots `n`, the maximum height `h`, and the number of restrictions `m`. Each restriction specifies a range `[l, r]` and a maximum height `x` for that range.\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize an array `heights` where each spot starts with the maximum possible height `h`.\n3. **Applying Restrictions**: For each restriction, we iterate over the specified range and update the maximum height for each spot within the range to be the minimum of the current height and the restriction's height.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, we compute the total profit by summing the squares of the heights of all spots.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each restriction and ensures that all constraints are respected, leading to the optimal solution.",
