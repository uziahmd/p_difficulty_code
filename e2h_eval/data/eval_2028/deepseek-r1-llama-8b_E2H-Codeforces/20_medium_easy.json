For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of ways to choose c_s for each binary string s of length from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a beautiful multiset is. From the description, for every binary string s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix should not exceed c_s. Oh right, and the goal is to find how many ways we can choose these c_s values so that the largest possible beautiful multiset has size exactly f.\n\nSo, the approach here is probably to model this as some kind of dynamic programming problem, where we track the state based on the current choices of c_s and the constraints they impose on the multiset size.\n\nWait, but the problem involves all possible binary strings up to length n. That's a lot—2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^(n+1)-2 strings. For n=15, that's 32766, which is manageable, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the problem in terms of the trie structure of binary strings. Each node in the trie represents a certain prefix. The count of the multiset would then be determined by the number of leaves (or internal nodes) selected, but each selection must satisfy the c_s constraints.\n\nHmm, thinking about the trie: each node corresponds to a string s, and the number of times s can appear in the multiset is constrained by c_s. But wait, no, because when you include a string t that is a longer version of s, it contributes to the count for s as well. So it's more like each node's count can't exceed its c_s plus the sum of the counts of all its children.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the count of s itself plus the counts of all its suffixes. Wait, no—because any string that starts with s will contribute to s's count. So if s is a prefix of t, then including t in the multiset increases the count for s.\n\nSo, for each node s in the trie, the total number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is the sum of the counts of s and all its proper prefixes. Wait, no—no, because s is a prefix of t only if t starts with s. So for the multiset, the number of strings that have s as a prefix is the count of s itself plus the counts of all strings that start with s and are longer than s.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a tree where each node s has a certain capacity c_s, and the sum of the capacities of all its descendants (including itself) cannot exceed its c_s. Because when you select a string t that is a descendant of s, it contributes 1 to s's count.\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase. When a string t is present in the multiset, it contributes 1 to the count of every prefix of t. So, for example, if t is '10', then '1' and '10' both have t as a child, so t contributes 1 to the count of '1' and 1 to the count of '10'.\n\nSo, for each string s, the total number of times s appears in the multiset is equal to the number of times any string in the multiset that starts with s. Therefore, for each s, the sum over all t where s is a prefix of t of the count of t in the multiset must be ≤ c_s.\n\nAh, right! So the constraints are that for each s, the sum of counts of all t that are supersets of s (i.e., s is a prefix of t) must be ≤ c_s.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to choosing c_s for all s such that the sum of counts of their supersets is ≤ c_s for each s, and then finding the number of such assignments where the maximum possible size of the multiset is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nI think the key is to model this as a problem where each node s has a certain weight, and the sum of the weights along the path from s to the root must not exceed c_s. Wait, no, because each node s's constraint depends on all its descendants. So it's a hierarchical constraint.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled using inclusion-exclusion or dynamic programming, considering the hierarchy of the trie.\n\nLet me think about it in terms of a trie. Each node s in the trie has a value c_s. The sum of the counts of all nodes in the subtree rooted at s must be ≤ c_s. Because any string in the multiset that is a descendant of s contributes 1 to s's count.\n\nWait, no. Because if a string t is a descendant of s, then t contributes 1 to s's count. So the total count for s is the number of strings in the multiset that are in the subtree of s. So for each s, the sum of the counts of all nodes in the subtree of s must be ≤ c_s.\n\nSo, the constraints are that for each node s, the sum of the counts of all nodes in its subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nNow, the maximum possible size of the multiset is the sum of all counts of the leaf nodes. Because each leaf node is a complete string, and their counts contribute directly to the total size.\n\nSo our goal is to assign c_s values such that for each s, the sum of counts in its subtree is ≤ c_s, and the total sum of counts is exactly f. We need to count the number of such assignments.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the number of ways to choose the c_s such that the maximum possible multiset size is exactly f. So, for each possible assignment of c_s, compute the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset, and count the assignments where that maximum is exactly f.\n\nHmm, but how do we model this? It's a combinatorial optimization problem.\n\nAnother approach: the maximum possible size is determined by the minimal possible c_s constraints. Because for each s, the sum of its subtree counts must be ≤ c_s. To maximize the total size, we need to set each subtree sum as close to c_s as possible, but subject to the constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible size is determined by the minimal possible c_s for each s. Or maybe it's the other way around.\n\nWait, no. Let's think differently. The maximum possible size is the sum of all counts, which is constrained by the c_s values. To find the maximum possible sum, we can model it as a problem where each node's subtree sum is as large as possible given the c_s.\n\nSo the maximum possible size is the sum for each s of min(c_s, sum of c_t for t in the subtree of s). Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible size is determined by the minimum of the c_s along each path from the root to a leaf. Because each node s's subtree includes all its descendants, so the sum for s's subtree is limited by c_s. But the sum is also limited by the c's of the nodes higher up in the hierarchy.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible size is the product of (c_s) for all nodes along some paths. No, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible size is the sum over all s of the minimum c_s and the sum of the c_t for all t in the subtree of s.\n\nNo, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum size is determined by the sum of the c_s minus some overlapping constraints.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to model the maximum possible size as the sum of all c_s, but with the constraints that for each node s, the sum of the subtree counts is ≤ c_s. But that's not correct because the subtree counts include the counts of all nodes under s.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible size is the sum over all s of the minimal c_s along the path from the root to s. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size is the sum of the c_s minus the sum of the c_t for all parents t of s. No, that seems unclear.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum size is determined by the sum of all c_s, but each c_s can't be less than the sum of the c_t for its children. Because each child's sum contributes to the parent's sum.\n\nWait, no. Because each child's sum is the sum of the counts in their subtree. So the parent's sum must be at least the sum of the child's sums. Because the child's subtree is part of the parent's subtree.\n\nWait, but the parent's sum is the sum of its own count plus all child subtree sums. So the sum for the parent's subtree is the parent's count plus the sum of the children's counts.\n\nBut since the parent's count is constrained by c_parent, the sum of the children's counts must be ≤ c_parent - count_parent.\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe we can model the maximum possible size as the sum over all s of the minimal possible c_s, considering the hierarchy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible size is the sum of all c_s minus the sum of the minimal required contributions from the children.\n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum size is the sum of c_s for all s, but each c_s is adjusted downwards by the sum of its children's c_t. Because the children's c_t determines how much they contribute to their parent.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Let's try to think differently.\n\nEach node s in the trie has a subtree consisting of s and all its descendants. The sum of counts of the multiset for the subtree of s is S(s). The constraint is that S(s) ≤ c_s.\n\nThe total size of the multiset is the sum of all counts, which is S(root), since the root's subtree is everything.\n\nSo, the maximum possible size is S(root) = sum of all counts. But S(root) is constrained by c_root. But S(root) is the sum of the counts of all nodes, which is also equal to the sum of S(s) for all s, since each S(s) is the sum for the subtree of s, and the root's S is the sum of all S(s).\n\nWait, no. Actually, S(s) is the sum of counts of all nodes in the subtree of s. So the root's S is the sum of all counts, which is the total size of the multiset. For any other node s, S(s) is the sum of counts of s and all its descendants. So, the root's S is the sum of S(s) for all s.\n\nBut for each s, S(s) ≤ c_s.\n\nSo, the maximum possible size is the sum of S(s) for all s, where S(s) is the sum of counts of the subtree of s. But each S(s) is bounded by c_s.\n\nBut how do these constraints interact?\n\nWait, for example, consider a chain of nodes s_0 (root), s_1, s_2, ..., s_m, where each is a prefix of the next. Then, S(s_i) is the sum of counts for s_i and all its descendants. Since s_i is a prefix of s_{i+1}, the counts of s_{i+1} and all its descendants are included in S(s_i).\n\nSo, for this chain, the constraints are:\n\nS(s_0) ≤ c_0\n\nS(s_1) ≤ c_1\n\n...\n\nS(s_m) ≤ c_m\n\nBut S(s_0) is S(s_1) + count(s_0)\n\nBecause S(s_0) is the sum of s_0's count and all its descendants, which include s_1's subtree.\n\nSimilarly, S(s_1) is the sum of s_1's count plus s_2's subtree.\n\nSo, for the chain s_0 → s_1 → ... → s_m, the constraints are:\n\ncount(s_0) + S(s_1) ≤ c_0\n\nS(s_1) ≤ c_1\n\n...\n\nS(s_m) ≤ c_m\n\nBut count(s_0) is a non-negative integer. So the first constraint becomes:\n\ncount(s_0) ≤ c_0 - S(s_1)\n\nBut S(s_1) is already ≤ c_1, so c_0 - S(s_1) ≥ c_0 - c_1.\n\nWait, but this can be rewritten as S(s_1) ≤ c_1 and S(s_1) ≤ c_0 - count(s_0).\n\nBut I'm not sure how this helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible size is determined by the minimal c_s along the path from the root to the deepest node in each path. Because each step down the trie adds a layer of constraints.\n\nWait, maybe for each node s, the maximum contribution it can have is the minimal c_t along the path from the root to s.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible size is the sum over all nodes s of the minimal c_t in the path from the root to s.\n\nNo, that doesn't sound right. Let's take the example given in the problem statement.\n\nIn the example, the c values are:\n\nc_0=3, c_00=1, c_01=2, c_1=1, c_10=2, c_11=3.\n\nThe multiset is {11,01,00,01}.\n\nSo, for the root '0', the sum is 3, which equals c_0.\n\nFor '00', the sum is 1 (only '00' in the multiset).\n\nFor '01', the sum is 2 (the two '01's).\n\nFor '1', the sum is 1.\n\nFor '10', sum is 0.\n\nFor '11', sum is 1.\n\nSo the total size is 3 (from root's sum) which is 1 (for '00') + 2 ('01's) + 1 ('1') + 1 ('11') = 5? Wait, no, in the example, the total size is 4: {11,01,00,01}. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, the example says that the multiset is {11, 01, 00, 01}, which has size 4.\n\nBut according to the explanation, the sum for each s is:\n\ns=0: 3 strings (00, 01, 11?), but wait, no, the multiset is {11,01,00,01}, so the count for s=0 is the number of strings that start with 0. Those are 00, 01, etc. Wait, how many strings in the multiset start with 0? Let's see: 00 starts with 0, 01 starts with 0, 01 starts with 0. So three strings. So c_0 is 3, which is satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, for s=00, the multiset has one string that starts with 00 (just 00), so c_00=1 is satisfied.\n\nFor s=01, the multiset has two strings that start with 01: the two 01s. So c_01=2 is satisfied.\n\nFor s=1, the multiset has one string that starts with 1: 11. So c_1=1 is satisfied.\n\nFor s=10, zero strings start with 10, so c_10=2 is satisfied.\n\nFor s=11, one string starts with 11: 11, so c_11=3 is satisfied.\n\nSo the total multiset size is 4.\n\nHmm, okay. So the maximum size is determined by the sum of the counts, which must satisfy all the constraints S(s) ≤ c_s for each s.\n\nSo, how do we model this to find the number of ways to choose c_s such that the maximum size is exactly f.\n\nWait, the problem is to find the number of assignments of c_s that allow a beautiful multiset of size exactly f, and no larger. Because the maximum possible size is f.\n\nSo, for each assignment of c_s, we can compute the maximum possible size m. We need to count the assignments where m = f.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Enumerate all possible assignments of c_s (each c_s can be between 0 and k, inclusive).\n\n- For each assignment, compute the maximum possible m.\n\n- Count the number of assignments where m equals f.\n\nBut for n up to 15, the number of possible assignments is (k+1)^(number of strings). For n=15, the number of strings is 2^15 -1 = 32767. So even for k=2e5, (2e5+1)^3e4 is way too big. So this brute force approach is impossible.\n\nThus, we need a smarter way to model this.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the constraints.\n\nEach c_s must be at least the sum of the counts of all its children. Because the sum of the counts of the children is the sum of their subtree counts, which is added to the parent's count to get the parent's subtree sum. So for the parent s, the sum of its subtree is count(s) + sum of children's counts.\n\nBut since the parent's subtree sum must be ≤ c_s, and the children's counts are part of their own subtree sums, which must be ≤ c_child.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible sum is determined by the sum of all c_s, but with the constraints that for each node s, c_s must be ≥ the sum of the c_t for all children t of s.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the sum of the counts of the children is the sum of their subtree counts, which must be ≤ c_t for each child. So the sum of the children's counts is ≤ sum(c_t) for t in children(s). But also, the parent's subtree sum is count(s) + sum(children's counts). This must be ≤ c_s.\n\nBut count(s) is a non-negative integer, so the maximum possible sum for the parent's subtree is c_s.\n\nWait, but the sum of the children's counts could be up to sum(c_t), and the parent's count can be up to c_s - sum(children's counts). So the total sum for the parent's subtree is count(s) + sum_children = s_count + sum_c_children ≤ c_s.\n\nBut s_count can be up to (c_s - sum_c_children). So the maximum possible sum for the parent's subtree is c_s - sum_c_children + sum_c_children = c_s.\n\nWait, but that's always true. So the constraints are automatically satisfied as long as for each s, the sum of the children's c_t is ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because the sum of the children's counts is the sum of their subtree counts, which is ≤ sum(c_t) for each child. But the parent's count can be anything as long as the sum of the parent's count plus the sum of children's counts is ≤ c_s.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum possible sum is the sum of c_s for all s, but with the condition that for each s, the sum of the c_t of its children is ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum of the children's counts is the sum of their subtree counts, which is bounded by their c_t. So the sum of the children's subtree counts is ≤ sum(c_t for t in children(s)).\n\nBut the parent's subtree sum is count(s) + sum(children's counts), which must be ≤ c_s.\n\nBut count(s) can be up to (c_s - sum(children's counts)). So the maximum possible sum for the parent's subtree is c_s.\n\nWait, but the sum of the children's counts is ≤ sum(c_t) for each t. So the sum for the parent's subtree is count(s) + sum(children's counts) ≤ c_s.\n\nBut count(s) can be up to (c_s - sum_children_counts). So the maximum possible sum for the parent's subtree is c_s.\n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum possible sum is the sum of all c_s, but with the constraints that for each s, sum(c_t for t in children(s)) ≤ c_s.\n\nBecause the sum of the children's counts can't exceed the sum of their c_t, and the parent's count can't exceed c_s minus that sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible sum is the sum of all c_s minus the sum of the c_s for each s and its children.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to formalize this.\n\nThe maximum possible size is the sum of all counts in the multiset, which is equal to the sum of all S(s), where S(s) is the sum of counts in the subtree of s.\n\nEach S(s) must be ≤ c_s.\n\nBut for any s, S(s) = count(s) + sum(S(t) for t in children(s)).\n\nSince S(t) ≤ c_t for each t, sum(S(t)) ≤ sum(c_t for t in children(s)).\n\nSo S(s) = count(s) + sum(S(t)) ≤ count(s) + sum(c_t).\n\nBut S(s) must be ≤ c_s, so count(s) + sum(S(t)) ≤ c_s.\n\nBut count(s) can be as high as c_s - sum(S(t)), but since S(t) is at least zero, the maximum possible count(s) is c_s.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find the maximum possible sum of counts. How does this relate to the c_s values?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum over all s of the minimum between c_s and the sum of c_t for t in the subtree of s.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of all c_s, but for each node s, the sum of c_t for t in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the subtree of s includes s and all its descendants. So the sum of the c_t for the subtree of s would be sum(c_t for t in subtree of s). If that sum is ≤ c_s, then the maximum sum for the subtree is c_s.\n\nBut that's not necessarily the case because the sum of c_t for the subtree could be larger than c_s, but the constraint is that the sum of counts for the subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of all c_s, but with the condition that for each s, the sum of the c_t for t in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. For example, in the sample input, the sum of c_s for all s is 3 +1 +2 +1 +2 +3 = 12. But the maximum sum is 4, which is much less than 12.\n\nSo that idea is wrong.\n\nAnother approach: The maximum sum is the sum of all c_s minus the sum of the minimal required constraints. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is determined by the sum of c_s for all s, but with the condition that for each s, the sum of c_t for t in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the sum of c_t for the root's subtree is 3 +1 +2 +1 +2 +3 = 12. But the maximum sum is 4. So the condition isn't met, which suggests that the sum of c_t for the root's subtree is 12 > c_root=3, which violates the constraint.\n\nSo, to compute the maximum sum, perhaps the sum must satisfy that for each s, the sum of c_t for t in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the sum of c_t for the subtree of s is the sum of all the constraints for the subtree. So, for the root, the sum of all c_t must be ≤ c_root.\n\nSimilarly, for any node s, the sum of c_t in its subtree must be ≤ c_s.\n\nIf that's the case, then the maximum sum is the sum of all c_t, but the sum of all c_t must be ≤ c_root, and for each s, the sum of c_t in the subtree of s must be ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, but that's a stricter condition than just S(s) ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, because S(s) is the sum of counts of the subtree of s, which is ≤ c_s. But the sum of c_t in the subtree is another variable. So perhaps I'm mixing up S(s) and the sum of c_t.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a way to model the problem differently.\n\nLet me think of the problem as a tree where each node s has a value c_s. The constraints are that for each s, the sum of counts in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s.\n\nWe want to maximize the total sum of counts, which is the sum of all counts across all leaves (since each leaf is a complete string, and their counts contribute directly to the total).\n\nWait, no. The total sum is the sum of all counts in the multiset, which is the same as the sum of S(s) for all s, since each S(s) is the sum of counts for the subtree of s, and the root's S is the total sum.\n\nSo, the maximum possible sum is the maximum possible total S(s) across all s, subject to S(s) ≤ c_s for each s.\n\nBut how?\n\nEach S(s) is the sum of counts in the subtree of s. So, the counts for each node can be written as x_s, and the constraints are x_s + sum(x_t for t in children(s)) ≤ c_s.\n\nWe want to maximize the sum of all x_s.\n\nWait, but x_s is the count for node s. So, for each node s, x_s + sum(x_t for t in children(s)) ≤ c_s.\n\nAnd the objective is to maximize the sum of all x_s.\n\nThis looks like a linear programming problem, but since x_s are integers, it's an integer linear programming problem.\n\nBut given the constraints of the problem, perhaps we can find a way to model this as a dynamic programming problem on the trie.\n\nWait, but the trie can be represented in a way that allows us to process each node in order of increasing depth, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into choosing the x_s such that for each node s, x_s is as large as possible given the constraints.\n\nWait, but the x_s can vary, and the problem is to choose the c_s such that the maximum sum is f.\n\nBut the problem requires us to count the number of c_s assignments where the maximum sum is exactly f.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is determined by the sum of the c_s, but with the constraints that for each s, the sum of c_t in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, let's think about this.\n\nIf for each s, the sum of c_t in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s, then the sum of all c_t is equal to the sum of all x_s, which is the maximum possible sum.\n\nBut in the sample, the sum of c_t is 3+1+2+1+2+3=12. The maximum sum is 4, which is much less than 12. So this suggests that the sum of c_t is not directly the maximum sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of the c_s minus the sum of the minimal required amounts. Or perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of the c_s minus the sum of the constraints that the sum of the subtree c_t is ≤ c_s.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck.\n\nLet me try to model this as a system of equations.\n\nFor each node s, the constraint is x_s + sum(x_t for t in children(s)) ≤ c_s.\n\nWe can rewrite this as x_s ≤ c_s - sum(x_t for t in children(s)).\n\nBut since x_s must be non-negative, the maximum possible x_s is min(c_s, c_s - sum_children_x).\n\nWait, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum x_s is c_s minus the sum of x_t of the children, but x_t must be ≤ c_t.\n\nWait, but the children's x_t can vary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum x_s is the minimum of c_s and the sum of the x_t for the children.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum x_s is the minimum of c_s and the sum of the x_t for the children. Because the sum of x_t for the children is the amount that must be subtracted from c_s to determine x_s.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible x_s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the x_t for the children.\n\nWait, but in the sample, for node '0', the sum of x_t for the children is x_00 + x_01 + x_10 + x_11. So x_0 can be up to c_0 - (x_00 + x_01 + x_10 + x_11). But since all the x_t must be non-negative, the maximum x_0 is c_0.\n\nWait, but that's not the case because in the sample, x_0 is 0, which is allowed because the sum of x_t for the children is 4, so x_0 can be up to 3-4 = -1, but since x_s can't be negative, x_0 is set to 0.\n\nSo, the maximum sum is 4, which is the sum of the x_t for the children of the root.\n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of the x_t for the leaves.\n\nWait, in the sample, the leaves are '00', '01', '10', '11'. Their x_t are 1, 2, 0, 1. Sum is 4.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of the x_t for all leaves.\n\nBut that's because, for the root node, the sum of x_t for the children is the sum of all x_t for leaves. So, the maximum sum is constrained by the root's c_0.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the sum of x_t for the children is 4, which is ≤ c_0=3. So, x_0 is set to 0 to allow the sum of the children to be 4.\n\nWait, but that would imply that x_0 can be as high as 3, but that would require the sum of children's x_t to be ≤ 0, which isn't possible because the sum is 4.\n\nSo, the maximum sum is the sum of x_t for leaves, which can't exceed the sum of c_t for the leaves and their ancestors.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of x_t for all nodes, which is equal to the sum of x_t for leaves plus the sum of x_s for internal nodes.\n\nBut the internal nodes' x_s is zero because the sum of their children's x_t exceeds their c_s, forcing x_s to be zero.\n\nSo, in the sample, x_0 is zero, x_00 is 1, x_01 is 2, x_10 is 0, x_11 is 1. Sum is 4.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of x_t for all leaves, and the rest x_s are zero.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to choosing c_s such that for each node s, the sum of x_t for the leaves in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because for each node s, the sum of x_t for all nodes in the subtree of s is x_s + sum(x_t for children of s). And this sum must be ≤ c_s.\n\nBut if s is an internal node, then its x_s must be zero because otherwise, the sum would be x_s plus sum_children_x, which could exceed c_s.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is indeed the sum of the x_t for the leaves, and all internal nodes have x_s = 0. Because, for any internal node s, the sum of x_t for its subtree is sum_children_x + x_s. But x_s can be at most c_s - sum_children_x. However, if sum_children_x + x_s must be ≤ c_s, and x_s is non-negative, then x_s can be as high as c_s. But if sum_children_x is larger than c_s, then x_s must be zero.\n\nSo, for the internal nodes, x_s can be zero or up to c_s - sum_children_x.\n\nBut for the maximum sum, perhaps setting x_s to zero whenever sum_children_x > c_s.\n\nWait, but the sum of x_t for the leaves is the same regardless of the x_s for internal nodes. Because x_s affects the sum of their own subtree, but the leaves' x_t are independent.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of x_t for all leaves, and the constraints are that for each node s, the sum of x_t for the leaves in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s.\n\nYes! That makes sense.\n\nBecause for any node s, the sum of x_t for the leaves in its subtree must be ≤ c_s.\n\nBecause the sum of x_t for the leaves in the subtree of s is exactly the sum of the counts for those leaves, which is the number of times they appear in the multiset.\n\nWait, but for node s, the sum of the x_t for the leaves in its subtree is the sum of the counts for those leaves, which is the sum of the counts of all leaves that are in the subtree of s.\n\nWhich is exactly the number of leaves in the subtree of s that are present in the multiset. So, this sum must be ≤ c_s.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to selecting c_s for each node s such that for each s, the sum of x_t for the leaves in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s, and the sum of x_t for all leaves is f.\n\nAnd we need to count the number of ways to choose c_s such that the maximum possible sum is exactly f.\n\nWait, but the sum of x_t for all leaves is f. So, the problem is to count the number of ways to choose c_s such that for each s, the sum of x_t for the leaves in s's subtree is ≤ c_s, and the sum of x_t for all leaves is exactly f.\n\nBut how do the c_s relate to each other?\n\nWell, for each node s, the sum of the leaves in its subtree is the sum of x_t for those leaves. This sum must be ≤ c_s.\n\nAdditionally, for any ancestor t of s, the sum of x_t's leaves is a subset of s's leaves, so the sum for t's leaves is ≤ sum for s's leaves. Therefore, for the root, the sum of x_t's leaves is the total sum, which is f.\n\nSo, for the root, f must be ≤ c_root.\n\nFor each node s, the sum of x_t's leaves in s's subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nMoreover, for any node s, the sum of x_t's leaves in s's subtree can be at most the sum for the root.\n\nSo, the constraints are that for each s, the sum of x_t's leaves in s's subtree is ≤ c_s, and the sum of all x_t's leaves is f.\n\nSo, the problem is now to find the number of c_s assignments where:\n\n1. For each s, the sum of x_t's leaves in s's subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\n2. The sum of x_t's leaves across all leaves is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we model this for counting the number of valid c_s assignments?\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the sum of x_t's leaves in s's subtree is exactly the sum of the x_t's for the leaves in s's subtree. Let's denote this sum as m(s).\n\nThen, for each s, m(s) ≤ c_s.\n\nThe sum of m(s) for all s is equal to the sum of x_t's for all leaves, which is f.\n\nWait, no. Because m(s) is the sum of x_t's for the leaves in s's subtree, and the sum of m(s) for all s is the sum of x_t's for all leaves multiplied by the number of times they appear in various m(s). For example, a leaf l is counted in m(s) for all s that are its ancestors. So the sum of m(s) for all s is equal to the sum of x_l * (depth(l)+1), where depth(l) is the length of the string l.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nEach leaf l is a binary string of length d. It is in the subtree of all its ancestors s, which are the prefixes of l. So the number of times l is counted in the sum of m(s) for all s is equal to the number of prefixes of l, which is d+1.\n\nWait, no. The prefixes of l are l itself, and all shorter strings that start with the same characters as l. For example, if l is '010', its prefixes are '0', '01', '010'. So the number of prefixes is the length of l.\n\nWait, no. The number of prefixes of a string of length d is d. So, the sum of m(s) over all s is equal to the sum of x_l * (d), where d is the length of l.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because each m(s) is the sum of x_l for all leaves in s's subtree. So, the sum of m(s) for all s is the sum over all s of sum_{l ∈ subtree(s)} x_l.\n\nBut each x_l is included in m(s) for all s that are prefixes of l. So the total sum is the sum_{l} x_l * (number of s where s is a prefix of l).\n\nThe number of s that are prefixes of l is equal to the length of l, since l has length d, and has d prefixes (",
