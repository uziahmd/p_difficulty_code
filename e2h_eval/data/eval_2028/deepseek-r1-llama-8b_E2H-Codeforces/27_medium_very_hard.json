On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"A Twisty Movement\" and involves sequences of numbers. Hmm.\n\nSo, the problem statement says that Tommy wants to choose an interval [l, r] in the sequence and reverse the subarray from l to r. After doing this, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the new sequence.\n\nWait, right. The original sequence consists of 1s and 2s because each ai is either 1 or 2. So the initial array is made up of just these two numbers.\n\nThe task is to find the best reversal such that when you reverse a certain subarray, the LNDS is as long as possible.\n\nHmm. Okay, let's think about how to approach this. Since n is up to 2000, which isn't too big, but trying all possible intervals [l, r] would be O(n^2) possibilities. For each interval, we'd have to compute the LNDS of the modified array. But computing LNDS for each modified array might be expensive if done naively.\n\nWhat's the standard way to compute the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence? Oh right, it's O(n log n) using a patience sorting-like algorithm. But if we have to do this for every possible reversed subarray, that's going to be O(n^3 log n), which for n=2000 would be 2000^3 * something, which is way too big—like 8e10 operations. That's definitely not feasible.\n\nSo, we need a smarter approach. Let's think about the structure of the problem.\n\nGiven that the array consists only of 1s and 2s, perhaps there's some pattern or property we can exploit.\n\nWait, after reversing a subarray, the LNDS will depend on how the 1s and 2s are arranged. The LNDS is maximized when we have as many consecutive 1s followed by 2s as possible. Because in a non-decreasing sequence, all 1s come first, then 2s.\n\nSo, maybe the optimal reversal is one that groups all 1s together and 2s together. Or perhaps not necessarily all, but as much as possible.\n\nLet me think: the LNDS without any reversal is just the count of 1s plus the count of 2s after the last 1. Wait no, because in a non-decreasing sequence, all the 1s come before the 2s. So the LNDS is simply the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that appear after the last 1. Or wait, no—if the 2s are all after the 1s, then the total is count_1 + count_2. If not, it's less.\n\nWait, no. For example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 4 because the order is 1,2,2. So it's possible to have a longer sequence by choosing a subsequence that skips some elements.\n\nBut in our case, since the entire array is reversed, perhaps the best scenario is that the reversed array has all the 1s first, followed by all the 2s. Because then the LNDS would be n, which is the maximum possible.\n\nSo, the key is to find a reversal that turns the array into a non-decreasing one. Because then the LNDS is n. But wait, can any reversal make the array non-decreasing?\n\nWait, the original array is made up of 1s and 2s. So a non-decreasing array would have all 1s first, followed by 2s. So the entire array must be a run of 1s followed by a run of 2s.\n\nIf that's the case, then the LNDS is n.\n\nBut whether such a reversal exists depends on the original array.\n\nWait, for example, in the first sample input:\n\nOriginal array is [1,2,1,2]. Reversing [2,3] gives [1,1,2,2], which is non-decreasing. So the LNDS is 4.\n\nIn the second sample, after reversing [3,7], the array becomes [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1], which is not non-decreasing because the last element is 1. So the LNDS isn't 10, but 9.\n\nSo sometimes, the best we can do is not achieve n, but get close.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the strategy is to find the reversal that, when applied, creates the longest possible prefix of 1s followed by 2s. Then the LNDS is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s after the last 1.\n\nWait, but in the reversed array, the 1s and 2s can be arranged in any way, not necessarily contiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal LNDS after reversal is equal to the maximum between the number of 1s plus the number of 2s after some point, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: for each possible interval [l, r], reverse it and compute the LNDS. But with n=2000, trying all O(n^2) intervals is 4 million possibilities. For each, computing LNDS in O(n) time would be manageable if we can find a way.\n\nWait, but the LNDS computation for a given array can be done in O(n) time? No, that's not possible. The standard method is O(n log n). So for 4 million arrays, each with n=2000, that's 4e6 * 2e3 log 2e3 ≈ 4e6 * 2e3 * 11 ≈ 8.8e10 operations. That's way too much.\n\nSo that approach won't work.\n\nWe need a smarter way to find, for each possible reversal, what's the maximum possible LNDS.\n\nAlternative idea: precompute for all possible intervals [l, r], what the LNDS would be after reversing [l, r]. But again, the problem is efficiently computing this.\n\nWait, but since the array consists of only 1s and 2s, perhaps the LNDS can be computed more cleverly.\n\nAnother observation: the LNDS is the maximum k such that there exists a partition of the array into a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_k.\n\nBut since the array is made of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s in a prefix plus the maximum number of 2s in the suffix. Wait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps something similar.\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s up to some index i plus the maximum number of 2s from some index j onwards, where j > i.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think of an example.\n\nTake the array [1,2,1,2]. The LNDS is 4. The counts of 1s up to index 0 (first 1) are 1, and the counts of 2s from index 2 onwards are 2. So 1+2=3, but the actual LNDS is 4. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm thinking about it wrong. Let's think about the LNDS as the maximum number of 1s that can be taken from the beginning, and the maximum number of 2s that can be taken from the end, such that the positions are increasing.\n\nWait, for the array [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 4. So how does that break down? It's taking the first 1, then the second 2, then the third 2. Wait, but that's not a non-decreasing subsequence. Oh wait, no. Because the first 1 is at position 0, the next 2 is at position 1, and then the 2 at position 3. So the subsequence is 1,2,2, which is length 3. But the array after reversal is [1,1,2,2], whose LNDS is 4.\n\nAh, right. So the key is that the reversed array may change the structure.\n\nSo, for each possible reversal, the LNDS could be improved.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find for each possible reversal, the maximum number of 1s that can be taken from the left, followed by 2s from the right, but within the reversed subarray.\n\nWait, maybe another way: when you reverse a subarray, you can affect the ordering of 1s and 2s. The goal is to arrange them such that as many 1s as possible come before 2s.\n\nBut how to model that.\n\nAlternative approach: for each possible reversal of [l, r], compute the maximum possible LNDS as follows:\n\nThe LNDS is the maximum number of 1s in a prefix, plus the maximum number of 2s in a suffix, such that all 1s are before 2s.\n\nBut how to compute this for each reversal.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible reversal, the LNDS is the maximum of:\n\n- the number of 1s in the entire array (if all 1s are already in a prefix, but that's not always the case).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the best possible arrangement after reversal.\n\nWhen you reverse a subarray [l, r], the new array is the same as the original except that the subarray is reversed.\n\nSo, for each [l, r], the new array is:\n\na[0..l-2] + reversed(a[l-1..r]) + a[r+1..n-1]\n\nWait, assuming 0-based indices.\n\nThen, the LNDS of this new array is the maximum possible.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAn alternative idea is to precompute for all possible l and r, the effect of reversing [l, r] on the positions of 1s and 2s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe think about the impact of reversing a subarray on the array's structure.\n\nFor example, if the reversed subarray has a lot of 1s, then those 1s might now come after some 2s in the original array, which could reduce the LNDS. But if the reversed subarray has a lot of 2s, they might come before some 1s, which could increase the LNDS.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best reversal is one that brings as many 1s as possible to the left and 2s to the right.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible interval [l, r], we can compute how many 1s are in the reversed subarray, and how many 2s are outside the reversed subarray but appear after the reversed subarray.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal LNDS after reversal is the sum of:\n\n- the number of 1s in the part before l, plus the number of 1s in the reversed subarray that are now before any 2s, plus the number of 2s in the reversed subarray that are after any 1s, plus the number of 2s in the part after r.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle: the LNDS can be thought of as the maximum number of 1s that can be taken from the left, followed by the maximum number of 2s that can be taken from the right, ensuring that the 2s start after the 1s.\n\nBut when you reverse a subarray, you can change the order of elements. So for each [l, r], the new array may allow more 1s to be on the left and more 2s on the right.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible l and r, we can compute the maximum number of 1s in the prefix up to some point, and the maximum number of 2s in the suffix starting from some later point, within the context of the reversed subarray.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible reversal, the LNDS is the maximum possible by considering the following:\n\nAfter reversal, the array is divided into three parts:\n\n1. Before l: same as original.\n2. Reversed subarray from l to r.\n3. After r: same as original.\n\nThe LNDS could consist of some 1s from the first part, some 1s and 2s from the reversed subarray, and some 2s from the third part.\n\nWait, but the LNDS has to be non-decreasing. So, the 1s in the first part, then the 1s and 2s in the reversed subarray that form a non-decreasing sequence, and then the 2s in the third part.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: for each possible l and r, the reversed subarray may contain some 1s and 2s. When reversed, their order is flipped. So, for the LNDS, the best is to take all the 1s in the reversed subarray that come before any 2s in the reversed subarray, and then add the 1s before l and the 2s after r.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nThe LNDS after reversal could be:\n\nnumber_of_1s_before_l + number_of_1s_in_reversed_subarray + number_of_2s_after_r + min(number_of_2s_in_reversed_subarray, number_of_1s_in_reversed_subarray + number_of_1s_before_l)\n\nNo, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS after reversal is the maximum of:\n\n- (number of 1s in the first part) + (number of 1s in the reversed subarray that are placed before any 2s in the reversed subarray) + (number of 2s in the reversed subarray that are placed after the 1s in the reversed subarray) + (number of 2s in the third part).\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nPerhaps another angle: the LNDS after reversal is determined by how the 1s and 2s are positioned. The maximum LNDS would be when the 1s are as much to the left as possible and the 2s as much to the right as possible.\n\nSo, perhaps for each possible l and r, the maximum possible contribution to the LNDS from the reversed subarray is the number of 1s in the reversed subarray plus the number of 2s in the reversed subarray. But that's only possible if the reversed subarray itself is non-decreasing.\n\nWait, because if the reversed subarray is entirely 1s followed by 2s, then the LNDS for that part is the sum of its own 1s and 2s. But if the reversed subarray has 2s followed by 1s, then the LNDS for that part is the maximum of 1s or 2s.\n\nHmm, perhaps not.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum LNDS after reversal is the maximum over all possible partitions of the array into three parts: prefix, reversed middle, suffix. The LNDS would be the sum of the 1s in the prefix, plus the 1s and 2s in the reversed middle that form a non-decreasing sequence, plus the 2s in the suffix.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum LNDS after reversal is:\n\nmax( (prefix_ones) + (reversed_middle_ones_and_twos) + (suffix_twos) )\n\nBut the reversed_middle_ones_and_twos must form a non-decreasing sequence themselves.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the reversed middle can contribute a longer sequence than that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LNDS is the sum of the 1s in the prefix, the 1s in the reversed middle, and the 2s in the suffix, but only if the 1s in the prefix are before the 1s in the reversed middle, which are before the 2s in the suffix.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the LNDS as the sum of:\n\n- the number of 1s in the prefix before l,\n- the number of 1s in the reversed middle,\n- the number of 2s in the suffix after r.\n\nBut also, we can include some 2s from the reversed middle that come after the 1s.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum LNDS after reversing [l, r] is:\n\nprefix_ones(l) + min(reversed_ones(r-l+1), reversed_twos(r-l+1)) + suffix_twos(r).\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal LNDS after reversing [l, r] is:\n\nthe maximum between:\n\n- the original LNDS (without any reversal),\n- the maximum possible when we take all 1s before l, plus all 1s in the reversed subarray, plus all 2s in the reversed subarray that are after the 1s in the reversed subarray, plus all 2s after r.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSince the array consists of 1s and 2s, perhaps the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s that can be taken from the left, followed by 2s that can be taken from the right.\n\nSo, for each possible reversal, the maximum LNDS is:\n\nmax over k (number of 1s up to position k) + max over m (number of 2s from position m to end), where k < m.\n\nBut wait, after the reversal, the relative positions of elements may change.\n\nWait, no. The reversal affects the positions of elements in [l, r], but the elements outside remain as they are.\n\nSo, for a given reversal [l, r], the new array is A' = A[0..l-1] + reversed(A[l..r]) + A[r+1..n-1].\n\nWe need to compute the LNDS of A'.\n\nBut computing this directly is O(n^3 log n), which is too slow.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find a way to model the effect of reversing a subarray on the LNDS without explicitly computing it for each possible [l, r].\n\nAnother idea: the LNDS of A' can be broken into segments. The best possible LNDS is the maximum of:\n\n- the LNDS of the original array,\n\n- the LNDS formed by taking all 1s from the beginning of the array up to some point, then all 1s and 2s from the reversed subarray, then all 2s from the end of the array.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum LNDS after any reversal is the maximum of:\n\n1. The original LNDS.\n\n2. For each possible l and r, the sum of the number of 1s in the prefix up to l, plus the number of 1s in the reversed subarray, plus the number of 2s in the suffix beyond r.\n\nWait, but that might not capture all cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum LNDS after reversal is the maximum of:\n\nthe number of 1s in the entire array (if possible) or the maximum possible when the 1s are all grouped in a prefix and the 2s in a suffix.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum number of 1s in a prefix, plus the maximum number of 2s in a suffix, where the suffix starts after the prefix ends.\n\nBut in this case, the reversal allows us to reorder a subarray to bring more 1s to the front or more 2s to the back.\n\nHmm, maybe that's the way to go.\n\nSo, for each possible [l, r], the reversal can potentially allow us to have more 1s in the prefix and more 2s in the suffix.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, let's define for each position i, the number of 1s in the prefix up to i, and for each position j, the number of 2s in the suffix starting at j.\n\nThen, the maximum LNDS after reversal is the maximum value of (prefix_ones[i] + suffix_twos[j]) where j > i.\n\nBut how does the reversal affect this.\n\nBecause when you reverse a subarray [l, r], it changes the positions of elements in that subarray. So, for any i < l, the prefix_ones remains as before. For i >= l, the prefix_ones may change depending on whether the element was a 1 or 2 in the original array and its new position.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: for each possible interval [l, r], compute the maximum possible prefix_ones and suffix_twos that can be achieved after reversing [l, r].\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal reversal is such that the reversed subarray contributes as many 1s as possible to the prefix and as many 2s as possible to the suffix.\n\nSo, for each [l, r], the prefix_ones becomes the number of 1s in A[0..l-1] plus the number of 1s in the reversed subarray [l..r]. Similarly, the suffix_twos becomes the number of 2s in the reversed subarray that are after the 1s in the reversed subarray plus the number of 2s in A[r+1..n-1].\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each [l, r], the reversed subarray's contribution is the maximum between the number of 1s in the reversed subarray and the number of 2s. So, if the reversed subarray has x 1s and y 2s, then the maximum contribution is x + y if all 1s are before 2s. Otherwise, it's min(x, y) + the rest.\n\nWait, no. Because in the reversed subarray, the 1s and 2s could be arranged in any order. So, the maximum possible contribution is the maximum of (x, y) plus the minimum of x and y. Because, if you can arrange the reversed subarray to have all 1s first, then 2s, then the contribution is x + y. Otherwise, it's the maximum of x and y.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because even if x > y, the maximum possible contribution is y + x. Because you can arrange all 1s first, then 2s.\n\nWait, no, that's only possible if the reversed subarray allows it. For example, if the reversed subarray has 3 1s and 2 2s, then yes, you can arrange them as 1s followed by 2s. So the contribution is 5.\n\nBut if the reversed subarray has 2 1s and 3 2s, the maximum contribution is 2+3=5.\n\nWait, so regardless of the original order, after reversal, you can arrange the subarray in such a way that all 1s come first, followed by all 2s. So, the contribution from the reversed subarray is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s in it.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nYes, because you can choose to reverse the subarray in a way that the 1s come first. So, for the purpose of maximizing the LNDS, you can treat the reversed subarray as contributing x + y 1s and 2s.\n\nSo, for each possible [l, r], the maximum possible contribution to the LNDS is:\n\nprefix_ones(l) + (number of 1s in [l..r]) + (number of 2s in [l..r]) + suffix_twos(r).\n\nWait, but the prefix_ones(l) is the number of 1s before l, including l? Or not including l? Hmm, need to clarify.\n\nWait, let's define:\n\nprefix_ones[i] = number of 1s in A[0..i-1].\n\nSimilarly, suffix_twos[j] = number of 2s in A[j..n-1].\n\nSo, for a reversal of [l, r], the new array's LNDS is the maximum of:\n\nprefix_ones[l] + (number of 1s in [l..r]) + (number of 2s in [l..r]) + suffix_twos[r+1].\n\nWait, because the reversed subarray can contribute all its 1s and 2s as a non-decreasing sequence, and the prefix and suffix can be connected to it.\n\nBut wait, the prefix_ones[l] is the 1s before l, which are fixed. The reversed subarray contributes all its 1s and 2s as a single non-decreasing segment, and the suffix_twos[r+1] is the 2s after r.\n\nSo, the total would be prefix_ones[l] + (x + y) + suffix_twos[r+1], where x is the number of 1s in [l..r], y is the number of 2s.\n\nBut is this always possible? Like, can the reversed subarray's 1s and 2s be arranged in such a way that they form a non-decreasing sequence?\n\nYes, because you can reverse the subarray so that all 1s come first, followed by 2s. Or, if the original subarray had 2s followed by 1s, reversing it makes them 1s followed by 2s.\n\nSo, the maximum possible contribution from [l..r] is indeed x + y.\n\nThus, the total LNDS after reversing [l..r] is prefix_ones[l] + x + y + suffix_twos[r+1].\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute prefix_ones and suffix_twos arrays.\n\n2. For each possible [l..r], compute x (number of 1s in [l..r]) and y (number of 2s in [l..r]).\n\n3. Compute the potential LNDS as prefix_ones[l] + x + y + suffix_twos[r+1].\n\n4. Find the maximum of all these values, along with the original LNDS.\n\nThat's a manageable approach because for each [l..r], it's O(1) to compute x and y, and then compute the potential.\n\nNow, the steps:\n\nCompute prefix_ones: for each i, prefix_ones[i] is the number of 1s in A[0..i-1].\n\nSimilarly, compute suffix_twos: for each j, suffix_twos[j] is the number of 2s in A[j..n-1].\n\nOnce these are precomputed, for each l and r, compute x = (number of 1s in A[l..r]), y = (number of 2s in A[l..r]).\n\nThen, the potential is prefix_ones[l] + x + y + suffix_twos[r+1].\n\nWe need to find the maximum of this value across all l and r, and compare it with the original LNDS.\n\nWait, but why do we add prefix_ones[l]? Because those 1s are before the reversed subarray, and the reversed subarray's 1s are after them. So, the prefix_ones[l] + x (reversed subarray's 1s) is the number of 1s up to l-1 plus the 1s in the reversed subarray, which are all before the 2s in the reversed subarray. Then, the suffix_twos[r+1] is the 2s after the reversed subarray, which are after the 2s in the reversed subarray.\n\nSo the total is the sum of all these.\n\nBut wait, in the original array, there could be 2s before l and 1s after r. How does this affect the calculation?\n\nWell, according to the formula, the 2s before l are not counted in prefix_ones, because prefix_ones[l] is the number of 1s before l. Similarly, the 1s after r are not counted in the reversed subarray's x, because x is the number of 1s in [l..r]. So, if the array has 2s before l, and 1s after r, those 1s won't be counted in the current formula. So, perhaps the formula misses some contributions.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because in the reversed array, the 1s after r are still in their original position, so they can be included in the LNDS as well.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nHmm, perhaps the formula should include:\n\nprefix_ones[l] (number of 1s before l) +\n\nx (number of 1s in reversed subarray) +\n\ny (number of 2s in reversed subarray) +\n\nsuffix_ones_after_r (number of 1s after r) +\n\nsuffix_twos[r+1] (number of 2s after r).\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because the suffix_ones_after_r are 1s, which cannot come after the 2s in the reversed subarray.\n\nSo, the LNDS can include the prefix_ones[l] + x (from the reversed subarray) + suffix_twos[r+1], but it cannot include both the suffix_ones_after_r and suffix_twos[r+1] unless all 2s in the reversed subarray are before those 1s.\n\nWhich is not possible, since the 2s in the reversed subarray are after the 1s in the reversed subarray.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula needs to be adjusted.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThe LNDS after reversing [l..r] can be:\n\n- All 1s in the prefix before l.\n\n- All 1s in the reversed subarray.\n\n- All 2s in the reversed subarray that come after the 1s in the reversed subarray.\n\n- All 2s in the suffix after r.\n\nBut the 1s in the suffix after r are after the 2s in the suffix, so they can't be included in the LNDS.\n\nSo, the total is prefix_ones[l] + x (1s in reversed) + y (2s in reversed) + suffix_twos[r+1].\n\nAdditionally, the 2s in the reversed subarray are after the 1s in the reversed subarray, so they can be added.\n\nBut the 2s in the suffix are after the reversed subarray, so they can be added as well.\n\nSo, the formula is correct.\n\nWait, but what about 1s in the suffix after r? Those 1s are after the 2s in the reversed subarray, so they can't be part of the same LNDS.\n\nSo, the formula correctly captures that.\n\nBut wait, what about 2s before l? They are in the prefix, but in the prefix, the 2s come before the 1s. So, they can't be part of the LNDS that includes the 1s in the prefix and reversed subarray.\n\nSo, the formula only counts the 1s in the prefix and the reversed subarray, plus the 2s in the reversed subarray and the suffix.\n\nBut what about the 2s before l? Are they being considered elsewhere?\n\nNo, because the 2s before l are in the prefix, but the prefix_ones[l] is the count of 1s before l. The 2s before l can't contribute to the LNDS after reversal unless they are part of a non-decreasing sequence.\n\nWait, this suggests that the formula is incomplete because it ignores the 2s before l.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the formula should also include the number of 2s in the prefix that are before the 1s.\n\nWait, but how? Because the 2s in the prefix are before the 1s, and thus can't be part of the same LNDS.\n\nSo, the formula is correct in ignoring them.\n\nBut wait, what if the reversed subarray includes 2s before l? No, the reversed subarray is from l to r, so the 2s before l are in the prefix.\n\nSo, the formula is correct.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the 2s before l can be part of the LNDS if they are followed by 2s in the reversed subarray.\n\nWait, for example, suppose the array is [2,1,2]. Reversing [1,2] (assuming 0-based) gives [1,2,2]. The LNDS is 3: 1, 2, 2.\n\nBut according to the formula, prefix_ones[l=1] is 0 (since A[0] is 2), x is 1 (number of 1s in [1..2] is 1?), y is 1 (number of 2s in [1..2] is 1). So formula is 0 + 1 + 1 + suffix_twos[r+1=2] (number of 2s from 2 onwards is 1). So total is 3, which is correct.\n\nSo the formula works in this case.\n\nAnother example: the first sample input.\n\nOriginal array is [1,2,1,2].\n\nprefix_ones[0] = 0\n\nprefix_ones[1] =1\n\nprefix_ones[2] =1\n\nprefix_ones[3] =1\n\nprefix_ones[4] =1\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not indexing correctly.\n\nWait, prefix_ones[i] is the number of 1s in A[0..i-1]. So for i=0, it's 0. i=1, A[0] is 1, so 1. i=2, A[0..1] is [1,2], so 1. i=3, A[0..2] is [1,2,1], so 2. i=4, A[0..3] is [1,2,1,2], so 2.\n\nSimilarly, suffix_twos[j] is the number of 2s in A[j..3]. For j=0, it's 2. j=1: 1. j=2: 1. j=3: 0. j=4: 0.\n\nSo, for the first sample, when l=2, r=3 (1-based?), or l=1, r=2 in 0-based.\n\nWait, the sample says reversing [2,3], which is 1-based. So l=2, r=3 in 1-based is l=1, r=2 in 0-based.\n\nSo, [l=1, r=2] in 0-based is the subarray [2,1]. Reversing it gives [1,2].\n\nSo, the new array is [1,1,2,2].\n\nprefix_ones[l=1] is the number of 1s before index 1 (A[0]) is 1.\n\nx is the number of 1s in [1..2], which is 1 (since A[1]=2, A[2]=1).\n\ny is the number of 2s in [1..2], which is 1.\n\nsuffix_twos[r+1=3] is the number of 2s from index 3, which is 1.\n\nSo the formula gives 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 =4, which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the formula seems correct.\n\nAnother example: the second sample.\n\nOriginal array is [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1].\n\nLet's say we reverse [3,7] (1-based), which is indices 2 to 6 in 0-based.\n\nThe reversed subarray is [2,2,2,1,1,2], wait, no. Wait, the original subarray from 2 to 6 is [2,2,2,1,1]. Reversing it gives [1,1,2,2,2].\n\nSo the new array becomes [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1].\n\nCompute the formula for this reversal.\n\nprefix_ones[l=2] (since l is 2 in 0-based, the prefix is A[0..1], which is [1,1], so prefix_ones[2] is 2.\n\nx is the number of 1s in [2..6] (indices 2 to 6 inclusive). In the original array, A[2]=2, A[3]=2, A[4]=2, A[5]=1, A[6]=1. So x is 2.\n\ny is the number of 2s in [2..6], which is 3.\n\nsuffix_twos[r+1=7] is the number of 2s in A[7..9], which are 2,2,1. So 2.\n\nSo the formula gives 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 =9, which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nThus, the approach is to compute, for each [l, r], the value prefix_ones[l] + x + y + suffix_twos[r+1], where x is the number of 1s in [l..r], y is the number of 2s in [l..r].\n\nThe maximum of all such values is the answer.\n\nAdditionally, we need to consider the original array's LNDS as a possible candidate.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input array.\n\n2. Precompute prefix_ones: for each index i, the number of 1s in A[0..i-1].\n\n3. Precompute suffix_twos: for each index j, the number of 2s in A[j..n-1].\n\n4. Compute the original LNDS.\n\n5. For each possible l and r (0 ≤ l ≤ r < n), compute x = number of 1s in [l..r], y = number of 2s in [l..r], and calculate the potential LNDS as prefix_ones[l] + x + y + suffix_twos[r+1].\n\n6. The maximum of the original LNDS and all the potentials is the answer.\n\nNow, the key is to compute x and y efficiently for all [l, r].\n\nWe can precompute prefix sums for 1s and 2s.\n\nLet's create",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in the given sequence of 1s and 2s.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to reverse a subarray such that the LNDS of the resulting array is maximized. The sequence consists only of 1s and 2s, so the LNDS will be maximized when the sequence has as many 1s as possible followed by as many 2s as possible.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each possible subarray reversal, the LNDS can be broken down into contributions from three parts:\n   - The number of 1s before the start of the reversed subarray.\n   - The number of 1s and 2s within the reversed subarray, which can be optimally arranged to form a non-decreasing sequence.\n   - The number of 2s after the end of the reversed subarray.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**:\n   - Precompute prefix sums for the count of 1s up to each index.\n   - Precompute suffix sums for the count of 2s starting from each index.\n   - For each possible subarray reversal, calculate the potential LNDS using these precomputed values.\n\n4. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute prefix_ones and suffix_twos arrays.\n   - Iterate over all possible subarrays, compute the potential LNDS for each reversal, and keep track of the maximum value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # Precompute prefix_ones: prefix_ones[i] is the number of 1s in a[0..i-1]\n    prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_ones[i+1] = prefix_ones[i] + (a[i] == 1)\n    \n    # Precompute suffix_twos: suffix_twos[j] is the number of 2s in a[j..n-1]\n    suffix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for j in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        suffix_twos[j] = suffix_twos[j+1] + (a[j] == 2)\n    \n    # Compute original LNDS\n    def compute_original_lnds():\n        # We can use the standard O(n log n) method\n        tails = []\n        max_len = 0\n        for num in a:\n            idx = bisect.bisect_left(tails, num)\n            if idx == len(tails):\n                tails.append(num)\n            else:\n                tails[idx] = num\n            max_len = max(max_len, idx + 1)\n        return max_len\n    \n    original_lnds = compute_original_lnds()\n    \n    max_possible = original_lnds\n    \n    # Precompute the number of 1s and 2s in all possible intervals\n    prefix_sum_1 = [0] * n\n    prefix_sum_2 = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_sum_1[i] = prefix_sum_1[i-1] + (a[i] == 1)\n        prefix_sum_2[i] = prefix_sum_2[i-1] + (a[i] == 2)\n    \n    # Now, for each l and r, compute x and y\n    for l in range(n):\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            # Number of 1s in [l, r]\n            x = prefix_sum_1[r] - prefix_sum_1[l]\n            # Number of 2s in [l, r]\n            y = prefix_sum_2[r] - prefix_sum_2[l]\n            current = prefix_ones[l] + x + y + suffix_twos[r+1]\n            if current > max_possible:\n                max_possible = current\n    \n    print(max_possible)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import bisect\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: `prefix_ones` keeps track of the cumulative count of 1s up to each index, while `suffix_twos` tracks the cumulative count of 2s from each index to the end of the array.\n2. **Original LNDS Calculation**: Using a binary search approach to efficiently compute the LNDS of the original array.\n3. **Iterate Over Subarrays**: For each possible subarray, compute the potential LNDS after reversal using the precomputed prefix and suffix arrays, ensuring efficient calculation.\n4. **Maximize Result**: Track the maximum LNDS found across all possible subarray reversals.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible subarray reversals and compute the optimal LNDS without redundant calculations.",
