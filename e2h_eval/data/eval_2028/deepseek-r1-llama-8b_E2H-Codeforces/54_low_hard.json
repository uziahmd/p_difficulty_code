Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Mister B and Angle in Polygon.\" Hmm, the task is to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 of a regular convex n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. And if there are multiple options with the same minimal difference, any of them is acceptable.\n\nAlright, first, I need to understand how the angle is formed in a regular polygon. So, let's think about a regular polygon. All sides are equal, all angles are equal. The internal angle of a regular n-gon is known; the formula for that is ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But wait, the angle we're considering here isn't necessarily the internal angle of the polygon. Because the angle is formed by two points on the sides of a vertex, not necessarily the adjacent vertices.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the polygon is regular, so each vertex has two adjacent vertices. But in this problem, the angle is formed by choosing any two points on the sides of a vertex. So for example, in a square (n=4), the sides are the edges between consecutive vertices. So when you pick v2, the two points v1 and v3 must lie on the two sides connected to v2. So v1 can be any vertex before v2 in the clockwise order, and v3 can be any vertex after v2, but both must be on different sides.\n\nHmm. So for a given vertex v2, the possible angles are determined by how far v1 and v3 are from v2 along their respective sides.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this. Let's say we have a regular polygon with n vertices arranged in a circle. Each vertex is equally spaced around the circle. The central angle between consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees.\n\nFor a given vertex v2, the two adjacent vertices are v_prev and v_next. The points v1 and v3 are somewhere along the edges from v_prev to v2 and from v2 to v_next, respectively.\n\nSo, for v2, the angle at v2 is determined by the positions of v1 and v3 on those edges.\n\nLet me think about the geometry here. Since the polygon is regular, all edges are the same length, and the shape is symmetric.\n\nSuppose the polygon is centered at the origin, and each vertex is at an angle of (i * 360/n) degrees from some starting point, like the positive x-axis.\n\nFor a given v2, which is at angle theta, the edge from v_prev to v2 is a line segment. Similarly for the edge from v2 to v_next.\n\nIf I choose v1 somewhere along the edge to v2, and v3 somewhere along the edge from v2 to v_next, then the angle formed at v2 will depend on where these points are placed.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model this using vectors. Let's consider the position vectors of the points. For a regular polygon, each vertex can be represented as (r*cos(theta), r*sin(theta)), where theta is the angle from the positive x-axis.\n\nBut maybe using the unit circle for simplicity, since scaling won't affect the angles.\n\nSo, let's assume the polygon is inscribed in a unit circle.\n\nLet’s denote the center of the polygon as O. Then, for each vertex v_i, its position is (cos(2π(i-1)/n), sin(2π(i-1)/n)).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. So, for i from 1 to n, the angle for vertex i would be (i-1)*2π/n radians, right? Or wait, maybe it's (i-1)*360/n degrees, but in the code, I'll have to handle the direction.\n\nAnyway, the idea is that for a given v2, the angle between v1 and v3, as seen from v2, depends on how far v1 is from v2 along the left side and how far v3 is along the right side.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for each vertex v2, compute all possible pairs (v1, v3) where v1 is on one side and v3 is on the other, and find the angle closest to 'a'.\n\nBut since n can be up to 105, and for each v2, there are O(n^2) possibilities, this approach might be feasible, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal angle occurs when the lines from v1 and v3 to v2 form certain symmetric conditions.\n\nWait, thinking about the angle: the angle at v2 is formed by the two lines v2v1 and v2v3. Since the polygon is regular, the sides are straight lines from v_prev",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices of a regular convex polygon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given angle. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently computing the possible angles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Polygon Structure**: A regular polygon has equal sides and equal internal angles. For each vertex, the two adjacent vertices are known, and any other vertex can be reached by moving clockwise or counterclockwise around the polygon.\n\n2. **Angle Calculation**: For each vertex `v2`, consider the edges extending from `v2` to its previous (`v_prev`) and next (`v_next`) vertices. The angle at `v2` is determined by points on these edges. By varying the positions of points on these edges, we can compute different angles at `v2`.\n\n3. **Optimal Angle Search**: For each vertex `v2`, compute the angle formed by points on its adjacent edges. Track the closest angle to the target `a` and store the corresponding vertices. After evaluating all vertices, select the configuration with the minimal difference from `a`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\nbest_diff = float('inf')\nbest_v2 = -1\nbest_v1 = -1\nbest_v3 = -1\n\nfor v2 in range(1, n+1):\n    # Generate all possible v1 and v3 for this v2\n    for step1 in range(1, n):\n        v1 = (v2 - step1) % n\n        if v1 == v2:\n            continue  # v1 must be distinct\n        for step2 in range(1, n):\n            v3 = (v2 + step2) % n\n            if v3 == v2 or v3 == v1:\n                continue  # v3 must be distinct and not equal to v1\n            # Compute the angle at v2\n            # Calculate vectors\n            theta_v1 = (v1 - 1) * 2 * math.pi / n\n            theta_v2 = (v2 - 1) * 2 * math.pi / n\n            theta_v3 = (v3 - 1) * 2 * math.pi / n\n            # Vector from v2 to v1\n            vec_v1 = (math.cos(theta_v1), math.sin(theta_v1))\n            # Vector from v2 to v3\n            vec_v3 = (math.cos(theta_v3), math.sin(theta_v3))\n            # Vector from v2 to center\n            vec_center = (math.cos(theta_v2), math.sin(theta_v2))\n            # Compute vectors relative to v2\n            vec_v1_rel = (vec_v1[0] - vec_center[0], vec_v1[1] - vec_center[1])\n            vec_v3_rel = (vec_v3[0] - vec_center[0], vec_v3[1] - vec_center[1])\n            # Compute angle between vec_v1_rel and vec_v3_rel\n            def angle_between(v1, v2):\n                dot = v1[0]*v2[0] + v1[1]*v2[1]\n                cross = v1[0]*v2[1] - v1[1]*v2[0]\n                angle = math.atan2(cross, dot)\n                return math.degrees(angle)\n            current_angle = angle_between(vec_v1_rel, vec_v3_rel)\n            current_diff = abs(current_angle - a)\n            if current_diff < best_diff:\n                best_diff = current_diff\n                best_v2 = v2\n                best_v1 = v1\n                best_v3 = v3\n            elif current_diff == best_diff:\n                # Choose the lex smallest or any, but let's just keep the first occurrence\n                pass\n\nprint(f\"{best_v1 + 1} {best_v2 + 1} {best_v3 + 1}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle).\n2. **Initialization**: Variables to track the best angle and the corresponding vertices are initialized.\n3. **Iterate Over Vertices**: For each vertex `v2`, consider all possible pairs of vertices `v1` and `v3` on its adjacent edges.\n4. **Calculate Vectors**: Using vector mathematics, compute the angle at `v2` formed by `v1` and `v3`.\n5. **Track Closest Angle**: Keep track of the smallest difference between the computed angle and the target `a`. Update the best vertices if a closer angle is found.\n6. **Output Result**: Print the vertices that form the angle closest to `a`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible angles within the polygon and find the optimal solution.",
