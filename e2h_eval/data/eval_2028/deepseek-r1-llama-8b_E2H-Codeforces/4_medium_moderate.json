The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a Rock-Paper-Scissors game between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They play n rounds, and in each round, the winner gives the loser a pinch, which leaves a red spot. We need to calculate how many red spots each has after all the rounds.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to figure out who wins each round based on their strategies. Both have sequences of choices that they cycle through. For example, if Nikephoros's sequence is \"RPS\" and Polycarpus's is \"RSPP\", then for each round, we take the next character from each sequence in order, cycling as needed.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input correctly. The first line is n, then the two sequences A and B.\n2. For each of the n rounds, determine who wins.\n3. Count the number of times each loses, because each loss adds a red spot to them.\n\nWait, no. Because the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros loses a round, he gets a red spot. Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\nSo for each round:\n- Compare A's move and B's move.\n- Determine who loses (the one whose move is beaten by the other).\n- Increment the respective count.\n\nBut wait, since the sequences are cyclic, for each round i (from 0 to n-1), we need to get the i-th character of both sequences, considering the cycles.\n\nSo, for example, if A has length m, then for the i-th round, the choice is A[i % m], same for B.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize two counters, nike = 0 and poly = 0.\n\nFor each round from 0 to n-1:\n    a = A[i % len(A)]\n    b = B[j % len(B)]\n    determine who wins between a and b.\n\nIf a beats b: then Poly gets a pinch (since he lost)\nElse if b beats a: then Nike gets a pinch\nElse: no one.\n\nSo, how to determine who beats whom.\n\nLet's think about the rules:\n\nRock beats scissors.\nScissors beat paper.\nPaper beats rock.\n\nSo for any two choices a and b:\n\nIf a is 'R' and b is 'S': a wins.\nIf a is 'S' and b is 'P': a wins.\nIf a is 'P' and b is 'R': a wins.\nOtherwise, if b is the winning choice, then a loses.\nElse, it's a draw.\n\nSo perhaps we can write a helper function to determine the outcome of a vs b.\n\nAlternatively, create a dictionary or some mapping to know what beats what.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to represent the beats relationship. Like, for each possible a, what does it beat?\n\nBeats = {\n    'R': 'S',\n    'S': 'P',\n    'P': 'R'\n}\n\nSo when a is 'R', it beats 'S'. So if a's choice is 'R' and b is 'S', then a wins.\n\nSo in code:\n\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nfor each round:\n    a = A[i mod m]\n    b = B[j mod k]\n    if a == b: continue\n    if beats[a] == b:\n        # a wins, so b loses\n        poly +=1\n    else:\n        # b wins, so a loses\n        nike +=1\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nThe sequences A and B are given as strings. So for each round i, the index for A is i mod m, where m is len(A). Similarly for B.\n\nSo, for example, if A has 3 elements, and i is 4, then i mod 3 is 1, so we take the second element (index 1).\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nnike = 0\npoly = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if beats[a] == b:\n        poly +=1\n    else:\n        nike +=1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n\nWait, but wait! That's not correct. Because in each round, the indices for A and B are independent. So for each i, A's index is i mod m, and B's index is i mod k. Not both i mod m and i mod k.\n\nOh right! That was a mistake. So I need to correct that.\n\nSo for each round i, the index for A is i mod m, for B it's i mod k.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a_index = i % m\n    b_index = i % k\n    a = A[a_index]\n    b = B[b_index]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if beats[a] == b:\n        poly +=1\n    else:\n        nike +=1\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n7\nRPS\nRSPP\n\nSo A is 'RPS' (length 3), B is 'RSPP' (length 4).\n\nRound 0:\na = R (i=0 mod 3)\nb = R (i=0 mod4)\nSame, no change.\n\nRound 1:\na = P (i=1 mod3=1)\nb = S (i=1 mod4=1)\nP vs S. Does P beat S? No. Because S beats P. Wait, beats['P'] is 'R'. So in this case, a is P, b is S. Beats[a] is R. So b is S, which is not equal to R. So it's not a win for a. Then, check whether b beats a.\n\nSo S beats P. So in this round, b's choice (S) beats a's (P). So a loses, so poly increases by 1.\n\nSo round 1: Poly gets a spot.\n\nRound 2:\ni=2.\n\na = S (2 mod3=2)\nb = R (2 mod4=2)\nS vs R. S beats R? No. Because beats['S'] is P. So a is S, b is R. Does S beat R? Yes, because S cuts R. So a wins. So poly loses: poly +=1.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, in the round, if a is S and b is R, then S beats R. So a wins. So b loses, so Poly gets a spot.\n\nSo round 2: Poly increases.\n\nWait, no. Because in the code, if a's choice is S, and b is R. Since beats[a] is P, which is not equal to b (R), so a doesn't win. Then, we check if b's choice (R) beats a's (S). Since R is beaten by S, no. Or wait, R is beaten by S. So for a's choice S and b's R: R is beaten by S, so b loses. So a's choice is S, which beats R. So in the code, if a's choice is S, and b is R: a's beats is P. So beats[a] is P != R. So the condition beats[a] == b is false. So we go to else: check if b beats a.\n\nSo, does b (R) beat a (S)? Yes, because R is beaten by S? Wait, no. Wait, R is beaten by S. So when a is S and b is R, a wins.\n\nWait, maybe I should make a table:\n\na | b | winner\nR R → draw\nR S → R wins\nR P → P wins\nS R → S wins\nS P → S loses, P wins\nP R → P wins\nP S → S wins\nS S → draw\netc.\n\nSo for a='R' and b='S', R wins.\n\nIn the code, when a is R, beats[a] is S. So if b is S, a wins.\n\nWhen a is 'S' and b is 'R', beats[a] is 'P'. So b is R, which is not equal to 'P'. So the code will enter the else clause. Then, check if b's move beats a's move.\n\nDoes 'R' beat 'S'? Yes, because R is beaten by S. Wait, no: in the rules, R beats S. So R beats S. So if a is S, b is R: then R beats S. So b wins.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify.\n\nRock (R) beats Scissors (S).\n\nScissors (S) beats Paper (P).\n\nPaper (P) beats Rock (R).\n\nSo for any a and b:\n\nif a beats b: a wins.\n\nelse if b beats a: b wins.\n\nelse: draw.\n\nSo in code, for a and b, if a is not equal to b, then:\n\nif a beats b → a wins, b loses.\n\nelse → b wins, a loses.\n\nSo for a='S' and b='R':\n\nDoes S beat R? Yes. Because S beats R. So a wins, b loses.\n\nSo in the code, when a is S and b is R:\n\nbeats[a] is P. So beats[a] == b? P vs R → no. So we go to else. Then, check if b beats a.\n\nBut b is R. Does R beat a (S)? Yes. So in the else part, we add 1 to the other player's count.\n\nWait, in the code, in the else clause, it's adding to the other player. So in this case, a is S, b is R. R beats S → so a (S) loses. So Poly (player B) gets a spot.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier analysis, when a is S and b is R, a should win. So why is the code adding to Poly?\n\nAh, that's a bug in the code. So the code isn't handling this case correctly.\n\nWait, let's think again. In the code, if a and b are different:\n\nif a beats b → then b loses (Poly gets a spot).\n\nElse → a loses (Nike gets a spot).\n\nSo for a='S' and b='R':\n\na beats b (S beats R). So in the code, beats[a] is P. So beats[a] is not equal to b (R). So we go into the else clause.\n\nIn the else clause, we assume that b beats a. But in this case, b is R, which does beat S. So the code increments the count for the other player (Nike) because a loses.\n\nWait, that's wrong.\n\nBecause when a is S and b is R, a wins, so b (Poly) loses. So the code should add 1 to Poly's count, but in this case, it's adding to Nike.\n\nSo the code is incorrect.\n\nSo what's the issue here?\n\nLet me re-express the logic.\n\nFor each round:\n\nIf a and b are the same → no change.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if a beats b. If yes → Poly loses (so Poly's count increases by 1).\n\nElse → a loses → Nike's count increases by 1.\n\nSo the condition is: if a beats b → Poly gets a spot.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nif a != b:\n\n    if beats[a] == b:\n\n        poly +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        nike +=1\n\nBecause when a beats b, then a's move wins, so the loser is b (Poly). Else, b's move wins, so the loser is a (Nike).\n\nSo in the case where a is S and b is R:\n\na's move is S, which beats R. So beats[a] is P. So beats[a] is not equal to b (R). So the else clause is triggered, and we add to nike.\n\nBut that's wrong because in reality, a (S) beats b (R), so Poly should lose, and thus Poly's count increases.\n\nSo the code is incorrect.\n\nSo the code's logic is flawed.\n\nWhat's the correct way to determine who loses?\n\nWe need to check if a beats b. If yes, then Poly (b's player) loses. So Poly's count increases by 1.\n\nElse, if b beats a → then a (Nike) loses. So his count increases.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nif a != b:\n\n    if a beats b:\n\n        poly +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        nike +=1\n\nSo how to implement this.\n\nThe current code does:\n\nif beats[a] == b:\n\n    poly +=1\n\nelse:\n\n    nike +=1\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWait, no. Because beats[a] is the move that a beats.\n\nSo for a='S', beats[a] is 'P'. So when b is 'R', beats[a] is not equal to b, so the else clause is taken, and nike increases by 1.\n\nBut in reality, a='S' beats b='R', so Poly should lose, which means Poly's count should increase.\n\nSo the code is wrong.\n\nAh, I see the problem now.\n\nWait, the code is checking if a beats b, but the way it's implemented is incorrect.\n\nBecause a beats b when a's move beats b's move.\n\nSo in code, when a's move beats b's move, then Poly (b's player) loses.\n\nSo the condition should be: if a's move is such that it beats b's move.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nif a != b:\n\n    if a_beats_b:\n\n        poly +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        nike +=1\n\nSo to check if a beats b, we can do:\n\nif beats.get(a, None) == b:\n\nThen, if yes, Poly loses.\n\nElse, if b beats a → then a loses, so add to Nike.\n\nSo in the previous example, a is 'S', b is 'R'.\n\nbeats['S'] is 'P', which is not equal to 'R' → so a does not beat b.\n\nBut wait, 'S' does beat 'R'!\n\nSo this indicates that the way the beats dictionary is set up is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Because the beats dict is defined as:\n\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nWhich means:\n\n- R beats S.\n\n- S beats P.\n\n- P beats R.\n\nSo for a='S' and b='R', a's move is S, which beats R. So a beats b.\n\nBut in the beats dict, beats[a] is 'P', which is not equal to b. So the code incorrectly thinks that a does not beat b.\n\nThus, the code is wrong.\n\nSo this suggests that the initial approach is flawed.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way the beats dictionary is structured is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the beats dictionary should represent what each move beats.\n\nLike, R beats S, S beats P, P beats R.\n\nSo for a given a, if a's move beats b's move, then a wins.\n\nSo the condition should be: a's move is in the beats list of b's move.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the beats in a way that for each a, we know what it beats, but then to check if a beats b, it's whether b is in the list of what a beats.\n\nWait, maybe the beats dictionary should be inverted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of what beats what.\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\nCreate a function that returns True if a beats b.\n\nSo:\n\ndef a_wins(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return False\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        return True\n\n    else:\n\n        return False\n\nBut that's more straightforward.\n\nSo perhaps using this function is better than relying on the beats dictionary, which might have been causing confusion.\n\nSo the code can be rewritten as:\n\nfor each round:\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        continue\n\n    if a_wins(a, b):\n\n        poly +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        nike +=1\n\nWhere a_wins is the function above.\n\nThat would correctly handle the cases.\n\nSo perhaps that's a better approach.\n\nLet me test this function.\n\nCase 1: a=R, b=S → a wins → True.\n\nCase 2: a=S, b=R → a wins → True.\n\nCase3: a=P, b= R → a wins → True.\n\nCase4: a=R, b=P → a's move is R, b is P. R is beaten by P. So a does not win. So function returns False.\n\nSo this seems correct.\n\nSo with this function, the code becomes:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\ndef a_wins(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return False\n\n    return (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R')\n\nnike = 0\n\npoly = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        continue\n\n    if a_wins(a, b):\n\n        poly +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        nike +=1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo for each round:\n\nRound 0:\n\nA[0] = R, B[0] = R → same. No change.\n\nRound 1:\n\nA[1] = P, B[1] = S → P vs S. Does P beat S? No. Because S beats P. So function returns False. So a does not win. So b (S) beats a (P). So a (Nike) loses. So Nike's count increases by 1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the function a_wins(a, b) is called with a=P and b=S.\n\nSo a_wins(P, S): a != b. Is (P == R and S is S?) No. (P == S and S is S?) No. (P == P and S is R?) No. So function returns False. So a does not win. So the else clause is triggered, and since a does not win, b must win. So a (Nike) loses, so his count increases.\n\nSo Round 1: Nike +=1.\n\nRound 2:\n\nA[2] = S, B[2] = R.\n\na = S, b = R.\n\na_wins(S, R): S == R? No. Check conditions: (S == R and R is S?) No. (S == S and R is P?) No. (S == P and R is R?) No. So returns False. So else clause: a does not win. So b wins. So a (Nike) loses. So Nike +=1.\n\nWait, but S does beat R. So the function is returning False when it shouldn't.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the function, a is S, b is R.\n\na_wins(S, R) → (S == R and ... ) → no. Or (S == S and R is P) → no. Or (S == P and R is R) → no.\n\nSo the function returns False.\n\nBut S does beat R. So the function is incorrect.\n\nWait, what's the problem here.\n\nWait, the function is designed to return True if a's move beats b's move.\n\nSo for a=S and b=R: a's move (S) beats R. So the function should return True.\n\nBut according to the function, it's returning False.\n\nSo the function is incorrect.\n\nAh, I see. Because the function is written as (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or ... etc. So it's checking for a being R and b being S, etc.\n\nBut when a is S and b is R, none of the conditions are met, because the function only checks if a is R, S, or P, and compares to specific letters.\n\nSo the function is incorrect.\n\nSo this approach is flawed.\n\nAlternative idea: instead of using a function, perhaps create a lookup table.\n\nWe can have a dictionary that maps each (a, b) pair to whether a beats b.\n\nBut that might be memory-intensive, but for 3 options each, it's manageable.\n\nSo create a 3x3 matrix:\n\nbeat_matrix = {\n\n    ('R', 'R'): False,\n\n    ('R', 'S'): True,\n\n    ('R', 'P'): False,\n\n    ('S', 'R'): True,\n\n    ('S', 'S'): False,\n\n    ('S', 'P'): True,\n\n    ('P', 'R'): True,\n\n    ('P', 'S'): False,\n\n    ('P', 'P'): False,\n\n}\n\nSo for any a and b, beat_matrix[(a, b)] is True if a beats b, else False.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif a == b:\n\n    continue\n\nelse:\n\n    if beat_matrix[(a, b)]:\n\n        poly +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        nike +=1\n\nThis way, it's accurate.\n\nSo the code becomes:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\nbeat_matrix = {\n\n    ('R', 'R'): False,\n\n    ('R', 'S'): True,\n\n    ('R', 'P'): False,\n\n    ('S', 'R'): True,\n\n    ('S', 'S'): False,\n\n    ('S', 'P'): True,\n\n    ('P', 'R'): True,\n\n    ('P', 'S'): False,\n\n    ('P', 'P'): False,\n\n}\n\nnike = 0\n\npoly = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        continue\n\n    if beat_matrix[(a, b)]:\n\n        poly +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        nike +=1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n\nTesting this with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nRounds:\n\nRound 0: R vs R → same.\n\nRound 1: P vs S → P does not beat S. So beat_matrix[(P, S)] is False. So else clause: a does not win, so b (S) beats a (P). So a (Nike) loses. So Nike +=1.\n\nRound 2: S vs R → S beats R → beat_matrix is True. So poly +=1.\n\nRound3: R vs P → R does not beat P. So beat_matrix is False. So else clause: b (P) beats a (R). So a (Nike) loses. So Nike +=1.\n\nRound4: P vs R → P beats R → True. So poly +=1.\n\nRound5: S vs S → same.\n\nRound6: R vs P → R does not beat P. So else clause: b (P) beats a (R). So a (Nike) loses. So Nike +=1.\n\nSo total:\n\nNike: 1 (round1) + 1 (round3) + 1 (round6) = 3.\n\nPoly: 1 (round2) + 1 (round4) = 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nAnother test case: when a and b are the same, nothing happens.\n\nAnother case: a is 'R', b is 'S' → a wins, poly +=1.\n\nAnother case: a is 'S', b is 'R' → a wins, poly +=1.\n\nAnother case: a is 'P', b is 'R' → a wins, poly +=1.\n\nAnother case: a is 'R', b is 'P' → b wins, so a (Nike) loses → Nike +=1.\n\nSo the beat_matrix approach is correct.\n\nThus, the code should use this method.\n\nNow, considering the constraints.\n\nn can be up to 2e5 (200,000). So the loop needs to run efficiently.\n\nEach iteration is O(1), so it's acceptable.\n\nThe sequences A and B can be up to 1000 characters each.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo the final code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, after they play `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each round is played with a specific sequence of moves for each player, and the loser of each round gets a red spot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game follows the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules where Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, and Paper beats Rock. If both players choose the same move, the round is a draw.\n2. **Cyclic Moves**: Both players use their own sequences of moves which are cycled through for each round. For example, if a player's sequence is \"RPS\", their moves will be R, P, S, R, P, S, etc.\n3. **Determine Winners**: For each round, we need to compare the moves of both players. The winner of each round is determined based on the Rock-Paper-Scissors rules. The loser gets a red spot.\n4. **Efficient Comparison**: Using a predefined matrix to check if one move beats another allows us to efficiently determine the winner of each round without repeatedly checking the rules.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\nbeat_matrix = {\n    ('R', 'R'): False,\n    ('R', 'S'): True,\n    ('R', 'P'): False,\n    ('S', 'R'): True,\n    ('S', 'S'): False,\n    ('S', 'P'): True,\n    ('P', 'R'): True,\n    ('P', 'S'): False,\n    ('P', 'P'): False,\n}\n\nnike = 0\npoly = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if beat_matrix[(a, b)]:\n        poly += 1\n    else:\n        nike += 1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, and two strings representing the sequences of moves for Nikephoros (A) and Polycarpus (B).\n2. **Matrix Setup**: A predefined matrix `beat_matrix` is used to quickly determine if one move beats another. This matrix maps each pair of moves to a boolean indicating the result.\n3. **Round Simulation**: For each round, the moves of both players are determined by cycling through their respective sequences. The result of the round is checked against the matrix to see who wins.\n4. **Counting Red Spots**: If Nikephoros loses a round, his red spot count is incremented. Similarly, if Polycarpus loses, his red spot count is incremented.\n5. **Output**: After processing all rounds, the counts of red spots for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that each round is processed in constant time, making the solution efficient even for the upper constraint of `n = 200,000`.",
