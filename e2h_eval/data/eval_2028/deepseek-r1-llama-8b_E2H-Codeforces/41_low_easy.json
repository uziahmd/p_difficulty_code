There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the problem is about maximizing profit by building houses on a street with certain restrictions. \n\nAlright, let me read the problem statement carefully again. So, there are n spots on the street where each house can be built with a height between 0 and h. Each spot contributes a squared value equal to the height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in the range from l_i to r_i (inclusive), the tallest house must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit.\n\nHmm. So, the constraints are that for each of the m ranges, the maximum height in that range doesn't exceed x_i. And I want each spot's height as high as possible to maximize the sum of squares.\n\nI think this is an optimization problem with constraints. Since n, h, m are up to 50, which is manageable, maybe I can model this with dynamic programming or some other approach.\n\nLet's think about how to model the state. For each spot i, the decision depends on the previous spots, especially because the constraints can overlap. So perhaps the state needs to keep track of the current position and the maximum height allowed up to that point based on the constraints.\n\nWait, but the constraints are on ranges. So for any given spot, its maximum allowed height could be influenced by multiple overlapping constraints. For example, if a spot is within several [l_i, r_i] intervals, each of those will impose their own x_i as a possible upper bound.\n\nSo, for each spot, the maximum height allowed is the minimum of all the x_i's from constraints that cover it, as well as h. Because each constraint that includes the spot restricts the maximum height, and the overall maximum is the smallest of these.\n\nWait, no. Because a spot could be covered by multiple constraints. For instance, suppose a spot is part of two ranges, one with x=5 and another with x=3. Then, the maximum allowed height for that spot would be min(5,3) = 3, because both constraints require it.\n\nSo, for each spot, the maximum height is the minimum x across all constraints that include it, and also not exceeding h.\n\nAh! So the first step is to compute, for each spot i, the maximum possible height it can have, considering all the constraints that apply to it.\n\nWait, but that's only part of the problem. Because even if a spot is not directly restricted by any constraint, its height is still limited by h. So, for each spot i, the maximum height is the minimum between h and the minimum x of all constraints that include i.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, for each spot, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of h and the minimal x_i across all constraints covering it.\n\nBut wait, that's only true if the constraints are independent. Because when you set a spot's height, it affects the constraints. For example, if I have two overlapping constraints on a spot, say x1 and x2, then the spot's height must be <= min(x1, x2). But if I have a spot that is covered by multiple constraints, then the maximum possible height for that spot is the minimum of all x_i's of the constraints that include it, and also <=h.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is for each spot, find the minimal x_i from all constraints that include it. If there are no such constraints, then the minimal x is h.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the constraints may not cover all spots. For example, in the second sample input, the first spot (spot 1) isn't covered by any constraint. So its maximum height is h, which is 10.\n\nSo, for each spot i, the maximum possible height is the minimum of h and the minimal x among all constraints that cover it. If there are no constraints covering it, then it's h.\n\nWait, no. Because if a spot is covered by some constraints, then its maximum height is min(h, min{x_i for constraints covering i}).\n\nBut wait, perhaps that's not correct. Because the constraints might not all be active. For example, suppose a spot is covered by two constraints: one with x=5 and another with x=3. Then, the maximum height for that spot is min(5,3)=3. So the spot's height can't exceed 3, because both constraints require it.\n\nSo, for each spot, the maximum possible height is the minimum of h and the minimal x_i of all constraints that include it. If there are no constraints, then it's h.\n\nSo, to model this, for each spot i, I can precompute the maximum possible height as min_x, where min_x is the minimum x_i of all constraints that include i. If there are no constraints, min_x is h.\n\nBut wait, no.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street with given constraints. Each house contributes a profit based on its height squared, but there are restrictions on the maximum height within certain ranges.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Constraints**: Each constraint specifies that the tallest house in a given range must not exceed a certain height. We need to ensure that all constraints are satisfied while maximizing the total profit.\n2. **Determine Maximum Heights for Each Spot**: For each spot, the maximum allowed height is determined by the minimum of the heights specified by the constraints covering that spot and the global maximum height `h`.\n3. **Compute Profit**: Once the maximum height for each spot is determined, compute the total profit by summing the squares of these heights.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nconstraints = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    constraints.append((l-1, r-1, x))  # Convert to 0-based\n\n# For each position, find the minimal x across all constraints that cover it\nmax_heights = [h] * n\nfor i in range(n):\n    min_x = h\n    for (l, r, x) in constraints:\n        if l <= i <= r:\n            if x < min_x:\n                min_x = x\n    max_heights[i] = min(min_x, h)\n\n# Calculate the profit\nprofit = sum(x*x for x in max_heights)\nprint(profit)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of spots `n`, the maximum height `h`, and the number of constraints `m`. Each constraint is stored as a tuple.\n2. **Adjusting Constraints**: Constraints are converted to 0-based indices for easier processing.\n3. **Determine Maximum Heights**: For each spot, iterate through all constraints to find the minimum height allowed by any constraint covering that spot. This ensures that the maximum height for each spot respects all applicable constraints and the global maximum height `h`.\n4. **Calculate Profit**: Sum the squares of the maximum heights for each spot to get the total profit, which is then printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and computes the optimal heights for each spot to maximize the profit while respecting all given restrictions.",
