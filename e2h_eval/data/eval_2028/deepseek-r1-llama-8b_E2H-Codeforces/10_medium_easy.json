Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) — the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is called \"Feed the Golorp.\" Hmm, sounds a bit funny, but it's a programming competition problem. \n\nThe problem statement says that Golorps are creatures that eat variables. Their name defines their diet. Each variable can be 0-9. For each Golorp, they want the lex smallest sequence possible or output false if impossible. Oh right, and for the input, we get a string which is the name of the Golorp, and we have to find the lex smallest feeding.\n\nWait, the input is a single string, not a list. So in the example, the input is something like ['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', ...], but wait no, in the actual problem statement, the input is a single string, not a list. Maybe the sample had a typo, or perhaps it's a mistake in how the problem is presented here. Anyway, moving on.\n\nSo, the task is to parse the given string and determine the minimal sequence of variables that can satisfy the Golorp's structure. The variables are in the order they enter the jaws into the stomach. If no such sequence exists, output 'false'.\n\nLet me think about how the Golorp's name translates into the required variables.\n\nI remember from Befunge that the structure is a grid of characters where each character represents an instruction. But maybe this problem isn't exactly about Befunge, but the problem statement mentions that Golorp's name is similar to Befunge programs. So perhaps the structure is similar.\n\nIn Befunge, the program runs in a grid, and each cell can be a command. The movement is controlled by the direction of the previous command. The program starts at the top-left corner, and the pointer moves right until it hits a '<' which makes it move down, or up if '>' is encountered.\n\nBut how does this relate to the variables consumed? Well, in Befunge, variables are represented as stacks. When you execute certain commands, you might push values onto the stack. So perhaps the Golorp's program has a certain number of variables (stacks) that need to be fed.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, each variable can take values from 0 to 9. So perhaps each time a variable is accessed, it's treated as a digit, and the program needs to have certain variables set before it can proceed correctly.\n\nHmm. So maybe the Golorp's name is a Befunge-like program that uses certain variables, and our job is to assign values to those variables in such a way that the program doesn't crash and successfully terminates, with the lex smallest sequence.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nFirst, I think I need to parse the Golorp's name into a structure that tells us which variables are used and in what order. Because each step of the program will require certain variables, and these variables must be assigned values in a way that allows the program to complete.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the program as a series of operations that consume variables. Each operation may require certain variables to be present on the stack or in memory. The goal is to assign the variables such that all required operations are satisfied, and the overall assignment is lex smallest.\n\nBut how to represent this? It seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a constraint satisfaction problem, where each variable is a digit from 0-9, and each step in the program imposes certain constraints on the variables.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is similar to solving a puzzle where each step depends on the previous variables. We can model the program as a state machine where each state represents the current position in the program and the current stack state. Then, we can perform a BFS to find the lex smallest sequence of variable assignments that leads to a successful program execution.\n\nBut that sounds computationally intensive, especially since the program can be up to 1024 characters long. So BFS might not be feasible for larger inputs.\n\nHmm, so perhaps there's a smarter way. Maybe the program can be processed to determine the order in which variables are accessed, and then we can assign the variables in that order, choosing the smallest possible digits as early as possible.\n\nWait, another angle: In Befunge, variables are typically stored on a stack. The program uses these variables through the use of the '!' command, which pops the top of the stack as a number. So perhaps each '!' in the program requires a variable to be present on the stack at that point.\n\nSo, the idea is that when the program is executed, certain '!' commands are encountered which pop the top of the stack. Each of these '!' commands expects that the stack has a value, which must have been pushed earlier in the program.\n\nSo, the variables used are the ones that are pushed onto the stack, and each '!' pops one. So, the variables used are those that are pushed, and each '!' corresponds to a variable being consumed.\n\nTherefore, the first step is to parse the Golorp's name into a list of commands, identify all the positions where '!' is used, and note that each such '!' requires a variable to be popped from the stack at that point.\n\nSo, for each '!' in the program, we need to have a corresponding variable that was pushed earlier. So, the variables used are in the order of their pushing, and each '!' takes the next variable in that order.\n\nWait, no. Because the stack is LIFO. So, for example, if you have a series of pushes followed by a '!', it pops the last pushed value. So, the variables are used in reverse order of their pushing.\n\nWait, but each '!' pops the top of the stack, which is the last pushed variable. So, the variables are consumed in the order of their pushing, but each '!' takes the most recently pushed one. So, the variables used in the program are in the order of their pushing, but each '!' consumes the last one.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the variables used are determined by the order in which '!' commands are encountered. Each '!' requires that a variable has been pushed onto the stack before it. Therefore, the number of '!' commands determines how many variables are needed. Also, each '!' must come after a certain number of pushes.\n\nWait, but the program could also have other commands, like '+', '-', which modify the stack. For example, '+' pops two values, adds them, and pushes the result. Similarly, '-' pops two, subtracts, and pushes.\n\nSo, the structure of the program will determine the dependencies between variables.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe the way to model this is to represent the variables as a linked list, where each '!' or other command that pops a variable points back to the variable it consumes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a graph where each node represents a variable, and edges represent the order in which variables are used. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach is to model the program as a dependency graph where each '!' command requires that a certain variable is available at that point. So, for each '!' command, we can track which variable it uses, and ensure that variable is set before that point.\n\nWait, but the variables are assigned in a certain order. The problem requires that the variables are listed in the order they get into the jaws. So, the first variable is the first to be fed, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps the variables are determined by the order in which they are accessed, and each '!' corresponds to a variable being used, so the variables are in the order of their last access.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's think differently.\n\nPerhaps the key is to process the program and determine which variables are used and in what order. Then, assign the smallest possible digits to the earliest variables to get the lex smallest sequence.\n\nWait, but how do we determine the order of variables? Because the order in which they are used depends on the stack operations.\n\nFor example, if the program does:\n\npush a\npush b\n!   // pops b, uses variable b\n\nThen the variables are used in the order b, a.\n\nBut when assigning, the variables would be assigned in the order they are pushed. So, a is pushed first, then b. So, the sequence is [a, b], and the '!' uses b first.\n\nWait, but the output is the sequence of variables in the order they get into the jaws, which is the order of their pushing.\n\nWait, no. Because the '!' uses the last pushed variable, which is b. So, the variables used are b, a. But the order in which they were pushed is a, then b.\n\nHmm, so the order of the output variables is the order in which they are pushed, but the '!' uses them in reverse order.\n\nSo, the output sequence is a list of variables in the order they are pushed, regardless of the order they are used. But the problem states that the output should be the lex smallest sequence of variable values in the order they get into the jaws. So, the order is the same as the order they are pushed.\n\nSo, for example, if the variables are pushed in the order a, b, c, then the output is a, b, c.\n\nEach '!' command uses the top of the stack, which is the last pushed variable.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to determining which variables are pushed, in which order, and ensuring that each '!' has a corresponding variable that was pushed before it.\n\nBut how do we model the dependencies? Because some commands modify the stack in ways that require certain variables to be present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to model the program as a series of operations that require certain variables to be present, and then assign the smallest possible values to the earliest variables to minimize the lex order.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about how the program is structured. Each command can be thought of as either modifying the stack or reading from it. So, the program can be broken down into segments where certain variables are pushed, and then '!' commands read them.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model the variables as a list, where each element is a variable that must be assigned a value. The order of the variables is the order in which they are pushed onto the stack. So, the first variable is the first one pushed, the second is the second, etc.\n\nEach '!' command in the program corresponds to taking the last pushed variable in the stack. So, the '!' commands form a chain, each requiring the stack to have at least one element.\n\nMoreover, other commands like '+', '-', '*', etc., may require popping two elements and performing an operation, then pushing the result. These operations affect the stack, which in turn affects the availability of variables for subsequent '!' commands.\n\nThis seems quite complex.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that for the program to run without error, certain conditions must be met:\n\n1. Every '!' command must have at least one element on the stack at that point.\n2. Any command that modifies the stack (like '+', '-', '!', etc.) must have enough elements on the stack as required.\n\nBut modeling this for a 1000-character program is challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the variables as a stack, and processing the program step by step, keeping track of the stack state. For each step, depending on the command, we may push or pop variables, and for each '!' we need to have a variable to consume.\n\nBut since we're trying to find the lex smallest sequence, perhaps we can model this as a backtracking problem where we assign the smallest possible value to each variable in order, and check if the program can execute successfully with those values.\n\nHowever, considering the size of the program (up to 1024 characters), this approach might be too slow unless optimized.\n\nBut perhaps the variables can be determined in advance, and the order in which they are assigned can be known, allowing for a straightforward assignment of the smallest possible digits.\n\nWait, perhaps the variables are determined by the order of their first occurrence in the program, specifically when they are pushed onto the stack. Then, the '!' commands refer to the top of the stack, which is the last pushed variable.\n\nSo, the variables are in the order they are pushed, and each '!' refers to the latest pushed variable. So, the first '!' will take the last pushed variable, the next '!' will take the second last, and so on.\n\nWait, no. Because the '!' commands can be interleaved with pushes and other operations. So, the stack can change dynamically, and the '!' commands can refer to any variable that's currently on the stack.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should try to think of the problem in terms of the variables used and their dependencies. For example, each '!' command requires that the stack has at least one element. But for more complex commands like '+', '-', we may require two elements.\n\nSo, perhaps the program can be processed into a series of steps where each step specifies how many variables are needed and in what order.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal approach is to model the program as a series of operations that require certain variables to be present, and then assign the variables in such a way that the earliest variables (in the order they are pushed) are assigned the smallest possible values.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAn alternative idea: the program can be processed into a list of operations that consume variables. Each '!' command must correspond to a variable that was pushed before it. So, the variables are determined by the order in which they are pushed and the order of '!' commands.\n\nWait, perhaps the variables are the same as the '!' commands, in the order they appear, but that's probably not accurate.\n\nNo, because '!' can appear anywhere, and the stack can have multiple variables pushed and popped.\n\nWait, maybe the variables are all the unique identifiers in the program that are pushed onto the stack. Each '!' command uses one, but the order in which they are used depends on the stack's state.\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nLet me think about the example provided.\n\nIn the sample input, the outputs are sequences like '0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101'. So, each output is a string of digits, varying in length.\n\nLooking at the first output '0010' which is four digits. So, perhaps the program requires four variables.\n\nWait, but the first line of the sample input is a string starting with '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' — perhaps this is a Befunge program that uses four variables.\n\nHmm, perhaps the number of variables is equal to the number of '!' commands in the program.\n\nWait, no, because each '!' command pops a variable, but the same variable can be pushed multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, each '!' command requires a new variable to be pushed before it. But that's not necessarily true because variables can be reused.\n\nWait, but in Befunge, variables are stored on the stack. So, if you push a, then push b, then '!' pops b. Then, if you push c, then '!' pops c. So, the '!' commands consume the variables in the order they are pushed, but each '!' takes the top of the stack, which is the latest pushed.\n\nSo, the variables used in '!' are the ones that were pushed, and the order in which they are popped is the reverse of their pushing order.\n\nSo, the variables are in the order of their pushing, but each '!' takes the last one.\n\nWait, perhaps the variables are determined by the order in which they are pushed, and each '!' command takes the last one. So, the first '!' will take the last pushed variable, the next '!' will take the second last, and so on.\n\nBut this depends on the entire stack state at each step, which complicates things.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the program can be processed to extract the sequence of variables that are popped by '!' commands. Once this sequence is known, the variables can be assigned in such a way that each variable is assigned the smallest possible value, ensuring that the sequence is lex smallest.\n\nBut how to determine the sequence of variables popped by '!' commands.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the program as a finite automaton, where each state represents the current stack state, and transitions are based on the commands. For each state, we can track the variables that have been pushed so far.\n\nBut the state space would be huge, making this approach impractical for large programs.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to model the problem as a series of constraints. Each '!' command must have at least one variable on the stack at that point. Additionally, each command that pops variables (like '+', '-', '!', etc.) must have the correct number of variables on the stack.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find the earliest possible assignment of variables that satisfies all these constraints.\n\nBut again, this seems abstract.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Parse the Golorp's name into a list of commands.\n2. Simulate the program while tracking the stack and any variables that are pushed or popped.\n3. Determine which variables are pushed and in what order.\n4. Ensure that each '!' command has a corresponding variable to pop.\n5. Assign the variables in the order they are pushed, choosing the smallest possible digits to make the lex smallest sequence.\n\nBut how to simulate the program and track the variables?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that each '!' command corresponds to a variable being used, and the order in which these '!' commands appear determines the order in which variables are used. So, the variables are the ones popped by '!' commands, and their order is the reverse of their pushing order.\n\nWait, but this is only true if the stack is empty except for the variables pushed in order. If other commands modify the stack, it could interfere.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to a dependency graph where each '!' depends on the variables that were pushed before it. So, the variables are in the order of their pushing, and each '!' refers to the latest variable.\n\nThus, the variables are determined by the order in which they are pushed, and the '!' commands form a chain of consumption in the reverse order.\n\nSo, the first '!' in the program corresponds to the last variable pushed, the second '!' to the second last, and so on.\n\nIf this is the case, then the variables are simply the ones pushed in the order that they are pushed, and each '!' takes the next variable in reverse order.\n\nBut how can we determine the order in which variables are pushed?\n\nWait, perhaps the program can be processed into a list of operations, and each '!' command is noted. Then, the number of '!' commands determines the number of variables needed. Each '!' must be preceded by a sufficient number of pushes to ensure that the stack has at least one element when the '!' is executed.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Process the program to count the number of '!' commands. This gives the number of variables needed.\n2. For each '!' command, determine the number of variables that must have been pushed before it. For example, if a '!' is at position i, and there are j pushes before it, then the stack must have at least one element when the '!' is executed.\n3. Assign the variables in the order of their pushing, ensuring that each '!' has the necessary variables.\n\nBut this is still vague.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the problem can be viewed as a series of constraints on the variables. Each '!' command imposes that the stack has at least one element. Additionally, any command that requires popping two elements (like '+', '-') imposes that the stack has at least two elements at that point.\n\nThus, for each command, we can track how many elements are required on the stack. For example:\n\n- '!' requires at least one element.\n- '+' requires at least two elements.\n- '*' requires at least two elements.\n- '>' and '<' don't modify the stack, but may change the program pointer direction.\n- 'p' and other commands may push new variables.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be modeled by tracking the required stack depth at each step. Then, for each '!' command, we can determine the number of variables that must be pushed before it.\n\nBut again, how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal approach is to find the earliest possible assignment of variables that satisfies all the constraints imposed by the program. Since we need the lex smallest sequence, we should assign the smallest possible digits to the earliest variables.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Identify all the variables used in the program. Each variable is a digit from 0 to 9.\n- Assign the variables in the order they are pushed onto the stack.\n- For each '!' command, ensure that there is a variable available to pop.\n- To achieve the lex smallest sequence, assign each variable the smallest possible digit, starting from 0.\n\nBut how to identify the order of variables.\n\nWait, perhaps the variables are the ones pushed in the order of their first occurrence. Or perhaps the order is determined by the '!' commands, which refer to the top of the stack at each point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables are all the '!' commands in reverse order. That is, the first '!' corresponds to the last variable pushed, the second '!' to the second last, etc. So, the variables are determined by the '!' commands in reverse order, and each variable is assigned a value in the order they are pushed.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables are the same as the '!' commands, and the order is the reverse of their occurrence.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nLet me think about how to represent the program.\n\nEach command in the program can be processed, keeping track of the stack. For each step, if the command is a '!', then we need to have at least one element on the stack. If it's a '+' or '-', we need at least two elements. And so on.\n\nSo, perhaps the simulation approach is necessary. We can model the stack and track the required variables.\n\nBut the problem is that the simulation needs to account for all possible variable assignments, which is impossible due to the exponential possibilities.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the program as a finite automaton that tracks the stack's state, but with the variables being the stack contents. But again, this is impractical for large programs.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps the minimal lex sequence is achieved by assigning the earliest possible variables (those pushed first) the smallest possible digits, ensuring that the '!' commands can be satisfied.\n\nBut how to determine which variables are pushed first.\n\nWait, perhaps the variables are determined by the order in which they are pushed onto the stack. So, the first variable is the first to be pushed, the second is the second, etc. Each '!' command pops the last variable pushed, so the '!' commands consume variables in the reverse order of their pushing.\n\nThus, the variables are in the order they are pushed, and the '!' commands use them in reverse.\n\nSo, the output is the sequence of variables in the order they are pushed.\n\nNow, the problem becomes determining which variables are pushed, in which order, such that all '!' commands have a variable to consume.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother Idea: Each '!' command requires that a certain variable is available. So, the variables are determined by the '!' commands in the order they appear. But this doesn't capture the stack dynamics.\n\nWait, perhaps the variables are the same as the '!' commands, and each '!' command corresponds to a variable that must be present. The order of the variables is the order of the '!' commands.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables are the same as the number of '!' commands, and each '!' corresponds to a variable. The variables are assigned in the order of the '!' commands.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nLet me think of a small example.\n\nSuppose the program is:\n\n?+:+:!\n\nWhich is a Befunge program that adds two numbers, then prints the sum.\n\nIn this case, the program pushes two variables (say x and y), then adds them, then prints the result.\n\nBut in our problem, variables are popped via '!', not printed. So perhaps the example isn't directly applicable.\n\nAnother example: suppose the program is \"?!?\", which would push a variable, then pop it, then pop again, but since the stack is empty, it would fail.\n\nSo, the program is invalid because the second '!' has nothing to pop.\n\nThus, the output would be 'false'.\n\nSo, in this case, the first '!' pops the variable, but the second '!' has nothing, so it's invalid.\n\nThus, the problem is to find a way to assign variables so that every '!' has a variable to pop.\n\nSo, perhaps the variables are the ones that are pushed, and each '!' corresponds to a variable being popped.\n\nThus, the variables are pushed in the order of their pushing, and the '!' commands pop them in reverse order.\n\nSo, for example, if the program is:\n\npush a\npush b\n!\n!\n\nThen the '!' commands pop b and then a. So, the variables are a and b, pushed in that order. The '!'s use them in reverse.\n\nThus, the output would be a, b, assigned in that order.\n\nSo, to get the lex smallest sequence, we'd assign a=0, b=1, giving 01.\n\nWait, but the output is the variables in the order they are pushed. So, the output would be '01' for a=0, b=1.\n\nSo, the variables are pushed in the order a, then b, so the output is a, b.\n\nThus, the order of variables in the output is the order of their pushing.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to determining the order of variables pushed, and ensuring that each '!' command can pop a variable.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each '!' command, we can track the required number of variables that must have been pushed before it. Then, the variables are determined by the '!' commands in reverse order, each requiring a variable to have been pushed before.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the variables can be determined by the '!' commands, and their order is the reverse of the '!' command positions.\n\nWait, for example, if the '!' commands are at positions 5, 3, and 1 in the program, then the variables are v1, v2, v3, pushed in that order. So, v1 is pushed first, v2 second, v3 third. Then, the '!'s pop v3, then v2, then v1.\n\nThus, the output is v1, v2, v3.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nThis suggests that the variables are in the order of their '!' commands in the reverse order of their occurrence.\n\nSo, the first '!' in the program corresponds to the last variable pushed, the next '!' to the second last, and so on.\n\nThus, the variables are ordered based on the '!' commands, in reverse order of their occurrence.\n\nSo, the first '!' in the program is the last variable in the output, the second '!' is the second last, etc.\n\nThus, the output is a list of variables, each corresponding to a '!' command, in the reverse order of their occurrence.\n\nThus, the number of variables is equal to the number of '!' commands in the program.\n\nEach '!' command must have been preceded by enough pushes to ensure that the stack has the required number of elements when the '!' is executed.\n\nSo, the problem now is:\n\n1. Count the number of '!' commands in the program. Let's call this n. If n is zero, then no variables are needed, so output an empty string?\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is always valid, but it's possible that no variables are needed. Wait, looking back: the problem says the input is guaranteed to be valid, but perhaps 'valid' refers to being a correct Befunge-like program, not necessarily that it needs variables.\n\nWait, no. Because in the sample input, some outputs are 'false', meaning that the program couldn't be fed. So, the program can be invalid in terms of needing variables.\n\nSo, the first step is to process the program to count the number of '!' commands. If the number is zero, then no variables are needed, so the output is an empty string. Otherwise, we need to assign variables.\n\nBut wait, no. Because even if there are no '!' commands, the program may require variables to be pushed and popped. For example, a program that does '+' would require two variables to be pushed, but no '!' commands. So, the output would be two variables, but since no '!' commands, it's unclear. But according to the problem statement, the variables are only consumed by '!' commands.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws. So, perhaps the '!' commands are the only way variables are consumed.\n\nSo, if the program has no '!' commands, then no variables are needed, and the output is an empty string.\n\nBut looking at the sample input, all the outputs are non-empty or 'false'. So, perhaps the program must have at least one '!' command to require variables. Or perhaps it's allowed to have no '!' commands, but then the variables are not needed, so the output is an empty string.\n\nBut in the sample, the outputs include 'false' when it's impossible. So, perhaps when the program requires variables but can't find enough, it's 'false'; when it doesn't require any variables, it's an empty string.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnyway, let's proceed under the assumption that the number of variables is equal to the number of '!' commands, and each '!' must have a variable assigned.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Parse the program to count the number of '!' commands. Let this be n.\n\n2. For each '!' command, determine the number of variables that must have been pushed before it. For example, if the '!' is the first command, then the stack must have at least one variable before it, which implies that a variable must have been pushed before it. But if the '!' is the first command, and the first command is '!', then the stack is empty, so it's impossible.\n\nThus, each '!' command must be preceded by enough pushes to ensure that the stack has the required elements.\n\nWait, but how to model the required pushes for each '!' command.\n\nPerhaps for each '!' command, we can track how many variables are pushed before it. Let's denote this as k. So, the '!' command requires that the stack has at least m elements, where m is the number of variables required by the command.\n\nFor example:\n\n- '!' requires m=1.\n- '+' requires m=2.\n- '*' requires m=2.\n- 'p' requires m=1 (assuming p pushes a new variable).\n- '>' or '<' don't affect the stack.\n\nSo, for each command, we can compute the required number of variables on the stack, and for each '!' command, ensure that the required number is met.\n\nBut again, how to model this for a 1024-length program.\n\nAlternative Idea: Model the program as a series of constraints on the variables. Each '!' command requires that a certain variable is present, and the order in which variables are pushed determines the order of the output.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to find the earliest possible variable assignments that satisfy all constraints, with the lex smallest sequence.\n\nSo, the variables are assigned in the order they are pushed, and each '!' command refers to the last pushed variable.\n\nThus, the variables are in the order they are pushed, and the '!' commands use them in reverse order.\n\nSo, for the lex smallest sequence, assign the earliest possible variables the smallest possible digits.\n\nThus, the first variable pushed is assigned 0, the second 0, etc., unless a '!' command requires a higher digit.\n\nWait, but the '!' commands may require variables to be popped, which may impose constraints on the variables.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to a series of constraints on the variables, where each '!' command requires that the corresponding variable is greater than or equal to 0, but this is always true since variables are digits 0-9.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nPerhaps I should look for patterns or simplifications.\n\nAnother Idea: The minimal lex sequence is obtained by assigning the earliest variables (the first few pushed variables) the smallest possible digits, starting from 0, and ensuring that the '!' commands can be satisfied.\n\nThus, the variables are pushed in a certain order, say v1, v2, ..., vn, and each '!' command corresponds to a vi. The order of the output is v1, v2, ..., vn.\n\nTo get the lex smallest sequence, assign each vi the smallest possible digit, starting from 0.\n\nBut how to model the constraints that each '!' can be satisfied.\n\nWait, perhaps the constraints are that for each '!' command, the variable it corresponds to must have been pushed before it.\n\nBut that's already implied by the order of '!' commands.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each '!' command must have a variable pushed before it in the program.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nPerhaps I should think about the problem differently.\n\nAssume that the program is a Befunge program, and we need to find a set of variables that, when assigned, allow the program to execute without errors.\n\nEach '!' command pops the top of the stack, which must have been pushed before.\n\nSo, the variables are the ones that are pushed, and each '!' command pops one of them.\n\nThus, the variables are the ones that are pushed, in the order they are pushed. The '!' commands consume them in reverse order.\n\nThus, the output is the variables in the order they are pushed.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the order in which variables are pushed, such that the program can execute without errors.\n\nOnce the order is known, assign each variable the smallest possible digit to get the lex smallest sequence.\n\nBut how to find the order.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the variables are determined by the order in which they are pushed. So, the first variable pushed is v1, the second v2, etc. Each '!' command pops the last pushed variable, which is vn, then vn-1, etc.\n\nThus, the output is [v1, v2, ..., vn].\n\nTo get the lex smallest sequence, assign each variable the smallest possible digit, starting from 0.\n\nBut how to ensure that the program can execute with these variables.\n\nWait, perhaps the constraints are that for each '!' command, the stack must have at least one element when it's executed.\n\nAdditionally, any command that requires popping more than one element (like '+', '*') must have enough elements on the stack.\n\nThus, the variables are pushed in the order v1, v2, ..., vn.\n\nEach '!' command corresponds to popping the last variable.\n\nThus, the variables are v1, v2, ..., vn, and the output is their values in this order.\n\nThus, the task is to assign each variable a digit 0-9, such that the program can execute without errors, and the resulting sequence is lex smallest.\n\nSo, the problem is similar to a constraint satisfaction problem where each '!' command imposes that the stack has enough elements, and each variable is assigned a digit.\n\nBut how to model the constraints.\n\nAnother Idea: The program can be simulated with a stack, and for each '!' command, record the variable it uses. Then, the variables are the ones recorded in the order of '!' commands. Wait, no, because '!' commands can be interleaved with pushes.\n\nWait, perhaps the variables are the same as the '!' commands, and their order is determined by the order of the '!' commands.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables are the ones that are pushed onto the stack, and each '!' command corresponds to consuming the top of the stack.\n\nThus, the variables are in the order of their pushing, and the '!' commands consume them in reverse order.\n\nThus, the output is the variables in the order they are pushed.\n\nThus, the problem is to determine the order of variables pushed, such that all '!' commands can be satisfied.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nPerhaps the key is to process the program and for each '!' command, determine the number of variables that must have been pushed before it.\n\nFor example, each '!' command must have at least one variable on the stack when it's executed. So, the number of variables pushed before the '!' command is at least the number of '!' commands that come after it.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, for each '!' command, we can track how many variables have been pushed before it. Let's call this count k. Then, the '!' command requires that the stack has at least one variable when it's executed, so k must be >= the number of '!' commands that come after it plus 1.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each '!' command, the number of variables pushed before it must be at least the number of '!' commands that come after it.\n\nBecause each '!' command after it will consume a variable.\n\nThus, for the i-th '!' command (in the order of occurrence), the number of variables pushed before it must be >= (n - i + 1), where n is the total number of '!' commands.\n\nWait, perhaps yes.\n\nFor example, consider the '!' commands at positions 3, 5, 7.\n\nSo, the first '!' is at position 3. At that point, the number of variables pushed before it is k. Then, the next '!' is at position 5, which requires that at least k + (number of variables pushed between 3 and 5) >= ... Hmm, maybe this is not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, for each '!' command, the number of variables pushed before it (including those pushed between previous '!' commands) must be >= the number of '!' commands that come after it.\n\nBecause each '!' command after it will consume a variable.\n\nThus, for the i-th '!' command (ordered from left to right), the number of variables pushed before it must be >= (n - i).\n\nBecause each of the (n - i) '!' commands after it will consume a variable, thus requiring that at least that many variables are on the stack when this '!' is executed.\n\nSo, for the first '!' command, the number of variables pushed before it must be >= (n - 1), since there are (n-1) '!' commands after it.\n\nFor the second '!' command, the number of variables pushed before it must be >= (n - 2), and so on.\n\nThus, the minimal number",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values that can be fed to a Golorp based on its name. The Golorp's name is given as a string resembling a Befunge program, where each character represents an instruction. The goal is to assign values to variables such that the program runs successfully without errors.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Variables and Constraints**: The problem requires us to identify the variables used in the program and ensure that each '!' command (which pops a value from the stack) has a valid value to pop.\n2. **Track Stack Operations**: As we process the program, we track the stack operations. Each '!' command must have at least one value on the stack when it is executed.\n3. **Determine Variable Order**: The variables are pushed onto the stack in a specific order. The '!' commands consume these values in reverse order of their pushing.\n4. **Assign Lexicographically Smallest Values**: To achieve the lexicographically smallest sequence, we assign the smallest possible digits (starting from 0) to the earliest variables.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    s = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    stack = []\n    beffuns =
