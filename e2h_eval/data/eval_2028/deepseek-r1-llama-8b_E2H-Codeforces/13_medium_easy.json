For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says that a major triad is formed when the three notes can be ordered such that the distance between the first and second is 4 semitones, and between the second and third is 3 semitones. A minor triad has the distances in the reverse order: 3 and 4 semitones respectively. \n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Convert each note into its position in the scale. Since the notes are cyclic, I'll represent them as numbers from 0 to 11 (since there are 12 notes). This way, calculating the distance between two notes becomes straightforward— it's just the difference in their positions modulo 12, right? But wait, the distance is always measured upwards, so I should take the positive difference. For example, the distance from C to E is 4 semitones, but from E to C is 8. Oh wait, no, because the distance is calculated as (E - C) mod 12, which would be 4, but if E is higher than C, that's correct. Wait, no— the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but considering that the scale is cyclic. So for any two notes, the distance is (Y_pos - X_pos) % 12. Because the scale loops around after H back to C.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The distance between two notes is the number of semitones going up from the lower one. So, for example, C to E is 4 semitones, and E to C is 8 (because you go up by 8 steps from E to reach C again). So, the distance is always the minimal possible when moving upwards. Hmm, but the problem statement says that the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppermost. So, perhaps the distance is always (Y - X) mod 12, but if that's more than 6, we consider the shorter path. Or wait, no. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement says: the distance between two consecutive notes is exactly one semitone. So each note is one semitone apart. Between C and E is 4 semitones. The distance is from the lower to the higher. So for any two notes, X and Y, the distance is (Y's position - X's position) mod 12, but only if Y is after X. If Y is before X, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X) mod 12? Or wait, maybe the distance is (Y - X) if Y >= X, else (Y + 12 - X). So the total distance is (Y - X) % 12. Because for example, if X is E (position 4) and Y is C (position 0), the distance is (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. Which matches the example given.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: the problem says the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. So C is position 0, E is position 4. So (4-0) =4. Correct. Now, E to C would be (0-4) mod 12= 8. But according to the problem statement, the distance from E to C is 8 semitones. So yeah, the formula is (Y - X) mod 12.\n\nWait, but wait. The distance is measured as the number of semitones from X to Y, moving upwards. So for any X and Y, the distance is (Y - X) mod 12. Because if Y is higher than X, it's the direct steps. If Y is lower, it's the steps going all the way around.\n\nSo, for any two notes, X and Y, their distance is (Y_pos - X_pos) % 12.\n\nNow, for a triad of three notes, say A, B, C, I need to check all possible orderings of these three notes. For each permutation, compute the distances between the first and second, and second and third. If any permutation satisfies either the major or minor condition, then the triad is classified accordingly.\n\nBut since it's an unordered set, we need to consider all possible orderings of the three notes. So, for each of the 6 possible orderings (since 3! is 6), check the distances.\n\nFor each ordering (X, Y, Z):\n\nCompute d1 = (Y - X) mod 12\nd2 = (Z - Y) mod 12\n\nIf d1 ==4 and d2 ==3, then it's a major triad.\nIf d1 ==3 and d2 ==4, then it's a minor triad.\n\nIf any of the permutations satisfy either condition, then the chord is major or minor. Otherwise, it's strange.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Create a mapping from note names to their positions. The notes are given in the problem statement as: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait— wait, the order is important here. Let me list them correctly.\n\nThe problem lists the notes as:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nWait, but wait— what about H? Because sometimes in music, H is not used, but in this problem, it's included. So the order is:\n\nIndex 0: C\n1: C#\n2: D\n3: D#\n4: E\n5: F\n6: F#\n7: G\n8: G#\n9: A\n10: B\n11: H\n\nYes. So I'll create a dictionary to map each note to its index.\n\nSo, for example, 'C#' is 1, 'H' is 11.\n\nOnce I have this, for each input note, I can get their numerical values.\n\nThen, for each permutation of the three notes, compute the distances between consecutive notes as per the above formula.\n\nOnce a permutation satisfies either major or minor condition, we can classify the chord.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer will always be unambiguous. So no case where a chord is both major and minor. So, once we find a permutation that satisfies major or minor, we can decide accordingly.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read the three notes.\n- For each permutation of the three notes:\n   - Compute the distances between the first and second, and second and third.\n   - If any permutation satisfies major condition (d1=4, d2=3), return 'major'.\n   - Else if any permutation satisfies minor condition (d1=3, d2=4), return 'minor'.\n- If none do, return 'strange'.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, create the note_to_pos mapping.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nThen, for the input, split into a list of three strings.\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nThen, for each permutation of the three notes:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_pos = note_to_pos[x]\n    y_pos = note_to_pos[y]\n    z_pos = note_to_pos[z]\n    d1 = (y_pos - x_pos) % 12\n    d2 = (z_pos - y_pos) % 12\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nAfter checking all permutations, if none satisfy, print 'strange'.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but what about the ordering? For example, in the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: C E G → output major.\n\nIn the permutation C, E, G: d1 is 4 (E-C), d2 is 3 (G-E). So yes.\n\nAnother sample input: C# B F → output minor.\n\nWait, let's see. How is this a minor triad?\n\nLooking at the sample explanation: when ordered as B, C#, F.\n\nB is position 10, C# is 1, F is 5.\n\nWait, no— wait, let me list the positions:\n\nWait, let me recheck the note_to_pos mapping.\n\nWait, the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nSo their indices are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nSo for the sample input ['C#', 'B', 'F']:\n\nC# is 1, B is 10, F is5.\n\nSo in the permutation B, C#, F:\n\nx_pos=10, y_pos=1, z_pos=5.\n\nd1 = (1-10) mod 12 = (1-10)= -9 → mod 12 is 3.\n\nd2 = (5-1) mod 12 =4.\n\nSo d1=3, d2=4 → minor.\n\nThus, the code would find this permutation and print 'minor'.\n\nThe third sample input is 'A B H' → output 'strange'.\n\nLet's see why. So A is 9, B is 10, H is11.\n\nWe need to check all permutations:\n\nA, B, H:\n\nd1=(10-9)=1, d2=(11-10)=1 → no.\n\nA, H, B:\n\nd1=(11-9)=2 mod12=2, d2=(10-11)= -1 mod12=11 → no.\n\nB, A, H:\n\nd1= (9-10) mod12= 11, d2= (11-9) mod12=2 → no.\n\nB, H, A:\n\nd1=(11-10)=1 mod12=1, d2=(9-11) mod12= (9-11)=-2 mod12=10 → no.\n\nH, A, B:\n\nd1= (9-11) mod12=10, d2=(10-9)=1 → no.\n\nH, B, A:\n\nd1=(10-11) mod12=11, d2=(9-10) mod12= 11 → no.\n\nSo none of the permutations give 4 and 3 or 3 and4.\n\nThus, output is 'strange'.\n\nSo the code should handle this.\n\nWhat about some edge cases?\n\nLike, what if all three notes are same? But the problem states that it's a triad, which is exactly three notes. But the problem doesn't say they're distinct. Wait, the problem says 'a chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes'. So a triad is exactly three notes, but perhaps they can be the same? Or does it require three distinct notes?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"the teacher has given to him\" as a triad. But the problem says that the input is three space-separated notes. So, perhaps the input can have duplicates. For example, if all three are C, then it's a triad, but the distances would be zero, which is not 3 or4. So it would be 'strange'.\n\nBut our code handles this naturally.\n\nAnother edge case: the three notes form a major triad, but in another permutation. Like, perhaps the notes are E, G, C. Because E to G is 3 semitones, G to C is 5 (since G is 7, C is0; 0-7 = -7 mod12 is 5). So E, G, C: E-G is 3, G-C is 5 → no. So in another permutation, like E, C, G: E to C is 8 semitones, which is (0-4) mod12=8. Then C to G is 3 semitones. So d1=8, d2=3 → not matching major or minor. So perhaps that's not a valid major triad.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the major triad requires that the three notes can be ordered such that the distances are 4 and 3. So perhaps in this case, the correct order is C, E, G: d1=4, d2=3 → major. So the code would find this permutation.\n\nWait, but in the example I'm thinking, the notes are E, G, C. So the code would check all permutations, including E, C, G. So in that permutation, E's position is4, C is0, G is7.\n\nd1 = (0 -4) mod12=8, d2=(7-0) mod12=7. So 8 and7, which isn't 4 and3. So the code would not choose that permutation.\n\nBut then, in another permutation, C, E, G: d1=4, d2=3 → so the code would detect it as major.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the code needs to generate all possible permutations, compute the distances, and check for the conditions.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, create the note_to_pos mapping.\n\nThen, read the input.\n\nThen, for each permutation of the three notes:\n\nCalculate the distances.\n\nCheck for major or minor.\n\nAs soon as a permutation satisfies, output and exit.\n\nOtherwise, after all permutations, output 'strange'.\n\nSo, the code will look something like this:\n\nRead the input notes.\n\nCreate the note_to_pos dict.\n\nGenerate all 6 permutations.\n\nFor each permutation, get their positions.\n\nCompute d1 and d2.\n\nCheck conditions.\n\nIf found, print and exit.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nElse, print 'strange'.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nNow, testing the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'C E G' → 'major'\n\nThe code would find permutation C, E, G: d1=4, d2=3 → major.\n\nSample Input 2: 'C# B F' → minor.\n\nThe permutation B, C#, F: d1=3, d2=4 → minor.\n\nSample Input 3: 'A B H' → 'strange'.\n\nNo permutation satisfies, so output is 'strange'.\n\nAnother test case: suppose the input is 'C D E' → which is C, D, E.\n\nPositions: 0, 2,4.\n\nPermutation C, D, E: d1=2, d2=2 → no.\n\nC, E, D: d1=4, d2= (D - E) mod12 → E is4, D is2 → 2-4= -2 mod12=10 → no.\n\nD, C, E: d1=(0-2)=10, d2=(4-0)=4 → 10 and4 → no.\n\nOther permutations may not satisfy.\n\nWait, but let's compute all:\n\nAll 6 permutations:\n\n1. C D E: d1=2, d2=2 → no.\n2. C E D: d1=4, d2=(2-4)= -2 → mod12 is 10 → no.\n3. D C E: d1=(0-2)=10, d2=(4-0)=4 → no.\n4. D E C: d1=2, d2= (0-4)=8 → no.\n5. E C D: d1=(0-4)=8, d2=(2-0)=2 → no.\n6. E D C: d1=(2-4)= -2 mod12=10, d2=(0-2)=10 → no.\n\nSo none satisfy. Thus, output is 'strange'.\n\nAnother test case: 'E G C' → which is E, G, C.\n\nE is4, G is7, C is0.\n\nPermutation E, G, C: d1=3, d2= (0-7) mod12=5 → no.\n\nPermutation E, C, G: d1=(0-4)=8 mod12=8, d2=(7-0)=7 → no.\n\nPermutation G, E, C: d1=(4-7)= -3 mod12=9 → no.\n\nPermutation G, C, E: d1= (0-7)=5 mod12=5, d2=(4-0)=4 → d1=5, d2=4 → no.\n\nPermutation C, E, G: d1=4, d2=3 → yes. So major.\n\nThus, the code will output 'major'.\n\nSo the code seems to handle this.\n\nAnother test case: 'B C E' → which is a minor triad.\n\nWait, B is10, C is0, E is4.\n\nIn permutation B, C, E: d1= (0-10) mod12= 2, d2=(4-0)=4 → d1=2, d2=4 → no.\n\nWait, maybe another permutation.\n\nWait, perhaps B, E, C.\n\nB is10, E is4, C is0.\n\nd1= (4-10) mod12= (4-10) =-6 mod12=6 → no.\n\nHmm, perhaps another order.\n\nWait, perhaps E, B, C.\n\nE is4, B is10, C is0.\n\nd1= (10-4)=6 mod12=6 → no.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's think differently. What's a minor triad?\n\nIt's when the distances are 3 and4.\n\nSo, for example, the notes are B, C#, F.\n\nWhich is the sample input.\n\nBut in that case, the code works.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of another example: C, D#, G.\n\nWait, C is0, D# is3, G is7.\n\nSo, C, D#, G: d1=3, d2=4 → yes, minor.\n\nSo, code will find this in the permutation.\n\nThus, code will correctly output 'minor'.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nPotential issues:\n\nWhat if two notes are the same?\n\nLike, C, C, E.\n\nIn this case, for permutation C, C, E: d1=0, d2=4 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: C, E, C: d1=4, d2=(C-E)= (0-4) mod12=8 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: E, C, C: d1= (0-4)=8, d2= (0-0)=0 → no.\n\nThus, output is 'strange'.\n\nAnother case: all three same notes. So, C, C, C.\n\nEach permutation will have d1=0 and d2=0 → no. So output is 'strange'.\n\nThus, the code handles all cases correctly.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, importing itertools.permutations is needed.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nImport necessary modules.\n\nCreate the note_to_pos dictionary.\n\nRead the input.\n\nGenerate all permutations.\n\nCheck each permutation.\n\nOutput accordingly.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\nfor perm in permutations(input_notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_pos = note_to_pos[x]\n    y_pos = note_to_pos[y]\n    z_pos = note_to_pos[z]\n    d1 = (y_pos - x_pos) % 12\n    d2 = (z_pos - y_pos) % 12\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nTesting with sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: ['C E G'] → Output 'major'.\n\nSample Input 2: ['C# B F'] → Output 'minor'.\n\nSample Input 3: ['A B H'] → Output 'strange'.\n\nThus, the code should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. A major triad is defined by specific distances between consecutive notes, as is a minor triad. The goal is to check all possible orderings of the notes and classify the chord accordingly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Positions**: First, we map each note to its corresponding position in the musical scale. This helps in calculating the distances between notes easily.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: For the given three notes, generate all possible permutations. This allows us to check every possible ordering of the notes.\n3. **Calculate Distances**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n4. **Check Conditions**: Check if the distances match the criteria for a major or minor triad. If a permutation satisfies the major condition (4 semitones followed by 3), it is classified as a major triad. If it satisfies the minor condition (3 semitones followed by 4), it is classified as a minor triad.\n5. **Output Result**: Based on the checks, output \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" if no valid condition is met.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\nfor perm in permutations(input_notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_pos = note_to_pos[x]\n    y_pos = note_to_pos[y]\n    z_pos = note_to_pos[z]\n    d1 = (y_pos - x_pos) % 12\n    d2 = (z_pos - y_pos) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Mapping Notes**: Each note is assigned a position from 0 to 11 based on its order in the musical scale.\n- **Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible orderings of the three notes to ensure we check every potential arrangement.\n- **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated as the difference in their positions modulo 12, ensuring correct handling of the cyclic scale.\n- **Condition Checking**: For each permutation, we check if the distances match the criteria for major or minor triads. If either condition is met, we print the result and exit. If none match, we print \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and accurately determine the type of chord, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic for correctness.",
