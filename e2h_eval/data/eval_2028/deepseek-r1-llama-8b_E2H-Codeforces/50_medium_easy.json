    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem is called \"Tree Sum\". Hmm. The task involves counting something over all possible edge-weighted trees that meet certain criteria and then summing a specific value for each of those trees.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem defines a 'good' tree. The tree has n vertices, each edge has a weight of either 1 or -1. For each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges connected to i must be -1. So, for every node, the product of its adjacent edges is -1.\n\nWait, that's an interesting condition. So each node must have an odd number of edges with -1? Because if you multiply an even number of -1s, the product would be 1, which doesn't satisfy the condition. So each node must have exactly an odd number of edges with -1. But wait, in a tree, each node (except leaves) has at least two edges. So perhaps each node must have exactly one edge with -1?\n\nWait no, because each node's product is -1. So the product of all edges around it is -1. Since each edge contributes either 1 or -1, the product depends on how many edges are -1. So for the product to be -1, the number of edges with -1 must be odd. So each node must have an odd number of edges with -1.\n\nBut wait, since the tree is connected and has n-1 edges, each node can have varying degrees, but in a tree, except for the root, internal nodes have more than one child.\n\nWait, but for each node, the product is -1. So the number of edges adjacent to it that are -1 must be odd. So each node has an odd degree in terms of -1 edges.\n\nBut wait, in a tree, each node's degree is the number of edges connected to it. So for each node, the count of edges with -1 must be odd.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all such edge-weighted trees where for every node, the number of edges incident to it with weight -1 is odd.\n\nOnce we have all such good trees, we need to compute the sum of d(1,n) across all these trees, where d(1,n) is the sum of the edge weights along the unique path from 1 to n.\n\nHmm. So for each good tree, calculate the sum of the edges on the path from 1 to n, then add all those sums together.\n\nThe result needs to be modulo 998244353.\n\nNow, the question is, how do we compute this sum efficiently, especially since n can be up to 5e5.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the good trees.\n\nFirst, for a tree to be good, each node must have an odd number of edges with -1. So let's model this.\n\nIn any tree, each node's degree is the number of edges connected to it. So for each node, the number of edges with -1 among its edges must be odd.\n\nWait, but the tree is undirected, so the edges are two-way. So for each node, the count is based on the edges connected to it, regardless of direction.\n\nSo each node must have an odd number of edges with weight -1.\n\nThis condition must hold for all nodes in the tree.\n\nSo how can we construct such trees?\n\nLet's consider small cases.\n\nCase n=2: There's only one edge between 1 and 2.\n\nFor the tree to be good:\n\n- Node 1 must have an odd number of edges with -1. Since it has one edge, it must be -1.\n\nSimilarly, node 2 must have one edge, which must be -1.\n\nSo the only possibility is the edge is -1. So for n=2, there is exactly one good tree, and d(1,2) is -1.\n\nWhich matches the first example, where the output was 998244352, which is -1 mod 998244353.\n\nAnother example: n=3.\n\nEach node must have an odd number of edges with -1.\n\nLet's think about how to assign the edges.\n\nIn a tree with 3 nodes, there are two edges.\n\nWe need each node to have an odd number of -1 edges.\n\nSo let's consider the possible configurations.\n\nEach node has degree 1 or 2.\n\nWait, no. In a tree with 3 nodes, the root has two edges (like a star), but the other two nodes each have one edge.\n\nWait, no: for a tree with three nodes, it's a chain of three nodes, or a central node connected to two others.\n\nWait, let's say node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 2 is connected to node 3. So node 1 has degree 1, node 2 has degree 2, node 3 has degree 1.\n\nWait, but for each node, the number of edges with -1 must be odd.\n\nSo node 1: must have 1 edge with -1. Similarly, node 3: must have 1 edge with -1. Node 2 must have an odd number of edges, but it has two edges. So node 2 must have exactly 1 edge with -1.\n\nSo for node 2, one edge is -1, the other is 1.\n\nSo in this case, the edges could be:\n\nEdge 1-2: -1, Edge 2-3: 1. Then:\n\nNode 1 has one edge (-1): okay.\n\nNode 2 has one edge (-1): okay.\n\nNode 3 has one edge (1): wait, no, 1 is not -1, but node 3's edge is 1. So node 3's product is 1, which is invalid.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So maybe this configuration isn't allowed.\n\nAlternatively, let's try another configuration.\n\nSuppose node 1 is connected to node 2 (edge is 1), and node 2 is connected to node 3 (edge is -1).\n\nThen:\n\nNode 1 has one edge (1): product is 1 → invalid.\n\nSo that's no good.\n\nAlternatively, node 1 connected to node 2 (edge -1), node 2 connected to node 3 (edge -1).\n\nThen:\n\nNode 1 has one edge (-1): okay.\n\nNode 2 has two edges, both -1. Product is 1 → invalid.\n\nSo that's not allowed.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Or perhaps for n=3, there are no good trees.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Let's think again.\n\nWait, for n=3, each node must have an odd number of -1 edges.\n\nIn a tree with 3 nodes, there are two edges.\n\nEach edge is between two nodes. Each edge can be 1 or -1.\n\nWe need for each node, the number of edges connected to it that are -1 must be odd.\n\nSo let's denote the edges as e1 (between 1-2) and e2 (between 2-3).\n\nPossible assignments:\n\nCase 1: e1 = -1, e2 = -1.\n\nThen:\n\nNode 1 has 1 edge (-1): odd → okay.\n\nNode 2 has 2 edges (-1): product is 1 → invalid.\n\nNode 3 has 1 edge (-1): okay.\n\nSo node 2 fails.\n\nCase 2: e1 = -1, e2 = 1.\n\nNode 1: 1 edge → ok.\n\nNode 2: 1 edge → ok.\n\nNode 3: 1 edge → ok.\n\nWait, that's valid! Because each node has exactly one edge with -1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, node 3 has one edge (e2) which is 1. So the product for node 3 is 1, which is not -1. So that's invalid.\n\nAh, right. So this case doesn't work.\n\nCase 3: e1 = 1, e2 = -1.\n\nNode 1: 0 edges → even → invalid.\n\nNode 2: 1 edge → ok.\n\nNode 3: 1 edge → ok.\n\nNo, node 1 is invalid.\n\nCase 4: e1 = 1, e2 = 1.\n\nNode 1: 0 edges → invalid.\n\nSo none of the cases for n=3 work. So for n=3, there are zero good trees.\n\nWait, but that seems odd. Is that correct?\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing some other tree structure for n=3.\n\nWait, perhaps the tree is structured differently, like a star with node 1 connected to both 2 and 3.\n\nIn that case, node 1 has two edges, node 2 and 3 have one each.\n\nSo for node 1, the number of edges with -1 must be odd. So either 1 or 3, but since there are only two edges, 1 is the only option.\n\nSo for node 1, exactly one edge is -1.\n\nThen, for node 2, it has one edge, which must be -1.\n\nSimilarly, node 3 has one edge, which must be -1.\n\nSo node 1's edges: suppose e1 (1-2) is -1, and e2 (1-3) is 1.\n\nThen node 1 has one -1 → ok.\n\nNode 2 has one -1 → ok.\n\nNode 3 has one -1 → ok.\n\nSo this is a valid configuration.\n\nSo in this case, the tree is valid.\n\nWait, but in this configuration, the edges are e1=-1, e2=1.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nnode 1's edges: e1=-1, e2=1. So the product is (-1)*1 = -1 → yes.\n\nnode 2's edges: e1=-1 → product is -1.\n\nnode 3's edges: e2=1 → product is 1 → which is invalid.\n\nOh, right, so node 3 is invalid.\n\nSo this configuration doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, e1=1, e2=-1.\n\nThen node 1 has one -1: product is -1 → ok.\n\nNode 2: e1=1 → product is 1 → invalid.\n\nSo again, node 2 is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, can we have both e1 and e2 as -1?\n\nThen node 1 has two edges: product is 1 → invalid.\n\nSo no.\n\nWait, perhaps it's impossible for n=3. So for n=3, there are zero good trees.\n\nSo in the second test case, where n=2, the answer is 0, but for n=3, perhaps it's zero as well.\n\nHmm, but in the sample input, when n=2, the output is 0. So that aligns.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the sample input for n=2 gives output 0. Wait no: the first test case in the sample input is for n=2, and the output is 998244352, which is -1 mod 998244353. So perhaps my earlier analysis for n=3 is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the tree structure.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the case for n=3.\n\nIf the tree is a chain: 1-2-3.\n\nThen, for each node:\n\nnode 1: one edge. It must be -1.\n\nnode 2: two edges. So the product is the product of the two edges. So it must be -1. So the product of e1 and e2 must be -1. So e1 and e2 must differ.\n\nnode 3: one edge. Must be -1.\n\nSo node 1's edge is -1, node 3's edge is -1. Then node 2's edges: e1 and e2.\n\nSince e1 is -1, e2 must be 1 to make the product (-1)*1 = -1. But then node 3's edge is 1, which is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, e1 is 1, e2 is -1.\n\nThen node 1's edge is 1 → invalid.\n\nSo in this case, it's impossible.\n\nHmm. So perhaps for n=3, it's impossible to have a good tree.\n\nSo the answer for n=3 is zero.\n\nWhich would explain why in the sample input, the second test case is n=1, giving 0, and n=2 gives 998244352.\n\nBut back to the problem.\n\nSo the key is to find all good trees, then sum d(1,n) over all of them.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 5e5, it's impossible to process each tree individually. So we need a mathematical approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the good trees.\n\nEach node must have an odd number of -1 edges.\n\nIn a tree, the sum of degrees is 2(n-1). So each node's degree is variable.\n\nBut for the number of -1 edges per node, the sum across all nodes is equal to twice the number of -1 edges in the tree. Because each edge is counted twice, once for each endpoint.\n\nWait, no. Because each edge is between two nodes. So if an edge is -1, it contributes 1 to both endpoints.\n\nSo for each edge, if it's -1, it adds 1 to the count of -1 edges for both its endpoints.\n\nThus, the sum of the counts of -1 edges across all nodes is equal to 2 * (number of edges with -1).\n\nBecause each -1 edge contributes 2 to the total.\n\nBut in a good tree, each node's count is odd. So the sum is the sum of n odd numbers.\n\nWhat's the sum of n odd numbers?\n\nWell, each odd number can be written as 2k + 1.\n\nSo the sum is 2k_1 + 1 + 2k_2 +1 + ... + 2k_n +1 = 2(k_1 + ... +k_n) + n.\n\nSo the sum is congruent to n mod 2.\n\nBut also, the sum is equal to 2m, where m is the number of edges with -1.\n\nSo 2m ≡ n mod 2.\n\nWhich implies that n must be even, because 2m is always even.\n\nWait, because 2m mod 2 is 0.\n\nSo for the sum to be congruent to n mod 2, n must be even.\n\nOtherwise, the sum cannot be achieved.\n\nSo this suggests that for n odd, there are zero good trees.\n\nBecause if n is odd, then the sum of all node's -1 edges is n mod 2, which is 1. But 2m is even, so 2m mod 2 is 0. So 0 ≡1 mod 2 is impossible.\n\nThus, for n odd, there are zero good trees.\n\nSo, for the problem, when n is odd, the answer is 0.\n\nWhen n is even, there are some good trees.\n\nSo the first thing to note is that when n is even, the answer is non-zero. Otherwise, it's zero.\n\nThat's a helpful observation.\n\nSo now, let's consider n even.\n\nOur goal is to compute the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees.\n\nd(1,n) is the sum of the edge weights along the path from 1 to n.\n\nSo for each good tree, we need to add the sum of the edges on the path from 1 to n.\n\nHmm. How can we model this?\n\nPerhaps, instead of thinking about each tree, we can model the contribution of each possible edge to the sum.\n\nWait, each edge can contribute to d(1,n) only if it lies on the path from 1 to n.\n\nSo for each edge (u, v), if u is in the subtree of 1 when n is considered the root, or v is in the subtree of 1, then the edge is on the path from 1 to n.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nWait, the path from 1 to n is unique. So for any edge in that path, it contributes its weight to the sum.\n\nSo for each edge, we can determine whether it is on the path from 1 to n. If it is, its weight (1 or -1) is added to d(1,n).\n\nThus, the sum over all good trees of d(1,n) is equal to the sum over all good trees of the sum of the edges on the path from 1 to n.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as the sum over all edges of (the number of good trees where the edge is on the path from 1 to n) multiplied by its weight (1 or -1).\n\nSo, for each edge e, let c(e) be the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n. Then, the total sum is sum_e (c(e) * w(e)), where w(e) is the weight of edge e (either 1 or -1).\n\nBut wait, since each edge's weight can vary, perhaps we can split into cases based on the weight.\n\nWait, no. Because for a given tree, the edge e's weight is fixed. So for each edge, the contribution is either 1*c(e) or -1*c(e), depending on whether it's on the path.\n\nBut the edge's weight is variable across different trees. So perhaps we can model this by considering for each edge, how many times it is on the path across all good trees, regardless of its own weight.\n\nWait, but each edge's weight is part of the tree's configuration. So for each tree, the edge's weight is determined, and for each such tree, if the edge is on the path, it contributes either 1 or -1 to the sum.\n\nSo the total contribution for edge e is (number of trees where e is on the path and e is -1) * (-1) + (number of trees where e is on the path and e is 1) * 1.\n\nBut that's equivalent to (sum_{tree} (w(e) * [e is on path in tree])).\n\nWhich can be written as sum_{tree} w(e) * x_e, where x_e is 1 if e is on the path in that tree, else 0.\n\nSo, the total contribution is the sum over all edges of w(e) multiplied by the number of trees where e is on the path, multiplied by the probability that e is on the path.\n\nWait, no. Because for each tree, the edge's weight is fixed. So for each tree, the edge contributes w(e) * x_e.\n\nBut the total across all trees is the sum for each tree, which is the sum of w(e) * x_e for each e in the tree.\n\nSo, the total is the sum over all edges e of (number of trees where e is on the path) multiplied by w(e).\n\nBut since the edge's weight is either 1 or -1, perhaps we can model this as the expected value multiplied by the number of trees.\n\nWait, let me think differently.\n\nEach edge e can be either 1 or -1.\n\nFor each tree, the edge e is present, but whether it's on the path from 1 to n depends on the tree's structure.\n\nSo the contribution of e to the sum is:\n\n(number of good trees where e is on the path and e is -1) * (-1) + (number of good trees where e is on the path and e is 1) * 1.\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n[ (number of good trees where e is on the path and e is 1) ] - [ (number of good trees where e is on the path and e is -1) ].\n\nBut the number of good trees where e is on the path and e is 1 plus the number where e is on the path and e is -1 is equal to the total number of good trees where e is on the path.\n\nSo, let's denote T(e) as the total number of good trees where e is on the path.\n\nThen, the contribution of e is (A(e) - B(e)), where A(e) is the number of trees where e is on the path and is 1, and B(e) is the number where e is on the path and is -1.\n\nBut A(e) + B(e) = T(e).\n\nSo, the difference is A(e) - B(e) = (A(e) + B(e)) - 2B(e) = T(e) - 2B(e).\n\nAlternatively, A(e) - B(e) = T(e) - 2B(e).\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model this as E(e), the expected value of w(e) when e is on the path.\n\nWait, since each edge can be 1 or -1 with certain probabilities, but subject to the constraints of being a good tree.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the edges are assigned their weights after the tree structure is fixed. So the structure determines which edges are on the path, and then the edge's weight is chosen.\n\nSo, for each edge, the expected contribution is (probability that e is on the path) * (E[w(e)] given that e is on the path).\n\nBut E[w(e)] is (number of trees where e is on the path and w(e)=1) / T(e) ) * 1 + (number of trees where e is on the path and w(e)=-1) / T(e) ) * (-1).\n\nBut this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the edge's weight is chosen independently of the tree structure, perhaps we can factor the problem.\n\nWait, no. Because the structure of the tree affects whether the edge is on the path, but the edge's weight is a separate choice.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to the number of good trees multiplied by the probability that e is on the path in a random tree.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached using linearity of expectation.\n\nConsider that for each edge e, the expected value of w(e) * x_e, where x_e is 1 if e is on the path from 1 to n, else 0.\n\nThen, the total sum is the sum over all edges e of (expected w(e) * x_e) multiplied by the number of good trees.\n\nWait, no. Because the expectation is over all possible edge weights, but the x_e is a function of the tree structure, which is already determined.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this combinatorially.\n\nLet me think: for a given edge e, what is the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, and the edge e has weight -1, minus the number of such trees where e has weight 1.\n\nBecause each tree contributes w(e) if e is on the path.\n\nSo, for edge e, the contribution is (number of good trees where e is on path and e is -1) * (-1) + (number of good trees where e is on path and e is 1) * 1.\n\nWhich is equal to (total good trees where e is on path) * (number of times e is -1) - (number of times e is 1).\n\nBut each edge can be 1 or -1, and the rest of the tree must satisfy the good condition.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to (some function of e) multiplied by the number of ways to assign the rest of the edges.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAn alternative approach: for each edge e, let’s compute the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n. Let’s call this C(e). Then, for each edge, the contribution is the sum over all such trees of w(e), which is either 1 or -1.\n\nBut since the edge's weight is part of the tree's configuration, perhaps we can model it as the expected value of w(e) multiplied by the number of such trees.\n\nWait, but the edge's weight is determined as part of the tree. So for a tree where e is on the path, the edge's weight can be 1 or -1, and the rest of the edges must satisfy the good condition.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as follows: for each edge e, the contribution is equal to (number of good trees where e is on the path and e is -1) * (-1) + (number of good trees where e is on the path and e is 1) * 1.\n\nWhich simplifies to (A - B), where A is the number of trees where e is on the path and e is 1, and B is the number where e is on the path and e is -1.\n\nBut A + B = C(e), so the contribution is C(e) - 2B(e).\n\nAlternatively, the contribution is (A - B) = (C(e) - 2B(e)).\n\nBut how do we compute A and B?\n\nWait, for a given edge e, when it's on the path, the weight can be 1 or -1, and the rest of the tree must be a good tree.\n\nBut the edge e's weight is independent of the rest of the tree, except for the constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to the number of ways to choose e's weight, and then assign the other edges such that the tree is good.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the weight of e can be considered separately from the rest of the tree.\n\nWait, let's think: for each edge e, when it's on the path, it can be 1 or -1, and the rest of the tree (excluding e) must form a good tree.\n\nWait, no. Because the rest of the tree may include edges that affect the good condition of other nodes.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the good tree condition is independent of the edge weights, except for the parity condition.\n\nWait, but no, because the good condition is based on the product of edges around each node, which depends on their edge weights.\n\nThis is getting quite tangled.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to (number of ways to assign the rest of the edges such that the tree remains good) multiplied by the number of ways e can be part of the path.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem as follows:\n\nEach good tree can be viewed as a spanning tree where each node has an odd number of edges with -1. We can model the assignment of these edges as a system of equations.\n\nBut this seems too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has some symmetry or combinatorial property that allows us to compute the sum without enumerating all trees.\n\nLet me think about the sum over all good trees of d(1,n). Since d(1,n) is the sum of the edges on the path, perhaps we can find a way to express this sum in terms of the number of good trees and some other properties.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge e, the probability that e is on the path from 1 to n in a randomly selected good tree is equal to some value p(e), and then the expected value of w(e) given that e is on the path is some value q(e). Then, the total sum would be the sum over all edges e of p(e) * q(e) multiplied by the total number of good trees.\n\nBut how to compute p(e) and q(e)?\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, for a single edge e, what is the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n?\n\nIn a tree, the path from 1 to n is unique. So for e to be on this path, one of its endpoints must be in the subtree of 1 when the tree is rooted at n, or vice versa.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to fix the tree structure and then compute the probability that e is on the path.\n\nBut perhaps I can model this combinatorially.\n\nLet me think about the number of good trees where e is on the path.\n\nEach edge e connects two nodes, say u and v. For e to be on the path from 1 to n, it must lie on the unique path between 1 and n.\n\nIn other words, either u is in the subtree of 1 when the tree is rooted at n, or v is in the subtree of 1.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me clarify.\n\nIn a tree, the path from 1 to n can be found by moving towards the root. So, for edge e = (u, v), if u is the parent of v in the path from 1 to n, then e is on the path.\n\nSo, for e to be on the path, either u is in the subtree of v when considering the path from 1 to n, or v is in the subtree of u.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of trees where e is on the path is equal to the number of trees where the subtree of one of the nodes (say u) contains the other node (v) when the tree is built in a certain way.\n\nBut this is unclear.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the problem can be modeled using the concept of centroid decomposition or some combinatorial formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum over all good trees can be expressed in terms of the number of good trees, and some function of the edge.\n\nWait, let's think about the total number of good trees.\n\nThe total number is given as n^(n-2) * 2^(n-1). But we need to count only the good trees, which is a subset of these.\n\nWait, but the number of good trees is not immediately clear.\n\nWait, perhaps for each good tree, the assignment of -1 and 1 edges must satisfy that each node has an odd number of edges with -1.\n\nThis is similar to a system of linear equations over GF(2), where each equation represents the parity condition for a node.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a useful perspective.\n\nEach node's condition is that the sum of edges incident to it with -1 is odd. So, in terms of binary variables (let's represent -1 as 1 and 1 as 0), each node's sum is 1 mod 2.\n\nThe number of such solutions is 2^{k}, where k is the dimension of the solution space.\n\nWait, but for a tree, there are n-1 edges. So the system has n equations (one per node) and n-1 variables (each edge is a variable indicating whether it's -1 or 1).\n\nSo the system is underdetermined. The number of solutions is 2^{d}, where d is the number of free variables.\n\nWait, but the system may not be consistent.\n\nEarlier, we saw that for n even, the system is consistent because the sum of the node parities must be even, which is satisfied because each node contributes 1, and n is even.\n\nWait, the sum of the node parities is n, which must be even for the system to be solvable.\n\nWhich aligns with our earlier conclusion that when n is even, there are solutions.\n\nSo, when n is even, the system is consistent, and the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1 - r)}, where r is the rank of the system.\n\nBut what's the rank?\n\nIn the system, each edge is a variable. Each node's equation is the sum of adjacent edges mod 2 equals 1.\n\nIn a tree, the equations are connected. Let's see.\n\nIn a tree, the sum of the node equations is equal to the sum of all edges multiplied by 2, mod 2. Which is zero, because each edge is counted twice.\n\nSo, the sum of all node equations is zero mod 2.\n\nWhich is consistent with our earlier analysis that for n even, the system is solvable.\n\nThus, the system has rank n-1.\n\nWait, because the sum of all node equations is zero, which is an additional constraint.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum of all node equations is equal to the sum of all edges multiplied by 2, which is zero mod 2. So the sum of the equations is zero.\n\nThus, the system's rank is n-1, because the sum of all equations is zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the rank is n-1, leading to a solution space of 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 1. But that can't be right because for n=2, the solution space is 1.\n\nYes, for n=2, the system has one equation (for node 1 and 2). Node 1: sum of edges is 1. Node 2: same. But since the edges are the same, they're dependent. So the solution is unique, which is correct.\n\nSo for general n even, the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 1? No, that can't be. Because for n=4, the number of good trees should be higher.\n\nWait, perhaps the rank is n-2. Because for a tree, there's a dependency between the node equations.\n\nWait, perhaps the rank is n-2.\n\nIn any case, perhaps the number of solutions is 2^{n-2}.\n\nWait, for n=2: 2^{0} = 1, which is correct.\n\nFor n=4: 2^{2}=4.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of solutions is 2^{k}, where k is the number of cycles in the graph. But a tree has no cycles, so k=0, but that's not the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps this line of thinking isn't leading me anywhere.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the sum we're looking for can be computed as the sum over all edges e of the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the weight of e, which is either 1 or -1.\n\nBut again, this brings us back to the same problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum can be expressed as (number of good trees) multiplied by the expected value of d(1,n) in a randomly chosen good tree.\n\nIf that's the case, then we can compute the expected value of d(1,n) and multiply it by the total number of good trees.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to computing E[d(1,n)], the expected value of d(1,n) for a randomly chosen good tree.\n\nThen, the answer is E[d(1,n)] * (number of good trees) mod MOD.\n\nSo, let's compute E[d(1,n)].\n\nd(1,n) is the sum of the weights of the edges on the path from 1 to n.\n\nSo, E[d(1,n)] is the sum over all edges e of the probability that e is on the path from 1 to n in a good tree, multiplied by the expected value of w(e) given that e is on the path.\n\nBut the edge's weight is determined as part of the tree's configuration.\n\nWait, but in a good tree, the edge's weight is 1 or -1, but the choice is constrained by the good condition.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given edge e, the probability that it's on the path is p(e), and given that, the probability that it's -1 is q(e).\n\nThen, E[w(e) | e is on the path] = q(e) * (-1) + (1 - q(e)) * 1 = 2q(e) - 1.\n\nSo, the expected contribution of e is p(e) * (2q(e) - 1).\n\nThus, the overall expected value E[d(1,n)] is the sum over all edges e of p(e) * (2q(e) - 1).\n\nSo, the problem now is to compute, for each edge e, p(e) and q(e).\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the total number of good trees.\n\nLet’s denote G as the number of good trees.\n\nG = number of good trees.\n\nAnd let’s denote T(e) as the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n.\n\nSo, p(e) = T(e) / G.\n\nNow, for q(e), it's the probability that e is on the path and has weight -1, given that the tree is good.\n\nBut how to compute q(e)?\n\nAlternatively, for a given edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path and e is -1 is equal to the number of ways to assign the rest of the edges such that:\n\n- All nodes have an odd number of -1 edges.\n\n- The edge e is -1.\n\n- The tree is a spanning tree containing e on the path from 1 to n.\n\nWait, but this is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the weight of edge e is determined by the parity of the number of edges incident to its endpoints.\n\nWait, considering that in a good tree, each node has an odd number of -1 edges.\n\nSo, for edge e connecting u and v, if e is -1, then u and v each have one more -1 edge. So, the parity of u and v's -1 edge count changes.\n\nBut perhaps this is not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge e, the probability that e is -1 in a good tree is 1/2, assuming uniform distribution. But that's probably not the case.\n\nBut perhaps for a good tree, the edges are chosen such that each node has an odd number of -1 edges. So the probability that an edge is -1 depends on the structure of the tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the edge's weight is determined by the structure of the tree.\n\nWait, perhaps the weight of each edge can be considered as a Bernoulli variable, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: since the good trees satisfy that each node has an odd number of -1 edges, perhaps the number of -1 edges in the tree is fixed modulo 2. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but for each node, the count is odd. So the sum across all nodes is n mod 2, which must be equal to 2m mod 2, where m is the number of -1 edges.\n\nThus, n must be even, as before.\n\nSo, for n even,",
