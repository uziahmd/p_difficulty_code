He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing trailing zeros problem**\n\nI’m looking at a competitive programming problem, possibly \"A Trivial Problem\" (353A). The main task involves finding a number `n` such that the count of trailing zeros \\( Z(n) = m \\). I know \\( Z(n) \\) is calculated as the sum of the integer division \\( n \\) by powers of 5, and that it’s nondecreasing. It might be possible to use binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) where \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\), and for certain values, there may be up to five valid integers. The input format presents two cases, which looks a bit odd.",
