Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Parsing input for substrings**\n\nI need to parse input that seems to involve multiple test cases. The example indicates a list of strings, which probably means dealing with multiple lines. It looks like it comes from the CSES problem \"Palindrome? No, it's Longest Repeated Substring.\" The first line contains the string, but I should also process each non-empty line for results. My goal is to compute the longest substring that appears at least twice. I could use a brute-force method since the length is manageable, but maybe a more efficient approach with a set would work better.",
