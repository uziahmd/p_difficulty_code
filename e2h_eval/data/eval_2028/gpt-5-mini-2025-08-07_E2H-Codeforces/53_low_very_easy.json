Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Examining substring problems**\n\nI think we need to read multiple lines based on the example input that shows a list of three strings. This could relate to a typical problem from CSES, probably from Codeforces as well. We’ll read all non-empty lines and compute the longest repeated substring length for each. Given n is at most 100, using a brute force O(n^2 * n) approach should be fine. I’ll have to check how to count overlapping substrings correctly using find in a loop!",
