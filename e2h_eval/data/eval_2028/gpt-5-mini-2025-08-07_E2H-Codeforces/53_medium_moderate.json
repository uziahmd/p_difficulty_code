Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Implementing test cases**\n\nI need to implement a solution for multiple test cases, focusing on the input list like ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']. It looks like they want to process all non-empty lines of strings. I think I should read and strip whitespace from each line, ignoring any empty ones, then produce results for each line. The task is to find the longest substring that appears at least twice, which could lead to a brute-force complexity of O(n^3). However, for the given constraints, Python should handle it reasonably well!",
