Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Assessing substring lengths**\n\nI need to find the longest repeated substring length from a given string, which can be a bit complex. I could brute force it by checking all substring lengths from n-1 down to 1, but a simpler method is to keep track of seen substrings using a set. The complexity would be O(n^3), but since n is up to 100, that's manageable. The input appears to come from multiple lines, so I should read and process each non-empty line accordingly.",
