You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Clarifying input requirements**\n\nI’m realizing that the typical input format from CF has the first line as ‘a’ and the second as ‘s’. However, there might be multiple test cases concatenated together. The sample shows two examples as a list, so I need to implement it for a single case.\n\nTo handle this, I’ll read from input, trim extra lines, and select the first two non-empty lines for ‘a’ and ‘s’. I should also check if ‘s’ might be empty, and if so, ensure ’m’ is positive, making ‘s’ always non-empty. I'll sort the digits in ‘s’ in descending order. Then I’ll compare and replace characters in ‘a’ accordingly. Lastly, I’ll concatenate everything and print it!",
