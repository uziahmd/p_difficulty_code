            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Radio Towers\n\nThere are $$$n + 2$$$ towns located on a coordinate line, numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$n + 1$$$. The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."
