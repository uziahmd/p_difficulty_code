Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Implementing number printing**\n\nI need to print one number per input line, separated by line breaks. I'll read from stdin and utilize `read().splitlines()`, ensuring to skip any empty lines. The problem specifies that strings are non-empty, but I want to handle potential blank lines from file reading as well. I’ll compute the length of each string, create a set for seen substrings, and apply a nested loop to find duplicates. If none are found, I’ll return 0, ensuring that results print on separate lines. I'll keep variable names clear and handle newlines properly.",
