Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Implementing input processing**\n\nI'm thinking about how to implement reading all tokens from input, but I need to process only the first pair for safety. If the input has multiple test cases, I wonder how to detect that. The first integer is n, and then I expect the next n numbers. If there’s extra data, that could signal another test, but the problem seems to expect a single input instance. I'll write code to read the input, take the first token as n, and gather the next n tokens into an array. If there are extra tokens, I can ignore those. Now, I'll make sure to handle edge cases like converting to int, sorting, and computing the result. Time to produce the code!",
