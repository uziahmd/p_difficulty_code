Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Evaluating counting logic**\n\nI'm considering edge cases related to large counts, especially with values up to approximately 1e17. For my example with maximum values, I'll analyze the triangle count using a summation loop with a defined range. \n\nI’ll check specific examples to mentally validate my logic. For instance, in the first example with values A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, I found some contributions to the total matches. I feel confident I can implement this in code now!",
