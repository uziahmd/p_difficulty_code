Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements. The next line contains n space-separated integers a0, a1, ..., an - 1 (0 ≤ ai ≤ 104) — elements of array a.The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m. Number m equals .\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the maximum value of function f(x) for all .\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\n### Output\n['3', '27']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case m = 20 = 1, f(0) = 0, f(1) = a0 = 3.In the second sample m = 20 + 21 + 23 = 11, the maximum value of function equals f(5) = a0 + a2 = 17 + 10 = 27.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Exploring problem-solving strategies**\n\nI'm looking at a competitive programming problem called \"Find Maximum,\" possibly problem number 276C. The task involves an array and a binary string to calculate a maximum function. My approach includes using dynamic programming to compute prefix sums while considering the binary segments indicated by the string. The idea is to iterate from the highest bit to the lowest and maintain a current sum. I’ll implement this iteratively, focusing on choosing whether to set each bit or not to maximize the sum.",
