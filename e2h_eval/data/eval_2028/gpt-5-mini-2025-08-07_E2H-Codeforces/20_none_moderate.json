For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

For counting assignments that allow total <= T we need number of choices of c such that min(c,?) ...\n    # Use known solution: number of assignments with max multiset size <= T equals product over all nodes of min(k, T) + 1 for leaves? Actually need known CF solution: compute number of assignments where maximum flow <= T equals product over nodes of (min(k, T_sub)+1) where T_sub is capacity of subtree computed bottom-up as min(k, sum children caps)).\n    # Implement bottom-up: for threshold T, for each node compute s = min(k, sum(child_s)) for internal, and for leaf s = min(k,1)?? Wait.\n    # Correct approach: For given c_s chosen, maximum multiset size equals sum over leaves of x_leaf where x_leaf <= c_leaf and prefix constraints enforce for internal node s_count = sum children counts <= c_s. So max possible size is maximum feasible sum when each leaf can be unlimited but bounded by constraints; that's equal to min over cuts?? Actually it's value computed by pushing capacities: root capacity c_root bounds total. So maximum size = c_root where capacities propagate: effective capacity of node = min(c_node, sum children effective caps) with leaves effective cap = c_leaf. For full-length leaves, they have no children so effective=c_leaf. Then total maximum size is effective at root.\n    # Therefore for given assignments c_s, root_effective = result.\n    # We need count of assignments c_s in [0..k] such that root_effective <= T. Equivalently assignments where effective_root <= T.\n    # For fixed T, count assignments where effective at root <= T. For node, let E(node) = min(c_node, sum E(child)). So E(node) <= T iff c_node <= T or sum E(child) <= T. So number of assignments for subtree = (#choices of c_node in [0..k] with c_node <= T) * total_assignments_children + (#choices c_node in (T..k]) * assignments_children_where sum E(child) <= T.\n    # Let A(node) = number of assignments in subtree where E(node) <= T.\n    # Let B(node,s) = number of assignments of children yielding sum E(child)=s. But sum range up to maybe huge (2^depth * k) but T limited up to f,k <=2e5. But n<=15 so leaves <=32768; but T up to 2e5 manageable for convolution? We can clip sums at T+1: we only need counts of sum<=T and >T.\n    # So for child combination we need distribution of sum truncated at T+1. Use DP merging children with cap at T+1.\n    # For leaf: children none => sum_children = 0. For leaf node, E = min(c_leaf,0)=0 so E always 0; Wait leaf here corresponds to node at depth n which represents full strings; they have no children so sum_children=0; E=min(c_leaf,0)=0 always. That implies leaves never contribute? That's wrong: leaves are strings of length n representing actual items; they should be leaves with capacity c_s and their effective is c_s since they represent count of strings at that leaf. But earlier definition: children are next bit strings; for depth n nodes (length n) they are leaves and their \"children\" nonexistent so sum_children should be infinity? Correct model: For nodes of length < n, children exist (append 0/1). For nodes of length n, they correspond to actual multiset elements; E(node)=c_node (not min with sum children). So base: if depth==n: E = c_node.\n    # Then for internal: E = min(c_node, sum E(child)).\n    # So for DP we compute distribution of sum E(child) clipped at T+1. For leaf, distribution is: sum_children not applicable; but E=c_leaf so for purpose of parent sum, child contributes a value in 0..k; but we need distribution of E(child) values: for leaf, number of assignments resulting in E = v is 1 for each c=v (since c chosen = v), so count =1 for v in [0..k].\n    # For internal node, after processing children produce distribution cnt_sum[s] for s in 0..T and overflow bucket >T. Then for each choice of c in 0..k, E = min(c, s) where s is sum_children. We need count of resulting E values distribution. But to decide whether E<=T is always true as E<=min(c,s) and both within bounds; but we want whether E<=T which always true unless E > T which can only happen if c> T and s> T producing E> T? But E=min(c,s) so E> T iff both c> T and s> T. So E<=T unless (c> T and s> T). So for node, assignments where E<=T equals total_assignments_children * (number of c in [0..k] with c<=T) + assignments_children_where s> T * (number of c in [0..k] with c<=k but c<=? Actually if s> T then need c<=T to have E<=T; so count c in [0..T] = T+1) So general formula:\n    # Let total_child_assign = product of child total assignments.\n    # Let overflow_child_assign = number of assignments of children with sum_children > T.\n    # Then A(node) = total_child_assign * (T+1) + overflow_child_assign * (T+1)?? Wait double counted.\n    # Derive: For each children assignment (with sum s), number of c choices making E<=T is: if s<=T then any c in [0..k] works (k+1 choices) because min(c,s)<=s<=T. If s> T then only c in [0..T] work (T+1 choices). So A(node) = sum_{children assignments} (k+1) if s<=T else (T+1). So A = good_count*(k+1) + overflow_count*(T+1) where good_count = number of children assignments with s<=T, overflow_count = with s> T. And total_child_assign = good+overflow.\n    # So we need for each node the number of children assignments with sum<=T and >T, and total multiplicity (product of child totals).\n    # For leaf, children assignments count = 1 with sum N/A? For leaf, parent sees child E value which equals c_leaf in 0..k. So from leaf perspective, distribution: for child itself, the \"assignments\" count = k+1 possibilities leading to E=value; For parent combining children, we treat child's possible E values with multiplicity 1 each. So for leaf as a subtree when computing A(leaf): leaf has no children so total_child_assign = 1, and sum_children is 0? But our formula for internal derived used sum over children; for leaf we must compute A(leaf) differently: E(leaf)=c_leaf. So count of assignments where E(leaf) <= T equals number of c in [0..k] with c<=T -> min(k,T)+1.\n    # So implement recursion: For node at depth n: return (total_assign = k+1, good = min(k,T)+1) where good = number of assignments with E <= T (which is good_assignments), overflow = total_assign - good.\n    # For internal: children two nodes (binary). For each child we get (total_i, good_i). The number of children assignments where sum_children <= T? Need convolution of distributions of E(child) but we only know counts of assignments with E<=T, not distribution of sums. But children E values range up to maybe large; but for internal we only need count of assignments where sum of E(childs) <= T. With two children, and each child E value distribution is uniform? But we only know counts of values individually not distributions by value. So need full distributions per node up to T. So earlier simplification invalid.\n    # Due to time, fallback: implement DP computing distribution for each node: array cnt[s] = number of assignments of subtree yielding E(node)=s for s=0..T and cnt_over = >T. For leaf: cnt[v]=1 for v in 0..k clipped into >T if v>T.\n    # For internal: first get distributions for children arrays, then compute distribution of sum_s = convolution truncated at T+1. Then for each c in 0..k, resulting E = min(c, sum_s). For each sum value sval, it contributes to result[e] where e=min(c,sval) accumulating counts multiplicatively. Implement by for sum distribution sd[s] counts, then for c from 0..k: for s<=T: e=min(c,s). We'll accumulate. Complexity: nodes ~ 2^n, k up to 2e5 so iterating c up to k heavy. But note k large but values >T all map similarly: for c > T, min(c,s)=s for s<=T, and for s>T treated as overflow. But c ranges 0..k, but effect depends only up to T and \"greater than T\". So number of distinct c behaviour is T+2. We can aggregate counts: number of c in [0..T] each distinct, and count of c in [T+1..k] treat as same as c = k_big. So iterate c from 0..T plus one bucket for >T with multiplicity k-T.\n    # Now implement.\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    # build full binary tree nodes by depth using recursion\n    def dfs(depth):\n        if depth==n:\n            # leaf: distribution of E = c_leaf in 0..k\n            cnt = [0]*(T+1)\n            over = 0\n            if k <= T:\n                for v in range(k+1):\n                    cnt[v]+=1\n            else:\n                for v in range(T+1):\n                    cnt[v]+=1\n                over = k - T\n            return cnt, over\n        left = dfs(depth+1)\n        right = dfs(depth+1)\n        cntL, overL = left\n        cntR, overR = right\n        # distributions length T+1 with over count representing sum > T?\n        # But child's distribution has cnt[s] for E=s (s<=T) and over count representing E> T but we don't know their exact values >T; when summing two children, sums involving >T need careful: any pair where either child >T may still have sum<=T if other negative? but E> T >=0 so sum> T.

But children E values range up to maybe large; but for internal we only need count of assignments where sum of E(childs) <= T. With two children, and each child E value distribution is uniform? But we only know counts of values individually not distributions by value. So need full distributions per node up to T. So earlier simplification invalid.\n    # Due to time, fallback: implement DP computing distribution for each node: array cnt[s] = number of assignments of subtree yielding E(node)=s for s=0..T and cnt_over = >T. For leaf: cnt[v]=1 for v in 0..k clipped into >T if v>T.\n    # For internal: first get distributions for children arrays, then compute distribution of sum_s = convolution truncated at T+1. Then for each c in 0..k, resulting E = min(c, sum_s). For each sum value sval, it contributes to result[e] where e=min(c,sval) accumulating counts multiplicatively. Implement by for sum distribution sd[s] counts, then for c from 0..k: for s<=T: e=min(c,s). We'll accumulate. Complexity: nodes ~ 2^n, k up to 2e5 so iterating c up to k heavy. But note k large but values >T all map similarly: for c > T, min(c,s)=s for s<=T, and for s>T treated as overflow. But c ranges 0..k, but effect depends only up to T and \"greater than T\". So number of distinct c behaviour is T+2. We can aggregate counts: number of c in [0..T] each distinct, and count of c in [T+1..k] treat as same as c = k_big. So iterate c from 0..T plus one bucket for >T with multiplicity k-T.\n    # Now implement.\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    # build full binary tree nodes by depth using recursion\n    def dfs(depth):\n        if depth==n:\n            # leaf: distribution of E = c_leaf in 0..k\n            cnt = [0]*(T+1)\n            over = 0\n            if k <= T:\n                for v in range(k+1):\n                    cnt[v]+=1\n            else:\n                for v in range(T+1):\n                    cnt[v]+=1\n                over = k - T\n            return cnt, over\n        left = dfs(depth+1)\n        right = dfs(depth+1)\n        cntL, overL = left\n        cntR, overR = right\n        # distributions length T+1 with over count representing sum > T?\n        # But child's distribution has cnt[s] for E=s (s<=T) and over count representing E> T but we don't know their exact values >T; when summing two children, sums involving >T need careful: any pair where either child >T may still have sum<=T if other negative? but E> T >=0 so sum> T.
