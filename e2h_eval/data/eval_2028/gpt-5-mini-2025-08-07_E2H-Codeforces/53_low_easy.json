Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Considering input for processing**\n\nI’m thinking about the input structure. The examples suggest we might need to read multiple lines, as one input shows an array of three strings leading to an array output. The user provided multiple example lines, but the judge may only expect one string per run. This seems related to CSES \"Longest Repeating Substring,\" where we find the longest repeating substring. \n\nI plan to implement reading all lines, filtering out empty ones, and checking for repeating substrings with a specific approach.",
