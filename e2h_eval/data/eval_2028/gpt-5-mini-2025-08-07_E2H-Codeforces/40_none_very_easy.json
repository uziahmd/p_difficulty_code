            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Abnormal Permutation Pairs (hard version)\n\nThis is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$. Print the number of such pairs modulo $$$mod$$$. Note that $$$mod$$$ may not be a prime.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$mod$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 500$$$, $$$1\\le mod\\le 10^9$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer, which is the answer modulo $$$mod$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 403458273']\n\n### Output\n['17']\n\n## Note\nThe following are all valid pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ when $$$n=4$$$.  $$$p=[1,3,4,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,3,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,2,3]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,3,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,3,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,4,3]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,3,1,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,3,4,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,1,3]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,4,2]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,2,1,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,2,4,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,1,2]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,2,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,2,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,3,2]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,2,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,2,1,3]$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."
