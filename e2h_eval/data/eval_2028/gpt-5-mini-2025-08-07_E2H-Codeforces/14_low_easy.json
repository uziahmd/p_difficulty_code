He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Implementing solution for trailing zeros**\n\nI need to implement a solution where, given `m` (from 1 to 100,000), I find all `n` values that have exactly `m` trailing zeros. I'll define the function `count_zeros(n)` as the sum of `n // 5^i`. The next step is finding the minimal `n` such that `count_zeros(n) == m` using binary search. I want to ensure that if trailing zeros increase stepwise by 5 blocks, I output either 0 or 5 solutions. The input suggests that I may have to handle multiple test cases, but I’ll focus on reading a single integer initially.",
