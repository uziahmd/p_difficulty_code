Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about processing substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the number modulo 1e9+7. But directly applying each substitution step by step might be inefficient, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. If we naively replace each occurrence every time, it could lead to O(n * m) time where m is the length of the string, which might not be feasible for large inputs.\n\nSo, I need a smarter way. Let me think about how substitutions work. Each substitution replaces a digit with another string. But if we process the substitutions in reverse order, maybe we can track the value of each digit as a function of the substitutions. Wait, but substitutions are applied in the order given. So, for example, if a query replaces '2' with '00', and then later a query replaces '0' with '1', then the initial '2's would first become '00', then those '0's would become '1's. So the order of processing is important.\n\nBut if we model each digit's contribution as a value that can be computed based on substitutions, perhaps using dynamic programming or some kind of memoization. Let me think: For each digit d, we can track what its current expansion is. However, when a substitution is made for d, it affects all future substitutions that depend on d. So maybe we can represent each digit as a value that represents the current expansion of that digit. But since substitutions can overwrite previous ones, we need to track the latest substitution for each digit.\n\nWait, but substitutions are cumulative. For example, suppose we have a substitution for '2' to '00', and then another substitution for '2' to '11'. The second substitution overrides the first. So each digit's current expansion is determined by the last substitution applied to it. However, when a substitution is applied, it replaces all instances of that digit in the current string with the new expansion. But if we process the substitutions in order, and track for each digit what it's replaced with, perhaps we can model the entire process as building a tree of replacements.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: instead of modifying the string each time, which could be expensive, we can model for each digit, what it's currently expanded into. Then, when processing the substitutions, we can track for each digit d, a function that represents the expansion. For example, initially, each digit d maps to itself. When a substitution is done (say, d → t), then any occurrence of d in the current string will be replaced by t. But when processing subsequent substitutions, we need to consider that the replacement of d is now t, and any future substitutions that refer to digits in t will affect that.\n\nBut how do we compute the final value of the string after all substitutions?\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose we have a mapping for each digit. Let's say that for each digit d, we have a value that represents the expansion of d. Initially, this is just d. When a substitution is made, say, d → t, then the expansion of d becomes t. However, when we process substitutions, we need to make sure that when we expand t, we use the current mappings for the digits in t. Wait, but if we process substitutions in the order they are given, and for each substitution, we update the mapping for d to be t, but when t contains other digits, those digits would have their own mappings. However, this seems like a problem because when we substitute, we need to replace all instances of d with the current expansion. But if the expansion of d is a string that includes other digits, which may themselves be subject to substitution.\n\nBut the key point is that substitutions are applied in sequence. For example, if we have a substitution for d, and then later a substitution for another digit e, which appears in the expansion of d, then the expansion of d would have to be updated again. But how can we track that?\n\nWait, no. Because substitutions are applied in order. Let me clarify:\n\nSuppose the original string is s. Then, for each query, we replace all occurrences of di in the current string with ti. So, the order of queries matters. So, if a query replaces d with t, and then a query replaces e with something, that affects any occurrence of e in the current string. However, if the current string has digits that were previously replaced, then those digits may have been substituted in prior steps.\n\nSo, for example, if the original string is 'd', and first we replace d with 'e', then replace e with 'f', then the final string is 'f'.\n\nBut if we have a substitution for d, then later a substitution for e (which is part of the expansion of d), then the expansion of d would need to be updated to include the substitution of e. However, in practice, the substitution for e is applied to the current string. So, if we have already replaced d with e, then when we do a substitution for e, it will replace all e's in the string (including those from the previous substitution). \n\nThis suggests that the substitutions are applied in order, and each substitution replaces all occurrences of a certain digit in the current string. Therefore, if we can model the effect of each substitution on the current string, but without actually building the string (which could be very large), we need a way to compute the final value modulo 1e9+7 efficiently.\n\nBut the problem is that the string can become extremely long after substitutions. For example, if we replace a digit with a string of length 1e5, and there are multiple such substitutions, the actual string could be exponentially long, which is impossible to handle directly.\n\nTherefore, we need a way to compute the value of the string without actually building it. How can we do that?\n\nLet me think in terms of modular arithmetic. Since we need the final value mod 1e9+7, perhaps we can model the value of each substitution as a number, and track how substitutions affect the overall value.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think recursively. Suppose that for each digit d, we have a value v_d which represents the number that the expansion of d would contribute when processed. But since substitutions can change the expansion of d, we need to track this value dynamically.\n\nFor example, when a substitution is made for d, replacing it with t, then the value of d becomes the value of t. But how to compute the value of t? Because t is a string of digits, which can be processed by substituting each digit in t according to their current mappings.\n\nWait, but the substitution is applied in order. So, when we process a substitution \"d -> t\", the current expansion of d is set to t. However, the t may contain digits that have their own expansions. But when the substitution is applied, the t is treated as a literal string. Wait no, because when the substitution is applied, all instances of d in the current string are replaced by t. However, after this substitution, any further substitutions would apply to the digits in t.\n\nSo, for example, if the current string is 'd', and we first substitute d with 'e', then the string is 'e'. Then, if we substitute e with 'f', the string becomes 'f'.\n\nBut if we substitute d with 'e' first, then substitute e with 'f', then the expansion of d would be 'e', but after the substitution of e, the expansion of d would still be 'e', unless we reprocess the substitution for d again.\n\nWait, no. The substitution is applied to the string. So, the substitution for d is applied once, and then when we substitute e, that only affects the current string, which may have e's generated from previous substitutions.\n\nSo, the problem is that the substitutions are applied to the string, which is modified in place. But if we want to avoid building the string, perhaps we can model the effect of substitutions on the value of the string.\n\nHere's an idea: we can represent for each digit d, the value that would be generated if we expand d according to all substitutions up to now. Then, when a substitution occurs, we can compute the value of the new expansion (t) based on the current mappings of the digits in t. Then, for the current substitution, we can update the value of d to be the value of t. However, this approach may not account for leading zeros or the way numbers are formed, but perhaps it can be adjusted.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when you represent s as a decimal number, you ignore leading zeros. However, the actual calculation requires considering the entire string as a number, but leading zeros are ignored. However, the modulo operation is applied to the actual numeric value. For example, if the string is \"000\", the number is zero, which mod 1e9+7 is zero. Similarly, \"00123\" is 123 mod MOD.\n\nBut how can we compute the numeric value of the string after substitutions, taking into account that leading zeros are ignored?\n\nHmm. That complicates things. Because the numeric value depends on the entire string, but leading zeros are ignored. So, for example, the string \"000\" is considered as zero. However, the string \"00123\" is considered as 123. So, the problem is that leading zeros don't contribute to the value, but trailing zeros do. So, the value is the number formed by the string after stripping leading zeros, or zero if the string is empty.\n\nThis makes it tricky to compute the value mod MOD, because we need to know whether there are any non-zero digits in the string. However, during substitutions, leading zeros can be introduced, but they are not part of the actual numeric value.\n\nBut how to track this? Because if the entire string is made of zeros, then the value is zero. Otherwise, the value is the number formed by the string with leading zeros stripped.\n\nBut this seems complicated to track during substitutions, especially if we are trying to compute the value incrementally.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the final string. After all substitutions, the string is some s_final. We need to compute the numeric value of s_final, ignoring leading zeros. But how to compute this value mod MOD?\n\nBut even if we can compute the value of s_final mod MOD, how can we do it without building s_final?\n\nThe key is that the numeric value of a string can be computed incrementally. For example, if we have a string s, and we append a digit d to it, the new value is (old_value * 10 + d) mod MOD. However, leading zeros complicate this, but perhaps we can track two things: the actual value mod MOD, and whether the string is non-zero (i.e., whether there are any non-zero digits yet). Once the first non-zero digit is encountered, the leading zeros are ignored, and all subsequent digits contribute to the value.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model the value of the string as follows:\n\n- We track two variables: the current value mod MOD, and a flag indicating whether the string has started (i.e., whether there have been any non-zero digits so far).\n\n- For each character in the string, when processing it, if the flag is not started (i.e., leading zeros), then if the character is zero, we ignore it (so the value remains 0 and the flag remains false). If it's non-zero, then we start the flag and add the digit to the value. For subsequent digits, we multiply the current value by 10, add the digit, and mod by MOD.\n\nBut how does this apply when substitutions are happening?\n\nWait, but substitutions can replace digits with strings. So, the original string s is processed through substitutions, and the final string is s_final. But how can we compute the value of s_final mod MOD, given that substitutions are applied in sequence?\n\nAn alternative idea is to represent the entire process as a series of operations that can be modeled using the above approach (tracking the value and the started flag). However, since substitutions can replace digits with arbitrary strings, we need to find a way to compute the effect of each substitution on the overall value.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the initial string and the substitutions. Each substitution replaces all occurrences of a certain digit with a certain string. So, the process is similar to expanding the initial string with the substitutions, but the substitutions are applied in order.\n\nBut how can we model this expansion in terms of the value mod MOD?\n\nLet me consider that each substitution is applied to the current string. So, the first substitution replaces all instances of d1 with t1. The second substitution replaces all instances of d2 with t2, etc. But each substitution can be considered as a transformation on the current value.\n\nBut how to model this? For example, if the current value is V, and we replace all occurrences of a digit d with a string t, how does this affect the value of the entire string?\n\nThis seems challenging. Because the value of the entire string depends on the positions of the digits. Replacing a digit with a longer string would change the way digits are ordered, which affects the value.\n\nSo, perhaps the only feasible way is to model for each digit, the value that it contributes when expanded, and track how substitutions affect these values.\n\nLet me think again. Suppose we have a mapping for each digit, which is the expansion of that digit. For example, initially, each digit maps to itself. When a substitution is applied, say, d → t, then the mapping for d is updated to t. However, the expansion of t may involve other digits, which have their own mappings. So, the value of d's expansion is the value of the string t, where each digit in t is replaced by their current expansion.\n\nWait, but how to compute the value of the expansion of t?\n\nLet's imagine that for each digit, we have a value that represents the numeric value of the expansion of that digit. However, this value must take into account the leading zeros. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model for each digit, the value of the expansion as a number, and also track the length of the expansion (the number of digits) so that when we replace a digit with a string, we can compute the contribution to the overall value.\n\nBut this seems complex. Let me try to formalize it.\n\nLet's say that for each digit d, we have two things:\n\n- A value v[d], which represents the numeric value of the expansion of d, ignoring leading zeros. But how to compute this?\n\n- A length l[d], which is the length of the expansion of d. This is useful when combining digits, because when you have a sequence of digits, the value depends on their order.\n\nBut when you replace a digit d with a string t, which has a certain value and length, how does that affect the value of the current string?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as follows: the initial string is a sequence of digits. Each substitution replaces all instances of a digit with a string. The final string is the result of applying all substitutions in order. To compute the value of this string mod MOD, we need to process the substitutions in a way that allows us to compute the value without building the entire string.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. Instead of processing the substitutions on the string, we can model the effect of substitutions on the value of the string.\n\nLet's think of the entire process as a series of transformations. Initially, the value of the string is the value of the original string. Then, each substitution can be considered as a transformation on the current value.\n\nBut how?\n\nSuppose that we have a current string S, and we perform a substitution: replace all occurrences of digit d with string T. How does this affect the value of S?\n\nWell, the problem is that the substitution replaces every occurrence of d in S with T. The value of the new string depends on how the Ts are inserted into the original string.\n\nFor example, suppose S is \"d1d2d3...\" and we replace each d with T. The new string is T concatenated for each occurrence of d in S, and the rest of the digits remain. The value of this new string is the value of the original string with each occurrence of d replaced by T.\n\nBut how can we compute this value mod MOD?\n\nThis seems very challenging, especially if the original string is large. However, if we can model the value of the entire string as a combination of parts, perhaps we can find a way to compute the new value after substitution.\n\nLet me think of the value of the string as a function f(S). When we replace all occurrences of d with T, the new value is f(S'), where S' is the new string. But how to compute f(S') based on f(S)?\n\nLet me think of the original string S as consisting of parts that are not d, and parts that are d. Let's split S into segments that are not d and segments that are d. For example, S = A + d + B + d + C, where A, B, C are sequences of digits not containing d. Then, after substitution, S' = A + T + B + T + C. The value of S' is the value of A followed by T, then B, then T, then C. But how to compute this?\n\nThe value of a string can be computed incrementally. Let me think of the value of the entire string as follows:\n\nvalue = 0\n\nfor each character in the string:\n\n    value = (value * 10 + int(char)) % MOD\n\nBut this assumes that leading zeros are not removed. However, the problem says that leading zeros are ignored. So, this approach would not work directly. Because, for example, if the string is \"00123\", the value should be 123, but the above method would compute 0*10 + 0 = 0, then 0*10 + 1 = 1, etc., giving 123 mod MOD. Which is correct. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nOriginal string is \"00123\".\n\nProcessing each character:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nFirst character is 0: value = (0 * 10 + 0) = 0 mod MOD.\n\nSecond character is 0: value = (0 * 10 + 0) = 0.\n\nThird character is 1: value = 0 * 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nFourth character is 2: 1 *10 + 2 = 12.\n\nFifth character is 3: 12*10 +3= 123 mod MOD. Which is correct.\n\nSo, even with leading zeros, the incremental computation gives the correct value. Because leading zeros are treated as part of the number, but when you process them, they contribute 0 to the value. However, once a non-zero digit is added, the value starts accumulating correctly. For example, the string \"000\" would be processed as 0, which is correct. The string \"0\" would be 0, which is correct. The string \"001\" is 1. So this method works for the problem's requirements. Because the problem says that leading zeros are ignored, but when you compute the value via the incremental method, the leading zeros are automatically handled. Because the value is calculated as the number formed by the entire string, including leading zeros, but since leading zeros don't change the numeric value (as per the problem's note, leading zeros are ignored), the incremental method gives the correct value.\n\nWait, but for example, the string \"0123\" would be processed as 0*10 + 1 = 1, then 1*10 +2 = 12, then 12*10 +3 = 123. Which is correct. So the incremental method gives the correct value regardless of leading zeros. Therefore, we can compute the value of the final string by processing each digit in order, and the value is computed correctly as per the problem's requirement.\n\nSo, this is a crucial insight. Therefore, the problem reduces to computing the value of the final string using this incremental approach, but without explicitly building the final string, which can be very large.\n\nNow, the challenge is to model the substitutions in such a way that we can compute the value of the final string mod MOD, without actually building the string.\n\nSo, here's an idea: for each substitution, we can track for each digit d, the value that replacing d would contribute. However, since substitutions are applied in order, and each substitution replaces all instances of a digit in the current string, perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can maintain for each digit d, a value that represents the contribution of d when expanded. Initially, each digit d maps to itself. For example, if we have a substitution for d, then the value of d is updated to be the value of the substitution string t. But how to compute the value of t?\n\nBecause t can contain other digits, which may have their own substitutions. So, when we process a substitution d → t, the value of t is computed by processing each character in t, and for each character, using the current value of that digit. However, since substitutions are processed in order, the current value of each digit is the one after all previous substitutions.\n\nWait, but the substitution for d is applied to the current string. So, when we process the substitution for d, we need to replace all instances of d in the current string with t. However, the value of the current string after this substitution depends on the value of t. But how can we compute that?\n\nLet me think of the current string as a sequence of digits. Each substitution replaces all occurrences of a digit with another string. So, the entire process can be seen as a series of transformations on the string. However, instead of tracking the string itself, we can track the value of the string mod MOD, along with the length of the string (since the value of appending digits depends on the current length).\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose we have a value V and a length L for the current string. When we perform a substitution that replaces all occurrences of digit d with a string t, how can we compute the new value and length?\n\nBut this seems difficult, because the substitution replaces every occurrence of d in the current string with t. So, the number of times d appears in the current string determines how many times t is inserted. However, we don't know how many times d appears in the current string. Unless we track for each digit, how many times it appears in the current string.\n\nBut that would require maintaining a count of each digit in the current string. However, with substitutions, the count of digits can change dynamically. For example, if we have a string with k occurrences of d, and we replace each with a string that has m occurrences of some other digit e, then the count of e increases by m*k, and the count of d decreases by k.\n\nThis seems manageable. Let me think of maintaining:\n\n- For each digit, a count of how many times it appears in the current string.\n\n- The current value of the string mod MOD.\n\nBut how can we update the value and counts when a substitution is performed?\n\nLet me outline the steps.\n\nInitially, the string is s. The value is computed as the value of s mod MOD. The counts are the frequency of each digit in s.\n\nThen, for each substitution query (d → t):\n\n1. Find how many times d appears in the current string (count_d).\n\n2. For each occurrence of d, we replace it with the string t. So, the total contribution to the value from these replacements is:\n\n   For each occurrence of d, the value of the original d (which was contributing to the current value) is replaced by the value of t. However, this is not straightforward because the original d is in the middle of the string, and replacing it with t changes the way the digits are ordered, which affects the value.\n\nAh, this is the crux of the problem. Because the value of the string depends on the order of digits, and replacing a digit with a longer string changes the positions of the other digits. Therefore, simply knowing the counts of digits is not sufficient to compute the new value.\n\nThis suggests that maintaining the value and counts is not enough. Therefore, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: since the value can be computed incrementally, perhaps we can model the entire process as a series of operations that build the value. But how?\n\nAnother approach is to think of the substitutions as functions. Each substitution for digit d replaces it with a string t. So, during the substitution process, when we encounter a digit d, we replace it with the string t. This is similar to a recursive expansion. However, since substitutions are applied in order, the expansion of d is determined by the latest substitution for d.\n\nBut how to compute the value of the entire string after all substitutions?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: the initial string is s. Each substitution replaces occurrences of a digit with another string. The final string is the result of applying all substitutions in order. We need to compute the value of this final string mod MOD.\n\nBut since the substitutions can be applied in any order, and the final string can be very long, we need a way to compute the value without building the string.\n\nLet me think recursively. For each substitution, we can model the expansion of each digit. For example, for each digit d, we can have a function that returns the string expansion of d. However, since the substitutions are applied in order, the expansion of d is the latest substitution for d. So, for example, if we have a substitution for d at step i, then for any step j >= i, the expansion of d is the substitution string from step i (or later steps if there are more substitutions for d).\n\nBut the problem is that the expansion of d can be very long, and we can't store the entire string for each digit. However, since we need the value mod MOD, perhaps we can compute for each digit d, the value of its expansion mod MOD, and also the length of the expansion (number of digits). This way, when a substitution is applied, we can compute the value and length of the new expansion based on the substitution string.\n\nWait! This seems promising. Let me elaborate.\n\nFor each digit d, we can keep track of two things:\n\n- val[d]: the numeric value of the expansion of d mod MOD. This is computed as if we process the expansion of d as a string, using the incremental method.\n\n- len[d]: the length of the expansion of d.\n\nWhen we perform a substitution for d → t, we need to compute the new val[d] and len[d] based on the string t. However, the string t may contain digits, which have their own expansions. Therefore, to compute val[t] and len[t], we need to process each character in t and compute their contribution.\n\nLet me think of how to compute val[t] and len[t]. For example, if t is the string \"abc\", then the expansion of t is the concatenation of the expansions of a, b, c. So, the value of t's expansion is equal to (val[a] * 10^{len[b] + len[c]} + val[b] * 10^{len[c]} + val[c]) mod MOD.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nYes! Because when you concatenate two strings, say, A and B, the value of AB is (A * 10^{len(B)} + B) mod MOD. So, for the string t, which is composed of characters c_1, c_2, ..., c_k, the value of the expansion of t is computed as follows:\n\nInitialize current_val = 0\n\ncurrent_len = 0\n\nfor each character c in t:\n\n    current_val = (current_val * 10^{len[c]} + val[c]) mod MOD\n\n    current_len += len[c]\n\nBut wait, no. Because each character in t is a digit, which expands into a string. So, the expansion of t is the concatenation of the expansions of each of its characters. So, for example, if t is \"ab\", then the expansion is expansion(a) + expansion(b). The value of this is (value(expansion(a)) * 10^{length(expansion(b))} + value(expansion(b))) mod MOD.\n\nSo, to compute the value of the expansion of t, we need to compute the value of the concatenation of the expansions of each character in t.\n\nTo compute this, we can iterate over each character in t, and for each character, we multiply the current value by 10^len of the next character and add the value of the next character. But this requires keeping track of the accumulated value and the accumulated length.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nFor the string t, which is a sequence of characters c_1, c_2, ..., c_m.\n\nThe value of the expansion of t is:\n\nv = 0\n\nl = 0\n\nfor each c in t:\n\n    v = (v * pow(10, len[c], MOD) + val[c]) % MOD\n\n    l += len[c]\n\nSo, the new val for d is v, and the new len for d is l.\n\nThis seems correct. Because for each character in t, we are appending the expansion of c to the current value. For example, if the current value is V and length L, and we append a new expansion with value v_new and length l_new, then the new value is (V * 10^{l_new} + v_new) mod MOD, and the new length is L + l_new.\n\nTherefore, for the substitution d → t, we can compute the new val[d] and len[d] as follows:\n\nCompute the value and length of t's expansion using the above method. Then set val[d] = new_v and len[d] = new_l.\n\nOnce we have these values for each digit, we can compute the value of the original string s after all substitutions. How?\n\nInitially, the original string s is processed by expanding each of its digits according to their current val and len. Wait, but the original string is processed as follows: each character in s is expanded into its current expansion, and the value of the entire string is the concatenation of these expansions. So, the value of the entire string is computed by processing each character in s in order, and for each character, multiplying the current value by 10^{len of expansion} and adding the val of expansion.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nInitialize total_val = 0\n\ntotal_len = 0\n\nfor each character c in s:\n\n    total_val = (total_val * pow(10, len[c], MOD) + val[c]) % MOD\n\n    total_len += len[c]\n\nThen, the total_val is the value of the final string mod MOD.\n\nBut wait, what about leading zeros? For example, if the final string is all zeros, the value should be 0. But according to the above calculation, it would be 0. So this is correct.\n\nYes, because the incremental method handles leading zeros correctly. So, the approach is:\n\n- For each substitution, update the val and len for the corresponding digit.\n\n- After all substitutions, compute the value of the original string s by expanding each character in s using the current val and len of each digit.\n\nThis approach avoids building the actual string and computes the value mod MOD directly, using the val and len arrays.\n\nThis seems promising. Now, let's think about the steps needed to implement this.\n\nFirst, precompute the powers of 10 mod MOD. However, since the maximum possible len for a digit's expansion can be up to ... well, since each substitution can add more digits, but the sum of the lengths of ti across all queries is up to 1e5. However, during processing, the len for each digit can be up to something like O(1e5) per substitution, but for our purposes, we need to compute pow(10, len[c], MOD) for each character in the substitution string t. However, during the substitution processing, for each character in t, we need to compute pow(10, len[c], MOD) where len[c] is the current length of the expansion of c.\n\nBut computing pow(10, x, MOD) for arbitrary x can be done quickly using the built-in pow function with three arguments, which is efficient.\n\nBut during the processing of the substitution, for each character in t, we need to calculate 10^len[c] mod MOD. However, this can be done on the fly.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nInitialize for each digit d (0-9):\n\nval[d] = d (since initially, each digit maps to itself)\n\nlen[d] = 1 (since the length of the expansion is 1)\n\nBut wait, for the initial state, when the substitution hasn't happened, each digit's expansion is itself. So, the value is d mod MOD (which is d), and the length is 1.\n\nThen, for each substitution query:\n\nThe query is of the form \"d->t\", where d is a single digit, and t is the replacement string.\n\nWe need to compute the new value and length for d, based on the current val and len of each digit in t.\n\nSo, for the current substitution, we process the string t, and for each character in t, we get their current val and len.\n\nWe compute the new_val and new_len for d as follows:\n\nInitialize new_val = 0\n\nnew_len = 0\n\nfor c in t:\n\n    new_val = (new_val * pow(10, len[c], MOD) + val[c]) % MOD\n\n    new_len += len[c]\n\nThen, set val[d] = new_val and len[d] = new_len.\n\nOnce all substitutions are processed, we process the original string s as follows:\n\nInitialize total_val = 0\n\ntotal_len = 0\n\nfor c in s:\n\n    total_val = (total_val * pow(10, len[c], MOD) + val[c]) % MOD\n\n    total_len += len[c]\n\nBut then, the total_val is the value of the entire string after expansion. However, we need to consider leading zeros. Wait, but earlier analysis shows that the incremental method handles leading zeros correctly. So, even if the entire string is zeros, the total_val will be zero, which is correct. So, this approach is correct.\n\nBut what about the case where the final string is empty? According to the problem statement, if the string is empty, the number is considered zero. However, in our processing, the original string s has length at least 1. But substitutions can replace digits with empty strings. For example, if the original string is \"123\" and a substitution replaces '1' with empty string, then the string becomes \"23\". If all digits are replaced with empty strings, then the string becomes empty, which should be treated as zero.\n\nBut in our processing, how do we handle this?\n\nIn the initial setup, for each digit, len[d] is 1. But if a substitution replaces a digit with an empty string, then len[d] becomes 0, and val[d] becomes 0 (since the empty string represents zero). However, during the processing of the original string, if all digits are replaced with empty strings, then the total_val would be zero, and the total_len would be zero. In that case, the value is zero, which is correct.\n\nBut during the processing of the original string, if the total_len is zero, then the string is empty, and the value is zero. Otherwise, the value is total_val.\n\nWait, but in our code, even if the total_len is zero, the total_val would be zero. Because during the processing of the original string, if all characters are replaced with empty strings, then for each character in s, we process their val and len. But if the len is zero, then pow(10, len[c], MOD) is pow(10, 0, MOD) = 1. But val[c] is zero. So:\n\ntotal_val starts at 0.\n\nFor each c in s:\n\nnew_val = 0 * 1 + 0 = 0.\n\ntotal_len is 0 + 0 = 0.\n\nSo, after processing all characters, total_val is zero, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, this approach handles the empty string case correctly.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nInput: '123123', n=1, query '2->00'\n\nProcessing:\n\nInitial val for each digit is their value, len is 1.\n\nAfter substitution for '2' → '00':\n\nFor t = '00', process each character:\n\nFirst character is '0':\n\npow(10, len[0] = 1) = 10.\n\nnew_val = 0 * 10 + val[0] = 0 + 0 = 0.\n\nnew_len = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nSecond character is '0':\n\npow(10, len[0] = 1) = 10.\n\nnew_val = 0 * 10 + 0 = 0.\n\nnew_len = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nSo, val['2'] becomes 0, len['2'] becomes 2.\n\nNow, processing the original string '123123'.\n\nEach character is processed:\n\nFor '1':\n\nval[1] is 1, len[1] is 1.\n\ntotal_val starts at 0.\n\ntotal_val = 0 * 10^1 + 1 = 1.\n\ntotal_len = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nNext character is '2' → val is 0, len is 2.\n\ntotal_val = 1 * 10^2 + 0 = 100 + 0 = 100 mod MOD.\n\ntotal_len = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nNext character is '3' → val is 3, len is 1.\n\ntotal_val = 100 * 10^1 + 3 = 1000 +3 = 1003 mod MOD.\n\ntotal_len = 3 + 1 =4.\n\nNext character is '1' → same as before.\n\ntotal_val = 1003 * 10^1 + 1 = 10030 +1 = 10031 mod MOD.\n\ntotal_len = 4 + 1 =5.\n\nNext character is '2' → same as before.\n\ntotal_val = 10031 * 10^2 + 0 = 10031",
