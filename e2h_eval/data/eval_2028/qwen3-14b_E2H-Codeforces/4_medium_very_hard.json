The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players over n rounds. Each player has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. For each round, we need to determine who wins and count the number of times each player gets pinched (i.e., loses a round). The challenge is to compute this efficiently given that n can be as large as 2e9, which is way too big for a straightforward simulation.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since directly simulating each of the n rounds is impossible due to time constraints, we need to find a pattern or cycle that can be computed once and then multiplied over the number of repetitions.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the moves are determined. For each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of his sequence. Similarly, Polycarpus's move is B[i % k], where k is the length of his sequence.\n\nThe key here is that the sequence of moves for both players repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles. So, the pattern of moves between the two players repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. Therefore, if we can compute the number of wins for each player in one full cycle of LCM(m, k) rounds, we can multiply that by the number of full cycles in n rounds and then add the results from the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period.\n2. For each round in 0 to period-1, compute the moves of A and B, determine who wins, and count the number of wins for each player in this period.\n3. Then, calculate how many full periods are in n rounds (full_cycles = n // period), and the remaining rounds (remainder = n % period).\n4. Multiply the counts from one period by full_cycles.\n5. Then, simulate the remaining 'remainder' rounds to add their counts.\n\nBut first, we need to calculate the LCM. To compute LCM(a, b), we can use the formula LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So, we need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, so for positive integers, it's fine.\n\nBut since m and k can be up to 1000, the maximum possible LCM would be 1000*1000 = 1e6. Which is manageable because even if n is 2e9, the period is up to 1e6, so the per-period calculation is feasible.\n\nSo steps in code:\n\n- Read n, A, B.\n- Compute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n- Compute period = LCM(m, k)\n- Precompute for each round in 0 to period-1, what the moves are, and count how many times each player wins in that period.\n- Then, total wins for each player would be (full_cycles * count_in_period) + count_in_remainder.\n\nBut how to compute the counts for the period?\n\nFor each round in 0 to period-1:\n\n- Get A's move: A[ i % m ]\n- Get B's move: B[ i % k ]\n- Determine who wins, if anyone.\n\nSo for each of the period rounds, we can check the outcome.\n\nOnce we have the counts per period, then multiply by the number of full periods.\n\nNow, the remainder is n % period rounds. For those, we need to simulate each round from 0 to remainder-1, again checking the moves and adding to the counts.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, and period up to 1e6, this approach is O(period) which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nCompute the counts for one period (total_a_wins, total_b_wins).\n\nThen:\n\nfull_cycles = n // period\n\nremainder = n % period\n\ntotal_a = full_cycles * total_a_wins\n\ntotal_b = full_cycles * total_b_wins\n\nThen, simulate the first 'remainder' rounds (from 0 to remainder-1) and add their counts.\n\nBut how to simulate the remainder rounds? Well, for each i in 0 to remainder-1:\n\nget a_move = A[i % m]\n\nget b_move = B[i % k]\n\ncheck outcome and add to total_a and total_b.\n\nBut for remainder up to 1e6, this is manageable.\n\nSo the overall time complexity is O(period) which is O(1e6), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this correctly.\n\nNow, the next thing is to compute the outcome between two moves.\n\nLet me think: for each pair (a, b), determine if a beats b, or b beats a, or draw.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf a is 'R' and b is 'S', then a wins. If a is 'S' and b is 'R', then b wins.\n\nSo, the rules are:\n\n- Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n- Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n- Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\nSo, for a given a and b, how to check who wins?\n\nWe can write a helper function that returns 0 for draw, 1 if a wins, -1 if b wins.\n\nAlternatively, we can create a lookup table.\n\nLike, for each possible a and b, determine the result.\n\nAnother approach is to check if (a, b) is a winning pair for a. For example:\n\nif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R') → a wins.\n\nElse if (a == 'S' and b == 'R') or (a == 'P' and b == 'S') or (a == 'R' and b == 'P') → b wins.\n\nElse, it's a draw.\n\nSo, for each pair, we can check these conditions.\n\nSo, for each pair (a_move, b_move):\n\nif a beats b → Nikephoros wins → Polycarpus gets a spot (so increment Nikephoros's count? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus gets a spot. So the count for Nikephoros's red spots is the number of times he lost. So when Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a spot. When Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot.\n\nSo for each round:\n\nif a wins → Nikephoros wins → Polycarpus gets a spot → so Nikephoros's loss count is 0, Polycarpus's loss count increases by 1?\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck the problem statement:\n\nThe loser gets pinched. So, if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser. So Nikephoros's red spots are the number of times he lost. So for each round, if Nikephoros loses, his count increases by 1. Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\nSo, for each round, we need to check if Nikephoros lost (so Polycarpus wins) or vice versa.\n\nSo, for each round:\n\nif a_move beats b_move → Nikephoros wins → Polycarpus loses → so Polycarpus's count (second number) increases by 1.\n\nif b_move beats a_move → Polycarpus wins → Nikephoros's count (first number) increases by 1.\n\nElse, nothing.\n\nSo, in code, for each pair (a, b):\n\nif a beats b → polycarpus gets a spot (so add 1 to second value)\n\nelif b beats a → nikephoros gets a spot (add 1 to first value)\n\nelse: no change.\n\nSo, the helper function needs to return which of the two cases.\n\nSo, let's code this logic.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nFirst, read n from input.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nSecond line is A.\n\nThird line is B.\n\nBut looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is given as three lines: first line is n, second line is A, third line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first element is '7\\nRPS\\nRSPP' — perhaps that's the first line (n=7), then the second line is 'RPS' (A), third line is 'RSPP' (B). But the second part is another test case? Or perhaps the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the following:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nThe second line contains sequence A.\n\nThird line contains sequence B.\n\nBut the sample input shows something else. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nIn the example, the input is:\n\nInput:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nOutput:\n\n3 2\n\nBut in the given sample input, the user wrote ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR'] — perhaps that's a mistake in formatting. Maybe the actual input is three lines: first line is n, second line is A, third line is B. So for the first example, the input is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nWhich gives output 3 2.\n\nAnother example is input:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nWhich outputs 0 0.\n\nSo, the code must read three lines: first n, then A, then B.\n\nSo in Python, the code would read:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nBut in the sample input provided, perhaps the user had some other format, but perhaps that's a mistake. Anyway, the code should read the input properly.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement the helper function for checking the outcome between a and b.\n\nLet me think of code:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return 0  # draw\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        return 1  # a wins\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1  # b wins\n\nSo, for each a and b, returns 1 if a wins, -1 if b wins, 0 for draw.\n\nThen, for each round in the period, we can compute the result and count how many times each player loses.\n\nWait, no. For each round, if the result is 1 → a (Nikephoros) wins → Polycarpus gets a spot. So Nikephoros's loss count is not increased. So in this case, the second number (Polycarpus's spots) increases by 1.\n\nIf the result is -1 → Nikephoros loses → his count (first number) increases by 1.\n\nSo during the period processing, for each round, we check the result and accumulate the counts.\n\nSo, for the period:\n\ncount_a = 0  # number of times Nikephoros lost (so his spots)\n\ncount_b = 0  # number of times Polycarpus lost (his spots)\n\nfor i in 0 to period-1:\n\n    a_move = A[i % m]\n\n    b_move = B[i % k]\n\n    res = get_result(a_move, b_move)\n\n    if res == 1:\n\n        # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses → count_b +=1\n\n        count_b +=1\n\n    elif res == -1:\n\n        # Nikephoros loses → count_a +=1\n\n        count_a +=1\n\nSo, after processing the period, we have count_a and count_b.\n\nThen, the total number of full cycles is full_cycles = n // period.\n\nThe remainder is rem = n % period.\n\nThen, the total for the full cycles is (count_a * full_cycles, count_b * full_cycles).\n\nThen, we need to process the rem rounds, same way.\n\nSo for the rem rounds, we do:\n\nfor i in 0 to rem-1:\n\n    a_move = A[i % m]\n\n    b_move = B[i % k]\n\n    res = get_result(...)\n\n    if res == 1:\n\n        count_b +=1\n\n    elif res == -1:\n\n        count_a +=1\n\nThen, sum all.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B)\n\nCompute period = LCM(m, k)\n\nCompute count_a_period and count_b_period.\n\nfull_cycles = n // period\n\nrem = n % period\n\ntotal_a = full_cycles * count_a_period\n\ntotal_b = full_cycles * count_b_period\n\nThen, process rem rounds and add to total_a and total_b.\n\nSo, the code.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute LCM(m, k). Let's code that.\n\nIn Python, math.gcd exists. So:\n\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut note that for Python 3, math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor of the absolute values, so for positive integers, it's correct.\n\nBut m and k are lengths of the strings, so they are positive.\n\nSo, that's okay.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nNow, handling the case when period is zero? No, since m and k are at least 1, so LCM is at least 1.\n\nNow, for the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=7\n\nA = RPS (m=3)\n\nB = RSPP (k=4)\n\nSo LCM(3,4)=12.\n\nSo period is 12.\n\nSo for the first 12 rounds, we compute how many times each player loses.\n\nBut in the sample, there are only 7 rounds. So full_cycles is 0, rem is 7. So the code would process the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the counts are 3 for Nikephoros (so total_a is 3) and 2 for Polycarpus (total_b is 2). So the code should compute that.\n\nSo, the code should correctly process the rem rounds.\n\nNow, code.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nm = len(A), k = len(B)\n\nCompute period = LCM(m, k)\n\nCompute count_a_period and count_b_period.\n\nBut how to compute them?\n\nInitialize count_a_period = 0, count_b_period = 0.\n\nfor i in range(period):\n\n    a_char = A[i % m]\n\n    b_char = B[i % k]\n\n    res = get_result(a_char, b_char)\n\n    if res == 1:\n\n        count_b_period +=1\n\n    elif res == -1:\n\n        count_a_period +=1\n\nThen, full_cycles = n // period\n\nrem = n % period\n\nThen, for the rem rounds, do similar steps.\n\nBut for rem rounds, we can loop from 0 to rem-1:\n\ncount_a_rem = 0\n\ncount_b_rem = 0\n\nfor i in range(rem):\n\n    a_char = A[i % m]\n\n    b_char = B[i % k]\n\n    res = get_result(...)\n\n    if res == 1:\n\n        count_b_rem +=1\n\n    elif res == -1:\n\n        count_a_rem +=1\n\nThen, total_a = full_cycles * count_a_period + count_a_rem\n\ntotal_b = full_cycles * count_b_period + count_b_rem\n\nThen, print(total_a, total_b)\n\nSo, that's the code.\n\nNow, the code for get_result can be implemented inline.\n\nBut in Python, perhaps better to code it as a helper function.\n\nBut for speed, perhaps inline checks are better. However, for code clarity, perhaps using a helper function is better.\n\nBut since the code is for a programming competition, and the code is going to be run for n up to 2e9, but the code is O(1e6) for the period, it's manageable.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n is zero? But according to input constraints, n >= 1.\n\nEdge case 2: m=1, k=1. Then period is 1. So for each round, same moves. So for n rounds, check once.\n\nAnother edge case: when A and B are same sequences. For example, A and B are same, then all rounds are draws. So the output is 0 0.\n\nAnother case: when one sequence is longer than the other. For example, m=2, k=3. LCM is 6.\n\nNow, code.\n\nNow, implementing the code.\n\nBut in Python, for very large n, but the code is O(period) which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def get_result(a, b):\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            return 0\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            return 1  # a wins\n\n        else:\n\n            return -1  # b wins\n\n    # Compute period\n\n    period = (m * k) // math.gcd(m, k)\n\n    # Compute counts for one period\n\n    count_a_period = 0\n\n    count_b_period = 0\n\n    for i in range(period):\n\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n\n        res = get_result(a_char, b_char)\n\n        if res == 1:\n\n            count_b_period +=1\n\n        elif res == -1:\n\n            count_a_period +=1\n\n    full_cycles = n // period\n\n    rem = n % period\n\n    # Now compute the counts for rem rounds\n\n    count_a_rem = 0\n\n    count_b_rem = 0\n\n    for i in range(rem):\n\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n\n        res = get_result(a_char, b_char)\n\n        if res == 1:\n\n            count_b_rem +=1\n\n        elif res == -1:\n\n            count_a_rem +=1\n\n    total_a = full_cycles * count_a_period + count_a_rem\n\n    total_b = full_cycles * count_b_period + count_b_rem\n\n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input given in the problem:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nWhich gives output 3 2.\n\nLet me check the code for that case.\n\nLet me compute the period.\n\nm = 3, k=4. GCD(3,4) is 1. So period is 12.\n\nFor each i from 0 to 11:\n\nCompute the moves for A and B.\n\nLet's see:\n\nA is \"RPS\" (indices 0: R, 1: P, 2:S)\n\nB is \"RSPP\" (indices 0: R, 1:S, 2:P, 3:P)\n\nFor i in 0 to 11:\n\ni=0: A[0%3=0] = R; B[0%4=0] = R → draw. No counts.\n\ni=1: A[1%3=1] = P; B[1%4=1] = S. P vs S: S beats P? Wait:\n\nget_result(P, S): a is P, b is S. Check if a beats b. (P beats R, S beats P, R beats S). So P vs S: S beats P. So the result is -1 (since a is P, which is beaten by S. So the result is -1 → Nikephoros loses. So count_a_period increases by 1.\n\nWait, in the sample explanation, the first round is R-R (draw), then P vs S (second round?), but let's check.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, the rounds are 7 rounds. Let me see:\n\nThe sample input is n=7.\n\nBut according to the code, the code for rem=7 rounds (since period is 12, and n=7 < 12).\n\nSo for rem=7, the code loops i in 0..6 (since rem=7, range(7) is 0-6).\n\nSo for each i from 0 to 6:\n\nLet me compute each step.\n\ni=0:\n\nA[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R → draw. No change.\n\ni=1:\n\nA[1%3=1] → P. B[1%4=1] → S. P vs S: S beats P. So Nikephoros loses. count_a_rem +=1 → count_a_rem is 1.\n\ni=2:\n\nA[2%3=2] → S. B[2%4=2] → P. S vs P: S beats P. So Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a spot. count_b_rem +=1 → count_b_rem is 1.\n\ni=3:\n\nA[3%3=0] → R. B[3%4=3] → P. R vs P: P beats R. So Nikephoros loses. count_a_rem +=1 → 2.\n\ni=4:\n\nA[4%3=1] → P. B[4%4=0] → R. P vs R: P beats R. Nikephoros wins. count_b_rem +=1 → 2.\n\ni=5:\n\nA[5%3=2] → S. B[5%4=1] → S. Draw. No change.\n\ni=6:\n\nA[6%3=0] → R. B[6%4=2] → P. R vs P → P beats R. Nikephoros loses. count_a_rem +=1 → 3.\n\nSo after rem=7 rounds, count_a_rem is 3, count_b_rem is 2. Which matches the sample output. So the code would output 3 2. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code works for this sample.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo n=5, A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (length 8), B is \"R\" (length 1). So period is LCM(8,1) = 8.\n\nFor each of the 8 rounds:\n\nEach round, A's move is R, B's move is R. All draws. So count_a_period and count_b_period are 0.\n\nfull_cycles = 5 // 8 = 0. rem =5.\n\nProcessing rem=5 rounds: all draws. So total_a and total_b are 0. Hence output 0 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when the period is larger than n? Like, n=3, m=2, k=3. Then period is 6. full_cycles is 0, rem=3. So code processes 3 rounds.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: when one sequence is longer than the other.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The code uses sys.stdin.readline() for reading input. However, sometimes, after reading n, the next lines may have leading/trailing spaces. But the problem says that the input is given as per the description, so the code uses strip() for A and B.\n\nBut in the code, when reading A and B, it uses sys.stdin.readline().strip(). So for example, if the input lines have leading/trailing whitespace, it's stripped. But the problem says that the input lines only contain the characters R, S, P. So probably, the code is correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: when the LCM is very large, but m and k are up to 1000, so LCM is up to 1e6. So for 1e6 iterations, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, the code is written.\n\nBut in Python, for very large numbers, the code may take some time, but for 1e6 steps, it's acceptable.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus after playing n rounds of rock-paper-scissors, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible, so we use a more efficient approach based on cycles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Patterns**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. The sequence of moves for both players will repeat every LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the lengths of their respective sequences. This LCM value is referred to as the period.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: Calculate the period using the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences.\n3. **Simulate One Period**: For one full period, simulate each round to count how many times each player loses.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: Determine how many full periods fit into the total number of rounds (n) and handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def get_result(a, b):\n        if a == b:\n            return 0\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            return 1  # a wins\n        else:\n            return -1  # b wins\n    \n    # Compute period\n    period = (m * k) // math.gcd(m, k)\n    \n    # Compute counts for one period\n    count_a_period = 0\n    count_b_period = 0\n    for i in range(period):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        res = get_result(a_char, b_char)\n        if res == 1:\n            count_b_period += 1\n        elif res == -1:\n            count_a_period += 1\n    \n    full_cycles = n // period\n    rem = n % period\n    \n    # Now compute the counts for rem rounds\n    count_a_rem = 0\n    count_b_rem = 0\n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        res = get_result(a_char, b_char)\n        if res == 1:\n            count_b_rem += 1\n        elif res == -1:\n            count_a_rem += 1\n    \n    total_a = full_cycles * count_a_period + count_a_rem\n    total_b = full_cycles * count_b_period + count_b_rem\n    \n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of rounds and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is calculated to determine the period after which the move sequences repeat.\n3. **Simulation for One Period**: For each round within one period, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcome of each round is checked to count losses for each player.\n4. **Handling Full Cycles and Remainder**: The total number of full periods in the given number of rounds (n) is calculated. The results from these full periods are multiplied by the counts from one period. The remaining rounds after the full periods are simulated separately to get the final counts.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of n by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring that the solution is both optimal and correct.",
