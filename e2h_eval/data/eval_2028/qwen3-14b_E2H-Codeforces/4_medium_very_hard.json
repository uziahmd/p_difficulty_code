The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. We need to solve this problem where two players play rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. We need to find out how many times each gets pinched (i.e., how many times they lose each round).\n\nThe constraints are big: n can be up to 2e9. So simulating each round one by one is impossible. We need an efficient approach.\n\nFirst, let's think about the sequences. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to find what move Nikephoros (A) and Polycarpus (B) made. Then determine who wins.\n\nBut since the sequences are cyclic, for each round, the move of A is A[i % m], where m is the length of A's sequence. Similarly for B, it's B[i % k], where k is the length of B's sequence.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, we can't loop through all n rounds. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats so that we can compute the number of wins for each in O(1) time after precomputing some data.\n\nLet me think. The key is that the combination of the two sequences' cycles will repeat after LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after that, the moves of both players will repeat their initial sequences. So, for example, if m=3 and k=4, the LCM is 12. So every 12 rounds, the pattern of moves between A and B repeats.\n\nSo the idea is to compute the number of wins for each player in one full cycle (of length LCM(m, k)), then multiply by the number of full cycles in n rounds, and then add the results from the remaining rounds.\n\nBut first, let's compute how many full cycles there are and the remainder.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it L. Let's compute L = LCM(m, k). Since m and k can be up to 1000, L can be up to 1e6 (since 1000*1000 is 1e6). Wait, but LCM(m, k) can be up to m*k. So if m and k are 1000, then LCM could be up to 1e6. Which is manageable.\n\n2. For each of the L rounds, compute the moves of A and B, and count how many times each player loses. Then, the total for each player is (number of full cycles) * (their loss count in L rounds) + the losses in the remaining rounds.\n\nBut wait, how do we compute the number of full cycles and the remainder?\n\nLet me think. The total number of rounds is n. So the number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // L, and the remainder is rem = n % L. So for each full cycle, we can multiply the counts by total_cycles. Then process the rem rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the counts for each of the L rounds?\n\nFor each of the L rounds, we can compute the moves of A and B. Then determine who loses. For example, for each round i in 0..L-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nThen determine who wins. If a wins, then b gets a spot. If b wins, a gets a spot. Else, no spots.\n\nSo for each of the L rounds, we can precompute the number of times a loses (count_a) and b loses (count_b). Then, the total for all full cycles is total_cycles * count_a and total_cycles * count_b.\n\nThen, for the remaining rem rounds, we process them one by one (since rem can be up to L-1, which is up to 1e6, which is acceptable).\n\nSo the overall steps are:\n\nCompute L = LCM(m, k)\n\nCompute the counts for a full L rounds: count_a and count_b.\n\nThen, total_a = (total_cycles * count_a) + (number of a losses in the first rem rounds)\n\nSimilarly for total_b.\n\nBut how to compute the count_a and count_b for the L rounds?\n\nYes. So for each i in 0 to L-1:\n\nget a's move and b's move.\n\nCheck the outcome. For each outcome, increment the counts accordingly.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute this for L up to 1e6. Which is acceptable since 1e6 is manageable.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nIf m and k are up to 1000, then LCM(m, k) can be up to 1000*1000 = 1e6. So for each of the 1e6 rounds, we can compute the outcome. That's acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCalculate LCM(m, k) as L.\n\nCompute for each of the L rounds, the outcome.\n\nThen, compute how many full cycles and rem.\n\nThen, compute the total for each.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this.\n\nBut first, how to compute LCM(m, k)?\n\nWe can compute LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b).\n\nSo we need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A string, m = len(A)\n\nRead B string, k = len(B)\n\nCompute LCM of m and k.\n\nThen, compute for each of L rounds, the moves and count the losses.\n\nOnce that's done, compute total_cycles = n // L\n\nrem = n % L\n\nThen, the total_a is total_cycles * count_a_in_L + count_a_in_rem\n\nSame for total_b.\n\nBut how to compute count_a_in_rem? Well, for the first rem rounds (from 0 to rem-1), we can loop through each of those and compute the outcome.\n\nBut how to compute the moves for each of those rounds?\n\nFor each round i in 0 to rem-1:\n\na's move is A[i % m]\n\nb's move is B[i % k]\n\nSo, for each of these rem rounds, we can compute the outcome.\n\nBut for rem up to 1e6, that's acceptable.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nCompute L = LCM(m, k)\n\nprecompute for 0 to L-1:\n\ncount_a = 0\n\ncount_b = 0\n\nfor i in 0 to L-1:\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    determine outcome:\n\n    if a beats b: then b gets a spot (so count_b += 1)\n\n    elif b beats a: count_a += 1\n\n    else: no change.\n\nOnce that's done, then:\n\nfull_cycles = n // L\n\nrem = n % L\n\ntotal_a = full_cycles * count_a\n\ntotal_b = full_cycles * count_b\n\nthen process rem rounds:\n\nfor i in 0 to rem-1:\n\n    same as before, compute a and b moves, check outcome, add to total_a and total_b accordingly.\n\nSo the total_a and total_b are the answers.\n\nBut how to determine whether a beats b?\n\nLet me think. The rules are:\n\nRock (R) beats scissors (S)\n\nScissors (S) beats paper (P)\n\nPaper (P) beats rock (R)\n\nSo for a and b, when a is R and b is S: a wins. So b gets a spot (so Nikephoros (a) is the winner, so Polycarpus (b) gets a spot. So in this case, count_b increases by 1.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nthe loser gets pinched. So the loser is the one who loses. So if a wins, then b is the loser. So Nikephoros (a) has no spot, Polycarpus (b) gets a spot. So for each round, if a wins, then Polycarpus (b) gets a spot. If b wins, Nikephoros (a) gets a spot. If draw, nothing.\n\nSo the variables:\n\ncount_a is the number of times Nikephoros lost (so Polycarpus's spots)\n\ncount_b is the number of times Polycarpus lost (Nikephoros's spots)\n\nWait, no. Wait:\n\nIn the problem statement, the output is two numbers: the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\nSo, when Nikephoros loses, he gets a spot. When Polycarpus loses, he gets a spot.\n\nSo for each round:\n\nif a (Nikephoros) loses, then Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nif b (Polycarpus) loses, then Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\nSo for the code:\n\nfor each round, check if a wins, b wins, or draw.\n\nif a wins: then b loses. So Polycarpus's count (second number) increases by 1.\n\nif b wins: then a loses. So Nikephoros's count (first number) increases by 1.\n\nif draw: nothing.\n\nSo during the precomputation for L rounds, we need to count for each round:\n\nhow many times Nikephoros lost (count_a) and how many times Polycarpus lost (count_b).\n\nSo in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is R, P, S. m=3.\n\nB is R, S, P, P. k=4.\n\nLCM(3,4) is 12.\n\nSo for each of 12 rounds, compute the moves.\n\nBut let's see the first sample:\n\nIn the example, the first 7 rounds are processed. The output is 3 2.\n\nBut according to the note, the first round is R vs R: draw. So no spots.\n\nSo in the first sample, the code would calculate for L=12, then n=7. So full_cycles is 0, rem=7. So process the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut in the code, for the first 7 rounds, we have to compute each of them.\n\nSo the code needs to process that.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute whether a beats b.\n\nLet me write a helper function. For two moves a and b, return which one wins.\n\nSo:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return 0  # draw\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        return 1  # a wins\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1  # b wins\n\nSo for example, if a is R and b is S: a wins. So return 1. Then, in this case, b loses, so Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\nSo in code, for each a and b:\n\nres = get_result(a, b)\n\nif res == 1: # a wins, so b loses. So polycarpus's count (second number) increases by 1.\n\nelif res == -1: # b wins, so a loses. Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nelse: nothing.\n\nSo in the code, during the precomputation of L rounds, for each i in 0 to L-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nthen compute the result.\n\nSo, now, the code can be written.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps in code.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nBut the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nSecond line is the sequence A.\n\nThird line is the sequence B.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is read as follows: the first line is n. Then the second line is A, third line is B.\n\nBut in the example given, the first input is 7, then A is RPS (length 3), B is RSPP (length 4). Then the output is 3 2.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A string.\n\nRead B string.\n\nThen m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute LCM(m, k).\n\nThen, compute for L rounds, the counts for a and b.\n\nThen compute full_cycles and rem.\n\nThen compute the total counts.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nBut how to compute LCM?\n\nImplementing LCM:\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\nBut in Python, math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor. But note that for Python 3.5 and above, math.gcd exists. Also, note that math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since a and b are positive, no problem.\n\nBut for Python versions, assuming that's okay.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nNow, for m and k.\n\nOnce L is computed, then:\n\ncount_a_total = 0\n\ncount_b_total = 0\n\nfor i in range(L):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    # determine outcome\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        continue\n\n    elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # a wins, so b loses. So Polycarpus's count (second number) increases by 1.\n\n        count_b_total += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # b wins, so a loses. Nikephoros's count (first number) increases by 1.\n\n        count_a_total += 1\n\nOnce that's done, then:\n\nfull_cycles = n // L\n\nrem = n % L\n\ntotal_a = full_cycles * count_a_total\n\ntotal_b = full_cycles * count_b_total\n\nThen, for the rem rounds, process each from 0 to rem-1:\n\nfor i in range(rem):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        continue\n\n    elif ... same as before:\n\n        if a wins: total_b += 1\n\n        else: total_a += 1\n\nSo then, output total_a and total_b.\n\nYes.\n\nBut for LCM(m, k) can be up to 1e6, and for rem up to 1e6, that's acceptable.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the first sample.\n\nSample Input:\n\nn = 7\n\nA = \"RPS\" (m=3)\n\nB = \"RSPP\" (k=4)\n\nCompute LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nSo for each of 12 rounds:\n\nLet me compute for each i from 0 to 11:\n\ni: 0 to 11.\n\nFor each i, a = A[i % 3], b = B[i%4].\n\nLet me list them:\n\ni | i%3 | A | i%4 | B | outcome\n\n0 | 0 | R | 0 | R → draw. No change.\n\n1 | 1 | P | 1 | S → P vs S. S beats P? Wait:\n\na is P, b is S. According to the rules: scissors (S) beats paper (P). So b wins. So a (Nikephoros) loses. So total_a increases by 1.\n\nWait in the code, for a = P, b = S. The condition (a == 'R' and b == 'S')? No. (a == 'S' and b == 'P')? No. (a == 'P' and b == 'R')? No. So the else clause. So the code checks if a wins. Else, b wins. So for a=P, b=S, the code would check if a wins. Since (a is P, b is S) → S beats P. So the condition is false. So else clause, which means b wins. So Nikephoros (a) loses, so count_a_total increases by 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for i=1, count_a_total +=1.\n\nThen i=2:\n\na is S (i%3=2), B[i%4=2] is P. So S vs P. S beats P. So a wins. So b loses. count_b_total +=1.\n\ni=3:\n\ni%3=0 (R), i%4=3 (B[3] is P). R vs P. P beats R. So b wins. So count_a +=1.\n\ni=4: i%3=1 (P), i%4=0 (R). P vs R. R beats P? No. P beats R. So a wins. So count_b +=1.\n\ni=5: i%3=2 (S), i%4=1 (S). S vs S → draw.\n\ni=6: i%3=0 (R), i%4=2 (P). R vs P → P beats R. So b wins. count_a +=1.\n\ni=7: i%3=1 (P), i%4=3 (P). P vs P → draw.\n\ni=8: i%3=2 (S), i%4=0 (R). S vs R. R beats S. So b wins. count_a +=1.\n\ni=9: i%3=0 (R), i%4=1 (S). R vs S. a wins. count_b +=1.\n\ni=10: i%3=1 (P), i%4=2 (P). P vs P → draw.\n\ni=11: i%3=2 (S), i%4=3 (P). S vs P → S beats P. a wins. count_b +=1.\n\nSo for the 12 rounds, let's compute count_a_total and count_b_total:\n\ncount_a_total is the number of times a (Nikephoros) lost. Let's count:\n\nLooking for when b wins.\n\nLooking at each i:\n\ni=0: draw → no.\n\ni=1: b wins → count_a +=1.\n\ni=2: a wins → no.\n\ni=3: b wins → count_a +=1.\n\ni=4: a wins → no.\n\ni=5: draw.\n\ni=6: b wins → count_a +=1.\n\ni=7: draw.\n\ni=8: b wins → count_a +=1.\n\ni=9: a wins → no.\n\ni=10: draw.\n\ni=11: a wins → no.\n\nSo count_a_total for the 12 rounds is 4 (i=1,3,6,8). So count_a_total =4.\n\ncount_b_total is when a wins. Let's see:\n\ni=2 → a wins → count_b +=1.\n\ni=4 → a wins → count_b +=1.\n\ni=9 → a wins → count_b +=1.\n\ni=11 → a wins → count_b +=1.\n\nAlso, check other instances.\n\ni=0: no.\n\ni=1: no.\n\ni=2: yes.\n\ni=3: no.\n\ni=4: yes.\n\ni=5: no.\n\ni=6: no.\n\ni=7: no.\n\ni=8: no.\n\ni=9: yes.\n\ni=10: no.\n\ni=11: yes.\n\nSo count_b_total is 4.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, when n=7, the output is 3 2. Let's see.\n\nfull_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0. rem =7.\n\nSo for the rem rounds (0 to 6), process each of the first 7 rounds.\n\nWhich would be:\n\ni=0: draw. No change.\n\ni=1: count_a +=1 → total_a is 1.\n\ni=2: count_b +=1 → total_b is 1.\n\ni=3: count_a +=1 → total_a is 2.\n\ni=4: count_b +=1 → total_b is 2.\n\ni=5: draw.\n\ni=6: count_a +=1 → total_a is 3.\n\nSo total_a is 3, total_b is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother sample is the second example:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo n=5, A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (m=8), B is \"R\" (k=1). LCM(8,1)=8.\n\nFor each of 8 rounds:\n\na is R, and b is R. All draws. So count_a_total and count_b_total are zero.\n\nfull_cycles = 5//8 = 0, rem=5. Process 5 rounds. All draws. So output is 0 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for that.\n\nNow, what about when n is larger than L?\n\nLike, say n= L * 2 + 3. Then full_cycles is 2, and rem is 3.\n\nSo the code would multiply the counts by 2, then add the counts for the first 3 rounds.\n\nNow, code-wise, the steps are correct.\n\nNow, considering the code:\n\nBut in Python, for very large n (up to 2e9), the code would process LCM(m, k) which is up to 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing all that.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- All rounds are draws. So output 0 0.\n\n- One of the sequences is longer than the other.\n\n- m or k is 1.\n\nAnother edge case: when n is zero? But according to input constraints, n ≥1.\n\nSo code can proceed.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n from input. But the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is A.\n\nThird line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the input is:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nBut perhaps the actual input is read as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nSo in code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # compute LCM of m and k\n\n    def lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    L = lcm(m, k)\n\n    # precompute counts for L rounds\n\n    count_a = 0\n\n    count_b = 0\n\n    for i in range(L):\n\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_char == b_char:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R'):\n\n            # a wins, b loses. So count_b +=1 (Polycarpus's spots)\n\n            count_b +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            # b wins, a loses. count_a +=1 (Nikephoros's spots)\n\n            count_a +=1\n\n    full_cycles = n // L\n\n    rem = n % L\n\n    total_a = full_cycles * count_a\n\n    total_b = full_cycles * count_b\n\n    # process rem rounds\n\n    for i in range(rem):\n\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_char == b_char:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R'):\n\n            total_b +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            total_a +=1\n\n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nBut wait, in the code, the function lcm is inside main, but that's okay.\n\nBut in Python, math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor. However, for Python versions before 3.5, math.gcd may not exist. However, assuming that the code is run in a Python environment that supports it.\n\nBut given that the problem says to write code that works, and that the code is to be written in Python, this should be okay.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nSample input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nWhich gives:\n\ncount_a for L=12 is 4, count_b is 4.\n\nfull_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0. rem =7.\n\nProcessing rem rounds:\n\nfor i in 0 to 6:\n\ni=0: R vs R → draw.\n\ni=1: P vs S → S beats P → b wins. So a loses. total_a +=1 → 1.\n\ni=2: S vs P → a wins. total_b +=1 → 1.\n\ni=3: R vs P → b wins. total_a +=1 → 2.\n\ni=4: P vs R → a wins. total_b +=1 → 2.\n\ni=5: S vs S → draw.\n\ni=6: R vs P → b wins. total_a +=1 → 3.\n\nSo total_a is 3, total_b is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: when n=12, then full_cycles=1, rem=0. So total_a is 4, total_b is 4. So output is 4 4.\n\nBut for each of the 12 rounds, how many times each lost?\n\nAs per earlier calculation, count_a was 4, count_b 4.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A is 'R', B is 'S'. So a wins, so total_a is 0, total_b is 1. Output is 0 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code must be written as a Python script that reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- Handling very large L (up to 1e6). But in Python, loops up to 1e6 are acceptable.\n\nBut for m and k up to 1000, LCM(m, k) can be up to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, the code as written.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the function lcm is defined inside main. But that's okay.\n\nBut in Python, math.gcd returns the GCD of the absolute values. Since m and k are positive, no problem.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nThus, the code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors using their respective cyclic strategies. The challenge is to efficiently handle up to 2 billion rounds by leveraging the cyclic nature of the strategies.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. Nikephoros's sequence repeats every `m` rounds, and Polycarpus's sequence repeats every `k` rounds.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The combined cycle of both sequences will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. This allows us to compute the outcomes for one full cycle of LCM(m, k) rounds and then use this to determine results for larger numbers of rounds.\n3. **Precompute Outcomes**: For each round within the LCM cycle, precompute the number of losses for each player. This helps in quickly calculating results for multiple cycles.\n4. **Handle Large Inputs**: By breaking down the total number of rounds into full cycles and a remainder, we efficiently compute the total losses without iterating through all rounds explicitly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    L = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    count_a = 0\n    count_b = 0\n    \n    for i in range(L):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        if (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R'):\n            count_b += 1\n        else:\n            count_a += 1\n    \n    full_cycles = n // L\n    rem = n % L\n    \n    total_a = full_cycles * count_a\n    total_b = full_cycles * count_b\n    \n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        if (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R'):\n            total_b += 1\n        else:\n            total_a += 1\n    \n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the move sequences for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: Compute the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the cycle length after which both sequences repeat simultaneously.\n3. **Precompute Outcomes**: For each round within the LCM cycle, determine the outcome (win, loss, or draw) and accumulate the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: Calculate how many full LCM cycles fit into `n` rounds and the remaining rounds. Use the precomputed values for full cycles and manually check the remaining rounds to get the final counts of losses.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of `n` by leveraging the cyclic nature of the sequences, ensuring the solution runs in linear time relative to the LCM of the sequence lengths, which is feasible given the constraints.",
