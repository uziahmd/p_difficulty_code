Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum radius d for the lanterns so that the entire street is covered. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says that each lantern can light up points within a distance d. So the goal is to find the smallest d such that every point on the street from 0 to l is within d of at least one lantern.\n\nHmm. So the key idea here is to check the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, then the middle of that gap would require a larger d to cover.\n\nBut wait, also need to consider the ends. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is a candidate for d. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo the steps I think are:\n\n1. Sort the positions of the lanterns. Because if they are not sorted, the gaps between consecutive ones can't be properly checked.\n2. Check the distance from the start (0) to the first lantern. That's a candidate for d.\n3. Check the distance from the last lantern to the end (l). Another candidate.\n4. Then for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them. The maximum of these divided by 2 would be the required d for that gap. Because if two lanterns are s units apart, the middle point between them is s/2 away from each. So the maximum of these values would be the required d.\n5. The answer is the maximum among all these candidates.\n\nWait, right. Because for any two consecutive lanterns, the worst case is the middle point between them. So for example, if two lanterns are at positions a and b (a < b), then the maximum distance from any point in between to the nearest lantern is (b - a)/2. So that's the value we need to consider.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial gap between 0 and the first lantern.\n- Compute the gap between last lantern and l.\n- Then iterate through consecutive lanterns and compute their gaps, divide by 2, and take the maximum.\n\nThen the answer is the maximum of all those values.\n\nLet me test this logic with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n7 15\n\nPositions are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting: 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nCheck the first gap: 0 to 3. The distance is 3. But since the first lantern is at 0, the distance from 0 to the first lantern is zero? Wait no, the first lantern is at 0. So the distance from 0 to the first lantern is zero. So the first candidate is 0. Then the next gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0 = 3. Divided by 2 is 1.5.\n\nThen 5-3=2 → 1.0.\n\nThen 7-5=2 → 1.0.\n\nThen 9-7=2 → 1.0.\n\nThen 14-9=5 → 2.5.\n\nThen 15-14=1 → 0.5.\n\nThen the last gap is 15 to l=15, which is zero.\n\nSo the maximum is 2.5, which matches the sample output of 2.5.\n\nYes. So that works.\n\nSecond example input: 2 5, positions 2 and 5. Sorted as 2,5.\n\nFirst gap is 2-0 = 2. So candidate is 2. Then between 2 and 5, the gap is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. Then the last gap is 5-5=0. So the maximum is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: suppose n=1, l=10. The lantern is at 5. Then the first gap is 5-0=5, the last gap is 10-5=5. The max between them is 5, which is the required d. Because the lantern covers from 0 to 10 (since d=5).\n\nAnother case: if the lanterns are at 0 and l. Then the gap between them is l, divided by 2. So for example, if l=10, then d is 5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nThen read the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first lantern's position. The distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0] -",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns such that the entire street is illuminated. The key idea is to consider the maximum distance between consecutive lanterns and the ends of the street.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to easily compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Endpoints**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l).\n3. **Check Consecutive Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them and determine the maximum distance from the midpoint of the gap to either lantern, which is half the gap length.\n4. **Determine Maximum Distance**: The required minimum radius is the maximum value among the distances calculated from the endpoints and the midpoints of consecutive lantern gaps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the first segment from 0 to a[0]\n    max_d = max(max_d, a[0] - 0.0)\n    \n    # Check segments between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    # Check the last segment from a[-1] to l\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of lanterns `n`, the length of the street `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to facilitate the calculation of consecutive gaps.\n3. **Initial Check**: The distance from the start of the street to the first lantern is checked.\n4. **Consecutive Gaps**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the gap between them is calculated. The maximum distance required to cover this gap is half the gap length, as the midpoint of the gap would be farthest from either lantern.\n5. **Final Check**: The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street is checked.\n6. **Output**: The maximum of all these distances is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places, ensuring the result meets the required accuracy.",
