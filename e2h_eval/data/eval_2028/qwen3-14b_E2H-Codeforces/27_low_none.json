On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. Hmm.\n\nSo the key is to figure out which subarray to reverse so that when we reverse it, the overall longest non-decreasing subsequence is as long as possible. But how do I approach this efficiently?\n\nFirst, let me think about the original longest non-decreasing subsequence. Since the array has only 1s and 2s, the maximum possible length without any reversal is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s (if they are in order). But obviously, there might be a better way by reversing a subarray.\n\nBut considering all possible subarrays to reverse would be O(n^2) possibilities, which for n=2000 would be 4 million possibilities. For each of these, I'd have to compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence, which is O(n^2) time. That would be O(n^4), which is way too slow. So that approach isn't feasible.\n\nI need a smarter way. Let's think about what reversing a subarray can do. Reversing a subarray [l, r] will flip the elements in that range. The optimal scenario would be to make as many 1s followed by 2s as possible. Because the longest non-decreasing subsequence would then be the total number of 1s and 2s, but maybe there are some transitions between 1 and 2 that can be improved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible length is the original maximum plus some improvement from reversing a subarray. But how?\n\nAnother idea: since the array consists of 1s and 2s, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s if they are in order. But if there's a transition from 2 to 1, that's a problem. Reversing a subarray that contains such a transition could fix that.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input: [1, 2, 1, 2]. The original longest is 3 (like 1,2,2 or 1,1,2). But reversing [2,3] gives [1,1,2,2], which is all non-decreasing. So the maximum is 4.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a subarray that, when reversed, reduces the number of transitions from 2 to 1. Because each such transition reduces the maximum possible length of the non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nSo maybe the maximum possible length is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of 2->1 transitions in the original array, but after reversing a subarray that can eliminate some of those transitions.\n\nWait, but how does reversing a subarray affect the transitions?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider the original array. The number of 2->1 transitions is the number of times a 2 is immediately followed by a 1. Each such transition reduces the maximum possible length by 1. Because the longest non-decreasing subsequence can't include both the 2 and the 1. So the maximum length is total elements minus the number of such transitions. Wait, no. Because for example, if there are two transitions, the maximum length is n - number_of_transitions. Because each transition is a place where the sequence breaks. For example, in the array [1,2,1,2], there are two transitions (2→1 and 1→2? No, wait transitions are 2→1 and then 2→1 again? Or maybe transitions are only from 2 to 1. Because the non-decreasing sequence allows 1s followed by 1s or 2s, and 2s followed by 2s. But a 2 followed by a 1 is a decrease. So the number of 2→1 transitions in the original array is the number of such points. Let me think of the maximum length of non-decreasing subsequence. Since all elements are 1 and 2, the maximum length is the number of elements minus the number of 2→1 transitions. Because each such transition is a break. For example, in the original array [1,2,1,2], there are two 2→1 transitions (the 2 at position 2 followed by 1 at position 3, and the 2 at position 4 is not followed by anything). So the maximum length is 4 - 1 = 3? Wait, no. Because in the original array, the maximum is 3. But according to that formula, it would be 4 - 1 = 3. But the original array has two transitions. Wait, let me count:\n\nOriginal array is ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing any subarray in the given sequence of 1s and 2s. The key insight is that reversing a subarray can eliminate transitions from 2 to 1, which are problematic for maintaining a non-decreasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Transitions**: In a sequence of 1s and 2s, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is affected by the number of transitions from 2 to 1. Each such transition reduces the potential length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n2. **Maximizing Length**: By reversing a subarray, we can eliminate these transitions. The optimal reversal will be one that maximizes the reduction of these transitions.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: We calculate the number of 2→1 transitions in the original array. Then, for each possible subarray, we check how many transitions it can eliminate when reversed. This allows us to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    # Calculate the number of 2->1 transitions in the original array\n    transitions = 0\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        if a[i] == 2 and a[i + 1] == 1:\n            transitions += 1\n    \n    max_len = n - transitions  # initial maximum possible length\n    \n    # Try all possible intervals [l, r] to reverse\n    for l in range(n):\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            # Check the effect of reversing [l, r]\n            # Count the number of 2->1 transitions in the original array\n            # Then subtract the transitions that would be removed by reversing [l, r]\n            # and add the new transitions introduced\n            \n            # Original transitions in the interval [l, r]\n            original_in = 0\n            for i in range(l, r):\n                if a[i] == 2 and a[i + 1] == 1:\n                    original_in += 1\n            \n            # Transitions that would be removed by reversing [l, r]\n            # The original transitions inside the interval\n            # Also, transitions between l-1 and l, and r and r+1\n            # Need to check the boundaries\n            removed = 0\n            if l > 0:\n                if a[l - 1] == 2 and a[l] == 1:\n                    removed += 1\n            if r < n - 1:\n                if a[r] == 2 and a[r + 1] == 1:\n                    removed += 1\n            \n            # Now, the transitions within the reversed interval\n            # When reversed, the transitions inside the interval become transitions in the reversed array\n            # For example, if the original segment was [2,1], reversing gives [1,2], which has no transition\n            # So we need to compute the transitions in the reversed segment\n            reversed_segment = a[l:r+1][::-1]\n            new_in = 0\n            for i in range(len(reversed_segment) - 1):\n                if reversed_segment[i] == 2 and reversed_segment[i + 1] == 1:\n                    new_in += 1\n            \n            # The new transitions introduced at the boundaries\n            added = 0\n            if l > 0:\n                if a[l - 1] == 2 and reversed_segment[0] == 1:\n                    added += 1\n            if r < n - 1:\n                if reversed_segment[-1] == 2 and a[r + 1] == 1:\n                    added += 1\n            \n            # The net change in transitions is (removed - (original_in - new_in) - added)\n            # Because original_in is the number of transitions inside the interval before reversal\n            # After reversal, the transitions inside the interval are new_in\n            # So the change in transitions is (original_in - new_in) - (removed - added)\n            # Wait, original transitions in the whole array is transitions\n            # When we reverse [l, r], we remove the original_in transitions inside the interval\n            # And remove the boundary transitions (if any)\n            # Then add the new_in transitions inside the interval\n            # And add the new boundary transitions (if any)\n            # So the net change is (original_in + removed_boundary) - (new_in + added_boundary)\n            # Where removed_boundary is the transitions at the boundaries before reversal\n            # and added_boundary is after reversal\n            # So total transitions after reversal is:\n            # transitions - (original_in + removed_boundary) + (new_in + added_boundary)\n            \n            # So the new number of transitions is:\n            new_transitions = transitions - original_in - removed + new_in + added\n            \n            # Update max_len\n            current_len = n - new_transitions\n            if current_len > max_len:\n                max_len = current_len\n    \n    print(max_len)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Transitions Count**: We first count the number of 2→1 transitions in the original array.\n2. **Check All Subarrays**: For each possible subarray [l, r], we calculate the effect of reversing it on the number of transitions.\n3. **Adjust Transitions**: By reversing a subarray, we adjust the count of transitions both inside the subarray and at its boundaries.\n4. **Update Maximum Length**: The maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is updated based on the adjusted number of transitions.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible subarrays and their impact on transitions, ensuring an optimal solution within feasible time complexity.",
