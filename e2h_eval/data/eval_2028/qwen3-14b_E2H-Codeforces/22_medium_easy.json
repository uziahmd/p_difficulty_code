After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, for each subject, we need to find the maximum mark, and then check which students have that mark. Each such student is considered successful. But since a student can be successful in multiple subjects, we need to count each student once even if they are best in multiple subjects.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For each subject (column in the gradebook), find the maximum value.\n2. For each student, check if they have at least one subject where their mark equals the maximum for that subject.\n3. Count how many such students there are.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this.\n\nFirst, the input is n and m, followed by n lines each with m characters. Each line represents a student's marks for m subjects.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the next n lines as a list of strings. Each string is a row of marks.\n- For each subject (columns 0 to m-1), find the maximum value among all students.\n- Then, for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject is equal to the maximum of that subject. If yes, then they are successful.\n- The total count of such students is the answer.\n\nSo, the key is to first compute the maximum for each subject. Then, for each student, check if any of their marks match the max of their respective subject.\n\nLet me think about how to represent the data. Let's say we have a 2D list, where each row is a student, and each column is a subject. For example, for the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nThe data would be:\n\nstudent 0: [2,2,3]\nstudent 1: [2,3,2]\nstudent 2: [1,1,2]\n\nFor each subject (columns 0, 1, 2):\n\nSubject 0: max is 2 (students 0 and 1 have 2)\nSubject 1: max is 3 (student 1)\nSubject 2: max is 3 (student 0)\n\nThen, for each student:\n\nStudent 0 has 2 in subject 0 (max), 2 in subject 1 (not max), 3 in subject 2 (max). So he is successful (has at least one max).\n\nStudent 1 has 2 in subject 0 (max), 3 in subject 1 (max), 2 in subject 2 (not). So successful.\n\nStudent 2 has 1 in all subjects, which are not max. So not successful. Hence total is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute for each column the maximum value. Then, for each student, check if any of their entries in the columns is equal to the max of that column. If yes, count them.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python?\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is n and m. Then n lines follow. Each line is a string of m digits.\n\nLet me think about reading the input. For example, in the first sample, the input is:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nSo, the code would read n=3, m=3. Then the three lines are \"223\", \"232\", \"112\".\n\nWe can process these into a list of lists. For example, for each line, convert it into a list of integers. So for the first line, [2,2,3], etc.\n\nOnce we have that, for each column (subject), find the maximum.\n\nLet me think about how to get the columns. For example, for the list of students, each student is a list of integers. So for column j, the values are [student[i][j] for i in range(n)].\n\nSo for each j in 0..m-1:\n\nmax_val = max( student[i][j] for i in range(n) )\n\nOnce we have the max values for each column, then for each student, check if any of their marks in any column is equal to the max of that column.\n\nSo, for each student in the list:\n\nfor any j in 0..m-1:\n\nif student's j-th mark == max_vals[j], then mark this student as successful.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string. Convert each string into a list of integers. Let's call this a 2D list called grades.\n\nThen, compute for each column j, the maximum value. Let's create a list called max_per_subject, where max_per_subject[j] is the maximum of column j.\n\nOnce that is done, for each student in grades, check if any of their marks in any subject j is equal to max_per_subject[j]. If yes, increment the count.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n, m.\n\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    grades.append(row)\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    # get all the values in column j\n    column_values = [grades[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n    max_val = max(column_values)\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break  # no need to check other subjects for this student\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, that's the plan. Let's test this against the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, m=3\n\ngrades is:\n\n[[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_per_subject for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 2, 2, 1 → max is 2\n\ncolumn 1: 2,3,1 → max 3\n\ncolumn 2: 3,2,2 → max 3\n\nso max_per_subject is [2,3,3]\n\nNow for each student:\n\nstudent 0: [2,2,3]\n\ncheck for j=0: 2 == 2 → yes. So count +=1, break. So this student is counted.\n\nstudent 1: [2,3,2]\n\nj=0: 2 == 2 → yes. count +=1.\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,2]\n\nj=0: 1 < 2 → no. j=1: 1 <3 → no. j=2: 2 <3 → no. So not counted.\n\nTotal count is 2, correct.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nSecond input is 3 5, with the lines:\n\n91728 → [9,1,7,2,8]\n\n11828 → [1,1,8,2,8]\n\n11111 → [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_per_subject for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 9,1,1 → max 9\n\ncolumn 1: 1,1,1 → max 1\n\ncolumn 2: 7,8,1 → max 8\n\ncolumn 3: 2,2,1 → max 2\n\ncolumn 4: 8,8,1 → max 8\n\nso max_per_subject is [9,1,8,2,8]\n\nNow check each student:\n\nstudent 0: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nCheck each column:\n\nj=0: 9 ==9 → yes. So counted.\n\nstudent 1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nj=0: 1 <9 → no. j=1: 1 ==1 → yes. So counted.\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nCheck each column:\n\nj=0: 1 <9. j=1: 1 ==1 → yes. So counted.\n\nThus total is 3, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase when all students have same marks. For example, n=2, m=1. All students have 5. Then each student is best in the subject. So count is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. The student is best, so count 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [9, 9], student 2 has [9, 9]. Then for each subject, max is 9. Both students are successful. So count is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [9, 8], student 2 has [9, 9]. Then for subject 0, max is 9. Both students have 9. For subject 1, max is 9. Only student 2. So student 1 is successful (because subject 0), student 2 is successful (subject 1). So total is 2.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input is read from stdin. The problem says that the input is given as per the first sample, but in the code, how to read it? For example, in the sample input, the first input is '3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', but in the code, the input is read via input() function.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as a single string, but in practice, when you read from stdin, you can read each line as needed.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read n lines, each line being a string of m digits.\n\nSo the code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    grades.append(row)\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    column_values = [grades[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n    max_val = max(column_values)\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nThis should work.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nInput is:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nWhich is read as n=3, m=3. grades is [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_per_subject is [2,3,3]. Then for each student:\n\nstudent 0: 2 (j=0) matches max, so count +=1.\n\nstudent 1: j=0 (2 == 2) → count +=1.\n\nstudent 2: none. So total 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: when all students have same marks. For example, n=2, m=1. Input:\n\n2 1\n\n5\n\n5\n\nThen max_per_subject is [5]. Each student has 5. So count is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. Input 1 1\\n5 → output 1.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about when a student is the best in multiple subjects? For example, in the first sample, student 0 is best in subject 0 and 2. But the code counts him once. Which is correct.\n\nYes, because once any of the subjects is found where he is best, the code breaks and counts him once.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nI think this should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their performance in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** First, read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m). Then, read the gradebook which consists of n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of students in different subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject:** For each subject (column in the gradebook), compute the maximum mark achieved by any student.\n3. **Identify Successful Students:** For each student, check if they have achieved the maximum mark in any subject. If they have, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    grades.append(row)\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    column_values = [grades[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n    max_val = max(column_values)\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The input is read and stored in a 2D list `grades` where each row represents a student's marks in different subjects.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks per Subject:** For each subject (column), we compute the maximum mark obtained by any student. This is stored in the list `max_per_subject`.\n3. **Checking Successful Students:** For each student, we check if they have achieved the maximum mark in any subject. If they have, they are counted as successful. This is done by iterating through each student's marks and comparing them with the corresponding maximum values for their respective subjects.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging the maximum values for each subject, leading to an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 100).",
