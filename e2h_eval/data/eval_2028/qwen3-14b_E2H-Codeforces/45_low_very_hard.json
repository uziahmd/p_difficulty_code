There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about how the tournament structure works. In a standard knockout tournament with n players, the winner has to play log2(n) games if it's a balanced bracket. But here, the structure isn't fixed. We need to arrange the matches in such a way that the winner plays as many games as possible, following the rule.\n\nLet me look at the examples. For n=3, the output is 2. How does that work? The winner plays two games. Let's see: first, maybe player 1 plays against player 2. Then, the winner (player 1) plays against player 3. But wait, when player 1 plays against player 2, they each have 0 games before that. After that, player 1 has 1 game, and player 2 is out. Then, player 1 plays against player 3. Player 3 has 0 games, and player 1 has 1. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's okay. So the maximum is 2 games. \n\nFor n=4, the output is 2. Wait, why not 3? Because in a normal bracket, the winner would play 3 games (since 4 players, log2(4)=2? Wait no, wait for 4 players, the winner plays 2 games: first round (quarter?), then semifinal? No, wait 4 players: first two games in the semifinals, then the final. So the winner plays two games. Oh right, the output for n=4 is 2. So the example says that the maximum is 2. But if you arrange the matches in a way that the winner plays more games? How?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the tournament is arranged in a way that the winner can't play more than a certain number of games due to the rule. Let's think about the third example where n=4. If the winner plays 3 games, that would require that each time he plays, the opponent has a number of games differing by at most one. Let's see. Suppose the winner plays three games. Let's think about the steps:\n\nFirst game: he plays against someone. Let's say he has 0 games, opponent also 0. After that, he has 1 game. Then, he needs to play another game. The opponent must have either 0 or 1 games. Suppose he plays against someone else. Let's say that opponent had 0 games. Then after that, the winner has 2 games, and the opponent has 1. Then, for the third game, he needs to play against someone who has 1 or 2 games. But how many players are there? For n=4, there are 3 other players. Let's think:\n\nFirst game: player 1 vs player 2. Player 1 wins. Now, player 1 has 1 game. Then, player 1 vs player 3. Player 1 wins again. Now, he has 2 games. Then, he needs to play against player 4. But player 4 has 0 games. The difference is 2, which is not allowed. So that's invalid. Therefore, the third game can't happen. Hence, the maximum is 2.\n\nSo the problem is about finding the maximum number of games the winner can play, given that each time he plays, his opponent must have a number of games that's within one of his current count.\n\nSo how do we model this? Let's think recursively. Let's say that the maximum number of games the winner can play is f(n). How can we find f(n)?\n\nLet me think about the structure. For the winner to play as many games as possible, each time he plays, he needs to have opponents that allow him to proceed. Let's think of the process as building a tree where each node represents a player, and each game the winner plays adds a level. But perhaps there's a pattern here.\n\nLet me consider the case where the winner plays k games. That means he has to have k opponents. Each time he plays, the opponent must have a certain number of games. Let's think about the structure of the tournament.\n\nThe first game, he has 0 games. The opponent also has 0. After winning, he has 1 game. For the next game, the opponent must have either 0 or 1 games. Suppose that the opponent has 0 games. Then, after that game, the winner has 2 games. For the next game, the opponent must have 1 or ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given a specific rule about the difference in the number of games played by opponents. The key insight is to recognize that this problem can be modeled using a Fibonacci-like sequence, where each term represents the minimum number of players required for the winner to play a certain number of games.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rule**: The rule states that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one. This constraint affects how we structure the tournament to maximize the number of games the winner can play.\n2. **Fibonacci Insight**: The maximum number of games the winner can play follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. For the winner to play `k` games, the minimum number of players required is determined by the sum of the previous two terms in this sequence.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: We start with the smallest number of players (2) and iteratively compute the minimum number of players required for each additional game the winner can play until we exceed the given number of players `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # The maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by the Fibonacci-like sequence.\n    # Let's find the largest k such that fib(k) <= n, where fib(k) is defined as:\n    # fib(1) = 2, fib(2) = 3, fib(k) = fib(k-1) + fib(k-2)\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Initialize the sequence\n    a, b = 2, 3  # fib(1) = 2, fib(2) = 3\n    k = 1  # current max games\n    while b <= n:\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        k += 1\n    \n    # After the loop, k is the maximum number of games possible\n    print(k - 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start with the base cases where the minimum number of players required for the winner to play 1 game is 2, and for 2 games is 3.\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: Using a loop, we iteratively calculate the minimum number of players required for each subsequent game count. This follows a Fibonacci-like sequence where each term is the sum of the previous two terms.\n3. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until the calculated number of players exceeds the given number `n`. At this point, the maximum number of games the winner can play is one less than the current count of iterations.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result in logarithmic time relative to the value of `n`, ensuring it handles the large input constraints effectively.",
