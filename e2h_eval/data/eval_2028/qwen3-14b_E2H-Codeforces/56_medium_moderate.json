Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about determining whether there's a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting lines intersect. So, the key here is to check for each possible perfect matching if all the line segments between matched pairs are non-intersecting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. Since R and B are up to 10, the total number of possible perfect matchings is manageable. For example, when R=B=10, the number of possible matchings is 10! which is around 3.6 million. But since 10! is 3,628,800, and for each matching we have to check O(R) line segments for intersections, it's feasible for small numbers like 10.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Generate all possible perfect matchings between the R spaceships and B bases. Since R and B are equal (since the problem says every base has exactly one guardian and vice versa), we can generate all permutations of the bases and assign each to a spaceship.\n\nWait, but the input may have R and B not equal? Wait, the problem says that the first line has R and B. But the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching. So, for that to be possible, R must equal B. Otherwise, there's no perfect matching. But the input constraints say that R and B are between 1 and 10. So, in the code, first check if R != B, then immediately output No. Because if R != B, there's no way to have a perfect matching. Oh right, the problem says that the input is such that the assignment is possible (but maybe not with the non-intersecting condition). Wait, no. The problem says that the input is given with R and B, but the first thing to check is whether R equals B. Because if they are not equal, then there's no possible perfect matching. So in that case, the answer is automatically No.\n\nSo first, check if R != B. If so, output No. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, for the case where R = B. Then, we need to check all possible permutations of the bases (or spaceships) and see if any permutation leads to a set of line segments that don't intersect each other.\n\nBut how do we check if two line segments intersect?\n\nWe need a function that takes two line segments (each defined by two points) and returns True if they intersect, False otherwise.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that no three points are colinear. So, any two line segments that are not overlapping (but in this problem, since all points are distinct and no three are colinear, any two line segments can't share a point except possibly endpoints. So, for two line segments AB and CD, they can't have overlapping parts except possibly at endpoints. So, the intersection check can be done by checking if the segments cross each other, not just touching at endpoints.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThe standard approach is to use the orientation method. Let me recall: To check if two line segments AB and CD intersect, we can check:\n\n- The orientation of A, B, C and A, B, D must be different (one is clockwise, the other counter-clockwise), and the orientation of C, D, A and C, D, B must be different. Also, we need to handle cases where one of the segments is a vertical line or something. Alternatively, the standard method uses the following steps:\n\nFirst, check if the segments AB and CD intersect properly (i.e., they cross each other, not just touching at endpoints). Also, check for the case where one of the endpoints lies on the other segment.\n\nBut given that the problem states that no three points are colinear, this simplifies things. Because if two segments share an endpoint, then that's allowed (as long as they don't cross). But since no three points are colinear, any two segments that share an endpoint can't have overlapping parts. However, for the problem's condition, the paths (segments) must not intersect. So even if two segments share an endpoint, that's considered as intersecting? Wait, no. The problem says that any two paths (straight lines from base to assigned spaceship) do not intersect. So, if two segments share an endpoint, that's allowed? Or does that count as intersecting?\n\nFor example, suppose two segments AB and AC. They share point A. Are they considered as intersecting? The problem says that the paths should not intersect. But since they meet at a common endpoint, they do intersect at that point. However, the problem says that the paths are straight lines from base to their assigned spaceship. So, if two paths share an endpoint, that would be a collision. But according to the note in the example, in the first example, connecting them in order works. So perhaps the problem allows the paths to share endpoints? Or perhaps the problem requires that the segments do not cross each other, but sharing endpoints is allowed.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\"\n\nSo, if two paths share an endpoint (i.e., a base is connected to a spaceship, and another base is connected to the same spaceship), then the paths share that point. But since each path is from a base to a spaceship, and each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, then two paths cannot share a spaceship or a base. Because in a perfect matching, each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship. Therefore, each path is from a unique base to a unique spaceship. Thus, any two paths will have distinct endpoints. Therefore, two paths cannot share any endpoints. Therefore, the only possible way that two paths could intersect is if their segments cross each other. Because the endpoints are all distinct. Therefore, the problem reduces to checking that for the given matching, none of the segments cross each other.\n\nTherefore, the problem of checking whether two segments intersect is to check if they cross each other (not just touching at endpoints). But given that no three points are colinear, the only way two segments can intersect is if they cross each other.\n\nSo, the function to check if two segments AB and CD intersect (properly, i.e., crossing each other) can be implemented using the orientation method.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor a given matching (a permutation of the bases, each assigned to a spaceship), check for all pairs of segments (each pair of matched pairs) whether they cross each other. If any pair crosses, the matching is invalid. Otherwise, it's valid.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\n- Read R and B. If R != B, output 'No'.\n\nElse:\n\n- Read R spaceship coordinates, then B base coordinates.\n\n- Generate all possible permutations of the bases (since each spaceship must be matched to exactly one base). For example, if there are R spaceships and B=R bases, then for each permutation of the B bases, we can assign the i-th spaceship to the i-th base in the permutation.\n\n- For each permutation, check if all the segments between spaceship i and base j (for the permutation) do not cross each other.\n\n- If any permutation satisfies this condition, output 'Yes'; else, output 'No'.\n\nNow, the problem is how to generate all permutations of the bases. Since B can be up to 10, the number of permutations is 10! = 3,628,800. For each permutation, we need to check all pairs of segments. For each permutation, the number of pairs is (R choose 2) = 45 for R=10. For each pair of segments, we need to check if they cross. So for each permutation, the cost is O(R^2) operations. For R=10, that's 100 per permutation. So total operations are 3.6 million * 100 = 360 million. That might be acceptable for Python, but perhaps tight. However, given that R and B are up to 10, and given that the problem says it's an easy version, perhaps the intended solution is this approach.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. However, given the constraints, the brute-force approach is feasible.\n\nNow, implementing the check for two line segments intersecting.\n\nImplementing the orientation function:\n\nThe orientation of three points (p, q, r) can be determined by the cross product of vectors (q-p) and (r-p). The value is:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0  # colinear\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2  # clockwise or counter-clockwise\n\nBut the problem says that no three points are colinear, so in our case, the orientation can never be zero. So, for the problem, when checking two segments AB and CD, the orientations can be used to check if they cross.\n\nThe standard method for checking if two segments AB and CD intersect is:\n\n- Check if the orientations of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) are different, and the orientations of (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) are different. If that's true, then the segments intersect.\n\nBut since the problem states that no three points are colinear, we can ignore the case where any of the orientations are zero.\n\nSo, the function to check if two segments AB and CD intersect:\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n    # General case\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n\n    # Special cases (but since no three points are colinear, these are not needed?)\n    # But wait, what if a point is on the other segment? But the problem says no three points are colinear, so for example, if C is on AB, then the orientation of A,B,C would be zero, which is impossible. Hence, the problem's input ensures that this can't happen. Therefore, the only case we need to check is the general case above.\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but in the problem's input, the points are such that no three are colinear. So, for any two segments AB and CD, the points C and D cannot lie on AB, and vice versa. Therefore, the only way the segments can intersect is if they cross each other. Therefore, the above condition is sufficient.\n\nThus, the segments_intersect function can be implemented as described.\n\nSo, for each permutation of the bases, we generate all the segments (spaceship i to base j in permutation), and check all pairs of segments for intersection. If any pair intersects, the permutation is invalid. Else, it's valid.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead R and B. If R != B, output 'No'.\n\nElse, read R spaceships (say, stored in a list called rebels), then read B bases (stored in bases).\n\nThen, generate all permutations of the bases. For each permutation, check if all pairs of segments in the matching are non-intersecting.\n\nIf any permutation passes, output 'Yes', else 'No'.\n\nNow, in Python, generating permutations can be done via itertools.permutations.\n\nBut for B=10, that's 10! = 3.6 million permutations. For each permutation, we need to check all pairs of segments.\n\nBut for each permutation, the segments are between rebels[i] and bases_perm[i], for i in 0..R-1.\n\nSo, for each permutation, we can generate all the segments, then for each pair of segments (i,j) where i < j, check if they intersect.\n\nIf any pair does, then the permutation is invalid.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplement the orientation function.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the code for orientation can be written as follows:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # returns 1 if clockwise, 2 if counter-clockwise\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0  # but the problem says this can't happen\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\nBut since the problem says that no three points are colinear, the val can't be zero. So, the function can safely return 1 or 2.\n\nThen, the segments_intersect function:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n    # Check if segment a1a2 intersects with segment b1b2\n    o1 = orientation(a1, a2, b1)\n    o2 = orientation(a1, a2, b2)\n    o3 = orientation(b1, b2, a1)\n    o4 = orientation(b1, b2, a2)\n\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the segments can't have overlapping points. So, this function returns True if the segments cross each other.\n\nNow, for each permutation, we generate all the segments, and check for all pairs.\n\nSo, for the permutation, the code would be:\n\nfor perm in permutations(bases):\n    # create list of segments\n    segments = [ (rebels[i], perm[i]) for i in range(R) ]\n    # check all pairs of segments\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(len(segments)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):\n            seg1 = segments[i]\n            seg2 = segments[j]\n            if segments_intersect(seg1[0], seg1[1], seg2[0], seg2[1]):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n    if valid:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n        exit()\nprint(\"No\")\n\nBut for R=10, this is O( (R^2) * permutations ), which may take some time. However, given the constraints, it's manageable.\n\nBut in Python, for R=10, the permutations are 3.6 million, and for each permutation, checking 45 pairs (for R=10, 10*9/2=45). For each pair, the segments_intersect function is called, which does four orientation checks. Each orientation check is O(1). So, per permutation, it's 45 * 4 = 180 operations. So, 3.6e6 * 180 = 6.48e8 operations. That's a lot for Python, which may be slow. However, given that the problem says it's the easy version, perhaps the test cases are small enough. But maybe there's a way to optimize.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can memoize some of the checks, but I don't think that's possible here.\n\nAnother optimization: for each permutation, once a pair of segments is found to intersect, we can break early and proceed to the next permutation.\n\nAnother thing: the order in which permutations are checked can affect performance. For example, if there's a valid permutation early in the list, the code can exit quickly.\n\nBut in the worst case, when there's no valid permutation, the code has to check all permutations.\n\nBut given the constraints, perhaps the code will pass.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, rebels are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n\nbases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\nIn the first example, the sample output is Yes. One possible way is to connect them in order. So, rebel 0 to base 0, rebel 1 to base 1, rebel 2 to base 2.\n\nCheck if any of the segments intersect.\n\nSegments:\n\n(0,0) to (-2,1)\n\n(2,0) to (0,3)\n\n(3,1) to (2,2)\n\nCheck pairs:\n\nBetween first and second segments: Do they cross?\n\nLet me compute the orientations.\n\nFirst segment is A(0,0) to B(2,0). Second segment is C(2,0) to D(0,3)? Wait no, the second segment is (2,0) to (0,3) (the second base is (0,3)).\n\nWait, the first segment is from (0,0) to (-2,1). The second is from (2,0) to (0,3).\n\nCheck if these two segments intersect.\n\nLet me compute the orientations.\n\nFor segment AB (A=(0,0), B=(2,0)), check points C=(-2,1) and D=(0,3) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first segment is A to B, and the second is C to D.\n\nWait, the first segment is between (0,0) and (-2,1) (A and B?), no. Wait, for the first segment, it's (0,0) to (-2,1). The second is (2,0) to (0,3). So for the first pair, the two segments are AB (from (0,0) to (-2,1)) and CD (from (2,0) to (0,3)).\n\nSo, compute o1: orientation of AB's points, C.\n\nWait, the function segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2) is checking if segment a1a2 and b1b2 intersect. So in this case, a1 is (0,0), a2 is (-2,1), and b1 is (2,0), b2 is (0,3).\n\nSo, o1 is orientation(a1, a2, b1) = orientation((0,0), (-2,1), (2,0)) ?\n\nLet me compute the value:\n\n(q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x)\n\np = (0,0), q = (-2,1), r = (2,0).\n\n(q.x - p.x) = -2 -0 = -2.\n\n(r.y - p.y) = 0 -0 = 0.\n\n(q.y - p.y) = 1 - 0 = 1.\n\n(r.x - p.x) = 2 - 0 = 2.\n\nSo the value is (-2)*0 - 1*2 = 0 - 2 = -2. Which is negative, so orientation returns 2.\n\nThen o2 is orientation(a1, a2, b2) = orientation((0,0), (-2,1), (0,3)).\n\nCompute:\n\np = (0,0), q = (-2,1), r = (0,3).\n\n(q.x - p.x) = -2, (r.y - p.y) = 3.\n\n(q.y - p.y) = 1, (r.x - p.x) = 0.\n\nvalue is (-2)*3 - (1)*0 = -6 - 0 = -6 < 0. So orientation returns 2.\n\nSo o1 and o2 are both 2. So o1 == o2. So the first condition (o1 != o2) is false. So the segments do not cross here.\n\nThen check the other pair. For the second segment (from (2,0) to (0,3)) and third segment (from (3,1) to (2,2)). Let's see if they cross.\n\nBut perhaps in this case, the segments don't cross. So the example is valid.\n\nSo the code would find that this permutation is valid and output yes.\n\nIn the second sample input:\n\n['2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, the input is R=2, B=1. So since R != B, output is No. Which matches the sample output.\n\nNow, code structure.\n\nIn Python, the code needs to read from stdin. However, the input format is given as a list of strings for the first example, but in reality, the code must read from standard input. So the code should read the input as per the problem description.\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe first line has R and B.\n\nThen R lines of x and y for the rebels.\n\nThen B lines of x and y for the bases.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B, print No.\n\nElse, read R rebels, then B bases.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the bases.\n\nFor each permutation, check if all pairs of segments between rebels[i] and perm[i] do not intersect.\n\nIf any permutation is valid, output Yes and exit.\n\nElse, output No.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut note that in Python, itertools.permutations is available. Also, the code must read from stdin.\n\nBut how to read the input?\n\nFor example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWhich is read as:\n\nFirst line: R=3, B=3.\n\nThen 3 lines for rebels: (0,0), (2,0), (3,1).\n\nThen 3 lines for bases: (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2).\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n    o1 = orientation(a1, a2, b1)\n    o2 = orientation(a1, a2, b2)\n    o3 = orientation(b1, b2, a1)\n    o4 = orientation(b1, b2, a2)\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    R = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    B = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(input[ptr])\n        y = int(input[ptr+1])\n        rebels.append( (x,y) )\n        ptr +=2\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(input[ptr])\n        y = int(input[ptr+1])\n        bases.append( (x,y) )\n        ptr +=2\n    # Now generate all permutations of the bases\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        # create segments\n        # check all pairs\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                # check segment between rebels[i] and perm[i], and rebels[j] and perm[j]\n                a1 = rebels[i]\n                a2 = perm[i]\n                b1 = rebels[j]\n                b2 = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code above, the for loops for checking pairs are nested. For each i in 0..R-1, and j in i+1..R-1. For each pair (i,j), check if their segments intersect.\n\nBut in the code, for each i, it loops j from i+1 to R-1. So, for each pair of segments (i and j), check.\n\nBut in the code, the 'break' after checking each j. So, for each i, after checking j, if any of them is invalid, break out of the j loop, then check if valid is False, break out of the i loop.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the code, the 'perm' is a permutation of the bases. So, for each perm, the code creates a list of bases, and for each i, the i-th rebel is matched with perm[i].\n\nNow, testing this code with the first sample input.\n\nBut what about the order of the points in the segments? For example, in the segments_intersect function, the order of a1 and a2 doesn't matter because the orientation is computed between a1, a2, and other points. Because the orientation is based on the cross product, which depends on the order of the points. But in the code, the segments_intersect function checks if the two segments cross, regardless of the order of the points in the segment. Because the function checks for the general case of crossing, regardless of the order of a1 and a2.\n\nYes. For example, if a1 is (0,0) and a2 is (-2,1), or vice versa, the orientation would be reversed, but the check for o1 != o2 would still hold if the segments cross.\n\nSo, the code is correct in that aspect.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The code reads the input as a single split list. But if the input is given with multiple lines, the split() method would split on all whitespace, which is correct.\n\nFor example, the input:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nis read as a list of strings split by whitespace, which would be ['3', '3', '0', '0', '2', '0', '3', '1', '-2', '1', '0', '3', '2', '2'].\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible issue is when R and B are zero? But the constraints say 1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10.\n\nAnother possible edge case is when R = B = 1. Then, there's only one possible matching, and no segments to check. So, output 'Yes'.\n\nAnother case: R = B = 2. Two rebels and two bases. There are two permutations. For each, check if the two segments cross.\n\nSo, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, let's test the code for the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nThe code would generate permutations of the bases. One of them is the original order [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]. The segments are:\n\nRebel 0 (0,0) to base 0 (-2,1).\n\nRebel 1 (2,0) to base 1 (0,3).\n\nRebel 2 (3,1) to base 2 (2,2).\n\nCheck all pairs of segments.\n\nCheck between first and second segments. As discussed earlier, they don't cross. Between first and third: check if the segments (0,0)-(-2,1) and (3,1)-(2,2) cross. Let's see.\n\nFor the first segment A=(0,0), B=(-2,1), and second segment C=(3,1), D=(2,2).\n\nCheck o1 = orientation(A,B,C). Compute:\n\n(q.x - p.x) = -2 - 0 = -2.\n\n(r.y - p.y) = 1 - 0 = 1.\n\n(q.y - p.y) = 1 - 0 = 1.\n\n(r.x - p.x) = 3 - 0 = 3.\n\nval = (-2)*1 - 1*3 = -2 -3 = -5 <0 → orientation is 2.\n\no2: orientation(A,B,D) → D is (2,2).\n\n(q.x - p.x) is -2, (r.y - p.y) is 2 - 0 = 2.\n\n(q.y - p.y) is 1, (r.x - p.x) is 2 - 0 = 2.\n\nval = (-2)*2 - 1*2 = -4 -2 = -6 <0 → orientation is 2. So o1 and o2 are same. So no crossing.\n\nThen check o3 and o4 for the other segment.\n\nFor segment CD (C=(3,1), D=(2,2)), check orientation with A and B.\n\no3 is orientation(C,D,A) → points C, D, A.\n\n(q.x - p.x) is 2-3 = -1, (r.y - p.y) is 0 -1 = -1.\n\n(q.y - p.y) is 2-1 = 1. (r.x - p.x) is 0 -3 = -3.\n\nval is (-1)*(-1) - 1*(-3) = 1 +3 =4>0 → orientation 1.\n\no4 is orientation(C,D,B) → B is (-2,1). So:\n\n(q.x - p.x) = 2-3 = -1, (r.y - p.y) = 1-1 = 0.\n\n(q.y - p.y) = 2-1 = 1. (r.x - p.x) = -2-3 = -5.\n\nval is (-1)*0 - 1*(-5) = 0 +5 =5>0 → orientation 1. So o3 and o4 are same. So the segments don't cross.\n\nSo, the first and third segments don't cross.\n\nThen check between second and third segments.\n\nSecond segment is (2,0) to (0,3). Third is (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nCheck if they cross.\n\nFor segment AB (A=(2,0), B=(0,3)), and CD (C=(3,1), D=(2,2)).\n\nCompute o1: orientation(A,B,C) → A=(2,0), B=(0,3), C=(3,1).\n\nval = (0-2)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(3-2) ?\n\nWait, formula is (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x).\n\np is A (2,0), q is B (0,3), r is C (3,1).\n\n(q.x - p.x) is 0-2 = -2.\n\n(r.y - p.y) is 1-0 = 1.\n\n(q.y - p.y) is 3-0 =3.\n\n(r.x - p.x) is 3-2 =1.\n\nval = (-2)*1 - 3*1 = -2 -3 = -5 <0 → orientation 2.\n\no2: orientation(A,B,D) where D is (2,2).\n\n(q.x - p.x) is -2, (r.y - p.y) is 2-0=2.\n\n(q.y - p.y) is 3, (r.x - p.x) is 2-2=0.\n\nval = (-2)*2 - 3*0 = -4 → orientation 2. So o1 and o2 are same. So no crossing.\n\nThus, the segments don't cross. So this permutation is valid. So the code would output 'Yes'.\n\nNow, for the second sample input:\n\nInput is:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nSo R=2, B=1. Since R != B, output is No. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: R=1, B=1. Output is Yes.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2. Suppose the rebels are at (0,0) and (2,2), and bases are at (0,2) and (2,0). Then, the two possible permutations are:\n\nPerm1: bases [ (0,2), (2,0) ] → segments (0,0)-(0,2) and (2,2)-(2,0). These are vertical lines, which are parallel, no crossing. So valid. So output Yes.\n\nPerm2: [ (2,0), (0,2) ] → segments (0,0)-(2,0) and (2,2)-(0,2). These are horizontal lines, no crossing. So valid. So output Yes.\n\nBut if the bases are arranged such that in any permutation, the segments cross.\n\nFor example, rebels at (0,0), (2,2), bases at (1,1), (3,3). Wait, but then R=B=2. But the problem says that no three points are colinear. However, in this case, the two bases and two rebels are colinear. But the problem says that the input ensures that no three points are colinear. So this case is not possible.\n\nSo, the code would handle the cases correctly.\n\nNow, considering that the code may have a problem with the order of the points in the segments. For example, if the segments are passed as (a1, a2) or (a2, a1), but the function segments_intersect is symmetric. Because the orientation function is based on the cross product, but the order of a1 and a2 affects the orientation. However, the function segments_intersect checks for both o1 and o2, and o3 and o4. For example, if you swap a1 and a2, then o1 and o2 would be swapped, but the condition (o1 != o2) remains the same. Similarly for the other part. So the function segments_intersect is symmetric in the two segments.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code is written as per the problem's instructions. The code reads from stdin, and outputs the required answer.\n\nNow, considering that the code may have to process multiple test cases. Wait, no. The problem says that the input is one test case. The sample input shows two examples, but the code is supposed to read one input. Wait, looking back at the problem's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers R and B. Then the next lines are the coordinates of the spaceships and bases. So, the code is supposed to process a single test case. The sample input shows two examples, but that's probably for the purpose of illustrating the input and output. So, the code should read one test case from stdin.\n\nThe sample input given in the problem is for two different test cases. For example, the first example's input is:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nBut this is probably a way to show that the first input gives 'Yes' and the second gives 'No'. However, in reality, the code should read from stdin. So, the code should read the entire input as a single test case.\n\nBut in practice, when the user runs the code, they would input the data for one test case. The code is supposed to handle that.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code may have a problem with the way it reads input. For example, if the input is read as a single string split into tokens, then for each line, the coordinates are read as two integers. The code uses input = sys.stdin.read().split(), which splits all whitespace, including newlines. So, for example, the first line is split into R and B, then the next R lines are split into their coordinates, etc. This is correct.\n\nTesting with the first sample input, the code would read the input correctly.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting paths intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of the bases and verifying if any permutation results in non-intersecting paths.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B). If R is not equal to B, immediately output \"No\" as a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: For each permutation of the bases, check if the paths from each spaceship to its assigned base do not intersect.\n3. **Intersection Check**: Use the orientation method to determine if two line segments intersect. This method checks the relative orientation of points to determine if segments cross each other.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n    o1 = orientation(a1, a2, b1)\n    o2 = orientation(a1, a2, b2)\n    o3 = orientation(b1, b2, a1)\n    o4 = orientation(b1, b2, a2)\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    R = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    B = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(input[ptr])\n        y = int(input[ptr + 1])\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n        ptr += 2\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(input[ptr])\n        y = int(input[ptr + 1])\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        ptr += 2\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                a1 = rebels[i]\n                a2 = perm[i]\n                b1 = rebels[j]\n                b2 = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Orientation Function**: This function calculates the orientation of three points to determine if they are clockwise, counter-clockwise, or collinear. Since the problem guarantees no three points are collinear, we can safely ignore the collinear case.\n2. **Segments Intersection Check**: This function uses the orientation values of four points to determine if two line segments intersect by checking if their orientations differ on both endpoints.\n3. **Permutations Check**: By generating all permutations of the bases, we check each possible assignment of spaceships to bases. For each permutation, we verify that no two paths intersect using the intersection check function.\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible assignments efficiently and correctly determine if a valid non-intersecting configuration exists.",
