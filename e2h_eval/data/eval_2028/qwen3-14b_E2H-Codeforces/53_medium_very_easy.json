    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is a string, and the output is the maximum length of such a substring. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the answer is 3 because 'aba' appears twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4, overlapping). So how do I check all possible substrings and their occurrences?\n\nHmm. The straightforward way is to check all possible substrings of the string and see which ones appear more than once. Then, among those, find the maximum length.\n\nBut how do I efficiently check all substrings? Let's think about generating all possible substrings for all possible lengths, then check if they appear at least twice.\n\nThe steps could be:\n\n1. Generate all possible substrings of the string.\n2. For each substring, check how many times it appears in the string.\n3. Keep track of the maximum length where the count is >= 2.\n\nBut generating all substrings might be computationally intensive. However, since the maximum length of the string is 100, even a brute-force approach should work here. Because for a string of length N, there are O(N^2) possible substrings. For N=100, that's 10^4 substrings. And for each substring, checking its occurrences can be done with a hash map or something similar.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\nLoop over all possible substring lengths, starting from the maximum possible down to 1. For each length L, generate all possible substrings of that length, and check if any of them appears at least twice. If found, return L as the maximum. Because we're checking from largest to smallest, the first occurrence of a valid substring would be the answer.\n\nWait, but how do I check if a substring appears at least twice? For each substring of length L, collect all occurrences and check if there are at least two.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible substring of length L, check if it exists in the string more than once.\n\nBut how to generate all substrings of a certain length?\n\nFor example, for a string s of length n, substrings of length L can be generated by taking s[i:i+L] for i in 0 to n-L.\n\nSo, for each possible L (starting from the maximum possible, which is len(s), down to 1), we can check all substrings of length L. For each of these substrings, check if it occurs more than once in the string.\n\nIf any substring of length L meets this condition, then the answer is L. Because we are checking from largest to smallest, the first L we find is the maximum.\n\nBut wait, what about when the same substring occurs multiple times? For example, in 'zzz', substrings of length 2 are 'zz' (positions 0-1, 1-2). So two occurrences. So the answer for that case is 2.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, len(s) - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            return L (since we're starting from the largest possible)\n\n        else:\n\n            add substr to seen\n\n    if any of the substrings in this loop was found twice, then return L.\n\nWait, but the above approach would not work because for each L, we need to check if any substring of length L appears at least twice. So for each L, we can collect all substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs more than once. But how?\n\nLet me think. For each L, we can collect all substrings of that length, and check if there are duplicates. So for example, for L=3 in 'ababa', the substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So the first occurrence is 'aba', then 'bab', then 'aba' again. So when we check, we can see that 'aba' appears twice.\n\nSo during the iteration for L, if any substring is found more than once, then return L as the answer.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nfor L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n\n    substrings = [s[i:i+L] for i in range(0, len(s)-L+1)]\n\n    if len(substrings) < 2:  # can't have two occurrences\n\n        continue\n\n    # check if any substring appears at least twice\n\n    counts = {}\n\n    for sub in substrings:\n\n        counts[sub] = counts.get(sub, 0) + 1\n\n    for key, val in counts.items():\n\n        if val >= 2:\n\n            return L\n\nSo the maximum L for which this is true is the answer.\n\nBut this approach would require checking for each L, starting from the maximum possible. Once we find the first L where this is true, return it.\n\nBut for the sample input 'abcd', the maximum possible L is 4, but there's only one substring of length 4. So for L=4, no. Then L=3, substrings are 'abc', 'bcd' — each occurs once. Then L=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' — all unique. Then L=1: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' — all unique. So answer is 0.\n\nAnother sample input is 'ababa', which for L=3, the substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So counts for 'aba' is 2. So return 3.\n\nThird sample is 'zzz', len is 3. For L=3, substrings is ['zzz'] → no. Then L=2: substrings are ['zz', 'zz']. So counts is {'zz':2} → return 2.\n\nSo this approach works for the samples.\n\nNow, the edge cases:\n\nCase where the entire string is made of the same character, like 'aaaaa'. The maximum L is 4, since substrings of length 4 are 'aaaa' (appears twice: positions 0-3 and 1-4).\n\nAnother edge case is when the string is of length 1, then output is 0.\n\nAnother case: 'aa' → the answer is 1, since the substring 'a' occurs twice. But for L=2, the substring is 'aa' which occurs once. So the answer is 1.\n\nSo the algorithm would correctly handle this.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nThe steps:\n\nRead the input string. Wait, the input is given as a list? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait the input is given as a list? Wait in the sample input, the input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but that's probably just the example of multiple test cases. Wait the original problem says:\n\nInput: the first input line contains the string. So the input is a single string. But the sample input shows a list. Oh, maybe that's a mistake in the problem description. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait the problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed... etc.\n\nBut the sample input shows ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], which is a list of three strings. But that's probably an example of multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output the answer. So perhaps the actual input is a single string, and the sample input is perhaps a list of test cases. But that's unclear.\n\nWait looking back:\n\nThe sample input is written as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], and the output is ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nBut that's probably a mistake in the problem description. Because the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is actually three separate test cases, each being a string, and the output is the corresponding answers. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output the answer. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Or perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's confusing.\n\nWait the original problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. So the code should read a single string. But the sample input shows a list of three strings, which would be a problem. However, perhaps that's a formatting error. For example, maybe the sample input is actually three lines, each being a string. But the problem says that the code should read from standard input. So perhaps the code is supposed to read a single string, and the sample input is a list of test cases. But the user needs to write code that reads from stdin, which for the sample input would be a single string. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not accurate, but the actual code is supposed to read one string per test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the code must read from stdin and output the answer. So for example, in the sample input, if the input is 'ababa', the output is 3.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the input is a list of three strings. However, perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description, and the actual input is a single string. So the code should read a single string from stdin, process it, and output the answer.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is a list of outputs. So perhaps the problem is expecting to process multiple test cases. But the original problem says that the input is a single string. This is confusing.\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a string. The first input line contains the string. So the code should read a single string. But the sample input shows a list of three strings. That's conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample input is ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], output is ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nSo perhaps the problem is that the actual input is multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single string. Maybe the problem is mistyped. Alternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as a list for clarity, but in reality, the input is a single string. For example, the sample input is the string 'abcd', which outputs 0. Then 'ababa' outputs 3, and 'zzz' outputs 2.\n\nBut how to reconcile that with the problem's input description?\n\nThis is a critical point. Because if the code is supposed to read a single string, then the sample input is perhaps written in a wrong way. But the user's instruction says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo, for example, if the input is a single string, then the code would read that string, compute the answer, and print it. But in the sample input, there are three test cases. So perhaps the problem is expecting to process multiple test cases, but the problem statement is not clear.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should read a list of strings, and output a list of answers. However, the problem says that the input is a single string. But this seems conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is presented with the sample input as a list of test cases, but the actual input is a single string. However, in the problem statement, the input is given as a single string. So perhaps the sample input is not properly formatted, and the actual code is supposed to process a single string.\n\nBut given that the problem says \"the first input line contains the string\", then the code should read a single string. Therefore, the sample input must be a mistake, and the actual code is supposed to read a single string.\n\nBut then, the sample input is given as a list of three strings, but the sample output is a list of three numbers. Which suggests that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. So perhaps the original problem is in a programming contest style where multiple test cases are provided, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases, and the sample output shows three answers. So perhaps the problem is that the user has to process multiple test cases. But the problem statement says that the input is a single string.\n\nThis is very confusing. However, looking back at the original problem statement:\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is given as a string, but the sample input shows a list of strings. Maybe that's a formatting error. For example, perhaps the sample input is three separate lines, each being a string. For example, the input is:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nWhich would make sense. So the code should read multiple lines of input, each being a string, and for each, output the answer.\n\nBut the original problem says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the problem is intended to have multiple test cases. However, the problem statement may have been miswritten.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, the code must handle multiple test cases. Otherwise, the sample input would not make sense.\n\nBut the user's problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo perhaps the code should read multiple lines of input, each line being a string, and output the corresponding answer for each line.\n\nBut the original problem's input description says that the first input line contains the string. Which is ambiguous.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, I think that the problem expects to process multiple test cases. So for example, the input may consist of multiple lines, each being a string, and the code should process each line and output the answer for each.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is a single string. But perhaps that's a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as a list for the purpose of the example, but the actual code should read a single string. However, the sample output is a list of numbers. So this is very confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the input is a list of strings, but the code should read a single string. But that's unclear.\n\nGiven that the problem says that the input is a single string, but the sample input shows a list of strings, perhaps the problem is intended to have multiple test cases. However, the user's code needs to process a single string. But that would not fit the sample input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code should read one string per line. For example, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate test case, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut how to proceed?\n\nWell, the sample input is given as a list of strings, and the sample output is a list of numbers. So perhaps the code should read all the strings from input (each on a separate line) and output the answers for each.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. However, the sample input contradicts that. Given that the user has provided the sample input and output, I think that the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases, each being a string on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single string. This is conflicting. However, given the sample input and output, I'll proceed under the assumption that the code needs to read multiple lines of input, each being a string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the original problem is written in a way that the input is a single string, and the sample input is written in a way that's incorrect. For example, perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, each being a string, and the output is the corresponding answers.\n\nBut in that case, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output the answer. So the code should process each line of input as a separate test case.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the problem is in the way the sample input is presented, and the actual code should process a single string.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output show multiple test cases, I think that the code is supposed to read multiple test cases.\n\nBut to resolve this, perhaps looking at the example:\n\nIn the sample input, the input is ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], and the output is ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nSo for each of these strings, the code should output the corresponding answer.\n\nThus, the code should read multiple lines from input, each being a string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut how to read that in Python? Well, for example, the code can read all lines from stdin, process each line as a string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is described as a single string. But perhaps that's a mistake. For example, perhaps the problem is from a programming competition where multiple test cases are present, and the code should process them all.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, perhaps the user's code should read a single string and output a single number. But then the sample input would not match. However, perhaps the sample input is written as a list to show multiple examples, but the actual code is to read one string and output one number.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output are lists, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. For example, the code could read all lines from stdin, split them into individual strings, and process each.\n\nBut the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the code is supposed to read a single string, and the sample input is written incorrectly.\n\nBut given the confusion, perhaps I should look for the correct approach based on the problem description.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string.\n\nSo the code should read a single string. So for example, if the input is 'ababa', the output is 3.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not accurate. For example, perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, and the code is supposed to read them all. But the problem says that the input is a single string.\n\nThis is a critical issue. If I proceed under the assumption that the code should process a single string, then the sample input may be a mistake, but the code can be written accordingly.\n\nBut given that the user provided the sample input as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], and output as ['0', '3', '2'], perhaps the code should read a list of strings, process each, and output the answers.\n\nBut how to read that from stdin? Well, in Python, the input can be read via input().split() or similar. For example, if the input is a single line with the list of strings, like ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], then perhaps the code should parse that.\n\nBut this is unclear. However, the original problem's sample input may be a formatting error, and the actual input is a single string. So perhaps the code should process a single string.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases, so the code may be expected to handle multiple test cases. But without further information, it's hard to say.\n\nBut looking at the problem's note that says \"this is a very easy question\", perhaps the code is supposed to read a single string and output a single number. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list for the purpose of showing multiple examples, but the actual code is supposed to read a single string.\n\nIn that case, the code should read a single string, and output the answer.\n\nSo, assuming that the code is supposed to process a single string, let's proceed.\n\nSo, the code will read a string from stdin, process it, and output the maximum length.\n\nNow, back to the algorithm.\n\nImplementing the approach of checking for each possible length L, starting from the maximum possible down to 1. For each L, check if any substring of length L appears at least twice.\n\nNow, in Python, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the string s.\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but this approach checks for substrings of length L and returns the first occurrence where a duplicate is found. However, for example, in the case of 'zzz', for L=2, the substrings are 'zz' (i=0) and 'zz' (i=1). When i=0, substr is added to seen. When i=1, substr is checked and found in seen, so returns 2.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nBut what about if there are multiple substrings of the same length, but some appear more than once? For example, in 'aaaaa', for L=4, the substrings are 'aaaa' (positions 0-3), 'aaaa' (positions 1-4). So when i=0, substr is added to seen. When i=1, substr is in seen, so return 4.\n\nYes.\n\nThis approach would work.\n\nBut what about cases where there are multiple substrings of the same length, but not overlapping? Like 'abab', for L=2: substrings are 'ab', 'ba', 'ab'. So when i=0, 'ab' is added. i=1: 'ba' added. i=2: 'ab' is already in seen, so return 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this approach is correct.\n\nBut why does this work? Because once we find any substring of length L that appears at least twice, we can immediately return L as the maximum possible. Since we're checking from largest to smallest, the first L that satisfies this condition is the maximum possible.\n\nSo this code would work.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 'abcd' → len 4.\n\nCheck L=4: only one substring. No.\n\nL=3: substrings are 'abc', 'bcd' → no duplicates.\n\nL=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' → no duplicates.\n\nL=1: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' → no duplicates. So output is 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' → len 5.\n\nCheck L=5: one substring. No.\n\nL=4: substrings are 'abab', 'baba' → no duplicates.\n\nL=3: substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. When i=0, add 'aba' to seen. i=1: 'bab' added. i=2: 'aba' is in seen → return 3.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz' → len 3.\n\nL=3: one substring. No.\n\nL=2: substrings are 'zz' (i=0) and 'zz' (i=1). At i=1, 'zz' is in seen → return 2.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nEdge case: 'aa' → len 2. For L=2: one substring. No. L=1: 'a' appears twice. So returns 1.\n\nAnother case: 'aaa' → L=3: one substring. L=2: substrings 'aa' (i=0) and 'aa' (i=1). So returns 2.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut how to read the input? The problem says that the input is a string. So the code should read a single line from stdin, which is the string.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, but that's possibly a mistake. So for the code, read the input as:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen process it.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but that's likely a formatting mistake. So the code should read a single string, and output the answer.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nBut wait, what about the case where there are multiple substrings of the same length, but not overlapping. For example, 'abab' → L=2: 'ab' appears at i=0 and i=2. So the code would catch this.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when the same substring appears more than once, but not in consecutive positions. Like 'abba' → L=2: substrings 'ab', 'bb', 'ba'. No duplicates. But for L=1, 'a' appears twice, 'b' appears twice. So the code returns 1.\n\nBut in this case, the maximum is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaa' → len 6. For L=3, substrings are 'aab', 'abb', 'bba', 'baa'. No duplicates. For L=2: 'aa', 'ab', 'bb', 'ba', 'aa'. When i=0, 'aa' is added. i=4, 'aa' is found again. So returns 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code for the problem. But according to the sample input and output, the code may need to handle multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single string. But given that the sample input shows multiple strings, perhaps the code should read multiple lines of input, each being a string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut how to handle that? For example, if the input is multiple lines, each being a string, then the code should process each line.\n\nBut the original problem statement says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the code should read a single line. However, the sample input shows three test cases, which suggests that the code should read multiple lines.\n\nBut the user's problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output the desired outputs. So perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate string, and output the answer for each.\n\nIn that case, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    s = line.strip()\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    found = False\n\n    for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                print(L)\n\n                found = True\n\n                break\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n        if found:\n\n            break\n\n    if not found:\n\n        print(0)\n\nBut this would handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but perhaps that's a representation of three lines, each being a string. For example, if the input is three lines, then the code would process each.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single string. But the sample input and output suggest multiple test cases.\n\nThis is very confusing. However, given the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. Hence, I'll proceed with the code that reads all lines from stdin and processes each.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is written in a wrong way, and the code should process a single string.\n\nBut the user's sample input shows that the input is a list of strings, and the output is a list of numbers. So perhaps the code should read a list of strings from input, process each, and output the answers.\n\nBut how to read that? For example, if the input is a single line containing a list of strings, like [\"abcd\", \"ababa\", \"zzz\"], then the code can read that line, split it into the list, and process each element.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a string. So this is unclear.\n\nBut given that the user provided the sample input as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], and the output as ['0', '3', '2'], perhaps the code should read a single line, which is a list of strings, process each, and output the answers as a list of numbers.\n\nBut this is unlikely, as the problem says that the input is a string.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the assumption that the code is supposed to process a single string. Hence, the code reads a single string from stdin and outputs the answer.\n\nThus, the code is:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nBut this code would handle the sample input if the input is a single string. For example, if the input is 'ababa', the output is 3.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the input is a list of three strings. However, this code would not handle that. But given the problem statement, this is the correct approach.\n\nHowever, the user's note says that the sample input is ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], and output is ['0', '3', '2'], which suggests that the code must handle multiple test cases. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines from stdin, each being a string, and for each, output the answer.\n\nBut how to handle that? For example, the code would read all lines from stdin, and for each line, process the string.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        s = line.strip()\n\n        n = len(s)\n\n        found = False\n\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n            seen = set()\n\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n                if substr in seen:\n\n                    print(L)\n\n                    found = True\n\n                    break\n\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n            if found:\n\n                break\n\n        if not found:\n\n            print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut in this case, for each input line, it processes the string and prints the answer. For example, if the input is three lines, each being a string, then the output would be three lines with the answers.\n\nThis would match the sample input and output.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the first input line contains the string. So this may be a misunderstanding. However, given the sample input and output, this seems to be the correct approach.\n\nBut the user's problem statement says that the input is a single string, but the sample shows multiple. This is a contradiction.\n\nBut given that the user provided the sample input as a list of strings and the output as a list of numbers, I think that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each string, and output the corresponding answer for each.\n\nThus, the final code would be as above.\n\nBut let's test with the sample input. For example, if the input is three lines:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nThe code would process each line and output 0, 3, 2.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the problem statement's input description, it says that the input is a single string. But perhaps that's a mistake.\n\nBut given that the user's sample shows multiple test cases, and the code must handle them, I'll proceed with the code that handles multiple test cases.\n\nHence, the code is written as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read multiple lines of input, each representing a separate string.\n2. **Substring Generation**: For each string, generate all possible substrings starting from the longest possible length down to 1.\n3. **Check for Duplicates**: For each length, check if any substring of that length appears more than once using a set to track seen substrings.\n4. **Early Termination**: As soon as a valid substring (appearing at least twice) is found for a particular length, output that length and move to the next string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        s = line.strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        found = False\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found:\n                break\n        if not found:\n            print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads all lines from standard input, each line being a separate string.\n- **Generating Substrings**: For each string, we iterate from the maximum possible substring length down to 1. This ensures that we find the longest valid substring first.\n- **Tracking Seen Substrings**: Using a set, we efficiently check if a substring has been seen before. If a duplicate is found, we immediately print the length of that substring and move to the next string.\n- **Efficiency**: By checking from the longest possible substring length downwards, we ensure that the first valid substring found is the longest one, allowing us to terminate early for each string.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the longest repeating substring for each input string, leveraging sets for quick lookups and early termination to optimize performance.",
