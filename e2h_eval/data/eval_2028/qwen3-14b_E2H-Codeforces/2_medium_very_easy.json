Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1), and the anti-diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must have the same character. Also, all other cells must have the same character, different from the diagonal's.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check that all elements not on the diagonals are the same. Let's call this 'o_char'.\n3. Ensure that d_char != o_char.\n\nBut how do I check that?\n\nFirst, collect all the characters on the diagonals. Then check if they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check if they are the same and different from the diagonal's.\n\nWait, but for the non-diagonal elements, they can be in any position except the diagonals. So for each cell (i,j), if i == j or i + j == n-1, then it's part of the diagonals. Otherwise, it's part of the non-diagonal group.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Iterate through each cell in the grid.\n- For each cell, check if it is on either diagonal. If yes, collect its character into the diagonal set. Else, collect into the non-diagonal set.\n- Then check that all diagonal characters are the same, all non-diagonal are same, and the two sets are different.\n\nBut wait, there's a possibility that the non-diagonal set is empty? Well, since n is at least 3, and odd. For example, n=3: the diagonals have 3 cells each, but overlapping at the center. So total diagonal cells are 2n - 1. For n=3, that's 5 cells. The total cells is 9, so non-diagonal is 4. So for n >=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nCollect all the diagonal characters. Check that they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters, check they are all same and different from the diagonal's.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think about code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string of length n. So grid is a list of lists, perhaps.\n\nThen:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1 and diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars.\n\nBut wait, the diagonal may have multiple elements, but all same. So the set would have size 1. Same for non-diagonal.\n\nSo the code would check that.\n\nBut wait, what if the non-diagonal set is empty? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1 and diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what if the non-diagonal set is empty? Well, for n=3, the non-diagonal has 4 elements. So no.\n\nBut let's test with sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nSo the diagonals are positions where i=j or i +j =4.\n\nFor i=0, j=0 and j=4: x and x.\n\ni=1: j=1 and j=3: x and x.\n\ni=2: j=2 (x) and j=2 (since i +j = 2+2=4? Wait n is 5, so n-1 is 4. So for i=2, j=2: i +j =4? 2+2=4, yes. So that's part of the diagonal. So the cell (2,2) is part of both diagonals. So for the diagonals, all cells are collected.\n\nSo in the first sample input, the diagonals have:\n\nLooking at each cell on the diagonals:\n\nRow 0: x (0,0) and x (0,4)\n\nRow 1: x (1,1) and x (1,3)\n\nRow 2: x (2,2) ?\n\nBut row 2 is 's o x o o' — so (2,2) is x. So the diagonals have x's. But then, looking at row 2, the cell (2,0) is s. Which is not on the diagonal. So the non-diagonal chars include s, o, etc. So in this case, the non-diagonal chars would have multiple values, hence the output is NO. Which matches the first sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nThe diagonals are (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). So the characters are w, w, w, w, w. So diagonal_chars is {w}.\n\nNon-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). Their values are s, s, s, s. So non_diagonal_chars is {s}. So the condition holds. So output is YES.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nThe diagonals are (0,0)=x, (0,2)=x; (1,1)=x; (2,0)=x; (2,2)=e. So the diagonal characters are x, x, x, x, e. So the set is {x, e}, so len is 2. Hence, the condition fails. So output NO.\n\nSo the code logic seems correct.\n\nBut how to implement it in Python?\n\nNow, the code needs to read from standard input. But the input is given as a list of strings, but in the problem statement, the input is given as first line n, then n lines of letters.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Each of the next n lines contains n small letters.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input, the first line is 5, then 5 lines of 5 letters each.\n\nSo, in code, we can read n, then read n lines, each line being a string.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the input is given as a list of strings, but that's probably for the example. The actual input is via stdin.\n\nSo, the code should read from stdin.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nRead n from input. Then read n lines, each line being a string. Then process.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, for each cell (i,j), check if i == j or i + j == n-1.\n\nSo, collect all the diagonal characters and non-diagonal.\n\nBut in code:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check if len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1 and diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars.\n\nIf yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what if the non-diagonal set is empty? Well, for n=3, the non-diagonal has 4 elements. For n=1, but n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut for n=3, the diagonals have 2n - 1 = 5 elements. The total cells is 9. So non-diagonal is 4.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, testing the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=5, the grid as above. The diagonal_chars would have x, x, x, x, x? Or maybe some other letters?\n\nWait, in the first sample input, the third row is 'soxoo'.\n\nSo row 2 (i=2) is 's o x o o'.\n\nSo for i=2, j=2 is x. And i + j = 2 + 2 = 4 (n-1 is 4). So yes, it's part of the diagonals. So the diagonals have:\n\nLooking at all cells:\n\nRow 0: (0,0) x, (0,4) x.\n\nRow 1: (1,1) x, (1,3) x.\n\nRow 2: (2,2) x.\n\nRow 3: (3,1) x, (3,3) x.\n\nRow 4: (4,0) x, (4,4) x.\n\nSo all diagonals are x. So diagonal_chars is {x}.\n\nBut the non-diagonal cells include, for example, row 2, column 0: s. Which is not on the diagonal. So non_diagonal_chars includes s, o, etc. So the non_diagonal_chars would have more than one element. So the code returns NO, which matches the first sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo for each cell:\n\ni=0, j=0 (w), i=0, j=2 (w). i=1, j=1 (w). i=2, j=0 (w), i=2, j=2 (w). So diagonals are all w. Non-diagonal cells are (0,1) s, (1,0) s, (1,2) s, (2,1) s. So non_diagonal_chars is {s}. So the code returns YES.\n\nThird sample input:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo for diagonals:\n\ncells (0,0) x, (0,2) x; (1,1) x; (2,0) x; (2,2) e. So diagonal_chars is {x, e} (since (2,2) is e). So len is 2, so condition fails. Output is NO.\n\nSo the code works for these samples.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat if all the non-diagonal are same, but same as diagonal?\n\nLike n=3, all cells are x. Then diagonals are x, non-diagonal are x. So the code would check if diagonal and non-diagonal are different. Since they are same, returns NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are x, non-diagonal are y. Then returns YES.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are x and x, but non-diagonal has some other letters. Like, suppose one non-diagonal is y and another is z. Then len(non_diagonal_chars) is 2, so returns NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the code would read n, then read n lines.\n\nBut for the code, the code should read from stdin. So:\n\nRead n from input. Then read n lines.\n\nBut sometimes, when reading input, there might be leading/trailing spaces, but the problem says that each line contains exactly n letters. So assuming that the input is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, process.\n\nBut for the code, the code is:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal = set()\n\nnon_diagonal = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal) == 1 and len(non_diagonal) == 1 and diagonal != non_diagonal:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what if the non_diagonal is empty? Well, n is at least 3. For n=3, the non-diagonal has 4 elements. So no.\n\nBut for n=1, but the constraints say n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal is empty? Well, it's impossible.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 5, then the lines. The code would process and get diagonal as {x}, non_diagonal as {s, o, ...} etc. So returns NO.\n\nSample 2: returns YES.\n\nSample 3: returns NO.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, input:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nThen, diagonals are all a, non-diagonal are all a. So len(diagonal) is 1, len(non) is 1, but they are same. So output is NO.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, input:\n\naba\n\nbaa\n\naba\n\nDiagonals: (0,0) a, (0,2) a; (1,1) a; (2,0) a; (2,2) a. So diagonal is {a}.\n\nNon-diagonal cells: (0,1) b, (1,0) b, (1,2) a, (2,1) b. So non_diagonal is {b, a} (since (1,2) is a). So len is 2. So output is NO.\n\nAnother case where non-diagonal has all same but same as diagonal. So output NO.\n\nAnother case where diagonals have different letters. Like, for n=3, first row is abc, second row def, third row ghi. Then diagonals are a, e, i. So set has 3 elements. So output is NO.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nThus, this code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of characters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The criteria are that all characters on both diagonals of the grid must be the same, and all other characters (not on the diagonals) must be the same but different from the characters on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Diagonal and Non-Diagonal Characters Collection**: Traverse each cell in the grid to collect characters that lie on the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) into one set. Collect all other characters into another set.\n3. **Validation**: Check if both sets contain exactly one unique character each, and ensure that these two characters are different.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1 and diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first input line is the integer `n`, followed by `n` lines each containing `n` characters.\n- **Character Collection**: We iterate through each cell in the grid. If a cell is on either of the two diagonals, its character is added to the `diagonal_chars` set. Otherwise, it is added to the `non_diagonal_chars` set.\n- **Validation Check**: The solution checks if both sets contain exactly one unique character each and that these characters are different. If so, the grid forms an \"X\", and we print \"YES\"; otherwise, we print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions using set operations, ensuring clarity and optimal performance for the given constraints.",
