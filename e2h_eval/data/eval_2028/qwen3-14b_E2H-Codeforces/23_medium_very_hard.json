In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about determining the minimum number of tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu, which can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The input is three tiles, and we have to find the minimum draws required.\n\nFirst, let's think about what the possible scenarios are. The initial three tiles might already form a mentsu, in which case the answer is 0. If not, we need to check how many more tiles are needed to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nLet me break down the steps:\n\n1. Check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n2. If not, determine the minimum number of tiles needed to add to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nBut how do I check for possible mentsu?\n\nFor checking a triplet (koutsu): All three tiles must be the same. So for example, if the input is three 9m, then it's a triplet. So for the initial check, if all three are same, then answer is 0.\n\nFor checking a sequence (shuntsu): The three tiles must be consecutive numbers in the same suit. For example, 1s, 2s, 3s. But they can be in any order. So I need to check if the three tiles are in the same suit, and their numbers form a consecutive sequence.\n\nSo first, I need to check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal draws. Let's think about the possibilities.\n\nThe problem allows adding any number of tiles. So the minimal number could be 0 (already has mentsu), 1, 2, etc. But since the initial three tiles don't form a mentsu, the minimal is at least 1. Wait, no. For example, maybe with adding one tile, you can form a triplet or a sequence.\n\nSo the approach would be to consider all possible ways to form a mentsu by adding some tiles, and find the minimal number needed.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think about possible cases where adding 1 tile is sufficient.\n\nCase 1: Adding one tile to form a triplet. For example, if two tiles are same, then adding another same tile. So for example, if the initial tiles are [1m, 1m, 2m], then adding another 1m would form a triplet. But wait, the initial three tiles are not a triplet. But adding one tile gives four tiles. Then, there are three same tiles (the two original plus the new one). So that's a triplet. So in this case, the answer would be 1.\n\nCase 2: Adding one tile to form a sequence. For example, if the initial tiles are [1s, 2s, 4s]. Then adding 3s would form a sequence of 1-2-3. Or if the initial is [2s, 3s, 4s], then adding 1s or 5s would allow a sequence. Wait, no. Wait, the original three tiles are 2s, 3s, 4s. That's already a sequence. So that case would have answer 0. But if the initial is [1s, 2s, 4s], adding 3s would make a sequence. So that's one tile needed.\n\nSo the problem is to check whether there's a way to form a triplet or sequence with the current tiles plus some added tiles, and find the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nBut how to approach this?\n\nLet me think about all possibilities. For each possible way of forming a mentsu, compute how many tiles are needed, then take the minimum.\n\nSo for the current three tiles, we need to check all possible mentsu that can be formed by adding some tiles, and find the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of all possibilities for forming a triplet or sequence.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles can form a triplet or sequence. If yes, answer is 0.\n\nIf not, then check for possibilities where adding 1 tile can form a triplet or sequence.\n\nIf any of those possibilities exists, answer is 1.\n\nElse, check for possibilities where adding 2 tiles can form a triplet or sequence.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut since the problem requires the minimal number, perhaps the answer can be 0, 1, 2, or 3? Let's think.\n\nWait, the maximum number of tiles needed would be 2, perhaps. Because with three tiles, maybe adding two more tiles can form a triplet or sequence.\n\nWait, for example, if the initial tiles are [1m, 1m, 2m]. Then adding one 1m gives a triplet. So answer is 1. If the initial is [1m, 2m, 3m], then answer is 0. But suppose the initial is [1m, 2m, 4m]. Then adding 3m would form a sequence (needs 1 tile). So answer is 1.\n\nAnother example: initial tiles are [1m, 1p, 2m]. How can they form a mentsu? Well, maybe adding two tiles. For example, adding 1m and 1p would form a triplet (but that's two tiles). Wait, but the initial tiles are 1m, 1p, 2m. So, if you add one 1m, then you have two 1m and one 1p. Not a triplet. So you need to add two more tiles. Or perhaps, you can form a sequence. Let's see. For example, 1m, 2m, 3m. So adding 3m. Then the tiles are [1m, 2m, 3m, 1p]. So there's a sequence. So that would require adding 1 tile. So the answer is 1.\n\nWait, but the initial three tiles are not forming a mentsu. So the answer is 1.\n\nSo the key is to find for all possible mentsu (triplet or sequence) that can be formed by adding some tiles, and find the minimal number of tiles needed to reach that.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nCheck if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, check if there exists a way to form a mentsu by adding 1 tile. If yes, return 1.\n\nElse, check if there exists a way to form a mentsu by adding 2 tiles. If yes, return 2.\n\nElse, return 3? Or is there a case where even adding 3 tiles is needed?\n\nWait, let's think of a case where adding 2 tiles is needed. For example, if the initial tiles are [1m, 1m, 2m]. Then, to form a triplet, you need to add one 1m. So answer is 1. But suppose the initial tiles are [1m, 2m, 4m]. To form a sequence, you need to add 3m. So answer is 1.\n\nAnother case: initial tiles are [1m, 3m, 5m]. How can we form a sequence? Well, adding 2m and 4m would make a sequence of 1-2-3, but that's two tiles. Or perhaps adding 2m and 3m and 4m? No, that's three. Alternatively, maybe adding 2m and 4m would allow sequences like 1-2-3 (needs 2m and 3m?), but maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, the initial tiles are 1m, 3m, 5m. So adding 2m and 4m would give us 1m, 2m, 3m, 4m, 5m. Now, there are multiple sequences possible. For example, 1-2-3, 2-3-4, 3-4-5. So adding two tiles. Thus, the answer is 2.\n\nBut is there a way to form a triplet? For example, adding two 1m's? Then the tiles would be 1m, 1m, 1m, 3m, 5m. Then there's a triplet. So that's adding two tiles. So the answer is 2.\n\nSo for this case, the minimal is 2.\n\nBut what about if the initial tiles are [1m, 2p, 3s]. Then, to form a triplet, you need to add two more tiles of same type. For example, adding two 1m's would give a triplet. But that's two tiles. Alternatively, adding one tile to form a triplet? No, because you need three same tiles. So initial has one of each. So you need to add two tiles. So the answer would be 2.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. For example, adding two tiles of 1m, then triplet. So that's two tiles. So the answer is 2.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal is 2.\n\nSo, in general, the answer can be 0, 1, 2, or maybe even 3? Let's see.\n\nIs there a case where even adding three tiles is needed?\n\nLet's think of an example. Suppose the initial tiles are [1m, 2m, 4p]. How can we form a mentsu?\n\nOption 1: form a triplet. We need three same tiles. So for example, adding two more 1m's. That would require adding two tiles. Then we have three 1m's. So answer is 2.\n\nOr, adding three 4p's. Then, the initial has one 4p, adding three would make four, so three of them. So that's adding three tiles. Which is worse than the previous option.\n\nAlternatively, can we form a sequence?\n\nLooking for a sequence. Let's see. The current tiles are 1m, 2m, 4p. So, perhaps adding 3m and 4m to form 1m, 2m, 3m. That would require adding two tiles. So answer is 2. So that's better than adding three.\n\nSo the answer here is 2.\n\nAnother example: initial tiles are [1m, 2p, 3s]. So, no suit is same. How to form a mentsu?\n\nPossible options:\n\nTriplet: Need to add two more of any tile. For example, adding two 1m's. Then, three 1m's. So answer is 2.\n\nSequence: Need to form a sequence in same suit. For example, in m: need 1m, 2m, 3m. Current has 1m. So adding 2m and 3m. Two tiles. Same for p and s. So answer is 2.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nSo in all these examples, the minimal number of tiles needed is 0, 1, or 2. Is there any case where the answer is 3?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the initial tiles are [1m, 1p, 2s]. How can we form a mentsu?\n\nTo form a triplet, we need to add two more of any tile. For example, adding two 1m's. So answer is 2.\n\nTo form a sequence, we need to have three consecutive in same suit. So for example, in m: need 1m, 2m, 3m. So adding 2m and 3m. Two tiles. Same for other suits. So again, answer is 2.\n\nSo even in this case, the answer is 2.\n\nAnother example: initial tiles are [1m, 2m, 3p]. How to form a sequence? Well, for m, we have 1m and 2m. Need 3m. Adding 3m. Then, there's a sequence. So answer is 1. So the answer is 1.\n\nSo I think that the minimal number of tiles needed is at most 2. Because if you can't form a mentsu with 0 or 1, then adding two tiles will allow you to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nWait, but why?\n\nBecause with three initial tiles, adding two tiles gives five tiles. So there are various possibilities. For example, if you have two tiles of the same suit and number, adding another same tile would form a triplet. Or, if you have two tiles in a sequence, adding one more to complete the sequence. Or, adding two tiles to form a triplet or sequence.\n\nBut how can I be sure that the answer is never 3?\n\nWell, perhaps the answer can't be higher than 2. Let me think.\n\nBecause, for example, even if the initial three tiles are all different suits and numbers, adding two tiles can form a triplet. For example, adding two same tiles as one of the existing ones. So, for example, initial tiles are [1m, 2p, 3s]. Adding two 1m's. Now, there's three 1m's. So triplet. So answer is 2.\n\nAlternatively, adding one 1m and one 2m. Then, the tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m, 2p, 3s. But that doesn't form a triplet or sequence. So that's not helpful. But the point is, there exists a way to add two tiles to form a triplet.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of tiles needed is 2.\n\nSo the possible answers are 0, 1, or 2.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCheck if the initial tiles form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, check if adding one tile can form a mentsu. If yes, return 1.\n\nElse, return 2.\n\nBut how to check if adding one tile can form a mentsu?\n\nLet me think. For the current three tiles, adding one tile gives four tiles. We need to check if among these four tiles, there exists a triplet or a sequence.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of all possible ways that adding one tile can help form a triplet or sequence.\n\nFor example, for triplet:\n\nWe need three same tiles. So, for each of the three existing tiles, check if there are two of them. Then adding one more would form a triplet. Or if there is one of them, adding two more. But that would require adding two tiles, which is beyond the one tile scenario.\n\nWait, for example, if the current tiles have two of the same. Then adding one more of the same would form a triplet. So in that case, the answer is 1.\n\nSo, for the triplet case, if there are two same tiles in the initial three, then adding one more would form a triplet.\n\nSimilarly, for the sequence case. Let's think about the current three tiles. Suppose they are in the same suit. Then, check if they can form a sequence with one tile added. For example, if the three are 1m, 2m, 4m. Then adding 3m would form a sequence. So the answer is 1.\n\nBut if the three tiles are in different suits, then adding a tile can't form a sequence unless it's in the same suit as two of the existing tiles.\n\nSo, for the sequence case, we need to check if there exists a way to have three consecutive numbers in the same suit, possibly with one tile added.\n\nSo, how to check that?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, check for triplet possibility with adding one tile.\n\nCheck if there are two tiles of the same type. For example, if the initial three tiles have two same, then adding one more same tile would form a triplet. So in that case, answer is 1.\n\nFor example, initial tiles are [1m, 1m, 2m]. Then, adding another 1m would form a triplet. So answer is 1.\n\nSo, the code can check for any occurrence of two same tiles. If yes, then answer is 1.\n\nBut what if there are two pairs? Like [1m, 1m, 1m] — but that's a triplet already, which would have been handled in the initial check.\n\nSo, in the initial check, if the three tiles are all same, answer is 0.\n\nElse, if there are two same tiles, then adding one more gives a triplet. So answer is 1.\n\nBut also, there's the possibility of forming a sequence with adding one tile. For example, if the three tiles are in same suit and can form a sequence with one tile added.\n\nSo, for example, initial tiles are [1m, 2m, 3m] — already a sequence. Answer is 0. If initial is [1m, 2m, 4m], then adding 3m gives a sequence. So answer is 1.\n\nSo, how to check for that possibility?\n\nSo, for the sequence case, we need to check if there's a way to have three consecutive numbers in the same suit, possibly with one tile added.\n\nSo, for the three initial tiles, we can group them by suit.\n\nFor each suit that has at least two tiles, check if they can form part of a sequence with one added tile.\n\nFor example, suppose the three tiles are in the same suit. Let's take their numbers and sort them. Let's say the numbers are a, b, c. Sorted, they are x, y, z.\n\nCheck if there's a way to have three consecutive numbers by adding one tile.\n\nPossible cases:\n\nCase 1: x, y, z are consecutive. Then, already a sequence. But that would have been handled in initial check.\n\nCase 2: x, y, z are such that x and y are consecutive, and z is two higher than y. For example, 1,2,4. Then, adding 3 would form 1,2,3. So possible.\n\nOr, if x is 1, y is 3, z is 4. Then adding 2 would form 1,2,3. Or adding 5 would form 3,4,5. So two possibilities.\n\nSo, for the sorted list of numbers in a suit, check if there is a gap that can be filled with one tile.\n\nSo, for example, if the numbers are [a, b, c], sorted.\n\nCheck if there's a pair of numbers with difference 2, and the third is adjacent to one of them.\n\nAlternatively, for three numbers, there are three possible gaps between them.\n\nFor example, sorted numbers are [a, b, c].\n\nCheck:\n\nIf (b - a == 1 and c - b == 2) → then adding (b+1) would make a sequence of a, b, b+1. But wait, then the three numbers would be a, b, b+1. But the original numbers are a, b, c = a, b, b+2. So adding b+1.\n\nOr if (c - b == 1 and b -a == 2) → adding a+1.\n\nOr if (a and b are consecutive, and c is two higher than b) → adding c-1.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to check is:\n\nIf there's a way to have two consecutive numbers, and the third is one away from them. For example, if the three numbers are 1, 2, 4. Then, adding 3 would form 1,2,3. Or if the three numbers are 1, 3, 4, adding 2 would form 1,2,3. Or adding 5 would form 3,4,5.\n\nSo, for the three numbers, if there's a way to form a sequence by adding one tile, then the answer is 1.\n\nSo, how to check that.\n\nLet me think about the sorted list of numbers in the same suit. Let's call them nums = sorted list of numbers.\n\nIf the length of nums is 3 (since we are considering the same suit), then check:\n\nIf the numbers are 1, 2, 3 → already a sequence. So handled in initial check.\n\nIf the numbers are 1, 2, 4 → then adding 3 → possible.\n\nIf the numbers are 1, 3, 4 → adding 2 or 5.\n\nIf the numbers are 2, 3, 5 → adding 4 or 6.\n\nIf the numbers are 1, 2, 5 → adding 3 or 4 (but adding 3 would form 1,2,3; adding 4 would form 2,4,5? No, that's not a sequence. Wait, 2,4,5 isn't consecutive. So only adding 3 would work.\n\nSo, for the three numbers, how to check if adding one tile can form a sequence.\n\nThe idea is that the three numbers must have two consecutive numbers, and the third is either one less than the first, or one more than the second. Or, the three numbers are spread out such that there's a gap of two between two of them, and the third is adjacent to one of them.\n\nAlternatively, for the three numbers, check if there exists a pair with difference 1, and the third is within one step of that pair.\n\nAnother approach: for the three numbers, check if the maximum minus the minimum is <= 2. Because if the max and min differ by 2, then adding one tile can fill the gap. For example, numbers 1, 2, 3 → max - min is 2. But already a sequence. So that's already handled. If the numbers are 1, 2, 4 → max - min is 3. So that's not. But if the numbers are 1, 3, 4 → max - min is 3. So that's not. Wait, that approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, for three numbers, check if the maximum and minimum differ by 2 and there is a missing number in between. For example, 1, 2, 4 → max - min is 3. No. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think of the three numbers as a set. For example, {1,2,4} → the missing number is 3. Adding that would form a sequence. So, for the three numbers, check if there exists a number x such that when added to the existing numbers, they form three consecutive numbers. For example, for {1,2,4}, x=3. For {1,3,4}, x=2 or x=5. For {1,2,3}, x is not needed.\n\nSo, for the three numbers, check if the set is missing exactly one number in a consecutive range of three. So, for example, {1,2,4} is missing 3. So adding it would form 1-2-3. Similarly, {1,3,4} is missing 2, which would form 1-2-3, or missing 5, which would form 3-4-5.\n\nSo, for the three numbers, the way to check is:\n\nIf the numbers are all in the same suit, and the set of numbers can be extended by one number to form a sequence of three consecutive numbers.\n\nHow to check that?\n\nLet me think of the three numbers as a sorted list. Let's say they are a, b, c.\n\nIf the numbers are such that (b - a) == 1 and (c - b) == 1 → already a sequence.\n\nElse, check if (b - a) == 1 and (c - b) == 2 → then adding (b + 1) would form a sequence. So yes.\n\nOr, if (b - a) == 2 and (c - b) == 1 → adding (a + 1) would form a sequence.\n\nOr, if (b - a) == 2 and (c - b) == 2 → then adding (a+1) or (b+1) would form a sequence. For example, a=1, b=3, c=5. Adding 2 would form 1-2-3. Adding 4 would form 3-4-5. So yes.\n\nIn this case, adding one tile is possible.\n\nBut if the three numbers are a, b, c such that the max and min differ by more than 2, then adding one tile can't form a sequence. For example, 1, 3, 5. The max is 5, min is 1. Difference is 4. Adding one tile (say 2) gives 1,2,3,5. Then there's a sequence 1-2-3. So that's possible. So the difference between max and min is 4, but adding one tile can form a sequence.\n\nSo, the earlier approach of checking for the sorted list's max and min is not sufficient.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to check if the three numbers can be part of a sequence of three consecutive numbers, with one missing. For example, in the case of 1,3,5, adding 2 and 4 would form sequences, but adding one tile can only form one of them. Wait, but adding one tile would give four tiles. So in the case of adding 2, the tiles would be 1,2,3,5. There's a sequence 1-2-3. So yes. So, even though the original three numbers are 1,3,5, adding 2 allows a sequence.\n\nSo, how to check that?\n\nFor the three numbers, check if there exists a sequence of three consecutive numbers where two of them are present, and the third is missing. For example, for 1,3,5, there are multiple possibilities:\n\n- 1,2,3: has 1 and 3, missing 2.\n\n- 2,3,4: has 3, missing 2 and 4.\n\n- 3,4,5: has 3 and 5, missing 4.\n\nSo, for each of the three numbers, check if there exists a consecutive triplet where two of the numbers are present and one is missing.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to generate all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers in the same suit, and check if two of the numbers are present in the current tiles. For example, for the current suit, check all possible sequences (like 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9). For each such sequence, check if at least two of the numbers are present in the current tiles. If so, then adding the missing one would form a sequence.\n\nBut since the current tiles have three numbers, perhaps in the same suit. For example, if the current suit has numbers [1,3,5], then for the sequence 1-2-3, there are two numbers (1 and 3) present. So adding 2 would form a sequence. Similarly, for the sequence 3-4-5, there are two numbers (3 and 5) present. So adding 4 would form a sequence. Hence, in this case, adding one tile is possible.\n\nSo, for the current three numbers in the same suit, check for each possible sequence of three consecutive numbers in that suit, whether two of the numbers are present. If yes, then adding one tile can form a sequence.\n\nSo, for example, in the case of three numbers in same suit:\n\nIf the current numbers are [a, b, c], sorted.\n\nThen, for each possible sequence (x, x+1, x+2), check if two of the numbers in the current set are in this sequence.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nWell, for the current suit, the possible sequences are 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9. There are 7 such sequences.\n\nSo, for each of these sequences, check if the current numbers have at least two elements in the sequence. If yes, then adding one tile (the missing one) would form a sequence.\n\nSo, for example, if the current numbers are [1,3,5], then for the sequence 1-2-3, two numbers (1 and 3) are present. So adding 2 would form a sequence. So this is a valid case.\n\nThus, for the current three numbers in a suit, if any of the possible sequences has at least two of the numbers, then adding one tile would form a sequence.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the steps for checking whether adding one tile is possible are:\n\nCheck for triplet possibility:\n\nIf there are two same tiles in the initial three, then adding one more same tile would form a triplet. So answer is 1.\n\nCheck for sequence possibility:\n\nCheck if there exists a suit where the current three tiles have at least two numbers in a consecutive sequence. For example, in the same suit, if two of the numbers are part of a consecutive triplet, then adding the third would form a sequence.\n\nSo, for each suit in the initial three tiles, collect the numbers. For example, if the initial three tiles are [1s, 2s, 4m], then for suit 's', the numbers are [1, 2], and for suit 'm', the numbers are [4].\n\nThen, for each suit that has at least two tiles, check if the numbers in that suit can be extended with one tile to form a sequence.\n\nSo, for each suit, collect the numbers of the tiles in that suit. Let's say, for example, the suit has two numbers: [1, 2]. Then, adding 3 would form a sequence. Or, if the suit has [2,4], then adding 3 would form a sequence of 2-3-4. Or adding 1 would form 1-2-3 (but that would require adding 1 and 3? No, wait, if the numbers are [2,4], adding 3 would form 2-3-4. So that's one tile. So, for this case, yes.\n\nSo, for a suit with two numbers, if the difference is 1, then adding the third (either +1 or -1) would form a sequence. For example, [1,2] can add 3 or 0 (but 0 is invalid). So adding 3. For [2,3], add 1 or 4.\n\nIf the difference is 2, then adding the middle number. For example, [1,3] → add 2.\n\nIf the difference is more than 2, then no way to form a sequence with adding one tile. For example, [1,4] → adding 2 or 3 would not form a sequence. Because to form a sequence, you need three consecutive numbers. So, adding 2 would give 1,2,4. Not a sequence. Adding 3 would give 1,3,4. Also not a sequence. So no.\n\nSo for a suit with two numbers, if their difference is 1 or 2, then adding one tile can form a sequence. Else, no.\n\nFor a suit with three numbers, check if they can form a sequence with adding one tile. As discussed before, for example, [1,2,4] can add 3. [1,3,4] can add 2 or 5. [1,2,3] is already a sequence.\n\nSo, for the case where the suit has three numbers (i.e., all three initial tiles are in the same suit), check if adding one tile can form a sequence. For example, if the numbers are [1,2,4], then adding 3.\n\nSo, for the case of three numbers in same suit:\n\nCheck if the numbers can be extended with one tile to form a sequence. How?\n\nAs discussed earlier, check if the numbers can be part of a consecutive triplet with one missing.\n\nSo, for example, for numbers [a, b, c], sorted, check if there exists a sequence of three consecutive numbers where two are in the current set.\n\nBut how to do that programmatically?\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\nIf the maximum number minus the minimum number is <= 2, then there's a possibility. For example:\n\nmax - min is 0 → all three same. Already checked.\n\nmax - min is 1 → two numbers same, and one different. For example, [1,1,2]. Then, adding 1 would form triplet. But for sequence, the numbers are [1,1,2]. So, sorted, [1,1,2]. The max - min is 1. So, possible sequences: 1-2-3. So adding 3. But the existing numbers have two 1s and one 2. Adding 3 would give 1,1,2,3. So there's no sequence. But if you have 1, 1, 2, adding 2 would form a triplet. So for the sequence part, maybe this case can't be handled with adding one tile. But the triplet case can be handled.\n\nSo, back to the problem of checking for the sequence possibility when there are three numbers in same suit.\n\nSo, for three numbers in same suit:\n\nIf they are all same → already handled (triplet).\n\nElse, check if there's a way to add one tile to form a sequence.\n\nFor example, numbers [1,2,4] → adding 3.\n\nNumbers [1,3,4] → adding 2 or 5.\n\nNumbers [2,3,5] → adding 4 or 6.\n\nNumbers [1,2,5] → adding 3 or 4.\n\nNumbers [1,4,5] → adding 2 or 3 (to form 1-2-3, or 4-5-6? No, adding 3 would give 1,4,5,3. So 3,4,5 is a sequence. Yes. So adding 3 would form that.\n\nSo, for any three numbers in same suit, if the numbers are not already a sequence, then check if there's a gap that can be filled with one tile.\n\nSo, the code for this part would be:\n\nsorted_nums = sorted([num1, num2, num3])\n\nif sorted_nums[2] - sorted_nums[0] <= 2:\n\n   then possible to form a sequence with adding one tile.\n\nBut wait, for example, sorted_nums = [1,2,3], then difference is 2. Already a sequence. So that's handled in initial check.\n\nIf sorted_nums = [1,2,4], difference is 3. So no. But adding 3 would form a sequence.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the previous idea. So the difference between max and min is 3, but adding one tile can form a sequence.\n\nSo, that approach is not correct.\n\nAlternative approach: for the three numbers, check if the set of numbers contains two consecutive numbers, and the third is within one step of that pair.\n\nFor example, [1,2,4] has 1 and 2 consecutive. The third is 4, which is two steps away. So adding 3.\n\nAnother example, [1,3,4] has 3 and 4 consecutive. The third is 1, which is two steps away. Adding 2.\n\nAnother example, [1, 2, 5]: 1 and 2 are consecutive, and 5 is two steps away. Adding 3 or 4.\n\nBut how to check that programmatically.\n\nMaybe the following logic:\n\nCheck if any two numbers are consecutive. If yes, then check if the third number is within one step of that pair.\n\nFor example, for sorted_nums [a, b, c], check:\n\nif b - a == 1:\n\n   if c - b == 1 → already a sequence (handled in initial check)\n\n   elif c - b == 2 → adding b+1\n\n   else → adding c-1 (but that's not possible, since c is larger than b by more than 2)\n\nWait, for example, a=1, b=2, c=5. Then, adding 3 would form 1,2,3. So that's possible.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nIf there is a pair of consecutive numbers (like a and b), then the third number is either c. If c is b+2 or higher, then adding b+1 would form a sequence (a, b, b+1). Or if c is a-1, then adding a-1 would form a sequence (a-1, a, b). But since the numbers are sorted, a <= b <= c. So, if a and b are consecutive, then c can be greater than or equal to b. So, if c is b+2, then adding b+1. If c is b+1, then it's already a sequence.\n\nSo, in the case of a and b being consecutive, and c is >= b+2, then adding one tile (b+1) would form a sequence of a, b, b+1.\n\nSimilarly, if b and c are consecutive, and a is two less than b, then adding a+1 would form a sequence.\n\nSo, the code for this part could be:\n\nfor the three numbers in same suit:\n\nsorted_nums = sorted([n1, n2, n3])\n\nif (sorted_nums[1] - sorted_nums[0] == 1) and (sorted_nums[2] - sorted_nums[1] >= 2):\n\n   then adding sorted_nums[1]+1 → possible.\n\nelif (sorted_nums[2] - sorted_nums[1] == 1) and (sorted_nums[1] - sorted_nums[0] >= 2):\n\n   then adding sorted_nums[1]-1 → possible.\n\nelif (sorted_nums[2] - sorted_nums[0] == 2):\n\n   then adding sorted_nums[0]+1 → possible.\n\nelse:\n\n   no possible sequence with adding one tile.\n\nWait, for example, sorted_nums = [1,3,4]. Here, sorted_nums[2] - sorted_nums[0] = 3. But the difference between",
