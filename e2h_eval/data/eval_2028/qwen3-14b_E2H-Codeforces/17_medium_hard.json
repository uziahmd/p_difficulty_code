He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, but we don't know which is prefix or suffix). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one possible string s that is consistent with this assignment.\n\nThe output should be a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The key is that there must be at least one possible s that matches the assignments.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the main idea is that for the correct string s, the prefixes and suffixes must match. For example, the prefix of length k is the first k characters of s, and the suffix of length k is the last k characters.\n\nBut since we have all the prefixes and suffixes, but not knowing which is which, we need to find an assignment of P and S such that:\n\n- For each input string, if it's marked as a prefix, then there exists some s where that string is a prefix of s. Similarly for suffix.\n\nBut since we need to find any valid assignment, perhaps we can find the correct s first, and then check which of the input strings are prefixes and suffixes of it.\n\nBut how do we find s? Because there might be multiple possibilities, but the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid (i.e., there exists at least one s that matches the given set of prefixes and suffixes).\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\nFind the correct string s, and then for each input string, determine whether it is a prefix or suffix of s. Then assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how to find s?\n\nWell, for the correct s, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be present in the input. Also, the full string s is not given, but the input contains all the proper prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut since the input includes all the prefixes and suffixes, perhaps the correct s can be determined by combining the longest possible prefix and suffix.\n\nWait, let's think. The correct s must have as its prefixes all the proper prefixes (each of length 1 to n-1), and similarly for suffixes. So for example, the longest prefix (of length n-1) is the first n-1 characters of s. Similarly, the longest suffix (of length n-1) is the last n-1 characters of s. But since the input has exactly two strings of each length, for length n-1, there are two strings. One of them must be the prefix of length n-1, and the other must be the suffix of length n-1.\n\nBut then, combining these two: the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 must overlap in such a way that they form the entire string s. For example, suppose the prefix of length n-1 is P, and the suffix of length n-1 is S. Then, the full string s must be P + (last character of S). Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose s is \"ababa\" (from the first example). The length is 5. The longest prefix (length 4) is \"abab\", and the longest suffix (length 4) is \"baba\". The full string is \"ababa\". So, the prefix of length 4 is \"abab\", and the suffix of length 4 is \"baba\". The full string is formed by taking the prefix of length 4 and adding the last character of the suffix of length 4. But wait, the suffix of length 4 is the last four characters of s. So the full string s is the prefix of length n-1 (say, P) plus the last character of the suffix of length n-1 (S). Because S is the last n-1 characters of s. So the first character of S is the second character of s, and the last character of S is the nth character of s.\n\nBut the full string s would be P concatenated with the last character of S. Because P is the first n-1 characters, and S is the last n-1 characters. So the first character of S is the second character of s, and the last character of S is the last character of s. Therefore, the full string s is P's first n-1 characters, and the last character of S. But since the first n-1 characters of s are P, and the last n-1 characters are S, the last character of S is the last character of s. So the full string s is P[0...n-2] + S[-1].\n\nBut also, the first character of S is the second character of s, so the first character of S must be equal to the second character of P. Because the first character of S is the second character of s (since S is the last n-1 characters of s). And the second character of P is the second character of s. So the first character of S must be equal to the second character of P.\n\nTherefore, for the correct s, the full string can be determined by taking the prefix of length n-1 (P) and the suffix of length n-1 (S), and checking that P[0...n-2] + S[-1] equals the string that also satisfies that S is the last n-1 characters of that string. Which implies that the first character of S must be equal to the second character of P. So, for example, in the first example, the prefix of length 4 is \"abab\", and the suffix of length 4 is \"baba\". Then the full string would be \"abab\" + \"a\" = \"ababa\". The suffix of length 4 is the last four characters of \"ababa\", which is \"baba\", which matches.\n\nSo the idea is that for the correct s, the full string can be determined by combining the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1. Therefore, for each pair of strings of length n-1 in the input, we can check if they can be combined in this way to form a candidate s. Once we find such a candidate s, we can check if all the other input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s. If yes, then this s is the correct one, and we can assign P and S accordingly.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Find all pairs of strings of length n-1 in the input. Since there are exactly two strings of length n-1, we can take those two and check if they can form a valid s.\n\nFor each pair (a, b), where a is a candidate for the prefix of length n-1, and b is the suffix of length n-1, then the candidate s would be a + (last character of b). Then, check if the suffix of length n-1 of this candidate s is indeed b. Because the suffix of length n-1 of s is the last n-1 characters. So, for the candidate s_candidate = a + (b[-1]), the last n-1 characters would be s_candidate[1:] (since len(s_candidate) is n-1 + 1 = n). So s_candidate[1:] should equal b. So:\n\ns_candidate = a + b[-1]\nif s_candidate[1:] == b, then this is a valid candidate.\n\nOnce we find such a candidate, we can check whether all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of this candidate s.\n\nIf this is true, then this is a valid s, and we can proceed to assign P and S to each input string.\n\nOnce we have this s, for each input string, check if it's a prefix of s or a suffix of s. Then assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nBut there's a problem: there may be multiple possible candidates for s. For example, in the third sample input, the input is:\n\nn=2, and the input strings are \"a\" and \"c\". The possible s could be \"ac\" or \"ca\". So when we check the pairs of length n-1=1, which are the two strings. For each pair (a, b), which are the same as the two strings. For example, if a is \"a\" and b is \"c\", then the candidate s is a + b[-1] = \"a\" + \"c\" = \"ac\". Then check if s_candidate[1:] is \"c\", which is true. Similarly, if a is \"c\" and b is \"a\", then the candidate is \"ca\", and s_candidate[1:] is \"a\", which is correct. So both candidates are possible.\n\nIn this case, we can choose any of the valid s candidates and proceed.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For the input, collect all the strings. Then, for the two strings of length n-1, generate possible candidates for s. For each pair (a, b) where a is one of the two strings of length n-1 and b is the other, check if combining them gives a valid s. Once a valid s is found, check whether all input strings are either a prefix or suffix of s. If yes, then use that s to assign P/S.\n\nBut how do we check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s?\n\nOnce we have a candidate s, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (i.e., s starts with the string) or a suffix (s ends with the string). However, since the input contains all the proper prefixes and suffixes, there must be exactly two strings for each length. So for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of s. But how do we ensure that?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there exists at least one s. So once we find a candidate s that satisfies the condition for the two strings of length n-1, then the rest of the input strings must be prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nBut perhaps not. For example, maybe there's a candidate s that satisfies the condition for the two length n-1 strings, but some other input strings are not prefixes or suffixes of s. However, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there must be at least one s that works. Therefore, once we find a candidate s that passes the check for the two length n-1 strings, we can assume that all other input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s. But perhaps this isn't necessarily true. So how to verify?\n\nWell, perhaps the way to proceed is to generate the candidate s, then check for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of s. If all are, then proceed. Otherwise, try another pair of the length n-1 strings.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nLoop through all possible pairs of the two strings of length n-1. For each pair (a, b), generate the candidate s_candidate as a + b[-1]. Check if the suffix of length n-1 of s_candidate is equal to b. If yes, then check for all input strings whether they are a prefix or suffix of s_candidate. If all are, then proceed to assign P/S based on that s_candidate.\n\nOnce such a candidate is found, proceed to assign the labels.\n\nBut why would there be more than one candidate s? For example, in the third sample input, there are two possible s_candidates. But in that case, both would have the same set of prefixes and suffixes. For example, if s is \"ac\", the prefixes are \"a\" and \"ac\" (but since n=2, the proper prefixes are length 1, which is \"a\". The suffixes are length 1, which is \"c\". Similarly for \"ca\".\n\nSo for the input strings, which are \"a\" and \"c\", both s_candidates will have all input strings as prefixes or suffixes.\n\nSo once we find a valid candidate s, we can proceed to assign the labels.\n\nNow, the next step is to generate the output string.\n\nFor each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If so, then assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly. But since there are two strings of each length, for each length, exactly one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Wait, no. For example, in the first sample input, for length 1, the input strings are \"a\" and \"b\" (assuming the first example's input is 5, and the input strings include \"a\", \"a\", etc. Wait, looking back at the first example's input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nba\n\na\n\nabab\n\na\n\naba\n\nbaba\n\nab\n\naba\n\nWait, the input is 2n-2 = 8 lines. The sample input is:\n\nn=5, then 8 strings. The output is SPPSPSPS. The correct s is ababa.\n\nSo for each of the input strings, we need to check if they are a prefix or suffix of ababa.\n\nFor example, the first input string is 'ba'. Is it a prefix of ababa? No. Is it a suffix? The suffix of length 2 is 'ba' (the last two characters of ababa are 'ba'). So yes. So that would be 'S'.\n\nBut how do we assign for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix?\n\nOnce we have the candidate s, for each input string, check if it's a prefix of s. If yes, then assign 'P'. Else, assign 'S'. But what if a string is both a prefix and a suffix? For example, the string 'a' in the first sample. The string 'a' is a prefix (length 1) and also a suffix (length 1). But according to the problem statement, for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings. So for length 1, two strings. But in the first sample, the input has two 'a's. So in that case, one is a prefix and one is a suffix. But how to decide which is which?\n\nBut the problem allows any valid assignment. So even if there are multiple possibilities, as long as the assignment is correct, it's acceptable.\n\nSo, for the candidate s, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix. If it is, assign 'P'. Otherwise, assign 'S'. However, there's a possibility that a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the case of s being 'aaa', then the string 'a' is both a prefix and a suffix. But since there are two instances of 'a' in the input, one must be assigned 'P' and the other 'S'.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nIn this case, for each input string, we need to decide whether to mark it as P or S. However, the problem states that the answer can be any valid one.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is: for each input string, if it is a prefix of s, then assign 'P' (but if there are multiple such strings for the same length, we need to make sure that exactly one is assigned P and the others S, but since the input has exactly two strings per length, and for each length, exactly one is a prefix and one is a suffix, except when the prefix and suffix are the same string. But in that case, for that length, both strings are same, so they must be one P and one S. However, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid. So for that case, there must be exactly two strings for each length, which may be same. But in that case, the two strings are same, but they are both a prefix and suffix. So in that case, one is marked as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to handle that during assignment? Well, the code can just check for each input string whether it is a prefix, and assign P if yes, else S. But in cases where the same string is both a prefix and a suffix, the code would assign P to all of them, but that would be wrong because for each length, exactly one must be P and one S.\n\nSo this approach would not work.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is such that there exists at least one s. So for each length k (from 1 to n-1), exactly one of the two strings is a prefix of s, and exactly one is a suffix. Because the input is generated from the proper prefixes and suffixes of s. For example, for each k, there is exactly one prefix of length k, and exactly one suffix of length k. Therefore, for each length k, the two input strings must be exactly the prefix and the suffix of s. So for each length k, exactly one of the two input strings is a prefix, and the other is a suffix.\n\nThus, for the candidate s, for each input string, exactly one of the two strings of each length is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Therefore, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, then assign P, else assign S. However, since for each length, exactly one is a prefix and the other is a suffix, this approach will work. Because for each length, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix, and the other is a suffix.\n\nBut how to handle cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix? For example, in the sample input 2, the correct s is \"aaa\". The input strings are \"a\", \"aa\", \"aa\", \"a\". For length 1, there are two \"a\" strings. Both are prefixes and suffixes. But according to the problem statement, the answer can be any assignment that is correct. So for example, the first \"a\" can be marked as P, and the second as S, or vice versa. The code can assign them as P and S in any order.\n\nBut how can the code determine which one is which? Because when checking, for each input string, if it's a prefix, assign P. But in this case, both are prefixes. So the code would assign P to both, which would be invalid because for length 1, there should be exactly one P and one S.\n\nThis suggests that the approach of checking whether the string is a prefix is not sufficient. Because for some strings, they are both a prefix and a suffix. So how can we distinguish between them?\n\nAh, but for each length k, there is exactly one prefix and one suffix. So for each length, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix (and the other is a suffix). Therefore, for the candidate s, for each length k, exactly one of the two input strings of length k is a prefix of s, and the other is a suffix.\n\nTherefore, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, then assign P. But for the case where two strings of the same length are both prefixes, which can't happen, because for a given length k, there's exactly one prefix. Therefore, in the code, when checking for each input string, the code must find that exactly one of the two strings for each length is a prefix.\n\nBut in reality, for example, in the case of s being \"aaa\", for length 1, the prefix is \"a\", and the suffix is also \"a\". So the two input strings of length 1 are both \"a\". So in this case, for the two input strings, both are prefixes and suffixes. How does the code assign P and S?\n\nBut the problem says that the answer can be any valid assignment. So for this case, we can assign one as P and the other as S. But how to choose which one?\n\nThe code needs to assign for each input string either P or S, ensuring that for each length, exactly one P and one S.\n\nSo perhaps, for each length k, collect all input strings of that length. For each of them, check if they are a prefix. For the ones that are, assign P, and for the others, assign S. However, since for each length k, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix, this would work. But how?\n\nWait, for the case of s being \"aaa\", and two input strings of length 1, both \"a\". Then, both are prefixes and suffixes. So when checking for each string, they are both prefixes. So the code would assign P to both, which would be invalid. But according to the problem statement, the input is generated from the proper prefixes and suffixes of some string. So in this case, for the input, there are exactly two strings of each length. For length 1, the two strings are the same. But how is that possible? Because the proper prefixes of \"aaa\" are \"a\" (length 1), \"aa\" (length 2), and \"aaa\" (length 3, but n is 3, so the proper prefixes are up to length 2). Wait, for the sample input 2, the input is n=3, and the input strings are a, aa, aa, a. So the correct s is \"aaa\". The proper prefixes are \"a\", \"aa\". Proper suffixes are \"a\", \"aa\". So for length 1, there are two strings \"a\" and \"a\", which are the prefix and suffix. For length 2, two strings \"aa\" and \"aa\", which are the prefix and suffix.\n\nSo for each length, the two input strings are the same. Thus, in this case, when checking for the input strings, the code would find that for each string, it is a prefix. But how to assign P and S?\n\nIn this case, the code can assign one as P and the other as S. But how to decide which?\n\nThe code can process the input strings in order, and for each length, assign P to the first occurrence and S to the second. Or vice versa. But how to track that.\n\nAlternatively, for each input string, check if it is a prefix. If it is, then assign P, but for each length, only one of the two strings can be assigned P. But in this case, both are prefixes. So how to choose?\n\nThis seems like a problem. How to handle such cases.\n\nBut perhaps, in practice, when the two strings for a given length are the same, then both are a prefix and a suffix. Therefore, for the code to assign P and S, we can choose arbitrarily. For example, for each length, the first occurrence in the input is marked as P, and the second as S. Or vice versa.\n\nBut how to track which is which.\n\nSo, perhaps, for each length k, collect all the input strings of that length. For each of them, check if they are a prefix of s. If exactly one is a prefix (which is the case except when the two are the same), then assign P to that one and S to the other. If both are prefixes (because they are the same string), then assign P to the first occurrence and S to the second.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce we have the candidate s, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s. However, for each length, we need to make sure that exactly one of the two strings is assigned P and the other S.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each length k (from 1 to n-1):\n\n   collect all the input strings of that length (there are two of them).\n\n   for each of these strings, check if they are a prefix of s.\n\n   if exactly one is a prefix, assign P to that one and S to the other.\n\n   if both are prefixes (they are same string), then assign P to the first one and S to the second.\n\nBut how to track which is first and which is second. Because the input order is arbitrary.\n\nSo, for example, for the input strings of length k, which are stored in a list, we can iterate through them, and for each, check if it is a prefix. But for the case where both are same and are prefixes, we need to assign P to the first occurrence and S to the second.\n\nBut how to do this in code.\n\nSo, the code can process the input strings in order. For each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, assign P, else S. However, for the case where two strings of same length are same and both are prefixes, the code would assign P to both. Which is invalid.\n\nSo, this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: For each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. For each length, we need to have exactly one P and one S. So for each length, among the two strings, exactly one is a prefix. So perhaps, for each length, we can find which one is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nBut how?\n\nWell, for the candidate s, the prefix of length k is unique. So for each length k, there is exactly one string in the input that is the prefix of s. So for each length k, we can find which of the two input strings is the prefix of s. Once found, assign P to that string and S to the other.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each length k from 1 to n-1:\n\n   collect the two input strings of that length.\n\n   for each of them, check if it is a prefix of s.\n\n   exactly one of them is a prefix. Assign P to that string, and S to the other.\n\nBut how to find which of the two is the prefix?\n\nFor example, in the case where the two strings are same, then both are prefixes. But according to the problem statement, the input is generated from the prefixes and suffixes of some s. So for that case, the two strings must be the same. So for example, for s being \"aaa\", the prefix of length 1 is \"a\", and the suffix of length 1 is also \"a\". So the two input strings of length 1 are both \"a\". Therefore, for each of them, it is both a prefix and a suffix. However, in the input, exactly one is a prefix and one is a suffix. So how to decide which is which.\n\nBut the problem allows any valid assignment. So for this case, we can assign one as P and the other as S. How to choose which one?\n\nPerhaps, for each length k, we can check which of the two input strings is the prefix of s. Since the prefix is unique, but in the case of same strings, both are prefixes, but the code can choose either one.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nWait, for the candidate s, the prefix of length k is known. So for example, for k=1, the prefix is s[0:1], which is the first character of s. So for the two input strings of length k, which are same, both are equal to the prefix. So the code can choose either one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to find which one is which in the input.\n\nBut the code can't know which one is which. So perhaps, for each length k, the code can check which of the two input strings is the prefix of s. If they are same, then assign P to the first occurrence and S to the second.\n\nBut how to track which is first in the input.\n\nSo, for each length k, collect all input strings of that length. For example, in the sample input 2, for length 1, the input strings are \"a\" and \"a\" (assuming the input is ordered as given). So for each length, the code can process the two strings in the order they appear in the input, and assign P to the first one and S to the second.\n\nBut how to do this in code.\n\nSo, the code can process the input strings in order. For each input string, we need to determine whether it is a prefix or suffix of s. But how to do that.\n\nAlternative idea: For each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, then assign P. Else, assign S. However, for cases where two strings of the same length are both prefixes (same string), this would assign P to both. Which is invalid. So how to avoid that.\n\nBut perhaps, for the candidate s, the code can generate all the prefixes and suffixes. For example, for each k, the prefix of length k is known. So for each input string, if it is equal to the prefix of length k, then assign P. Else, check if it is equal to the suffix of length k. Assign S. But how to get the prefixes and suffixes of s.\n\nYes! That's a better approach. For the candidate s, we can precompute all the prefixes and suffixes of lengths 1 to n-1. Then, for each input string, check if it is in the prefix list. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nFor example, for the candidate s, we can create a set of all prefixes of lengths 1 to n-1. Similarly, a set of all suffixes of lengths 1 to n-1. Then, for each input string, if it is in the prefixes set, assign P. Else, assign S. However, since the input strings are exactly the union of the prefixes and suffixes, each input string must be in exactly one of the sets. So this approach would work.\n\nBut how to build the prefixes and suffixes sets.\n\nFor example, for s of length n:\n\nprefixes = {s[0:k] for k in 1..n-1}\n\nsuffixes = {s[n-k: n] for k in 1..n-1}\n\nThen, for each input string, check if it is in prefixes. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S.\n\nBut this would work because the input strings are exactly the union of the prefixes and suffixes. So for each input string, it is either in the prefixes or in the suffixes.\n\nBut how to handle cases where a string is both in prefixes and suffixes. For example, the string \"a\" in the sample input 2. It is in prefixes and suffixes. But since the input has two copies of \"a\" for length 1, each of them must be assigned to either P or S. However, in the prefixes set, there is one \"a\" (the prefix of length 1), and in the suffixes set, there is one \"a\" (the suffix of length 1). So the input strings have two copies. So for each input string, it is in prefixes or in suffixes. But how to decide which.\n\nBut the problem is that the same string can be in both the prefixes and the suffixes. For example, the string \"a\" is in both. So, how to decide whether to assign P or S.\n\nBut the code can't know which one is which. However, the problem allows any valid assignment. So, for example, the code can check if the input string is a prefix of s. If it is, assign P. Else, assign S. But since the input strings are exactly the union of prefixes and suffixes, this would work.\n\nBut for a string that is both a prefix and a suffix, how to decide.\n\nBut in this case, the code would check if it is a prefix. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S. But since it is a prefix, it would be assigned P. However, there is another input string of the same value, which is also a prefix and suffix. How to assign that.\n\nBut since the input has exactly two copies of that string, and for the candidate s, there is exactly one prefix and one suffix of that length. So, for example, the two input strings of length 1 are both \"a\". One is the prefix, and one is the suffix. So, the code needs to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nThis suggests that the previous approach of checking whether the input string is a prefix is not sufficient. Because for the same string, which is both a prefix and suffix, the code would assign P to both, which is invalid.\n\nSo the problem is that when a string is both a prefix and a suffix, the code cannot tell which one is which. But how to handle that.\n\nAn alternative approach is to precompute for each length k, the prefix and suffix of that length. Then, for each input string, if it matches the prefix of some length, assign P. Else, assign S. But how to do that.\n\nFor example, for the candidate s, we can create a dictionary for prefixes: for each length k, store the prefix. Similarly for suffixes. Then, for each input string, check for each length k whether it matches the prefix or suffix of that length. But how to do that.\n\nBut for each input string, there must be exactly one length k where it is either the prefix or the suffix of that length. So for each input string, we can check for all possible k (from 1 to n-1) whether it is equal to the prefix of length k or the suffix of length k. Once found, assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, then assign P. Else, assign S. But in cases where the same string is both a prefix and suffix, this would assign P to one of them and S to the other.\n\nBut how to ensure that.\n\nWait, for example, for the input strings \"a\" and \"a\", and the candidate s is \"aaa\". The first \"a\" is a prefix of length 1. The second \"a\" is a suffix of length 1. So for the code, when processing the first \"a\", it is a prefix, so assign P. When processing the second \"a\", it is not a prefix (since the prefix of length 1 is already accounted for?), but how to know that.\n\nNo, the code can't know that. Because for the second \"a\", it is also a prefix of length 1. So the code would assign P to both, which is invalid.\n\nThis suggests that the approach of checking whether the string is a prefix is not sufficient.\n\nAlternative idea: For each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, then assign P, but for each length k, only one string can be assigned P. So for each length k, we can track how many times we've assigned P. Once we have assigned one, the other strings of the same length must be assigned S.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor example, during processing the input strings, for each string, check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, and if for that length, we haven't assigned a P yet, assign P. Else, assign S. But how to track that.\n\nSo, for each length k, we can have a flag indicating whether we have already assigned a P for that length. Then, when processing an input string of length k:\n\nif it is a prefix of s:\n\n   if not yet assigned P for this length:\n\n       assign P and mark the flag.\n\n   else:\n\n       assign S.\n\nelse:\n\n   assign S.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nYes, this would work. Because for each length k, there is exactly one prefix. So for the first input string of length k that is a prefix, assign P. For the other input string of length k, even if it is a prefix, assign S.\n\nBut how to determine if the input string is a prefix of s.\n\nBut for the candidate s, we can precompute all the prefixes and suffixes. For example, for each length k, the prefix of length k is known. So for any input string of length k, if it equals the prefix of length k, then it's a prefix. Similarly for suffix.\n\nThus, for each input string, we can check if it equals the prefix of its length. If yes, then assign P, but only if we haven't assigned a P for that length yet. Otherwise, assign S.\n\nThis approach would work.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nOnce we have the candidate s:\n\n   precompute for each length k from 1 to n-1:\n\n      prefix_k = s[0:k]\n\n      suffix_k = s[n -k : n]\n\n   create a dictionary for each length k, storing prefix_k and suffix_k.\n\nThen, for each input string:\n\n   determine its length, say l.\n\n   check if the input string equals prefix_l.\n\n   if yes, and we haven't assigned a P for length l yet:\n\n       assign P, and mark that length l has a P.\n\n   else:\n\n       assign S.\n\nBut how to track which lengths have already been assigned a P.\n\nSo, during processing, we can have a dictionary or array that tracks for each length l (from 1 to n-1) whether a P has been assigned.\n\nThis way, for each input string, we check if it's the prefix of its length. If yes, and if not yet assigned, assign P. Else, assign S.\n\nThis would ensure that for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings is assigned P (the one that matches the prefix), and the other is assigned S.\n\nFor example, in the case of two input strings of length l being the same as prefix_l:\n\nthe first input string of that length would be assigned P, and the second would be assigned S.\n\nIn the case of the input string being the same as the prefix and suffix, but the code checks if it is the prefix, then the first one would be assigned P, and the second would be assigned S.\n\nThis approach should work.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe code needs to:\n\nRead n and the 2n-2 strings.\n\nGenerate all possible candidates for s by checking the pairs of strings of length n-1.\n\nFor each candidate s_candidate:\n\n   check if the suffix of length n-1 is correct.\n\n   then, check for all input strings whether they are prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate.\n\n   but since the input is guaranteed to be valid, perhaps we don't need to check all, but just proceed.\n\nOnce a valid s_candidate is found, proceed to assign P/S.\n\nNow, the problem is how to generate the candidate s_candidate",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the correct string `s` based on the given input and then classifying each input string as either a prefix or a suffix of `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Candidate String**: The unknown string `s` can be determined by considering the longest proper prefixes and suffixes (of length `n-1`). By combining these, we can form potential candidates for `s`.\n2. **Validate Candidate String**: For each candidate string derived from the longest proper prefixes and suffixes, check if all other given strings are valid prefixes or suffixes of this candidate.\n3. **Classify Input Strings**: Once a valid candidate string is found, classify each input string as either a prefix or a suffix of this candidate. This classification ensures that each length from 1 to `n-1` has exactly one prefix and one suffix.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try all possible pairs of the two strings of length n-1\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            a = candidates[i]\n            b = candidates[j]\n            # Generate candidate s\n            s_candidate = a + b[-1]\n            # Check if the suffix of length n-1 is b\n            if s_candidate[1:] == b:\n                # Now check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate\n                valid = True\n                for s in strings:\n                    is_prefix = s == s_candidate[:len(s)]\n                    is_suffix = s == s_candidate[-len(s):]\n                    if not is_prefix and not is_suffix:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                if valid:\n                    # Found valid s_candidate\n                    # Now assign P/S\n                    # Precompute prefixes and suffixes for each length\n                    prefix_dict = {}\n                    suffix_dict = {}\n                    for k in range(1, n):\n                        prefix = s_candidate[:k]\n                        suffix = s_candidate[-k:]\n                        prefix_dict[k] = prefix\n                        suffix_dict[k] = suffix\n                    \n                    # Now process each input string\n                    result = []\n                    assigned_p = [False] * (n)  # for lengths 1..n-1\n                    for s_str in strings:\n                        l = len(s_str)\n                        if prefix_dict[l] == s_str:\n                            if not assigned_p[l-1]:\n                                result.append('P')\n                                assigned_p[l-1] = True\n                            else:\n                                result.append('S')\n                        else:\n                            result.append('S')\n                    print(''.join(result))\n                    return\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Finding Candidates**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified.
