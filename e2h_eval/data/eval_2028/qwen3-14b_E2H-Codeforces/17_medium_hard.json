He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, but we don't know which is prefix or suffix). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one possible string s that is consistent with this assignment.\n\nThe output should be a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The key is that there must be at least one possible s that matches the assignments.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the main idea is that for the correct string s, the prefixes and suffixes must match. For example, the prefix of length k is the first k characters of s, and the suffix of length k is the last k characters.\n\nBut since we have all the prefixes and suffixes, but not knowing which is which, we need to find an assignment of P and S such that:\n\n- For each input string, if it's marked as a prefix, then there exists some s where that string is a prefix of s. Similarly for suffixes.\n\nBut how do we find such an assignment?\n\nAn alternative approach: For each possible candidate string s (which is of length n), check if all the given strings are exactly the prefixes and suffixes of s. Then, for each such s, we can generate the correct assignment of P and S for the input strings. However, since n can be up to 100, the total number of possible s is 26^100, which is way too big to check exhaustively.\n\nSo that approach isn't feasible. We need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the given input strings are all the prefixes and suffixes of some s, perhaps we can find the correct s by looking for the longest possible prefix and suffix.\n\nWait, for the correct s, the longest prefix (length n-1) is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix (length n-1) is s[1..n-1]. These two strings must be present in the input. Also, the full string s is not part of the input, but the input has all the prefixes and suffixes of lengths 1 to n-1.\n\nSo, for example, if we can find two strings in the input of length n-1, one of which is the prefix (say, p) and the other is the suffix (suf), then the actual string s must be p + last character of suf (since the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1], so the full string s would be p[0] ... p[n-2] followed by suf[-1]).\n\nBut wait, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, combining these two, the full string s would be the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character of the suffix of length n-1. Because the suffix of length n-1 ends with the last character of s. So, if we have a prefix p of length n-1 and a suffix s of length n-1, then s must be p + s[-1].\n\nBut how do we know which of the two strings of length n-1 is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nFor example, suppose there are two strings of length n-1. Let's call them A and B. Then, the possible s could be A + last character of B, or B + last character of A. But we need to check if that s's prefixes and suffixes are exactly the input strings.\n\nSo, maybe the approach is:\n\n- Find all possible candidates for the full string s by considering the two strings of length n-1. For each possible combination (assuming one is prefix and the other is suffix), generate the candidate s and check if all the input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s. Then, once such an s is found, assign the P/S accordingly.\n\nOnce we have such an s, we can check for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of s. Then assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how do we generate the candidate s?\n\nLet me think. For the input, there are exactly two strings of length n-1. Let's call them L1 and L2. Then, the possible candidate s's are:\n\nCase 1: L1 is the prefix of length n-1, and L2 is the suffix of length n-1. Then, s must be L1 + (last character of L2). Because the suffix of length n-1 is the last n-1 characters of s. So the last character of the suffix is the last character of s. So the full s would be L1 concatenated with the last character of L2.\n\nSimilarly, case 2: L2 is the prefix, and L1 is the suffix. Then s would be L2 + last character of L1.\n\nBut we need to check if this generated s is valid. For example, when we generate s, we need to verify that all the input strings are indeed either prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nOnce we find such an s, then we can proceed to assign the P/S labels.\n\nBut why would this approach work? Because the correct s must have its own prefix of length n-1 and suffix of length n-1. So, among the input strings, these two must be present. So, by checking these two possibilities, we can generate possible candidates for s.\n\nOnce we find a valid s, we can proceed to assign P and S.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Find all the input strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them.\n\n2. For each possible pair (A, B) where A and B are the two strings of length n-1, generate two possible candidates for s:\n\n   a. s_candidate1 = A + B[-1]\n\n   b. s_candidate2 = B + A[-1]\n\n3. For each candidate s_candidate, check if all the input strings are either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate. If yes, then this s_candidate is valid. Once we find such a candidate, we can proceed to assign P/S.\n\nOnce we have a valid s_candidate, we can process each input string and check if it is a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate. Then assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nBut how to check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate?\n\nFor each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate (i.e., s_candidate starts with the string) or a suffix (ends with the string). But note that for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate. However, since the input includes all prefixes and suffixes, each input string must be either a prefix or suffix of s_candidate.\n\nSo, for each input string, check if it's a prefix or suffix of s_candidate. If all are, then this is a valid candidate.\n\nOnce we find such a candidate, then we can assign the P/S labels based on whether the input string is a prefix or suffix of s_candidate.\n\nBut how to handle cases where multiple input strings are both prefixes and suffixes? For example, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix of s_candidate. In that case, we can choose either P or S. Since the problem allows any valid assignment, we can choose either.\n\nBut how to make sure that for each input string, it's marked as P or S, and that the counts of P and S are equal (since there are exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes, so total 2n-2 strings, and the number of P and S must each be n-1).\n\nBut the problem says that the output must have exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's. Because each of the 2n-2 strings is either a prefix or a suffix. So, for the candidate s_candidate, the input strings must contain exactly the prefixes and suffixes. Hence, for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate. So, when we check for each input string, it must be one or the other. So, when we generate the assignment, we can just check for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of s_candidate, and assign accordingly.\n\nBut what if a string is both a prefix and a suffix? For example, if the input has a string that is both. Then, the assignment can be either P or S. But the problem allows any valid assignment. So, in that case, we can choose either.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Generate possible candidate s_candidate by considering the two strings of length n-1.\n\n- For each candidate s_candidate, check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it.\n\n- Once a valid s_candidate is found, assign P/S for each input string based on whether it's a prefix or suffix of s_candidate.\n\nNow, the problem is that for some cases, there may be multiple valid s_candidate. However, the problem allows us to output any valid assignment, so once we find a valid one, we can proceed.\n\nBut how to generate the candidate s_candidate?\n\nLet me take the first example from the problem:\n\nInput is:\n\n5\n\nba\n\na\n\nabab\n\na\n\naba\n\nbaba\n\nab\n\naba\n\nThe two strings of length 4 (since n=5, n-1=4) are abab and baba.\n\nSo, for candidate 1: take abab as the prefix (length 4), and the suffix is baba. Then the candidate s would be abab + last character of baba. The last character of baba is 'a', so s_candidate is ababa. Let's check if that's correct. The actual string in the example is \"ababa\".\n\nThen, for each input string, check if it is a prefix or suffix of ababa.\n\nFor example:\n\nInput strings are:\n\nba (length 2)\n\na (length 1)\n\nabab (length 4)\n\na (length 1)\n\naba (length 3)\n\nbaba (length 4)\n\nab (length 2)\n\naba (length 3)\n\nSo, for s_candidate = ababa:\n\nCheck each input string:\n\n- \"ba\" is a suffix of length 2? ababa ends with \"ba\"? The last two letters are 'ba' (positions 3 and 4, 0-based?), yes. So \"ba\" is a suffix. Or is it a prefix? The first two letters are 'ab', so no. So in the output, this would be S.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the first input string is assigned 'S' (the first character of the output is S). Which matches.\n\nSo, the approach seems to work.\n\nAnother example: the second input in the sample is:\n\n3\n\na\n\naa\n\naa\n\na\n\nThe two strings of length 2 are 'aa' and 'aa'. So generating candidate s_candidate by taking one as prefix and the other as suffix. For example, take the first 'aa' as prefix, and the second 'aa' as suffix. Then the candidate s would be 'aa' + last character of 'aa' which is 'a', making 'aaa'.\n\nWhich is the correct string. Then, all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of 'aaa'.\n\nSo, the approach works here.\n\nNow, the third example:\n\nInput is 2, with strings 'a' and 'c'.\n\nThe two strings of length 1 (n-1=1) are 'a' and 'c'. So possible candidates for s_candidate:\n\nTake 'a' as prefix (length 1), and 'c' as suffix (length 1). Then s_candidate is 'a' + last character of 'c' which is 'c' → 'ac'.\n\nOr take 'c' as prefix and 'a' as suffix → 'ca'.\n\nBoth are valid, and the problem allows any assignment. For example, in the sample output, the answer is 'PS' (assuming the first input string is 'a' and the second is 'c', then 'a' is a prefix of 'ac' (so 'P'), and 'c' is a suffix of 'ac' (so 'S').\n\nSo, the approach works here.\n\nThus, the algorithm seems to be:\n\nFor each possible candidate s_candidate generated from the two strings of length n-1, check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate. Once a valid s_candidate is found, assign P/S accordingly.\n\nBut how to handle the case where there are multiple candidates? For example, if more than one candidate s_candidate is valid. But the problem allows any valid assignment, so we can pick the first one found.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is n. Then read 2n-2 lines of strings.\n\nThen, collect all the input strings into a list. Also, note their order, since the output must correspond to the input order.\n\nNext, find the two strings of length n-1. Let's collect them.\n\nOnce we have those two, say s1 and s2, generate two possible candidates:\n\ncandidate1 = s1 + s2[-1]\n\ncandidate2 = s2 + s1[-1]\n\nFor each candidate, check if all input strings are either a prefix or a suffix of it.\n\nOnce a candidate passes this check, then proceed to assign P/S.\n\nNow, how to check if all input strings are either a prefix or suffix of the candidate.\n\nFor each input string in the list:\n\nCheck if it is a prefix of candidate (i.e., candidate.startswith(string)) OR a suffix (candidate.endswith(string)).\n\nIf all are, then the candidate is valid.\n\nOnce we find such a candidate, we can proceed to generate the output.\n\nBut what if neither candidate1 nor candidate2 is valid? Well, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be correct, i.e., there exists at least one possible string. So, at least one of the two candidates must be valid.\n\nWait, but maybe there are other possibilities? For example, maybe the two strings of length n-1 are both prefixes or both suffixes. But according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be prefixes and suffixes of some existing string. So, the correct s must have exactly one prefix of length n-1 and one suffix of length n-1. Therefore, the two strings of length n-1 must be the prefix and suffix of the correct s. Therefore, the correct s must be formed by combining one of the two as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\nHence, the two candidates generated from the two strings of length n-1 must include the correct s. Therefore, one of the candidates will be valid.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed by generating the two candidates and checking them.\n\nOnce a valid candidate is found, then assign P/S for each input string.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead 2n-2 strings, store in a list called inputs.\n\nCollect the two strings of length n-1. Let's find them:\n\nstrings_of_length_n_minus_1 = [s for s in inputs if len(s) == n-1]\n\nThese are exactly two elements.\n\ns1, s2 = strings_of_length_n_minus_1[0], strings_of_length_n_minus_1[1]\n\nGenerate candidate1 = s1 + s2[-1]\n\ncandidate2 = s2 + s1[-1]\n\nNow, check for each candidate whether all input strings are either a prefix or suffix of it.\n\nOnce a valid candidate is found, proceed.\n\nOnce the candidate is found, for each input string in the original list, check if it is a prefix of the candidate. If yes, assign 'P'; else, assign 'S'.\n\nBut what if a string is both a prefix and a suffix? For example, the string 'a' in the case of 'aaa'. Then, the code can choose either. But how to decide? For example, in the sample input 2, the output could be PPSS, which would imply that the two 'aa's are considered as prefixes and the two 'a's as suffixes. But the code would need to assign 'P' or 'S' based on whether it's a prefix or suffix. However, in the code, if the string is both, then the code could choose either. However, the code must ensure that the number of P and S is exactly n-1 each.\n\nBut since the input contains exactly all the prefixes and suffixes, for the correct candidate s, each input string is either a prefix or a suffix. So, for the candidate, the number of input strings that are prefixes is exactly n-1 (since there are n-1 prefixes of lengths 1..n-1), and same for suffixes. But how?\n\nWait, the input contains exactly 2n-2 strings. Each of the prefixes (n-1) and suffixes (n-1) of the string. So, for the candidate s, each input string is either a prefix or a suffix. However, some strings may be both a prefix and a suffix. For example, the string 'a' in 'aaa' is a prefix of length 1, and a suffix of length 1. But in the input, there are two strings of length 1 (for n=3). So, in this case, the input has two 'a's. For the candidate 'aaa', each 'a' is both a prefix and a suffix. So, when assigning P or S, we need to make sure that exactly n-1 are P and n-1 are S.\n\nBut how does that work? For example, in the case of the input for n=3, the two 'a's are both prefixes and suffixes. So, when generating the output, we have to assign one as P and one as S. However, the code's current approach would check for each input string whether it is a prefix. If it is, assign P. Else assign S. But in this case, since both are prefixes and suffixes, the code would assign P to both, which would result in 2 P's and 2 S's (but the total is 2n-2=4, and n-1=2. So, the code would have 2 P's and 2 S's, which is correct. Wait, no. For the input of n=3, the output must have 2 P's and 2 S's. However, if the code assigns P to both 'a's, then the other two input strings (the two 'aa's) would be checked. For the candidate 'aaa', the 'aa's are prefixes of length 2 and suffixes of length 2. So, when checking for each 'aa' in the input, the code would assign P if it is a prefix, else S. But since they are both prefixes and suffixes, the code would assign P to both. Then the total would be 2 P's (from the 'a's) and 2 P's (from the 'aa's) → 4 P's, which is wrong.\n\nWait, that's a problem. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Because the code checks for each input string whether it is a prefix. If it is, assign P, else assign S. But in this case, the input strings may be both a prefix and a suffix. However, the code would assign P to them, but in reality, they are both a prefix and a suffix. But the problem requires that the total number of P and S is n-1 each.\n\nSo, the approach of checking if it's a prefix and assigning P may not work, because in cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix, we have to choose which one to assign. But how?\n\nThis suggests that the previous approach is insufficient. Because, for the code to generate the correct count of P and S, we need to assign exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's. However, if some strings are both prefixes and suffixes, the code's approach of choosing P or S based on whether it's a prefix may not lead to the correct count.\n\nSo, what's the correct way to assign P and S for such cases?\n\nThe problem says that the answer is acceptable if there exists at least one possible string s that is consistent with the assignment. So, for the candidate s, the input strings are exactly the prefixes and suffixes. So, for each input string, it is either a prefix or a suffix of s. However, the same string may appear as both a prefix and a suffix. For example, the string 'a' in 'aaa' is both a prefix and a suffix. But in the input, there are two copies of 'a' (for n=3). How do we assign them?\n\nIn this case, for the candidate s='aaa', the input strings are:\n\n['a', 'aa', 'aa', 'a'].\n\nEach of the two 'a's is a prefix (of length 1) and a suffix (of length 1). The two 'aa's are prefixes (of length 2) and suffixes (of length 2).\n\nSo, the correct assignment is that for each of the input strings, exactly one of P or S is chosen, such that the total number of P's is 2 (n-1=2) and S's is 2.\n\nFor example, in the sample input, the output is 'PPSS' (for the second example). That would mean that the two 'a's are assigned P and the two 'aa's are assigned S. Alternatively, the two 'a's could be assigned S and the two 'aa's P. Or mix them.\n\nBut how to ensure that the code's assignment leads to exactly n-1 P's and S's?\n\nThe problem says that the input is guaranteed to have exactly 2n-2 strings, which are all the prefixes and suffixes. Therefore, for the candidate s, the number of input strings that are prefixes is exactly n-1. Similarly for suffixes. However, some strings may be both. So, the code needs to assign each string to either P or S, ensuring that the total number of P's is n-1 and S's is n-1.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nThe problem arises when a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For such strings, the code must choose to assign it as P or S, but in such a way that the total counts are correct.\n\nSo, the approach of checking whether it's a prefix and assigning P may not work because in some cases, the number of P's could be more than n-1.\n\nFor example, in the case of the candidate 'aaa' and the input strings being ['a', 'a', 'aa', 'aa'], the code would assign P to all four strings if it checks for being a prefix. Which is incorrect.\n\nSo, how to handle this?\n\nAlternative approach: For each input string, determine whether it is a prefix of the candidate s. If it is, then it can be assigned as P. Otherwise, it must be assigned as S. However, this may not account for overlapping cases. But how to ensure that the number of P's is exactly n-1?\n\nWait, the candidate s has exactly n-1 prefixes (for each length from 1 to n-1). Each of these prefixes is present in the input. Similarly for suffixes. However, the input contains exactly the set of prefixes and suffixes. So, for the candidate s, the input strings consist of exactly the prefixes and suffixes. Thus, the number of input strings that are prefixes is exactly n-1. Similarly for suffixes. But some strings may be both.\n\nSo, for example, in the case of 'aaa', the prefixes are 'a', 'aa', and 'aaa' (but the input doesn't have 'aaa'). The input has for n=3, the prefixes of lengths 1 and 2. The prefixes are 'a' and 'aa'. The suffixes are also 'a' and 'aa'. So, the input strings are the two 'a's and two 'aa's. So, the total number of prefixes is 2 (for lengths 1 and 2). But the input contains two 'a's and two 'aa's. So, the number of input strings that are prefixes is 2 (the 'a' and 'aa' of the prefixes). But the input has two copies of each. So, how does that work?\n\nWait, the input contains exactly two strings for each length. For example, for n=3, the input has two strings of length 1 and two of length 2. For the correct s (like 'aaa'), the prefixes of length 1 is 'a', and the suffix of length 1 is 'a'. So, the input has two 'a's. So, one of them is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. Similarly for the two 'aa's. So, for the input strings, each of the two 'a's is either a prefix or a suffix. But how to choose which?\n\nThus, for the code, when checking whether a string is a prefix or suffix, we need to assign it to P or S, but ensuring that exactly n-1 are P and n-1 are S.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nPerhaps, the approach is to first collect all the prefixes of the candidate s, and then assign P to those, and S to the rest. However, since the input contains exactly the prefixes and suffixes, the number of input strings that are prefixes is exactly n-1. Because the input contains all prefixes and all suffixes. But for the candidate s, the input strings are exactly the prefixes and suffixes. So, the number of input strings that are prefixes is exactly n-1. So, for example, in the 'aaa' case, the input strings are two 'a's and two 'aa's. The prefixes are 'a' (length 1) and 'aa' (length 2). So, for the input, there are two 'a's (which are prefixes and suffixes) and two 'aa's (prefixes and suffixes). So, the number of input strings that are prefixes is 2 (the 'a' and 'aa' of the prefixes). But since there are two 'a's and two 'aa's, how to count?\n\nWait, no. For the candidate s, the prefixes are unique. For example, for s = 'aaa', the prefixes of length 1 is 'a', length 2 is 'aa', length 3 is 'aaa' (but not part of the input). The input has all prefixes and suffixes of lengths 1 to n-1. So, the input has the prefixes of length 1 and 2. So, the input contains the prefix 'a' and 'aa'. However, the input may have duplicates. For example, in the second sample input, the two strings of length 1 are 'a' and 'a', and the two strings of length 2 are 'aa' and 'aa'.\n\nBut the actual prefixes are 'a' (length 1) and 'aa' (length 2). So, for the input, the two 'a's are both prefixes (but only one is a prefix of the string, but the input has two copies). Wait, this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input consists of all improper prefixes and suffixes. For example, for the string 'aaa' of length 3, the improper prefixes are 'a' (length 1) and 'aa' (length 2). The improper suffixes are 'a' (length 1) and 'aa' (length 2). So, the input has exactly two strings of length 1 (both 'a'), and two of length 2 (both 'aa'). Thus, the input has four strings, which is 2n-2 for n=3.\n\nSo, for the candidate s, the input strings are the prefixes and suffixes. However, some of them may be duplicates. For example, the 'a's are both prefixes and suffixes.\n\nSo, for the code, when checking whether an input string is a prefix of the candidate s, it's possible that multiple input strings are the same and are prefixes. So, the code needs to count how many of them are prefixes, and assign them as P, and the rest as S.\n\nBut how to ensure that exactly n-1 are assigned as P?\n\nThe code can do the following:\n\nFor the candidate s, collect all the prefixes of lengths 1 to n-1. These are n-1 unique strings. However, the input may contain duplicates. For example, in the case of 'aaa', the input has two 'a's (prefixes of length 1) and two 'aa's (prefixes of length 2). So, the prefixes are 'a' and 'aa', but the input has two copies of 'a' and two of 'aa'.\n\nSo, for the code, when processing the input strings, for each string, if it is a prefix of s, then it should be marked as P, but how to ensure that exactly n-1 of them are marked as P.\n\nBut how can we know which ones to mark as P and which as S?\n\nAh, but the problem states that the input is guaranteed to be valid. So, for the candidate s, the input strings contain exactly the set of prefixes and suffixes. Thus, for the candidate s, the input strings must contain exactly n-1 prefixes (possibly with duplicates) and exactly n-1 suffixes (possibly with duplicates). So, for the code, when checking the input strings, for each string, if it is a prefix, then it must be counted as part of the prefixes, and similarly for suffixes.\n\nBut how to assign P and S to the input strings such that exactly n-1 are P and n-1 are S?\n\nOne approach is to collect all the prefixes of the candidate s, and assign P to all input strings that are prefixes, and S to the rest. However, since the input contains exactly n-1 prefixes (counting duplicates), this would give exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's.\n\nBut how to determine which input strings are prefixes?\n\nFor example, in the case of the candidate s='aaa', the prefixes are 'a' (length 1) and 'aa' (length 2). So, any input string that is equal to 'a' or 'aa' is a prefix. So, for the input strings, the two 'a's are prefixes, and the two 'aa's are prefixes. So, the code would assign P to all four input strings, which is incorrect. But this contradicts the earlier assertion.\n\nWait, this suggests that there's a flaw in the approach. Because the input strings contain both prefixes and suffixes. For example, the two 'a's are both prefixes and suffixes. The code would assign P to all input strings that are prefixes, but in this case, the number of P's would be 4 (two 'a's and two 'aa's), but n-1 is 2. So, this is impossible.\n\nBut this implies that the code's approach of assigning P to all input strings that are prefixes of the candidate s is incorrect.\n\nWhat is the mistake here?\n\nAh, the mistake is that the input contains all prefixes and suffixes. So, for the candidate s, the input contains exactly the set of prefixes and suffixes. However, the number of prefixes is n-1, but the input may have duplicates. For example, in the case of s='aaa', the prefixes are 'a' (length 1) and 'aa' (length 2). However, the input contains two 'a's and two 'aa's. So, the input contains two prefixes of length 1 and two prefixes of length 2. But the actual number of prefixes is two (one per length). So, the input has duplicates of the prefixes. Hence, the code cannot simply assign all input strings that are prefixes to P, because that would result in more than n-1 P's.\n\nThis indicates that the initial approach is flawed. So, what's the correct way to assign P and S?\n\nThe problem is that the input strings contain all prefixes and suffixes, but for each length, there are exactly two strings. However, for a given candidate s, each length has exactly one prefix and one suffix. But the input may have duplicates. For example, the prefix of length 1 is 'a', and the suffix of length 1 is also 'a'. So, the input has two 'a's, one being a prefix and the other a suffix.\n\nSo, for the code, the approach of checking for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of the candidate s is not sufficient, because the same string can be both a prefix and a suffix. Hence, the code must assign it to either P or S, but ensuring that the total number of P's and S's is correct.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternative idea: For the candidate s, the set of prefixes is {prefix_1, prefix_2, ..., prefix_{n-1}}}, and the set of suffixes is {suffix_1, ..., suffix_{n-1}}}. However, the input strings are exactly the union of these two sets. So, the input strings may contain duplicates, but the code needs to assign each string to either prefix or suffix, such that the count of P's is n-1 and S's is n-1.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nMaybe the correct way is to first find all the prefixes of the candidate s, and then for each input string, if it is a prefix, assign P, else assign S. However, this would count all prefixes (including duplicates) as P, leading to possibly more than n-1 P's. Which is not allowed.\n\nBut wait, the input contains exactly 2n-2 strings, which are the prefixes and suffixes. For the candidate s, the number of prefixes is n-1. So, the input must contain exactly n-1 prefixes (counted with multiplicity). But how?\n\nNo, this is not correct. For example, in the case of s='aaa', the input has two 'a's (prefixes of length 1) and two 'aa's (prefixes of length 2). But the actual number of prefixes is two (one for length 1 and one for length 2). So, the input has four strings, but the number of prefixes is two. But the input contains two copies of each prefix. Hence, the code cannot directly use the presence of the string as a prefix to assign P.\n\nThus, the initial approach is not sufficient. We need to find a way to assign exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's.\n\nAlternative idea: For the candidate s, the prefixes are unique for each length. For example, for each length k from 1 to n-1, there is exactly one prefix of length k. Similarly for suffixes. So, the input must contain exactly two strings for each length, one being the prefix and the other the suffix. But how to determine which is which?\n\nWait, but for the candidate s, the input contains all the prefixes and suffixes. For example, for length k, there are two strings in the input: one is the prefix of length k, and the other is the suffix of length k. Hence, for each length k, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. Thus, for the input strings, for each length k, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix, and the other is a suffix.\n\nThis is true because the input is guaranteed to be the set of all prefixes and suffixes of some s. For that s, for each length k, there is exactly one prefix and one suffix. Hence, the input has two strings of length k, one being the prefix and the other the suffix.\n\nSo, for the candidate s, for each length k, exactly one of the two strings of length k is a prefix, and the other is a suffix.\n\nSo, for the code, for each length k, we can check which of the two strings of that length is a prefix of s_candidate, and assign it as P, and the other as S.\n\nThis would ensure that for each length, exactly one P and one S are assigned. Hence, overall, there are n-1 P's and n-1 S's.\n\nYes! This is the key insight.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nOnce we have a valid candidate s_candidate, for each length k from 1 to n-1:\n\n   get the two strings of length k in the input.\n\n   check which of them is a prefix of s_candidate. That one is assigned as P.\n\n   the other is assigned as S.\n\nThis ensures that for each length, exactly one P and one S are assigned. Hence, the total number of P's is n-1, and same for S's.\n\nThis solves the problem of duplicate strings and overlapping prefixes/suffixes.\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\nFor the candidate s_candidate:\n\n   for each length k in 1..n-1:\n\n      get the two strings of length k.\n\n      check which one is a prefix of s_candidate.\n\n      assign that as P, the other as S.\n\nBut how to find, for each length k, the two strings of that length?\n\nWe need to group the input strings by their lengths. For example, for each k in 1..n-1, there are exactly two strings.\n\nSo, during preprocessing, we can create a dictionary that maps lengths to lists of strings.\n\nOnce that is done, for each length k, we can process the two strings.\n\nBut how to handle the order of the input strings? Because the output must be in the order of the input strings.\n\nSo, the code needs to, for each input string, determine whether it is the prefix or suffix for its length.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\nOnce a valid candidate s_candidate is found:\n\n   create a dictionary, say, grouped = defaultdict(list), where grouped[k] contains the two strings of length k.\n\n   for each k in 1..n-1:\n\n      strings_of_k = grouped[k]\n\n      for each string in strings_of_k:\n\n          check if it is a prefix of s_candidate.\n\n          if yes, assign 'P' to it.\n\n          else, assign 'S' to it.\n\nBut since there are two strings of each length, and",
