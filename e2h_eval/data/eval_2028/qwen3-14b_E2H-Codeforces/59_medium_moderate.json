    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about counting the number of arrays of sets that can be rearranged such that each set in the sequence is a child of the next one. Let me think about what the conditions mean.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a \"child\" set is. A set A is a child of set B if for every element x in A, there's an x+1 in B. So, for example, if A has {1, 2}, then B must have 2 and 3. Wait, no: for each x in A, B must contain x+1. So for x=1 in A, B has 2. For x=2 in A, B has 3. So B must have both 2 and 3. \n\nNow, the task is to find the number of arrays of N sets, each containing integers from 1 to K, such that there exists some permutation of the array where each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}.\n\nBut how do we model this? Since the order can be rearranged, perhaps we need to find some structure that allows such a permutation. Let's think about the dependencies between the sets. For the permutation to exist, there must be a way to arrange the sets so that each is a child of the next. So, the entire sequence forms a chain where each step satisfies the child condition.\n\nBut since the order can be rearranged, maybe there's a way to model the sets based on their elements and how they can be ordered. Let me think about the properties that the sets must satisfy collectively.\n\nLet me think of each set as being part of a hierarchy. For example, if a set S has elements {x}, then any set that comes after it in the permutation must have x+1. But since the permutation can be arranged, perhaps the sets can be ordered in a way that their elements are compatible with each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the sets in terms of their \"levels\" or something similar. Let me think about the possible elements in the sets. For each integer value from 1 to K, there's a certain way they can be present in the sets.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's think of the sets in terms of their elements. For the permutation to exist, there must be a topological order where each set is a child of the next. This implies that the sets can be ordered such that for each consecutive pair, the first is a child of the second. \n\nBut what's the necessary and sufficient condition for such a permutation to exist? Well, perhaps the sets can be arranged in a sequence where each set's elements are all \"less than or equal to\" the next set's elements in some way. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the entire collection of sets. Let's imagine that for each set, we can assign a certain \"level\" such that when arranged in order of increasing levels, each set is a child of the next. However, how to define this level?\n\nAlternatively, think about the maximum element in each set. Suppose that for a set S, let m(S) be the maximum element in S. Then, if S is a child of T, then for every x in S, x+1 is in T. So, for the maximum element in S, say x, x+1 must be in T. Therefore, the maximum element of T must be at least x+1. Which implies that m(T) >= m(S)+1. \n\nWait, that's an important point. If S is a child of T, then for every x in S, x+1 is in T. In particular, the maximum element of S, say m_S, must have m_S +1 in T. Therefore, the maximum element of T must be at least m_S +1. Hence, m_T ≥ m_S + 1. \n\nThis suggests that in the permutation S'_1, S'_2,..., S'_N, the maximum elements must form a strictly increasing sequence. Because each S'_i's maximum is less than that of S'_{i+1}.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Suppose S has elements {1,3}, then its max is 3. For S to be a child of T, T must have 2 (from x=1) and 4 (from x=3). So the max of T is at least 4. So the max of T is larger than the max of S. So indeed, the maximum elements of the sets in the permutation must be strictly increasing. Therefore, the entire permutation must have the maximum elements of the sets in strictly increasing order. \n\nBut wait, if the permutation has maximum elements in strictly increasing order, then that would imply that each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}? No, not necessarily. Because even if m(S'_i) < m(S'_{i+1}), it's possible that S'_i has an element x such that x+1 is not in S'_{i+1}.\n\nFor example, suppose S'_i has elements {2}, and S'_{i+1} has elements {3}. Then m(S'_i) is 2, m(S'_{i+1}) is 3. So the maximum is increasing. And since S'_i's element is 2, x+1 is 3 which is in S'_{i+1}, so yes, S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}. \n\nAnother example: S'_i has elements {1, 3}, and S'_{i+1} has elements {2, 4}. The maximum of S'_i is 3, and of S'_{i+1} is 4. Then, for each x in S'_i, x+1 is 2 and 4. Both are in S'_{i+1}, so yes, S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}.\n\nAnother example: S'_i has {1, 3}, and S'_{i+1} has {2, 3}. The max of S'_i is 3, and of S'_{i+1} is 3. So the max is not strictly increasing. Therefore, the previous condition would not hold. But in this case, S'_i has x=3. x+1 =4 must be in S'_{i+1}, which it isn't. Therefore, S'_i is not a child of S'_{i+1}.\n\nSo, the condition that the max elements are strictly increasing is necessary. But is it sufficient?\n\nSuppose that for two sets S and T, m(S) < m(T). Is it possible that S is a child of T?\n\nYes. For example, S is {1}, T is {2}. Then yes. Or S is {1, 2}, T is {2, 3}. Then yes. However, if S is {1, 3}, T is {2, 3}, then m(S)=3, m(T)=3. Not strictly increasing. But if m(S) < m(T), then for example, S is {1, 3}, T is {2, 4}, m(S)=3 < m(T)=4. Then for x=1, x+1=2 is in T. For x=3, x+1=4 is in T. So yes, S is a child of T.\n\nBut if m(S) < m(T), but there's an element x in S where x+1 is not in T. For example, S is {1, 3}, T is {2, 4}. Then m(S)=3 < m(T)=4. But for x=3, x+1 is 4 which is present. So that's okay. Another example: S is {1, 2}, T is {2, 3}. Then m(S)=2 < m(T)=3. All elements in S have x+1 in T. So yes. \n\nAnother case: S is {1, 3}, T is {2, 3, 4}. Then x=1 → 2 is present, x=3 → 4 is present. So yes. \n\nSo, if the maximum of S is less than the maximum of T, then for all elements x in S, x+1 must be ≤ max(T). But since max(S) < max(T), then x can be up to max(S). So x+1 can be up to max(S)+1. But since max(T) ≥ max(S)+1, then x+1 is ≤ max(S)+1 ≤ max(T). But that doesn't necessarily mean that x+1 is present in T. For example, suppose S is {1}, and T has max 2. But T could be {2}, which doesn't contain x+1 = 2. Wait, no, T has max 2. So T contains 2. So x+1 is 2, which is present. Oh right. Because if S has elements with max m_S, then T's max is m_T ≥ m_S +1. So for any x in S, x can be at most m_S. So x+1 is at most m_S +1. Since m_T ≥ m_S +1, then x+1 ≤ m_T. But does that imply that x+1 is in T? Not necessarily. For example, suppose S is {1}, m_S = 1. T has m_T = 2, but T is {2}. Then x+1 is 2, which is present. So that's okay. Wait, in that case, yes. \n\nAnother example: S is {1, 2}, m_S = 2. T has m_T = 3. Suppose T is {3}. Then for x=1, x+1=2 is not in T. So S is not a child of T. But m_S is 2 < m_T=3. So the condition that m_S < m_T is necessary but not sufficient. \n\nAh! So my previous conclusion was wrong. The maximum of T being larger than that of S is necessary but not sufficient. Therefore, the earlier idea that the max elements must be strictly increasing is necessary, but not sufficient. So that complicates things.\n\nHmm, so how can we model this?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that the entire array of sets can be arranged into a sequence where each set S_i is a child of S_{i+1}. Let's think about the dependencies between the sets. For that to be possible, there must be some order of the sets such that for each consecutive pair, S_i is a child of S_{i+1}.\n\nBut how can we model this? Maybe think about the sets in terms of their elements. Each set can be represented as a subset of {1, 2, ..., K}, and the problem requires that there's a permutation of these sets where each is a child of the next.\n\nBut since the array can be permuted in any way, perhaps the problem reduces to the following: the entire collection of sets must be such that there's a way to order them so that for each consecutive pair, the first is a child of the second. How can we count all such arrays?\n\nThis seems complex. Let's think about the structure of the sets. For the entire array to be rearranged into a valid sequence, perhaps each set must be part of a chain where each set can be followed by another set that satisfies the child condition.\n\nBut given that the array has N sets, perhaps we can model this as a DAG where each node represents a set, and there's an edge from A to B if A is a child of B. Then, the problem reduces to checking if there exists a path of length N-1 in this DAG. However, since the array can have multiple copies of the same set (but the problem says that two sets are different if they differ in elements), but the array can have multiple instances of the same set? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that each set in the array can be any subset (possibly empty) of {1..K}, but the array can contain multiple copies of the same set. But when considering different arrays, two arrays are considered different if there is at least one index where the sets differ. So, for example, if two sets are the same, but appear in different positions, the arrays are considered different.\n\nBut the problem is to count all possible arrays of N sets, such that there exists a permutation of the array where each consecutive pair satisfies the child condition.\n\nBut given that N and K can be up to 2e5, we need an efficient approach. Brute-forcing all possibilities is impossible.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet’s think about the problem in terms of the possible sets. For each set S, define its \"signature\" as a binary vector indicating which elements are present. However, with K up to 2e5, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet’s think about the problem in terms of the elements. For the entire array to be rearranged into a valid sequence, there must be a way to arrange the sets so that for each set in the sequence, all elements in it are \"covered\" by the next set. \n\nBut perhaps we can model the problem by considering the elements in the sets and their dependencies. Let me think recursively. For example, each set can contribute to certain elements, and the arrangement must allow for a chain where each step covers the elements properly.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire array of sets as forming a DAG where each set can be followed by any set that satisfies the child condition. Then, the problem becomes counting the number of arrays of N sets where the sets can be ordered in a sequence such that each is a child of the next. But even this is abstract.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the order can be rearranged, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding a way to assign to each set in the array a position in a chain of length N, such that each set in the chain is a child of the next. But how to model this?\n\nWait, but the array can have any number of sets. For example, if N=2, then the array can consist of two sets S and T. We need that there exists a permutation (either [S, T] or [T, S]) where the first is a child of the second. So the array is valid if either S is a child of T, or T is a child of S.\n\nBut for general N, the problem requires that the array can be ordered into a sequence S_1, S_2, ..., S_N where each S_i is a child of S_{i+1}.\n\nSo the entire array must be such that the sets form a chain of length N-1, where each step satisfies the child condition. However, the array can have multiple sets, and the order can be chosen arbitrarily.\n\nBut how to count all such arrays?\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the problem as follows. For the array to be valid, there must exist a permutation of the sets in the array such that each set is a child of the next. Let’s think of this permutation as a chain of sets. For the entire array, the sets can be arranged in such a chain. Therefore, the sets in the array must form a collection that can be ordered into a chain where each consecutive pair satisfies the child condition.\n\nBut how to model this for counting purposes?\n\nPerhaps the key is to realize that the entire collection of sets must be such that there exists a linear extension where each set is a child of the next. However, given that the array can contain any number of sets, this seems challenging.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think about the problem in terms of the elements. Let's think of the sets as being built in a way that allows them to be ordered. For instance, each set can be characterized by the maximum element it contains. However, as discussed earlier, this isn't sufficient, but perhaps we can find a way to model it.\n\nLet me think again about the necessary and sufficient conditions for a set A to be a child of set B. For every x in A, x+1 must be in B. Which means that B must contain all x+1 for x in A. So, if we think of the elements of A as a subset of {1, ..., K}, then B must contain the image of A under the function f(x) = x+1. \n\nSo, B must be a superset of f(A). Let's denote this as B ⊇ f(A).\n\nNow, for the entire array to be rearranged into a sequence where each set is a child of the next, we need that for each consecutive pair (S_i, S_{i+1}), S_i is a child of S_{i+1}, i.e., S_{i+1} ⊇ f(S_i).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of arrays of N sets (each being a subset of {1..K}) such that there exists a permutation of the array where each consecutive pair satisfies S_{i+1} ⊇ f(S_i).\n\nBut how can we model this? It's tricky because the permutation is arbitrary, but the condition depends on the relation between pairs of sets.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the entire array as a collection of sets that can be ordered in a sequence where each set is a subset of the image of the previous set under f. However, since the order is arbitrary, perhaps the sets can be partitioned into levels, where each level's sets can be followed by sets in the next level. For example, if we can assign to each set a level l, such that for any set in level l, all sets in level l+1 contain f(S), then the sequence can be formed by taking one set from each level in order. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the sets in terms of their \"reachability\". For example, the maximum element in a set S is m. Then, for S to be a child of T, T must contain all x+1 for x in S. In particular, T must contain m+1. Therefore, the maximum element of T must be at least m+1. So, if we define for each set S, its \"rank\" as the maximum element in S, then for S to be a child of T, rank(T) ≥ rank(S) + 1. \n\nThis gives us a necessary condition. However, as discussed earlier, this is not sufficient. But perhaps, if we can ensure that all sets in the array have ranks that can be ordered in a strictly increasing sequence, and that for each set S in the sequence, the next set T has rank ≥ rank(S) + 1, then perhaps there's a way to choose T such that T contains all the required elements.\n\nWait, but if the rank of T is at least rank(S) + 1, then T contains at least one element (the maximum element of T) which is ≥ rank(S) + 1. However, that doesn't guarantee that T contains all the x+1 elements for x in S. For example, if S has elements {1, 3}, and T has rank 4 (so contains 4), but T doesn't have 2. Then, since x=1 in S requires that T contains 2, which it doesn't. So the rank condition is not sufficient.\n\nBut what if we also require that for any set S with rank m, all elements in S are ≤ m. Which they are, since the rank is the maximum element. So, for any x in S, x ≤ m. Therefore, x+1 ≤ m+1. If T has rank ≥ m+1, then T contains at least m+1, but may or may not contain x+1 for all x in S.\n\nBut how can we ensure that T contains all x+1 for x in S? Well, if T contains all elements from 1 up to its rank. For example, if T is {1, 2, ..., r}, then for any x in S (which has max m), x+1 is in T if x+1 ≤ r. But if r ≥ m+1, then x+1 ≤ m+1 ≤ r. So T would contain all x+1 for x in S. \n\nAh! So if T is a set that contains all elements from 1 up to its rank, then any S with rank m < r will satisfy that T contains all x+1 for x in S. Because for each x in S, x ≤ m, so x+1 ≤ m+1 ≤ r. Therefore, x+1 is in T. \n\nBut what if T is not such a set? For example, T could have elements {2, 4} with rank 4. Then, if S has {1, 3}, then x+1 for 1 is 2 (which is in T), x+1 for 3 is 4 (which is in T). So even though T is not a full interval, it still satisfies the condition. \n\nSo, the key is that for any x in S, x+1 is in T. This is equivalent to saying that T contains the image of S under f(x) = x+1. \n\nBut how can we model this for counting purposes?\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's consider that for each set S, define a \"profile\" which is the set of elements it contains. However, with K up to 2e5, enumerating all possible profiles is impossible. \n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to model the problem using dynamic programming, considering the elements from 1 to K and building up the solution.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that we have a certain number of sets, and we want to count the number of ways to arrange them such that there exists a valid permutation. \n\nBut this seems too vague. Let's think of the problem in terms of the allowed transitions between sets. \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: for the array to be valid, there must be a way to arrange the sets in a sequence where each set is a child of the next. This implies that the entire array's sets can be ordered in a sequence where each set's image under f is contained in the next set. \n\nBut perhaps we can model this by considering that the sets in the array can be ordered such that their images under f are contained in the next set. This seems like a dependency graph, but again, it's unclear how to count the possibilities.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the problem in terms of the sets' elements and their relations. Let's imagine that we can assign to each set a certain \"level\" l, and arrange the sets in increasing order of levels. For example, level l is the maximum element in the set. Then, for a set with level l, the next set in the sequence must have level ≥ l+1. However, this is the same as the earlier necessary condition. But this condition is not sufficient. However, if we can ensure that all sets are such that their elements are exactly the numbers from 1 up to their level, then this condition would be sufficient. \n\nBut this seems too restrictive. However, maybe there's a way to model the problem by considering that the sets can be represented in terms of their levels, and that the count depends on the number of sets with each level.\n\nLet me think about the following: For each set, define its level as the maximum element it contains. Then, for the sequence to be valid, the levels must form a strictly increasing sequence. But again, this is not sufficient, but perhaps if we can count the number of arrays where the sets can be ordered with strictly increasing levels, and for each such array, there exists a way to arrange the sets such that the child condition holds. \n\nBut how to ensure that? Well, if the levels are strictly increasing, then for each set S_i with level l_i, the next set S_{i+1} has level l_{i+1} ≥ l_i + 1. Now, for S_i to be a child of S_{i+1}, we need that for every x in S_i, x+1 is in S_{i+1}. \n\nBut since the level of S_{i+1} is ≥ l_i + 1, then the maximum element of S_{i+1} is ≥ l_i + 1. However, this doesn't guarantee that all x+1 are present. For example, if S_i has level l_i = 2 (so contains 2), and S_{i+1} has level 3 but only contains 3. Then, x=2 in S_i requires that 3 is in S_{i+1}, which it is. So this works. \n\nWait! Because if the level of S_{i+1} is at least l_i + 1, then the maximum element of S_{i+1} is ≥ l_i + 1. For any x in S_i, x ≤ l_i, so x+1 ≤ l_i + 1. Since S_{i+1} has maximum element ≥ l_i + 1, it must contain at least that element. But does it contain x+1? Not necessarily. Unless S_{i+1} contains all elements up to its level. \n\nWait, no. For example, if S_i has elements {1, 3} and level 3, and S_{i+1} has elements {4} with level 4. Then x=3 in S_i requires that 4 is in S_{i+1}, which it is. x=1 in S_i requires that 2 is in S_{i+1}, which it isn't. Therefore, S_i is not a child of S_{i+1}, even though the levels are increasing. \n\nSo the level condition is not sufficient. But what if we ensure that all sets are intervals from 1 to their level? Then, for any set S with level l, it contains all elements from 1 to l. In that case, if S_{i} has level l_i, and S_{i+1} has level l_{i+1} ≥ l_i + 1, then S_{i} is a child of S_{i+1} because for any x in S_i, x+1 is in S_{i+1} (since x+1 ≤ l_i + 1 ≤ l_{i+1}, and S_{i+1} contains all elements up to its level). \n\nIn this case, the level condition is sufficient. \n\nBut how does this help us? Well, perhaps the total number of valid arrays is equal to the number of arrays where the sets can be ordered with strictly increasing levels, and each set is an interval from 1 to its level. But this seems like a very restrictive condition. However, the problem allows for any sets, not just intervals. \n\nBut perhaps the answer can be derived by considering that the valid arrays are those where the sets can be ordered with strictly increasing levels, and for each set, the elements are a subset of the interval [1, l], where l is the level. However, this might not capture all possibilities, but perhaps there's a way to model this.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the following: For any array of sets that can be ordered in a strictly increasing sequence of levels (l_1 < l_2 < ... < l_N), the number of such arrays is equal to the product of the number of ways to choose each set with level l_i, multiplied by the number of permutations of the sets that follow the level order. But this seems too vague.\n\nBut perhaps the key insight is that the necessary and sufficient condition for the array to be valid is that the sets can be ordered in a sequence where each set's level is strictly greater than the previous. Because if that is the case, then we can choose for each set in the sequence to be an interval from 1 to its level. \n\nWait, but this is not the case. For example, suppose we have two sets S and T, where S has level 2 (contains {1,2}), and T has level 3 (contains {3}). Then, the levels are strictly increasing, but S is not a child of T because T doesn't contain 2. However, if we choose T to be {2,3}, then S is a child of T. \n\nSo the problem is that the choice of sets affects whether the level condition is sufficient. Therefore, if we can choose the sets in a way that ensures that whenever the levels are strictly increasing, the child condition is satisfied, then we can count those arrays. \n\nBut how to model this? Perhaps we can think of the problem as follows: For each set, we can choose it to be any subset of {1..K}, but to ensure that the array can be ordered with strictly increasing levels. But how?\n\nWait, but if the array can be ordered with strictly increasing levels, then regardless of the actual elements of the sets, there exists a way to choose a permutation where each set's level is strictly increasing. However, this doesn't ensure that the child condition is satisfied. \n\nBut what if we require that for each set, it contains all elements up to its level? Then, the level condition would be sufficient. \n\nSo, if we can count the number of arrays where each set is an interval [1, l_i], and the levels are strictly increasing in some permutation, then that would give us a subset of valid arrays. However, this may not account for all possible valid arrays. \n\nBut maybe this is the way to go. Let me think: For the array to be valid, it's necessary that the levels can be arranged in a strictly increasing sequence. And if we can choose the sets to be intervals, then this condition is sufficient. So the number of valid arrays would be equal to the number of ways to choose N sets (each being an interval [1, l_i]) such that there exists a permutation of the sets with strictly increasing levels. \n\nBut then, what is the number of such arrays? Well, for each set, the level l_i can be any value between 0 (empty set) and K (the full set {1..K}).\n\nWait, but the empty set has no elements, so its level is zero. For a non-empty set, the level is the maximum element in the set. For the empty set, it's zero. \n\nIf we model each set as being an interval [1, l], where l is between 0 and K, then for any two sets with levels l1 and l2, if l1 < l2, then the first is a child of the second. Because for any x in [1, l1], x+1 is in [1, l2] since x+1 ≤ l1 + 1 ≤ l2 (since l1 < l2 implies l1 + 1 ≤ l2 only if l2 ≥ l1 + 1). Wait, if l1 < l2, then l2 could be l1 + 1 or higher. \n\nFor example, if l1 is 2 and l2 is 3, then for x=2 in the first set, x+1 is 3 which is in the second set. For x=1, x+1=2 is in the second set. So yes, the first is a child of the second. If l2 is l1 + 1, then yes. But what if l2 is larger than l1 + 1? Like l1=2 and l2=4. Then x=2's x+1=3 is in the second set (since it's [1,4]). Yes. So any set with level l2 ≥ l1 + 1 will contain all x+1 for x in the first set. Therefore, if the sets are intervals, and the levels are strictly increasing, then the child condition holds. \n\nSo if we restrict ourselves to sets that are intervals, then the problem reduces to counting the number of arrays of N sets, where each set is an interval [1, l_i], and there exists a permutation of the array where the l_i's are strictly increasing. \n\nBut how many such arrays are there?\n\nWell, for each array of N sets, each set being an interval [1, l_i], where l_i can be any value from 0 to K. The array is valid if there exists a permutation of the sets where the l_i's are strictly increasing. \n\nBut since the array can be rearranged, this is equivalent to requiring that the multiset of l_i's can be arranged in a strictly increasing sequence. Which is always possible if all the l_i's are distinct. But if there are duplicates, then it's not possible. Wait, no. Because if there are duplicates, say two sets with the same level, then you cannot arrange them in strictly increasing order. \n\nTherefore, the array is valid if and only if all the l_i's are distinct. Wait, no. Because for example, if you have two sets with levels l and l, then you can't arrange them in strictly increasing order. But if you have three sets with levels l, m, l, where m > l, then you can arrange them as l, m, l, which is not strictly increasing. So the only way for the array to be rearrangeable into a strictly increasing sequence is that the multiset of levels has distinct values. Because otherwise, you can't have a strictly increasing sequence. \n\nWait, no. For example, if you have two sets with levels l and m where l < m, then the array [l, m] is valid. If you have two sets with levels l and l, then the array cannot be rearranged into a strictly increasing sequence. Hence, the array is valid if and only if all the l_i's are distinct. \n\nWait, but what if the array has N sets with levels that are all distinct? Then, there exists a permutation of them in strictly increasing order. So for the array to be valid, it's necessary and sufficient that all the l_i's are distinct. \n\nSo, in this model, the number of valid arrays is equal to the number of arrays of N sets, each being an interval [1, l_i], where all l_i's are distinct. \n\nBut how many such arrays are there? \n\nThe number of possible intervals is K+1: levels 0, 1, ..., K. Each set corresponds to choosing one of these levels. The array must consist of N distinct levels. So the number of such arrays is (K+1) choose N multiplied by N! (since each array is a permutation of N distinct levels, but wait no: the array is not required to be a permutation. The array can have any N elements, as long as they are all distinct. Wait no. Wait, the array is of N sets. Each set is an interval. The array is valid if there exists a permutation of the array where the levels are strictly increasing. Which requires that all levels in the array are distinct. Because if there are two sets with the same level, then no permutation can make them strictly increasing. \n\nThus, the number of arrays is equal to the number of ways to choose N distinct levels from K+1 options, multiplied by the number of ways to assign these levels to the N sets. Wait, no. Because for each array, the sets are ordered. For example, if the array has N distinct levels, then there are N! permutations of the array. But the problem states that the array is valid if there exists any permutation. So for the array to be valid, it's sufficient that the multiset of levels has all distinct elements. Once that is true, the array is valid. \n\nSo the number of such arrays is equal to the number of ways to select N distinct levels (from K+1 possible levels) multiplied by the number of ways to assign each set in the array to a level. But since each set in the array must be an interval corresponding to its level, and the array is ordered, the number of arrays is (K+1 choose N) * (number of ways to assign the levels to the N positions in the array). Wait, no. For each selection of N distinct levels, the array can have any permutation of those levels. But the array is ordered. For example, if we have N distinct levels, then the array can be any of the N! permutations of those levels. However, the problem counts arrays as different if the sets in different positions are different. \n\nWait, but in this model, each set is determined by its level. So for example, if the array has N distinct levels, then each set is uniquely determined by its level. Thus, the number of arrays is equal to the number of ways to choose N distinct levels (from K+1 options), multiplied by the number of permutations of these levels (since the array can be arranged in any order). But no, the array is not required to be a permutation of the levels. The array is a sequence of N sets, each with a distinct level. So for each array, each of the N sets has a unique level. The number of such arrays is (K+1) * (K) * ... * (K+1 - N + 1) ) = P(K+1, N), where P is the permutation function. Because for the first set, you can choose any of K+1 levels, the second any of the remaining K levels, etc. \n\nBut this would count all arrays where the sets are intervals with distinct levels. And for each such array, there exists a permutation (the sorted order) where the levels are strictly increasing. Therefore, each such array is valid. \n\nBut are there other valid arrays that are not covered by this model? For example, arrays where the sets are not intervals, but can be arranged in a sequence with strictly increasing levels. \n\nYes. For example, suppose K=2. Consider an array with two sets: S1 = {1}, S2 = {2}. These are intervals. But also, consider S1 = {1}, S2 = {2, 3} (but K=2, so this is invalid). Or S1 = {1}, S2 = {2}. Which is covered by the model. Another example: S1 = {1}, S2 = {2}. Valid. What if S1 = {1}, S2 = {1, 2}? The levels are 1 and 2, which are distinct. So this is covered. But what about S1 = {1}, S2 = {2}? Yes. \n\nAnother example: S1 = {1, 2}, S2 = {2}. The levels are 2 and 2. So the array is invalid. But if S2 is {3}, then levels are 2 and 3,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid arrays of sets that can be rearranged such that each set in the sequence is a child of the next one. A set $ A $ is a child of set $ B $ if for every element $ x $ in $ A $, there exists an element $ x+1 $ in $ B $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Child Condition**: For a set $ A $ to be a child of set $ B $, every element $ x $ in $ A $ must have $ x+1 $ in $ B $. This implies that the maximum element in $ A $ (denoted as $ \\text{max}(A) $) must be less than the maximum element in $ B $ (denoted as $ \\text{max}(B) $).\n\n2. **Strictly Increasing Levels**: If we consider the maximum element (level) of each set, the sets can be arranged in a sequence where each set's level is strictly increasing. This ensures that each set in the sequence is a child of the next one.\n\n3. **Counting Valid Arrays**: The problem reduces to counting the number of ways to choose $ N $ distinct levels from $ K+1 $ possible levels (ranging from 0 to $ K $), and then permuting these levels in any order. Each level corresponds to a unique interval set $ [1, l] $, ensuring the child condition is met when arranged in increasing order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    N = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    K = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo MOD\n    max_n = K + 1\n    fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n    \n    if N > K + 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Compute permutation P(K+1, N)\n    res = fact[K+1]\n    inv_fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    inv_fact[K+1] = pow(fact[K+1], MOD-2, MOD)\n    for i in range(K+1-1, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n    \n    # P(n, k) = fact[n] * inv_fact[n - k] mod MOD\n    numerator = fact[K+1]\n    denominator = fact[K+1 - N]\n    ans = numerator * pow(denominator, MOD-2, MOD) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Factorial Precomputation**: We precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to $ K+1 $ to efficiently compute permutations and combinations.\n\n2. **Permutations Calculation**: The number of valid arrays is determined by the number of permutations of $ N $ distinct levels chosen from $ K+1 $ possible levels.
