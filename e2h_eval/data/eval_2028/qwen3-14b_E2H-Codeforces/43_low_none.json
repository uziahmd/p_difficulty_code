He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps involved.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. A starts with some number of 'a's. So the initial string is all a's. But there has to be at least one 'a' here.\n2. Then B appends some number of 'b's. So after this step, the string is a bunch of a's followed by some b's. And there must be at least one 'b' here too. So the total string after B's step has both a's and b's.\n3. Then C appends some number of 'c's. The number of c's added must be equal to the number of a's or the number of b's in the string at that point (before adding the c's). Also, it's possible that the number of c's equals both, like if a and b counts are same.\n\nSo the final string must consist of a's followed by b's followed by c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order of characters in the string must be all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. Otherwise, it's invalid. For example, if there's a 'c' before some 'b's, that's impossible.\n\nSo first thing I need to check is that the string is in the form of a* b* c*. So all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. If the string doesn't follow this structure, then immediately return NO.\n\nOnce that's confirmed, then proceed to check the counts.\n\nLet me think about the counts.\n\nLet me denote:\n\ncount_a = number of a's in the string.\n\ncount_b = number of b's.\n\ncount_c = number of c's.\n\nNow, according to the process:\n\nAfter A and B's steps, the string has count_a and count_b, with count_a >=1 and count_b >=1. Then C adds count_c c's, which must be equal to either count_a or count_b (from before adding the c's). Wait, but when C adds the c's, the count of a's and b's in the string is the same as before adding the c's. Because adding c's doesn't affect the counts of a and b.\n\nSo, the count_c must be equal to count_a (original) or count_b (original). But the original count_a and count_b are the ones from before adding the c's. So in the final string, count_c must be equal to count_a_initial (which is the same as count_a in the final string, since adding c's doesn't change a's) or count_b_initial (same as count_b in the final string).\n\nWait, yes. Because when C appends the c's, the count of a's and b's in the string is the same as before adding the c's. So the count_c must be equal to count_a_initial (which is the same as count_a in the final string) or count_b_initial (same as count_b in the final string).\n\nSo for the final string, count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b. But also, the original steps require that after B's step, there was at least one a and one b. So in the final string, count_a must be >=1, count_b >=1, and count_c >=1.\n\nWait, because when C appends the c's, he adds some number of c's. So the count_c is at least 1? Because the problem says that C appends some number of c's. But the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end. So \"some number\" could be zero? Wait no. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\nBut the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c'. So, the number of c's added is equal to count_a_initial or count_b_initial. But since the original count_a_initial is at least 1 (because A had some a's and B added some b's, so after B's step, count_a_initial is the same as the original A's count, which is at least 1. Similarly for count_b_initial. So when C adds the c's, the count_c added is equal to count_a_initial or count_b_initial. So the count_c in the final string is equal to that value. So count_c must be >=1.\n\nSo in the final string, count_c must be >=1. Also, count_a and count_b must be >=1.\n\nSo the steps for checking:\n\nFirst, check that the string is in the form a*b*c*. If not, return NO.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. The operations are as follows:\n1. Start with some number of 'a's.\n2. Append some number of 'b's to the end of the string.\n3. Append some number of 'c's such that the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Structure**: The string must be composed of only 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's. If the string does not follow this structure, it is immediately invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: Count the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string.\n3. **Validation**: Ensure there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. Additionally, the count of 'c's must be equal to either the count of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_valid_string(s):\n    # Check if the string is in the form a*b*c*\n    i = 0\n    n = len(s)\n    \n    # Check for 'a's first\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n        i += 1\n    # Check for 'b's next\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'b':\n        i += 1\n    # Check for 'c's next\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'c':\n        i += 1\n    \n    if i != n:\n        return \"NO\"\n    \n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    # Check if there's at least one of each\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n        return \"NO\"\n    \n    # Check if count_c equals count_a or count_b\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        return \"YES\"\n    else:\n        return \"NO\"\n\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    print(is_valid_string(s))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Structure Check**: The code first checks if the string is in the form of all 'a's followed by all 'b's followed by all 'c's. This is done by iterating through the string and ensuring that each segment (a's, b's, c's) is contiguous.\n2. **Count Validation**: After confirming the structure, the code counts the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c'. It then checks if there is at least one of each character.\n3. **Final Check**: The count of 'c's is compared against the counts of 'a's and 'b's. If it matches either, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints and conditions specified in the problem are checked efficiently.",
