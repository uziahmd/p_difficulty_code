Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where we have a string of digits and perform multiple substitution queries. Then compute the number modulo 1e9+7. The challenge is handling the substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. If I try to process each substitution naively by replacing all occurrences in the string each time, that would be O(n * len(s)) which could be way too slow for large inputs. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nHmm, thinking about it, maybe we can model this with some kind of replacement rules that track how each digit is transformed. But since substitutions are done in sequence, each query replaces a digit with another string, which might include digits that are later replaced. So the order of processing queries matters. For example, if first we replace 2 with 00, then replace 0 with 7, then the original 2s would become 00, which then become 77.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each query replaces all instances of di in the current string with ti. So the substitutions are applied in the order given. So for each query, we need to process the current string, replacing all instances of di with ti. However, doing this directly for each query would be too slow for large strings and many queries.\n\nSo, what's the alternative? Let's think about representing the transformations as a mapping from each digit to its replacement. However, since substitutions can be applied multiple times, and each substitution affects the current state of the string, we need to track for each digit what it's currently being replaced with. But if we process the queries in order, and for each query, we update the replacement rules, then maybe we can model the final expansion of each original digit in the initial string.\n\nWait, but how do we track the expansion? Because when a digit is replaced, it's replaced by a string which may contain other digits that are later replaced. So, for example, if initially, the string is '2', and the first query is 2->0, then the second query is 0->7, then the final result is 7. But if the queries were reversed, then the first query is 0->7, and the second is 2->0, then the initial '2' would become 0, which then becomes 7. So the order of the queries matters, and the replacement rules are cumulative.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this with a kind of memoization or dynamic programming approach. Let's consider that for each digit d, we can track what it expands to after all the queries. However, since the queries are processed in order, and each query replaces a digit with a new string, which may include other digits that might be replaced later, we need to track for each digit, the current expansion.\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently? Let's think: when a query comes in, say \"d -> t\", then any occurrence of d in the current string will be replaced by t. However, when processing the queries, the replacement for d is updated. But if we can track for each digit, what it's currently expanded into, then we can compute the final expansion for each original digit in the initial string.\n\nWait, here's an idea: instead of maintaining the actual string, we can maintain for each digit (from 0-9) a representation of what it expands to. Initially, each digit expands to itself. Then, when a query comes in, say \"d -> t\", we need to update the expansion of d to be t. However, the expansion of t may involve other digits which have their own expansions. So, for example, if d is replaced with t, and t contains digits that have their own expansions, then when we expand d, we need to expand those digits as well.\n\nBut how do we handle this? Let me think. Suppose we have a mapping, say, replace_map, where replace_map[d] is the string that d is replaced with. Initially, replace_map[d] = d for all d. Then, when a query comes in, say \"d -> t\", we set replace_map[d] = t. However, when we need to compute the expansion of a digit, we need to recursively expand the replace_map entries. For example, if replace_map['2'] is '0', and replace_map['0'] is '7', then expanding '2' would give us '7'.\n\nBut if we have to compute this expansion on the fly, then for each query, when we process it, we need to make sure that the replace_map entries are updated in a way that reflects all previous substitutions. However, this seems tricky. Because when you replace d with t, the t may contain digits that are themselves being replaced. But if we have a way to represent the expansion of each digit as a function of the current replace_map,",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to handle a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the final number modulo $10^9 + 7$. Directly applying each substitution to the entire string would be inefficient for large inputs. Instead, we can use a dynamic programming approach to track how each digit is transformed through the sequence of queries.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Expansion**: Maintain a mapping (`replace_map`) where each digit maps to its current expansion. Initially, each digit maps to itself.\n2. **Recursive Expansion**: When a query replaces a digit `d` with a string `t`, update `replace_map[d]` to `t`. However, to ensure that subsequent substitutions are handled correctly, we recursively expand any digits in `t` using the current mappings.\n3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be very large, we use modulo $10^9 + 7$ during all operations to keep numbers manageable and avoid overflow.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: For each character in the initial string, compute its final expanded value using the `replace_map` and accumulate the result while maintaining the modulo.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    s = input[idx].strip()\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx].strip())\n    idx += 1\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            break\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if line:\n            queries.append(line)\n        idx += 1\n\n    # Initialize replace_map: for each digit, what it expands to\n    replace_map = {}\n    for d in map(str, range(10)):\n        replace_map[d] = d\n\n    # Process each query\n    for query in queries:\n        parts = query.split('->')\n        d = parts[0].strip()\n        t = parts[1].strip() if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        # Update replace_map[d] to t, but expand t using current replace_map\n        # To do this, we need to recursively expand t's characters\n        expanded_t = []\n        for c in t:\n            expanded_t.append(replace_map[c])\n        replace_map[d] = ''.join(expanded_t)\n\n    # Now, compute the final number by expanding each character in the original string\n    # But since the expansions can be large, we need to calculate the value mod MOD\n    result = 0\n    for c in s:\n        # Expand c to its full form\n        expanded = replace_map[c]\n        # Now compute the value of expanded string as a number mod MOD\n        # To do this efficiently, we can process each digit in expanded\n        val = 0\n        for ch in expanded:\n            val = (val * 10 + int(ch)) % MOD\n        result = (result * pow(10, len(expanded), MOD) + val) % MOD\n\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The `replace_map` is initialized so that each digit maps to itself.\n2. **Query Processing**: Each query updates the `replace_map` by replacing the target digit with the provided string, which is expanded using the current mappings to ensure subsequent substitutions are handled correctly.\n3. **Final Calculation**: For each character in the original string, we expand it using the final `replace_map` values and compute the resulting number modulo $10^9 + 7$. This is done efficiently by processing each digit and maintaining the modulo at each step to avoid overflow.\n\nThis approach ensures that each substitution is handled in constant time relative to the length of the replacement strings, making the solution efficient even for large inputs.",
