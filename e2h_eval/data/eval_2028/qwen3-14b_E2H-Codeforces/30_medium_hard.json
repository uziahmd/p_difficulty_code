Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Homer and Marge are playing a game with a number A of 2n digits. They take turns picking the leftmost digit, and each makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. And I have to output the sequence of H and M moves that achieves this maximum.\n\nHmm. So the main challenge is to find the optimal sequence of choices between Homer and Marge such that their total is maximized. Since each choice affects the remaining digits and the future choices, this feels like a dynamic programming problem. But considering that n can be up to 18, which means the total length is 36 digits. Let me think about the possible states and transitions.\n\nLet me think about the state. At any point, the number of digits left is 2n - k, where k is the number of digits already taken. But more importantly, we need to track how many moves Homer and Marge have made so far. Because each must make exactly n moves. So the state can be represented by the number of digits taken (which is equal to the number of moves made so far), and how many of those moves were Homer's and how many Marge's. Wait, but since each move is either H or M, the total moves made so far is the sum of Homer's and Marge's moves. Let's say that for the current state, we have h moves made by Homer and m moves made by Marge. Since each move adds one to either h or m, and h + m = k, where k is the number of digits taken so far. Also, since the total number of moves is 2n, and each player must have exactly n moves, the constraints are h ≤ n and m ≤ n, and h + m = k. \n\nSo the state can be represented as (h, m), which implies that there are h moves for Homer and m for Marge. But since h + m = k, and the number of digits left is 2n - k, which is also equal to (n - h) + (n - m) because each player has to make n moves. So when we are in state (h, m), the next move can be H or M, provided that h < n or m < n respectively.\n\nBut how do we model the decision here? For each state (h, m), we can choose to take the next digit as H or M, and then proceed. The key is to decide which choice (H or M) will lead to the maximum total sum. However, since the digits are being taken from the front of the number, the current position in the string is determined by the number of digits taken so far. For example, if k digits have been taken, the current digit is the (k+1)th digit of the original string. So the state would also need to know the current position in the string. But wait, the position is determined by k = h + m. So for each state (h, m), the current position is h + m, and the next digit is A[k], where k = h + m. \n\nWait, yes. So the state is (h, m), and the next digit is A[h + m]. Then, when we choose to take H, we add that digit to Homer's number, and increment h by 1. Similarly for M. \n\nBut how do we compute the total sum? Because the value of S1 and S2 depends on the digits collected, and the order in which they are collected. For example, taking a digit earlier gives it a higher place value. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that each time a player takes the leftmost digit and appends it to their number. So the first digit taken becomes the first digit of their number. So for example, if Homer takes digits in positions 0, then 1, then 2, his number would be the digits in order of 0, 1, 2. So the digits are added in the order they are taken, making the first digit taken the most significant digit of their number. Therefore, the value of S1 and S2 is determined by the order of digits taken. \n\nBut how do we model the total value? For example, if Homer takes a digit d at step k (where k is the number of digits taken so far, so the digit is the (k)th position in the original string?), then the value contributed by that digit is d multiplied by 10^{n - h - 1} where h is the number of times he has taken digits before. Wait, no. Because when Homer takes the first digit, it's the first digit of his number. If he takes n digits, the first digit is multiplied by 10^{n-1}, the second by 10^{n-2}, etc. So for each digit that Homer takes, the contribution depends on the position in his own number. Similarly for Marge. \n\nBut tracking the exact value of S1 and S2 would be computationally expensive, especially for large n. For example, when n=18, the numbers can be up to 1e18 digits, which is way too big to handle directly. So we need a way to model the problem without actually computing the full numbers. \n\nWait, but the problem requires us to maximize the sum of S1 and S2. Let's think about how each choice affects the sum. Suppose that at a certain step, the current digit is d. If Homer takes it, then this digit contributes d * 10^{(n - h - 1)} to the total sum. Similarly, if Marge takes it, it contributes d * 10^{(n - m - 1)}. But wait, h is the number of times Homer has taken digits so far. So when he takes this digit, it's his (h+1)th digit. So the exponent is (n - (h + 1)) + 1? Or maybe (n - h - 1) ?\n\nWait, for example, if Homer has taken h digits so far, and he takes another digit now. His new number will have h+1 digits. The new digit is the (h+1)th digit in his number, which is the most significant digit. Wait, no. Wait, the first digit taken is the first digit of his number. So the first digit is multiplied by 10^{n-1}, the second by 10^{n-2}, etc. So the (k)th digit he takes (for k from 1 to n) contributes d * 10^{n - k} to S1. \n\nSo when Homer takes a digit at the moment when he has already taken h digits (so after this move, he has h+1 digits), then this digit is the (h+1)th digit in his number, contributing d * 10^{n - (h+1)} to S1. Similarly for Marge: if she has taken m digits before, and takes a new digit, that's her (m+1)th digit, contributing d * 10^{n - (m+1)} to S2. \n\nSo the total contribution of choosing H or M at this step is based on the current h and m values. \n\nTherefore, the problem can be modeled as a dynamic programming problem, where the state is (h, m), and the value stored is the maximum possible total sum achievable from that state onwards. \n\nThe recurrence would be:\n\ndp[h][m] = max(\n   (current_digit * 10^{n - h - 1} ) + dp[h+1][m], \n   (current_digit * 10^{n - m - 1} ) + dp[h][m+1]\n)\n\nBut wait, the current digit is the (h + m)th digit of the original string (since h + m steps have been taken so far, and the next digit is the (h + m)th index? Wait, the original string is given as a string, say A. For example, if the original string is \"1234\", then for n=2, the digits are 1,2,3,4. The first move takes the first digit (index 0). Then the next move takes the next digit (index 1), etc. So the current digit when h + m steps have been taken is A[h + m].\n\nSo for the state (h, m), the current digit is A[h + m], and the next move is to take that digit. \n\nSo, for the DP approach, the state is (h, m), and the value is the maximum total sum that can be achieved from this state onwards. \n\nThe base case is when h = n and m = n, which means all digits have been taken, and the sum is zero. \n\nBut for n up to 18, the state space is (n+1) * (n+1) = 19*19=361 for n=18. That's manageable. However, the problem is that the value of the DP can be very large. For example, each digit can be up to 9, multiplied by 10^something. For n=18, the exponents can be as high as 10^17. But even then, Python can handle big integers. However, the problem is that for each state, we need to compute the value of the current choice and the recursive calls. \n\nBut the problem is that the DP approach may not be feasible due to the high computational cost of calculating the exponents. Wait, but for each state (h, m), the current digit is known, and the contribution for choosing H or M is known. Let's think about precomputing the powers of 10. \n\nFor example, precompute pow10[i] = 10^i. Then, when Homer takes a digit at state (h, m), the contribution is digit * pow10[n - h - 1], because after taking this digit, Homer has h+1 digits, and this is the (h+1)th digit. So the exponent is (n - (h+1)) + 0? Wait, the first digit is multiplied by 10^(n-1), the second by 10^(n-2), ..., the h+1-th digit is multiplied by 10^(n - (h+1)). \n\nYes. So for Homer's contribution, when he takes the current digit (at state h, m), the contribution is digit * pow10[ n - (h+1) ] = digit * pow10[ n - h - 1 ].\n\nSimilarly for Marge, it's digit * pow10[ n - (m+1) ] = digit * pow10[ n - m - 1 ].\n\nSo for each state (h, m), the current digit is A[h + m], and we have to compute the maximum between choosing H or M, adding their respective contributions plus the DP value of the next state.\n\nSo the DP can be memoized with memoization. However, for n=18, the maximum number of states is (18+1)^2 = 361, which is very manageable. Each state requires two transitions (H or M), so the total number of operations is O(n²), which is acceptable.\n\nBut how do we compute the pow10 terms? For n up to 18, the maximum exponent needed is for when h=0 (so n - h - 1 = 18-0-1 = 17). So we can precompute pow10 up to 18 digits. For example, pow10[0] = 1, pow10[1] = 10, etc. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the pow10 array up to n.\n\n2. Use memoization (like lru_cache) for the DP function, which takes h and m as parameters.\n\n3. For each state (h, m), check if h + m is within the length of A (which is 2n, so h + m ranges from 0 to 2n).\n\n4. At each state, the current digit is A[h + m].\n\n5. The DP function returns the maximum total sum possible from this state onward.\n\nOnce we compute the DP, we also need to reconstruct the path (the sequence of H and M choices) that leads to the maximum sum. For that, during the DP computation, we can track the choices made, or perform a separate backtracking step once the DP table is filled.\n\nBut since Python's recursion stack may not be sufficient for memoization (though for n=18, the maximum recursion depth is 2*18=36 steps, which is manageable), but using memoization via lru_cache is feasible.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that for memoization, the function needs to return the maximum sum, and then during the backtracking phase, we need to know which choice (H or M) was taken to reach that maximum. Therefore, the DP function can return the maximum sum, and then we can have a separate function for backtracking, which for each state (h, m) decides whether to take H or M based on which option gives the maximum sum.\n\nAlternatively, during the DP computation, we can store both the maximum value and the choice made (H or M) for each state. But that might complicate things. Another approach is to compute the DP table first, and then backtrack through the states, choosing at each step the option (H or M) that gives the maximum value.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Precompute pow10.\n\n- Compute the DP table with memoization.\n\n- Then, starting from (0, 0), for each step, decide whether to take H or M based on which choice gives a higher value.\n\nBut how to compute the DP?\n\nLet's think about implementing it recursively with memoization. Let's write a function max_sum(h, m) which returns the maximum sum possible from the state (h, m). \n\nThe base case is when h == n and m == n: return 0.\n\nOtherwise, the current digit is A[h + m], which is a character. We convert it to an integer, say d.\n\nIf we choose H (Homer takes the digit), then the contribution is d * pow10[n - h - 1], and then we add the result of max_sum(h + 1, m). But this is only allowed if h < n.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose M, the contribution is d * pow10[n - m - 1], and then add max_sum(h, m + 1), provided m < n.\n\nSo for each state, we need to evaluate both options (if possible) and take the maximum.\n\nBut how do we handle cases where one of the options is not possible? For example, when h == n, then we cannot choose H anymore, so we must choose M. Similarly for m == n.\n\nSo the code for the DP function would be:\n\ndef max_sum(h, m):\n\n    if h + m == 2n: return 0\n\n    if (h, m) is in memo: return memo[(h, m)]\n\n    current_digit = A[h + m]\n\n    d = int(current_digit)\n\n    option_h = -infinity\n\n    if h < n:\n\n        contribution = d * pow10[n - h - 1]\n\n        option_h = contribution + max_sum(h + 1, m)\n\n    option_m = -infinity\n\n    if m < n:\n\n        contribution = d * pow10[n - m - 1]\n\n        option_m = contribution + max_sum(h, m + 1)\n\n    result = max(option_h, option_m)\n\n    memo[(h, m)] = result\n\n    return result\n\nBut for the purposes of memoization, perhaps using memoization via a dictionary or a memo table would be better.\n\nBut in Python, for memoization, using lru_cache with a recursive function is convenient. However, since n can be up to 18, and the parameters h and m can be up to 18, the maximum number of states is 19*19 = 361, which is manageable.\n\nNow, once the DP is computed, we need to reconstruct the path. For that, we can start from (0, 0), and for each step, check which choice (H or M) gives the maximum sum. \n\nFor example, during the backtracking phase:\n\ncurrent_h = 0\n\ncurrent_m = 0\n\nresult = ''\n\nfor i in range(2n):\n\n    current_digit = A[current_h + current_m]\n\n    d = int(current_digit)\n\n    if current_h < n and current_m < n:\n\n        # need to check which option gives higher value\n\n        option_h = d * pow10[n - current_h - 1] + dp(current_h + 1, current_m)\n\n        option_m = d * pow10[n - current_m - 1] + dp(current_h, current_m + 1)\n\n        if option_h > option_m:\n\n            result += 'H'\n\n            current_h += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            result += 'M'\n\n            current_m += 1\n\n    elif current_h < n:\n\n        result += 'H'\n\n        current_h += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        result += 'M'\n\n        current_m += 1\n\nBut wait, the problem is that during the backtracking phase, how do we know which choice was taken? Because the DP function returns the maximum sum, but how do we know which option (H or M) was chosen? Well, during backtracking, for each state (h, m), we can compute the value of choosing H and choosing M, and compare them. If the maximum is achieved by H, then take H, else take M. \n\nBut how do we compute the value of choosing H and M again? Because during the DP phase, we already computed the maximum sum for each state. However, when backtracking, we need to recompute the options for each state. But that could be computationally feasible, since the number of states is small.\n\nBut wait, during the DP phase, the memoization already stores the maximum value for each state. However, during backtracking, when evaluating the options, we need to calculate the value of choosing H and M. But how?\n\nFor example, suppose we are at state (h, m). The maximum value is max(option_h, option_m). But during backtracking, we can compute option_h and option_m again, and check which is larger. However, this would require recomputing the same values again, which is redundant. However, since the number of states is small, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, during the DP phase, we can store not only the maximum value but also the choice (H or M) that was made. But that would require storing additional information. However, for the purposes of backtracking, it's easier to compute during the backtracking phase.\n\nBut how to compute the options again? Because the DP function is already memoized, perhaps we can call the DP function again. However, that's not necessary. Because the DP function for (h, m) returns the maximum of option_h and option_m. So during backtracking, for the current state (h, m), we can compute the value of option_h and option_m, and compare them. \n\nBut how to compute option_h and option_m? For option_h, it's the contribution of choosing H (d * pow10[...]) plus the DP value of (h+1, m). Similarly for option_m. \n\nBut during the backtracking phase, the DP table is already computed, so we can just look up the DP values. So for example, during backtracking, for state (h, m), the value of option_h is (d * pow10[...]) + dp[h+1][m], and similarly for option_m. \n\nSo during backtracking, we can compute these values and compare them. \n\nBut how to get the dp values? Well, during the DP phase, we can build a memoization table, perhaps as a 2D array. \n\nSo, perhaps the code can be structured as follows:\n\n- Precompute pow10.\n\n- Read n and A.\n\n- Precompute pow10 up to n.\n\n- Implement a memoization-based DP function to compute the maximum sum for each state.\n\n- Once the DP is computed, backtrack through the states to find the path.\n\nNow, for the implementation in Python, using memoization with lru_cache may be feasible. However, since the input size is small, even for n=18, the recursion depth is manageable.\n\nBut for the backtracking, we need to have access to the DP values. Alternatively, during the DP phase, we can compute a memo table, which is a 2D array (for h and m) storing the maximum sum for each state. \n\nSo, perhaps using memoization with a decorator is easier for the DP function, and then during backtracking, for each state, we can compute the options again. \n\nBut let's think about the code structure. Let's take the example input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n2\n\n1234\n\nSample Output: HHMM\n\nLet's see. For n=2, A is '1234'.\n\nThe steps are:\n\nInitially, h=0, m=0. The current digit is 1 (A[0]).\n\nOption H: contribute 1 * 10^(2-0-1) = 1 * 10^1 = 10. Then proceed with h=1, m=0.\n\nOption M: contribute 1 * 10^(2-0-1) = same 10? Wait no. Wait, when M takes the digit, it's added to her number. So for M, the contribution is 1 * 10^(n - m - 1). Here, m is 0. So 10^(2 - 0 - 1) = 10^1 = 10. So same as H. So in this case, both options give same contribution. But which choice leads to higher overall sum?\n\nWell, the DP function will choose the best path.\n\nBut the sample output is HHMM, which suggests that the first two moves are H, then M, then M. Let's see what happens.\n\nBut perhaps in the case where both options give same contribution, the choice between H and M can be arbitrary. However, the problem says that if there are multiple solutions, output any of them.\n\nBut for the code, during backtracking, when the options are equal, we can choose H or M as per some priority, like preferring H first.\n\nSo, the code for backtracking:\n\nStart with h=0, m=0.\n\nAt each step, check if h < n and m < n. If yes, compute the value of choosing H and M, and select the one with higher value. If equal, choose H (or M, but the problem allows any choice).\n\nBut how to compute the value of choosing H and M? For that, during backtracking, we need to calculate the contribution of choosing H and then the DP value of (h+1, m), and same for M.\n\nBut how do we get the DP values? Well, during the DP phase, the memoization function returns the maximum sum for each state. So during backtracking, for each state (h, m), the DP value is already computed.\n\nThus, during backtracking, for each state, the code can check the two options.\n\nBut how to implement this in code. Let's think about writing the DP as a memoized function, and then during backtracking, for each state, compute the options.\n\nNow, the problem is that in Python, the recursion with lru_cache may be possible, but for memoization, we need to use mutable data structures or something else. Alternatively, we can use memoization via a memo table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using memoization with lru_cache is easier. Let's try to outline the code.\n\nFirst, read n and A.\n\nThen, precompute pow10. For example, pow10 = [10**i for i in range(n)]? Wait, no. Because for n up to 18, the exponents for Homer's contribution can be up to n - 1 (when h is 0, then n - h -1 = 18 - 0 -1 = 17 for n=18). So pow10 should be precomputed up to n-1.\n\nSo pow10 = [10**i for i in range(0, n)] ?\n\nWait, for example, when Homer takes a digit when he has h steps already. The exponent is (n - h - 1). For h ranging from 0 to n-1. So the maximum exponent is n-1 - 0 -1? No, when h is 0, exponent is n - 0 - 1 = n-1. For n=18, that's 17. So pow10 needs to be up to 10^17. So precompute pow10 as [10^i for i in 0 ... n-1], but for exponents up to n-1. So pow10 = [10**i for i in range(n)] ?\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\nA = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\npow10 = [10**i for i in range(n)]\n\nBut wait, for n=18, the pow10 list will have elements up to 10^17, which is okay.\n\nBut for the DP function, the code would be:\n\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef dp(h, m):\n    if h + m == 2 * n:\n        return 0\n    current_pos = h + m\n    d = int(A[current_pos])\n    option_h = -1\n    option_m = -1\n    if h < n:\n        # Homer takes this digit\n        contribution = d * pow10[n - h - 1]\n        next_val = dp(h+1, m)\n        option_h = contribution + next_val\n    if m < n:\n        # Marge takes this digit\n        contribution = d * pow10[n - m - 1]\n        next_val = dp(h, m+1)\n        option_m = contribution + next_val\n    # Now choose the maximum\n    if option_h == -1:\n        return option_m\n    if option_m == -1:\n        return option_h\n    return max(option_h, option_m)\n\nWait, but how to handle cases where one of the options is not available (like when h == n, then option_h is not possible). The code above checks if h < n before trying to compute option_h. So in that case, option_h is set to -1 (but then, when h is already n, the code would have m < n, and option_m would be valid. So the code returns the correct value.\n\nBut in Python, the initial value of option_h and option_m is -1, which may be incorrect. Because for example, when h is 0 and m is 0, and the code computes option_h and option_m. But what if the contribution is negative? Well, since the digits are between 0 and 9, and the pow10 is positive, the contributions are non-negative. So the initial values of -1 are safe as they indicate that the option is invalid.\n\nBut perhaps initializing option_h and option_m to -infinity is better. However, in Python, we can use float('-inf').\n\nBut for the code, perhaps better to use:\n\noption_h = -infinity\n\noption_m = -infinity\n\nthen, if h < n:\n\n    compute option_h.\n\nsame for option_m.\n\nthen, the maximum between the two.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nBut in Python, for the function, perhaps:\n\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pow10 = [10**i for i in range(n)]\n    total_length = 2 * n\n\n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        if h + m == 2 * n:\n            return 0\n        current_pos = h + m\n        d = int(A[current_pos])\n        option_h = float('-inf')\n        option_m = float('-inf')\n        if h < n:\n            contribution = d * pow10[n - h - 1]\n            option_h = contribution + dp(h+1, m)\n        if m < n:\n            contribution = d * pow10[n - m - 1]\n            option_m = contribution + dp(h, m+1)\n        return max(option_h, option_m)\n\n    # Now, backtracking to find the path\n    # Start with h=0, m=0\n    h = 0\n    m = 0\n    result = []\n    for _ in range(2 * n):\n        current_pos = h + m\n        d = int(A[current_pos])\n        # Determine which choice to take\n        option_h_val = float('-inf')\n        option_m_val = float('-inf')\n        if h < n:\n            contribution = d * pow10[n - h - 1]\n            next_h = h + 1\n            next_m = m\n            option_h_val = contribution + dp(next_h, next_m)\n        if m < n:\n            contribution = d * pow10[n - m - 1]\n            next_h = h\n            next_m = m + 1\n            option_m_val = contribution + dp(next_h, next_m)\n        if option_h_val > option_m_val:\n            result.append('H')\n            h += 1\n        elif option_m_val > option_h_val:\n            result.append('M')\n            m += 1\n        else:\n            # choose H or M arbitrarily, say H\n            result.append('H')\n            h += 1\n    print(''.join(result))\n\nBut wait, this code has a problem. The dp function is called during the backtracking phase. However, during the backtracking phase, the dp function is already memoized, so it's okay. However, in the code above, during backtracking, the code recomputes the options again. But that's okay, since the dp function is memoized.\n\nBut what about when the code is called in the backtracking phase? For example, when the code is trying to compute option_h_val, which is contribution plus dp(next_h, next_m). But the dp function is already computed during the initial DP phase. So this is correct.\n\nBut there's a problem with the pow10 array. Because when n is 2, the pow10 array is [1, 10], but for exponents up to n - h - 1. For example, when h=0, the exponent is 2 - 0 -1 = 1, which is 10^1 = 10, which is in the pow10 array. For h=1, exponent is 2 - 1 -1 = 0, which is 10^0 = 1, which is in the array. So for n=2, the pow10 array is [1, 10], which is correct. So the pow10 array is correctly computed.\n\nBut wait, pow10 is generated as [10**i for i in range(n)], which for i from 0 to n-1. For example, for n=2, the exponents are 0 and 1. Which is correct. Because for Homer's contribution, the exponent is n - h -1, which ranges from (n - 0 -1) = n-1 down to (n - (n-1) -1) = 0. So the exponents are 0 to n-1, which are covered by the pow10 array. So this is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct. However, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n2\n\n1234\n\nSample Output: HHMM.\n\nLet's see what the code would generate.\n\nFor n=2, pow10 is [1, 10].\n\nThe dp function is called recursively.\n\nBut during backtracking, the code starts with h=0, m=0. Let's simulate the first step.\n\ncurrent_pos = 0, d = 1.\n\noption_h_val: h=0 < 2, contribution = 1 * pow10[2 - 0 -1] = 1 * pow10[1] = 10. Then call dp(1, 0).\n\nSimilarly, option_m_val: contribution is 1 * pow10[2 - 0 -1] = 10. Call dp(0, 1).\n\nWhich of these is larger?\n\nWe need to compute dp(1, 0) and dp(0, 1).\n\nLet's compute dp(1, 0):\n\nh=1, m=0. current_pos = 1 + 0 = 1. d = 2.\n\noption_h: h=1 < 2. contribution is 2 * pow10[2 - 1 -1] = 2 * pow10[0] = 2*1=2. Then call dp(2, 0). \n\ndp(2, 0): h=2, m=0. current_pos is 2+0=2. d=3. Now, h is 2 (equal to n=2). So can't take H. So option_m is allowed. contribution is 3 * pow10[2 - 0 -1] = 3 * 10^1 = 30. Then call dp(2, 1).\n\ndp(2, 1): current_pos = 3. d=4. h=2, m=1. current_pos is 3. h + m = 3, which is 2n=4? No, 2n is 4. So current_pos is 3. h=2, m=1. So h + m = 3 < 4. Now, h is already 2 (n=2), so can't take H. So take M. contribution is 4 * pow10[2 - 1 -1] = 4 * 10^0 =4. Then call dp(2, 2). dp(2,2) returns 0. So option_m_val is 4 + 0 =4. So dp(2,1) returns 4.\n\nSo back to dp(2,0): option_m is 30 + 4 = 34. So dp(2,0) returns 34. Thus, the option_h for dp(1,0) is 2 + 34 = 36.\n\nNow, for option_m in dp(1,0): m is 0 < 2. contribution is 2 * pow10[2 - 0 -1] = 2 * 10^1 = 20. Then call dp(1, 1).\n\nLet's compute dp(1,1). current_pos = 2. d=3. h=1, m=1. \n\noption_h: h < 2. contribution is 3 * pow10[2 -1 -1] = 3 * 10^0 = 3. Then call dp(2,1), which returns 4. So option_h is 3 +4 =7.\n\noption_m: m <2. contribution is 3 * pow10[2 -1 -1] = 3 * 1 =3. call dp(1, 2). \n\ndp(1,2): current_pos = 3. d=4. h=1, m=2. Now, h can be increased (h <2). So option_h is 4 * pow10[2 -1 -1] =4 *1 =4. call dp(2, 2) which returns 0. So option_h is 4. option_m is invalid (m=2 is n=2). So dp(1,2) returns 4. So option_m for dp(1,1) is 3 +4 =7. So max(7,7) is 7. So dp(1,1) returns 7.\n\nSo back to dp(1,0): option_m is 20 + 7 = 27. So the max between 36 and 27 is 36. So dp(1,0) returns 36.\n\nSo option_h_val for the initial step (h=0, m=0) is 10 + 36 =46.\n\nNow, compute option_m_val: contribution is 10 + dp(0,1).\n\nLet's compute dp(0,1). h=0, m=1. current_pos is 0+1=1. d=2.\n\noption_h: h <2. contribution is 2 * pow10[2 -0 -1] = 2*10^1 =20. call dp(1,1) which returns 7. So option_h is 20+7=27.\n\noption_m: m=1 <2. contribution is 2 * pow10[2 -1 -1] = 2*10^0=2. call dp(0,2). \n\ndp(0,2): current_pos = 0+2=2. d=3. h=0, m=2. Now, m is 2 (n=2). So can't take M. So must take H. contribution is 3 * pow10[2 -0 -1] = 3 * 10^1 =30. call dp(1, 2). Which returns 4. So option_h is 30 +4=34. So dp(0,2) returns 34. So option_m for dp(0,1) is 2 + 34=36. So max(27,36) is 36. So dp(0,1) returns 36. \n\nThus, option_m_val for",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize money is maximized when playing a game with a given number A consisting of 2n digits. Each player must make exactly n moves, taking turns to pick digits from the leftmost side of the number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a DP approach to explore all possible sequences of moves and determine the maximum total prize. The state of our DP function is defined by the number of moves each player has made so far (h for Homer and m for Marge).\n2. **Precompute Powers of 10**: Since the value of each digit depends on its position in the player's number, we precompute powers of 10 up to n to efficiently calculate the contribution of each digit.\n3. **Backtracking to Determine Moves**: After computing the maximum possible total prize using DP, we backtrack through the states to reconstruct the sequence of moves (H for Homer and M for Marge) that leads to this maximum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pow10 = [10**i for i in range(n)]\n    total_length = 2 * n\n\n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        if h + m == 2 * n:\n            return 0\n        current_pos = h + m\n        d = int(A[current_pos])\n        option_h = float('-inf')\n        option_m = float('-inf')\n        if h < n:\n            contribution = d * pow10[n - h - 1]\n            option_h = contribution + dp(h + 1, m)\n        if m < n:\n            contribution = d * pow10[n - m - 1]\n            option_m = contribution + dp(h, m + 1)\n        return max(option_h, option_m)\n\n    h = 0\n    m = 0\n    result = []\n    for _ in range(2 * n):\n        current_pos = h + m\n        d = int(A[current_pos])\n        option_h_val = float('-inf')\n        option_m_val = float('-inf')\n        if h < n:\n            contribution = d * pow10[n - h - 1]\n            next_h = h + 1\n            next_m = m\n            option_h_val = contribution + dp(next_h, next_m)\n        if m < n:\n            contribution = d * pow10[n - m - 1]\n            next_h = h\n            next_m = m + 1\n            option_m_val = contribution + dp(next_h, next_m)\n        if option_h_val > option_m_val:\n            result.append('H')\n            h += 1\n        elif option_m_val > option_h_val:\n            result.append('M')\n            m += 1\n        else:\n            # Choose 'H' arbitrarily when equal\n            result.append('H')\n            h += 1\n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Function (dp)**: This function calculates the maximum total prize from the current state (h, m). It recursively evaluates both possible moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit) and returns the maximum value.\n2. **Precompute Powers of 10**: The `pow10` array stores powers of 10 up to n, which helps in quickly calculating the contribution of each digit based on its position in the player's number.\n3. **Backtracking**: After computing the DP table, we backtrack from the initial state (0, 0) to determine the sequence of moves. At each step, we compare the contributions of both possible moves and choose the one that leads to the higher total prize, ensuring we maximize the sum.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible move sequences using dynamic programming and memoization, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of n = 18.",
