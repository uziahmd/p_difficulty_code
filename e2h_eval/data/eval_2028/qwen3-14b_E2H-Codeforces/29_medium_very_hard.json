Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where we have a string of digits and perform multiple substitution queries. Then compute the number modulo 1e9+7. The challenge is to handle these substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be large and substitutions can be applied in sequence.\n\nFirst, the straightforward approach would be to process each query by replacing all instances of di with ti in the string. But if the string is big and there are many queries, this could be very slow. For example, if the original string is 1e5 characters long and each query replaces a digit that appears many times, then doing this naively for each query would result in O(n * m) time where m is the length of the string, which might be too slow for the constraints given.\n\nSo, we need a smarter way. Let me think about how to model the substitutions. Since each substitution replaces a digit with another string, perhaps we can model this using some kind of dynamic programming or memoization approach, tracking for each digit what it expands to after all substitutions.\n\nBut the problem is that substitutions are applied in order. So, for example, if a query replaces '2' with '00', and then later replaces '0' with '1', then the first substitution's '0's would be replaced again. Therefore, we need to process the substitutions in the order they are given, and track for each digit what its current expansion is.\n\nWait, but if we process each substitution step by step, maybe we can represent for each digit (from 0-9) what the current expansion is. Let me think: initially, each digit d maps to itself. Then, when a substitution comes in, say d -> t, we need to update the mapping for d. But when we do that, any subsequent substitution that refers to d will use the new expansion. However, if a substitution is done for a digit that was previously substituted, we need to make sure that we track the current expansion.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think of it as a replacement rule. For example, suppose we have a mapping for each digit, where each digit's value is the string it expands to. Initially, for each digit d, the expansion is just [d]. Then, when a query comes in, say replace d with t, we set the expansion of d to t. However, when we process substitutions, we need to make sure that when we expand a digit, we use the current expansion rules. \n\nBut if we have a substitution that replaces d with t, and then later replace another digit e with something that includes d, then when we process the e substitution, we need to expand d according to the current expansion. So, the idea is that when processing substitutions, we should track the expansion of each digit as a function of the current state.\n\nBut how do we compute the final string? Well, if we can track for each digit, what it expands to, then the original string can be processed by expanding each character according to the current mappings. However, if we do this naively, for each query, we have to recompute the entire string, which would be O(n * len(s)) again, which is not feasible for large n and s.\n\nWait, but the problem requires us to process all the substitutions and then compute the final number mod 1e9+7. So perhaps we can model the transformations in a way that allows us to compute the final value without building the entire string.\n\nLet me think about the mathematical approach. Let's consider that each substitution can be represented as a transformation on the digits. For example, when a substitution replaces digit d with string t, then every occurrence of d in the current string is replaced by t. However, since substitutions are processed in order, each substitution may affect the future substitutions.\n\nBut since the final goal is to compute the numerical value mod 1e9+7, perhaps we can model the transformations using modular arithmetic, tracking for each digit what its contribution is when expanded.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that for each digit d, we can track a value that represents the number that d would expand to. For example, initially, each digit d maps to itself. If we have a substitution that replaces d with t, then the new value of d is the value of t. But t is a string of digits, which can be processed by expanding each of its characters according to their current mappings.\n\nWait, but if we can track for each digit d, the value of the expansion of d as a number mod MOD, and also track the length of the expansion (since when you append digits, the value depends on the length of the previous part). But that seems complicated. Let me think again.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose the original string is s, and we have a series of substitutions. Each substitution replaces a digit with a string. The final string is built by applying all substitutions in order. The problem is to compute the final number mod MOD.\n\nBut directly building the string is not feasible for large cases because the string can become exponentially long. For example, if each substitution replaces a digit with a string of length 2, and there are 20 substitutions, the length could be 2^20, which is way too big.\n\nTherefore, we need a way to compute the final value mod MOD without actually building the string. How can we do that?\n\nLet me think about the following approach: for each digit d, we track two values:\n\n- val[d]: the value of the expansion of d, mod MOD.\n- len[d]: the length of the expansion of d, mod (MOD-1), perhaps? Wait, why MOD-1?\n\nBecause when we compute the value of a number formed by appending a string, the value is (current_value * 10^len_new + new_value). However, since MOD is 1e9+7, which is a prime, and 10 and MOD are coprime, perhaps we can precompute powers of 10 mod MOD.\n\nBut for the exponent part, we need to compute 10^k mod MOD, where k is the length of the string being added. However, if we can track for each digit's expansion both the value and the length, then when we combine them, we can compute the new value.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a substitution that replaces digit d with a string t. Let's say that the expansion of t is value_t and length_t. Then, the expansion of d would be value_t and length_t. Now, if during processing, when we have a substitution that replaces another digit e with a string that includes d, then the expansion of e would be computed by combining the expansions of each digit in the substitution string.\n\nThis suggests that we can model each digit's expansion as a pair (value, length), and whenever a substitution is processed, we can compute the new (value, length) for that digit based on the substitution string.\n\nBut how do we compute the (value, length) for the substitution string? Let's think. Suppose the substitution string is t. To compute the value of t, we need to process each character in t, expanding them according to the current mappings. So, for example, if t is \"ab\", then the value of t is (value of a * 10^length_b + value of b) mod MOD, and the length is length_a + length_b.\n\nWait, yes. Because when you have a string formed by concatenating two strings, say A followed by B, the value is A * 10^{len(B)} + B. So, for each substitution string, we can compute its value and length by processing each character in the substitution string, and combining them with the existing (value, length) for each character.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nWe maintain for each digit d (0-9) two variables:\n\n- value_map[d]: the numeric value of expanding d, mod MOD.\n- length_map[d]: the length of the expansion of d.\n\nInitially, for each digit d, value_map[d] = d, and length_map[d] = 1.\n\nThen, for each query \"di -> ti\", we need to update the value_map and length_map for di. But how?\n\nThe substitution ti is a string. We need to compute the value and length of ti, considering that each character in ti is expanded according to the current value_map and length_map. Once we compute that, we set value_map[di] and length_map[di] to that computed value and length.\n\nOnce all queries are processed, we take the original string s, and for each character in s, we compute its contribution to the final value. Again, since the original string is a sequence of digits, each of which is expanded into their respective value and length. So, the total value is computed by combining each digit's expansion in sequence.\n\nSo for example, if the original string is s = s1 s2 s3 ... sn, then the total value is:\n\nvalue = 0\n\nfor each c in s:\n\n    value = value * 10^length_c + value_c\n\n    mod MOD\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nWe can precompute the powers of 10 mod MOD up to the maximum possible length. However, since the length can be very large (if substitutions expand the string a lot), we can't precompute all possible exponents. But we can compute them on the fly using modular exponentiation.\n\nWait, but when combining the digits, we need to compute for each step, the current value multiplied by 10^length of the next expansion, plus the next expansion's value. However, since the length of the expansion can be very large, we need to compute 10^length mod MOD for each step. However, since MOD is 1e9+7, which is a prime, and 10 and MOD are coprime, we can compute exponents using fast exponentiation.\n\nBut how do we handle this for each step?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose that the original string is s. For each character in s, we have a (value, length) pair. Let's process the original string from left to right, keeping track of the current value and the current length. For example:\n\ncurrent_value = 0\n\ncurrent_length = 0\n\nfor c in s:\n\n    (v, l) = get_value_and_length(c)\n\n    current_value = (current_value * pow(10, l, MOD) + v) % MOD\n\n    current_length += l\n\nBut wait, the current_length is not needed for the final value, but the pow(10, l, MOD) is needed for the next steps. However, the problem is that for each step, we need to compute 10^l mod MOD, where l is the length of the expansion of the current character. However, the length can be very large (like up to 1e5 * 1e5?), but we can compute pow(10, l, MOD) using the built-in pow function with three arguments, which is efficient.\n\nWait, but even for l up to 1e10, pow(10, l, MOD) can be computed in O(log l) time. So, for each character in the original string, we compute the exponent once, and proceed.\n\nBut how do we compute the value and length for each character in the original string?\n\nYes, because for each character in the original string, we can look up its value_map and length_map. So the steps are:\n\n- Initialize value_map and length_map for each digit.\n\n- Process each substitution query, updating the value_map and length_map for the corresponding digit.\n\n- After all queries, process the original string s, combining each character's value and length into the final value.\n\nNow, the key is how to process the substitution queries. For each substitution query, when replacing di with ti, we need to compute the value and length of ti, based on the current value_map and length_map of the digits in ti.\n\nSo, for example, if ti is \"abc\", then the value of ti is (value of a * 10^length_b + value of b) * 10^length_c + value of c. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf ti is a string of characters, say t1, t2, ..., tk. Then the value of ti is the value of the concatenation of the expansions of each t_i. So, the value is calculated as follows:\n\nstart with value = 0\n\nfor each character in ti:\n\n    value = value * 10^length_of_char + value_of_char\n\nSo, for example, if ti is \"ab\", then:\n\nvalue = (value of a) * 10^length_b + value of b.\n\nBut how do we compute this for ti? Well, we can process each character of ti in order, and for each step, compute the cumulative value and length. For example, for ti:\n\ncurrent_val = 0\n\ncurrent_len = 0\n\nfor c in ti:\n\n    (v, l) = value_map[c], length_map[c]\n\n    current_val = (current_val * pow(10, l, MOD) + v) % MOD\n\n    current_len += l\n\nThen, the value of ti is current_val and the length is current_len.\n\nSo, for each substitution query, when we have to replace di with ti, we compute the value and length of ti as above, and then set value_map[di] = current_val and length_map[di] = current_len.\n\nBut wait, this is only correct if during the processing of ti, we use the current value_map and length_map. Which is exactly what we need, because substitutions are processed in order. So, for example, if a previous substitution has already changed the mapping of some digits, then when processing ti, those mappings are used.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the steps for processing each substitution query are:\n\nGiven a query \"d -> t\":\n\n- Compute the value and length of the string t, using the current value_map and length_map for each character in t.\n\n- Set value_map[d] to this computed value.\n\n- Set length_map[d] to this computed length.\n\nBut how do we compute the value and length of t? As I said, for each character in t, we process them in order, accumulating the value and length.\n\nBut what about when t is empty? Then, the value is 0, and the length is 0. For example, if a substitution replaces '3' with empty string, then the value is 0 and length is 0. Then, when this substitution is applied, any occurrence of '3' in the original string would contribute nothing to the final value.\n\nSo, the code outline would be:\n\nInitialize value_map and length_map for each digit (0-9):\n\nvalue_map = [i for i in 0..9]\n\nlength_map = [1 for ...]\n\nThen, for each query:\n\nparse d and t.\n\ncompute the value and length of t:\n\ncurrent_val = 0\n\ncurrent_len = 0\n\nfor c in t:\n\n    v = value_map[int(c)]\n\n    l = length_map[int(c)]\n\n    current_val = (current_val * pow(10, l, MOD) + v) % MOD\n\n    current_len += l\n\nthen, set value_map[d] = current_val, length_map[d] = current_len.\n\nWait, but what about if t is empty? Then, the loop doesn't run, and current_val is 0, current_len is 0. So that's correct.\n\nOnce all queries are processed, we need to compute the value of the original string s. So, for each character in s, we process them in order, and accumulate the value.\n\nSo, initial current_val is 0, current_len is 0.\n\nfor c in s:\n\n    v = value_map[int(c)]\n\n    l = length_map[int(c)]\n\n    current_val = (current_val * pow(10, l, MOD) + v) % MOD\n\n    current_len += l\n\nBut wait, the current_len isn't needed except for the computation of the pow(10, l) for the next step. However, the current_val is the accumulated value of the entire string.\n\nWait, no. Because the current_val is the value of the concatenation of all the expansions of the characters so far. So, for example, if the first character is 'a', which expands to value v1 and length l1, then current_val is v1. Then, the second character 'b' expands to v2 and l2. The total value is v1 * 10^l2 + v2. And so on.\n\nYes. So the code for processing the original string is as described.\n\nBut the problem is that for each character in the original string, we need to compute pow(10, l, MOD), where l is the length of the expansion of that character. However, for each step, the l can be very large, but pow(10, l, MOD) can be computed efficiently with the built-in pow function in Python.\n\nBut wait, what is the maximum possible l? Let's think. The original string is up to 1e5 characters. Each substitution can add more characters. However, the sum of the lengths of ti across all queries is up to 1e5. However, the length of the expansion for each digit can be up to something like O( (sum ti lengths) * ... ), but in practice, when we track the length_map, it's stored as an integer. However, for pow(10, l, MOD), even if l is up to say 1e5 * 1e5, which is 1e10, the pow function in Python can handle that.\n\nBut in Python, pow(a, b, mod) is optimized and can handle large exponents efficiently.\n\nSo, the overall plan is feasible.\n\nNow, let's think about some edge cases.\n\nCase 1: The original string is empty. But according to the problem statement, the original string s has length at least 1.\n\nCase 2: Substitution replaces a digit with an empty string. For example, in the sample input, the third example: input is '222' with two queries: 2->0, then 0->7. So after first query, 2 is replaced with '0', then 0 is replaced with '7'. So the original string is 222. After first query, it becomes 000. Then, after second query, each 0 is replaced with 7. So the final string is 777, which mod 1e9+7 is 777.\n\nIn our approach, during the first substitution (2 -> 0), the value of '0' is 0, length is 1. So for the substitution, the value of '2' is computed as the value of '0', which is 0, length is 1. Then, the second substitution is 0 -> '7'. So the value of '0' is 7, length is 1. Then, when processing the original string, which is '222', each '2' is expanded to 0 (value) with length 1. But after the second substitution, the value of '0' is 7. So, during the processing of the original string, the code would process each '2' as follows:\n\nInitially, the value_map for '2' is 0 (from first substitution), and length is 1. But after the second substitution, the value_map for '0' is 7, length 1. However, the substitution for '2' was done before the substitution for '0', so the value_map for '2' is still 0 (the value of the string '0' at the time of substitution). But when the substitution for '0' occurs, the value_map for '0' is updated. However, the value_map for '2' was already computed as the value of '0' at that time, which was 0 (original value of '0' is 0, length 1). But after the substitution for '0', the value of '0' is now 7. However, the value of '2' remains as 0, which was computed based on the previous value of '0'.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because in the example, after the first substitution, the '2's are replaced with '0's. Then, when the second substitution replaces '0's with '7's, the '2's were already replaced with '0's. So, the original string is '222', which after first substitution becomes '000', then after second substitution becomes '777'.\n\nBut according to our approach, the value_map for '2' is 0 (the value of '0' at the time of substitution). But after the substitution of '0' to '7', the value of '0' is 7, but the value of '2' is still 0. However, when processing the original string, the '2's are expanded to their current value_map, which is 0. But that's incorrect, because after the substitution of '0' to '7', the '0's that were generated by the first substitution would be replaced. But according to our approach, the '2's are expanded to their current value, which is 0 (the value of '0' at the time of substitution). However, the '0's in the expansion of '2' would be replaced by the substitution of '0' to '7'.\n\nAh, here's the problem. Our approach does not account for the fact that the expansion of '2' is '0', which in turn may be substituted later. But according to the approach, the value_map for '2' is fixed once the substitution is processed. So, in the example, when the first substitution is processed (2 -> 0), the value of '2' is computed as the value of '0' at that time. At that time, '0' has value 0 and length 1. So, the value of '2' is 0, length 1. Then, when the substitution for '0' is processed (0 -> 7), the value of '0' is updated to 7 (value) and length 1. However, the value of '2' remains 0. But when the original string is processed, the '2's are expanded to their value_map, which is 0, but that's the value of the expansion of '0' at the time of substitution. However, in reality, the '0's in the expansion of '2' are now replaced with '7's.\n\nSo this approach is wrong. Oh no! What's the mistake here?\n\nThe mistake is that the approach assumes that the value_map and length_map for a digit d is the value and length of the expansion of d, considering all substitutions that have been processed so far. However, when a substitution replaces a digit d with a string that contains other digits, which may themselves be replaced in later substitutions, the approach is not capturing that. Because when we process the substitution for d, we compute the value of the string t, which is based on the current value_map and length_map. However, if in the future, some of the digits in t are replaced, then the value of d's expansion would not change, because the substitution for d was already processed. But in reality, when you process substitutions in order, replacing d with t, then later replacing some digits in t, the expansion of d should reflect those changes. But according to this approach, the expansion of d is fixed once it's processed. Which is incorrect.\n\nWait, but how? Let's take the example:\n\nOriginal substitution order:\n\nFirst, replace 2 with 0. Then, replace 0 with 7.\n\nIn the first substitution, when we process the query '2->0', we compute the value of '0' (which is 0, length 1). So the value of 2 is 0, length 1. Then, when we process the query '0->7', we compute the value of '7' (which is 7, length 1). So the value of 0 is now 7, length 1. However, the value of 2 is still 0. But when the original string is processed, the '2's are expanded to 0 (the value of 0 at the time of substitution). However, in reality, the 0's would have been replaced by 7's. So the approach is wrong.\n\nAh, this shows that the approach is flawed. Because the substitution for 2 is processed before the substitution for 0. When the substitution for 2 is processed, the expansion of 2 is set to the expansion of 0 at that time. However, when 0 is later substituted, the expansion of 2 is not updated. Thus, the approach is not capturing the fact that the expansion of 2 should be the expansion of 0, which may change in the future.\n\nThis is a critical flaw. How can we handle this?\n\nThe problem is that the substitution for d is fixed once processed. However, if a substitution replaces a digit that is part of the expansion of d, then the expansion of d would need to be recomputed. But in our approach, once the substitution for d is processed, it's not updated again. So, the approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So, what's the correct way to model this?\n\nAlternative idea: Instead of storing the value and length for each digit, we need to model the expansion of each digit as a function of the current substitution rules. However, this seems difficult.\n\nAnother approach: Since substitutions are processed in order, and each substitution replaces a digit with a string. The expansion of a digit is determined by all substitutions that have been applied to it. However, when a substitution replaces a digit d with a string t, the expansion of d is t. However, any future substitutions that affect digits in t would not affect the expansion of d, unless d is substituted again. Because once d is substituted, its expansion is fixed as t. Any future substitutions that modify other digits would not affect the expansion of d unless d is substituted again.\n\nWait, that's the case. Let's think again about the example:\n\nOriginal substitutions:\n\nFirst, substitute 2 with 0. So, any occurrence of 2 is replaced with 0. Then, substitute 0 with 7. So, any occurrence of 0 is replaced with 7. So, the original string 222 would be first replaced with 000, then replaced with 777.\n\nBut according to the approach, when we process the first substitution (2 -> 0), we compute the value of 0 (which is 0, length 1). So, the value of 2 is 0, length 1. Then, when we process the substitution of 0 -> 7, the value of 0 is updated to 7, length 1. However, the value of 2 remains 0. So, when we process the original string, the 2's are expanded to 0, which is the value of 0 at the time of substitution. But in reality, those 0's would be replaced by 7's. So the approach is missing this.\n\nSo why is this happening? Because when we substituted 2 with 0, we stored the value of 0 at that moment. However, later substitutions to 0 do not affect the value of 2, which was already substituted. This is incorrect because the substitution of 2 is supposed to replace it with the string 0, and then subsequent substitutions would replace that 0 with 7. So the expansion of 2 should be the expansion of 0 at the time of the substitution of 2, but that expansion may have changed later.\n\nWait no. The substitution is done in sequence. So the first substitution replaces all 2's with 0. Then, the second substitution replaces all 0's with 7. So, after both substitutions, the 2's are first replaced with 0's, then those 0's are replaced with 7's. So the expansion of 2 is the expansion of 0 after all substitutions. But in our approach, when we process the substitution of 2 with 0, we compute the expansion of 0 at that moment. However, after the substitution of 0 with 7, the expansion of 0 changes, but the expansion of 2 is not updated.\n\nSo the problem is that the substitution for 2 is fixed to the expansion of 0 at the time of substitution, not the current expansion. But in reality, when the substitution for 0 is processed, the expansion of 2 should be updated to reflect that 0 has changed. However, that's not the case.\n\nSo the approach of storing the value and length for each digit is incorrect because it does not account for future substitutions that may affect the expansion of digits in the substitution string.\n\nThis suggests that the initial approach is incorrect and needs to be revised.\n\nAlternative idea: Instead of storing the value and length for each digit, we need to represent the expansion of each digit as a function that can be evaluated dynamically. But this seems computationally expensive.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each substitution replaces a digit with a string, and the substitutions are applied in order. So, the expansion of a digit is determined by the substitutions applied to it. For example, if a digit d is substituted with t1, and later substituted with t2, then the final expansion of d is t2. However, if a substitution replaces d with a string that contains other digits, and those digits are later substituted, then the expansion of d would be the expansion of the string t1 with all substitutions applied.\n\nWait, but substitutions are applied in sequence. So, the first substitution replaces d with t1. Then, any subsequent substitutions replace other digits, but not d. So, when we process the original string, the expansion of d is t1, and any digits in t1 are expanded according to their current substitutions. But how can we track that?\n\nAh, this suggests that the substitution for d is not a fixed value, but rather, it's a reference to the current substitution rules. So, for example, if d is substituted with t, then during the expansion of d, each character in t is expanded according to the current substitution rules at the time of expansion. However, this would require that when we compute the value of the original string, we recursively expand each digit according to the latest substitution rules. But this would be computationally expensive if done naively.\n\nBut how can we model this efficiently?\n\nPerhaps, instead of precomputing the value and length for each digit, we can represent each substitution as a tree, and during the expansion of the original string, we evaluate the substitutions on the fly, using memoization to avoid redundant computations.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nLet me think of it as a memoization problem. For each digit d, we can have a function that returns the expanded string. But since the substitutions are applied in sequence, each substitution overwrites the previous substitution for that digit. So, for example, if we substitute d with t1, then later substitute d with t2, then the expansion of d is t2.\n\nHowever, when substituting d with t, the expansion of d is the expansion of the string t, with all substitutions applied up to that point. So, during the substitution processing, when we replace d with t, we need to compute the expansion of t, which involves expanding each character in t according to the current substitution rules.\n\nWait, this seems like a recursive approach. So, during substitution processing, for each query, when we replace d with t, we need to compute the expansion of t, which is done by expanding each character in t according to the current substitution rules. Then, we store this expansion as the new expansion for d.\n\nBut this would require that for each substitution, we compute the expansion of the substitution string t, which is a string that may contain digits that have their own substitutions. So, during the substitution processing, we can't precompute the value and length, but instead have to recursively expand the substitution string t.\n\nBut how to compute the value and length of the expanded string t, which may be very long?\n\nThis brings us back to the original problem of handling large expansions. However, if we can compute the value and length of the expanded string t without actually expanding it, then this approach could work.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think again. For each substitution query, we need to compute the value and length of the string t, which is the expansion of t according to the current substitution rules. To compute this, we can process each character in t, and for each character, recursively compute its expansion's value and length.\n\nBut this would be computationally intensive if done naively, but perhaps with memoization, it can be handled.\n\nBut how to compute the value and length of the expansion of a string t, given that substitutions may have been applied to the digits in t.\n\nLet me try to formalize this:\n\nDefine for each digit d, a function expand(d) that returns the expanded string. But since this can be very long, we cannot store it directly. Instead, we need to compute the value and length of the expansion of d.\n\nBut for the purpose of computing the value and length, we can define for each digit d, two values: val[d] and len[d], which represent the value and length of the expansion of d, considering all substitutions applied up to now.\n\nWhen a substitution is applied to d, we need to compute the val and len of the substitution string t, which involves expanding each character in t.\n\nSo, during substitution processing, for the query \"d -> t\", we compute the val and len of the expansion of t, which is done by processing each character in t, and for each character c, using the current val[c] and len[c].\n\nThis is exactly what the initial approach did. But the problem in the earlier example is that when we later substitute another digit (say 0), the val and len for d (which was substituted earlier) are not updated. However, in the example, the substitution for d=2 was done with t=0, which at that time had val[0]=0 and len[0]=1. Then, later, when 0 is substituted with t=7, the val[0] is updated to 7 and len[0] is 1. However, the val[2] is still 0 and len[2] is 1. But when the original string is processed, the expansion of 2 is val[2] = 0, which represents the expansion of '0' at the time of substitution. However, in reality, the substitution of 0 has changed, and the expansion of 2 should now be the expansion of '0' after all substitutions. But according to the initial approach, it is not.\n\nAh, this indicates that the initial approach is incorrect. But why? Because the substitution of 2 is fixed to the expansion of '0' at the time of substitution. But if '0' is later substituted, the expansion of '0' changes, but the expansion of 2 is not updated. This suggests that the initial approach is not capturing the fact that substitutions can affect other substitutions.\n\nSo, the core issue is that the substitution for d is stored as a fixed value, but in reality, it should be a dynamic value that depends on the current state of substitutions for the digits in its substitution string.\n\nSo, how can this be modeled? Perhaps the answer is that the initial approach is correct, but the example analysis was wrong.\n\nLet me re-examine the example:\n\nOriginal substitution order:\n\n1. 2 -> 0\n\nAt this point, the substitution for 2 is '0'. To compute val[2] and len[2], we need to compute the expansion of '0' at this moment. At this moment, val[0] is 0, len[0] is 1. So val[2] = 0, len[2] = 1.\n\nThen, substitution 2 -> 0 is done, and the next substitution is 0 -> 7.\n\nNow, when processing the substitution 0 -> 7, we compute the expansion of '7', which is val[7] = 7, len[7] = 1. So val[0] is set to 7, len[0] is 1.\n\nNow, the original string is '222'. When processing this string, each '2' is expanded to val[2] = 0, len[2] = 1. But according to the substitution rules, the '2's are replaced with '0's, and then those '0's are replaced with '7's. So the final expansion is '777', which has value 777 mod MOD.\n\nBut according to the initial approach, the val[2] is 0 and len[2] is 1. So, when processing the original string, the calculation would be:\n\ncurrent_val starts at 0.\n\nFirst '2' contributes 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0? No, let me re-calculate:\n\nWait, the initial current_val is 0. For each character in the original string, which is '2', we have:\n\nv = val[2] = 0, l = len[2] = 1.\n\ncurrent_val = (current_val * pow(10, l, MOD) + v) % MOD\n\nSo, initial current_val is 0.\n\nAfter first '2':\n\ncurrent_val = (0 * 10^1 + 0) mod MOD = 0.\n\nThen, the second '2' is processed:\n\ncurrent_val = (0 * 10^1 + 0) = 0.\n\nThird '2' is processed similarly, resulting in current_val = 0. Which is clearly incorrect. But the actual value should be 777.\n\nSo the initial approach gives the wrong answer in this case. Hence, the approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, what's wrong here? It seems that the approach assumes that the val and len for a digit d represents the expansion of d after all substitutions, but in reality, when substitutions are applied to other digits that appear in the substitution string of d, the val and len of d should be updated.\n\nBut how can this be handled?\n\nAlternative idea: Each substitution replaces the expansion of d with the current expansion of the substitution string t. But the expansion of t is computed at the moment of substitution. So, if later substitutions change the expansion of digits in t, the expansion of d is not affected. But this is not correct, because in the example, the substitution of d=2 with t='0' should mean that the expansion of d=2 is the expansion of '0' at the moment of substitution, and if later",
