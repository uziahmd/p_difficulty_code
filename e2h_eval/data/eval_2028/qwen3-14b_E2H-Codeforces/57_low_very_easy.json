His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on the given points from two tours. The problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. But how do I model this?\n\nFirst, the best possible rank. For that, I want to maximize Vasya's total points. Because if he has the highest possible sum, he can be first. But how do I find the maximum possible sum he can have? Well, since the teacher knows that there's some i and j where a_i + b_j >=x, but for the best case, we can choose the maximum possible a_i + b_j. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. But in reality, Vasya's actual total could be any value that's >=x. However, the problem says that the teacher needs to find the best and worst possible positions considering all possibilities where Vasya's total is at least x. So for the best possible rank, we need to assume that Vasya's total is as high as possible (so that he can be ranked higher). But how?\n\nWait, no. Because the actual total of Vasya is not known. But the teacher knows that it's at least x. So when trying to find the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya's total is the maximum possible. Because that would allow him to be as high as possible.\n\nWait, but how do we find what's the maximum possible total for Vasya? Since the problem says that there exists some i and j such that a_i + b_j >=x. But for the best case, we can choose the maximum possible a_i + b_j. Because that would give the best possible position for Vasya. So for the best possible rank, we need to consider the scenario where Vasya's total is the maximum possible sum of a_i + b_j. Then, compare that with others.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour, but they are in arbitrary order. So for each participant, their first tour and second tour points are paired. But the problem says that the teacher has to find the best and worst possible places for Vasya, given that there exists some pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x. But for the best case, we can assume that Vasya's total is the maximum possible (so that he can be first). For the worst case, we need to assume that his total is the minimum possible (but still >=x), and arrange the other participants' totals such that as many as possible have higher totals than him.\n\nWait, but how to model this. Let me think again.\n\nThe key here is that the actual pairing of a_i and b_j for the participants is unknown. So for the best possible rank, we can imagine that Vasya's a_i and b_j are chosen such that a_i + b_j is as high as possible, and then count how many participants can have a higher sum. But how?\n\nWait, no. Because the participants are already paired. The problem states that each participant has a first tour and second tour score. But the teacher has the first and second tour scores in arbitrary order. So the actual pairs are not known. But the problem says that Vasya is one of the participants. So for example, the teacher knows that there exists some i and j (possibly same index?) such that a_i + b_j >=x. But for the purpose of calculating the best and worst possible rank, we can choose the best possible pairing for Vasya, and the worst possible pairing for Vasya.\n\nWait, no. Because the actual pairing is fixed. But the teacher doesn't know which a_i and b_j belong to Vasya. So the problem is to find the best and worst possible rank Vasya could have, given that there exists some pairing (i,j) for him where a_i + b_j >=x. But the rest of the participants are paired in some way, but the teacher doesn't know which.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe teacher has the results of the first and second tour, but the problem is that the results have only points, no names. So for example, the first tour's list is a1, a2,... an, and the second tour's list is b1, b2,... bn. But these are not paired. Each participant has a first tour and a second tour score. But the teacher doesn't know which a_i belongs to which b_j. So the actual pairs are unknown. However, it's guaranteed that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x (this is Vasya's total, but the teacher doesn't know which pair is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The teacher has the results of both tours but not the pairing of participants between the two tours.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: To find the best possible rank for Vasya, we assume that he has the highest possible total score. This is done by considering the maximum sum of any pair (a_i, b_j) where a_i is from the first tour and b_j is from the second tour. We then count how many participants can have a higher total score than this maximum value.\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To find the worst possible rank, we consider the minimum possible total score that is still at least x. This is done by considering the minimum sum of any pair (a_i, b_j) that is at least x. We then count how many participants can have a higher total score than this minimum value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    first_line = input[idx].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    x = int(first_line[1])\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    \n    # For best place: find max possible sum of a_i + b_j\n    # To maximize, take max a and max b\n    max_a = max(a)\n    max_b = max(b)\n    best_sum = max_a + max_b\n    \n    # Count how many participants have sum > best_sum\n    # To do this, we need to consider all possible pairs\n    # But since we want the minimal number of people with sum > best_sum, we can use a greedy approach\n    # Sort a in descending order, sort b in ascending order, then pair them to minimize the number of sums > best_sum\n    # Wait, no. For the best case, we want as few people as possible to have sum > Vasya's sum.\n    # So for the best case, we can arrange the pairs such that as many as possible have sum <= best_sum.\n    # But how to compute the number of participants whose sum can be greater than best_sum?\n    # Actually, the best_sum is the maximum possible. So no one can have a sum higher than that. Therefore, the best rank is 1.\n    # Wait, but that's not correct. Because other participants might have a_i + b_j that is equal or higher than best_sum.\n    # No. Because best_sum is the maximum possible sum of a_i + b_j. So no other participant can have a higher sum. Hence, the best possible rank is 1.\n    # So the best rank is always 1? That seems to contradict the example given.\n    # Wait the first example input:\n    # 5 2\n    # 1 1 1 1 1\n    # 1 1 1 1 1\n    # All pairs sum to 2. So the best possible rank is 1, and the worst is 5. Which matches the sample output.\n    # So the best rank is 1, because in the best scenario, Vasya has the maximum possible sum, and others can't have more than that.\n    # So best rank is always 1.\n\n    # Wait, but what if there are multiple participants with the same sum as Vasya's maximum? Then the best rank is 1, but the worst depends on how many have the same.\n    # However, according to the problem statement, if participants have the same sum, the jury can assign the ranks as they choose. So for the best case, Vasya can be first even if others have same sum.\n\n    # Therefore, the best possible rank is always 1.\n\n    # Now for the worst possible rank: we need to find the minimal possible sum that is >=x, and then count how many participants can have a sum strictly greater than that minimal sum.\n\n    # To find the minimal possible sum that is >=x, we need to find the minimal sum s >=x, such that there exists a_i and b_j with a_i + b_j = s.\n    # However, to find the worst case, we need to assume that Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), and then count how many participants can have sum > s.\n\n    # To find the minimal possible s >=x, we can look for the minimal possible sum that is >=x. However, since the actual pairing is unknown, we need to consider the minimal possible s >=x that can be formed by a_i + b_j.\n\n    # Wait, but for the worst case, we want to choose the minimal possible s (>=x) for Vasya. Then, the worst possible rank is determined by how many participants can have sum > s.\n\n    # How to find the minimal s >=x? It's the minimal value in the set {a_i + b_j | i,j} that is >=x. But since we can choose any pair for Vasya, we can take the minimal possible sum that is >=x.\n\n    # So, to find the minimal s >=x, we can take the minimal a_i + b_j that is >=x. But how?\n\n    # Let me think. For the worst case, we want Vasya's sum to be as low as possible (but still >=x), so that as many other participants as possible can have a higher sum than him.\n\n    # To find the minimal s >=x, we can consider the minimal sum that is >=x. So, we can find the minimal value s such that s >=x and there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j = s.\n\n    # But how to find this s? Well, the minimal s is the minimal value in the sorted list of all possible a_i + b_j that are >=x. But considering that for the worst case, we can choose the minimal possible s >=x.\n\n    # However, calculating all possible pairs is O(n^2), which is not feasible for n up to 1e5.\n\n    # So we need a better way. Here's the key insight:\n\n    # For the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal possible sum s (>=x) that Vasya could have. Then, the worst rank is the number of participants that can have a sum strictly greater than s plus 1.\n\n    # To find the minimal s >=x, we can take the minimal value of a_i + b_j that is >=x. But how to find this?\n\n    # We can sort a and b. Then, for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then take the minimal among all these values.\n\n    # Alternatively, we can find the minimal s by using a two-pointer approach.\n\n    # Let's sort a in ascending order and b in descending order. Then, for each a_i, we can find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. The minimal s is the minimal among all such a_i + b_j.\n\n    # Wait, but perhaps there's a better way. For the worst case, we want to find the minimal possible s >=x. To do this, we can sort a and b, and for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then the minimal s is the minimal of all such a_i + b_j.\n\n    # However, to find this efficiently, let's sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order. Then for each a_i, we can use binary search to find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then the minimal s is the minimal of all those a_i + b_j.\n\n    # Once we have this minimal s, we need to count how many participants can have a sum > s. To find this, we need to find the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can have a sum > s.\n\n    # Wait, but how to count the maximum number of participants that can have a sum > s. Because for the worst case, we want as many as possible participants to have sum > s.\n\n    # To find the maximum number of participants that can have sum > s, we can pair the largest elements of a with the largest elements of b. Because that maximizes the number of pairs with high sums.\n\n    # So the approach is:\n\n    # 1. Find the minimal possible s >=x (for the worst case).\n    # 2. Count the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can have a sum > s. This is done by sorting a in descending order and b in descending order, then pairing them, and counting how many pairs have sum > s.\n\n    # Let's implement this step by step.\n\n    # Step 1: Find the minimal s >=x.\n    # Sort a and b in ascending order.\n    # For each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x.

Keep track of the minimal s_candidate.\n\n    # But for efficiency, let's proceed as follows:\n\n    # Sort a in ascending order, and b in ascending order.\n\n    # Initialize min_s to a very large value.\n\n    # For each a_i in a:\n    #   find the smallest index j in b where b[j] >= x - a_i. If found, then s_candidate = a_i + b[j]. Compare to min_s.\n\n    # However, for the minimal s >=x, we need to find the minimal possible a_i + b_j >=x. So for each a_i, find the minimal b_j that when added to a_i gives >=x. Then take the minimal across all such candidates.\n\n    # Let's proceed with this.\n\n    # Sort a and b in ascending order.\n\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n\n    min_s = float('inf')\n\n    # For each a_i, find the minimal b_j >= (x - a_i)\n    # Using binary search for each a_i\n    import bisect\n    for ai in a_sorted:\n        target = x - ai\n        # find the first b_j >= target\n        j = bisect.bisect_left(b_sorted, target)\n        if j < len(b_sorted):\n            candidate = ai + b_sorted[j]\n            if candidate < min_s:\n                min_s = candidate\n    # Also check if there is any pair that sums to exactly x, but that's already covered.\n\n    # Now, once we have min_s, we need to find the maximum number of pairs that can have sum > min_s.\n\n    # To find the maximum number of participants that can have sum > min_s, we sort a in descending order and b in descending order, and pair the largest a with largest b, etc., and count how many pairs have a_i + b_j > min_s.\n\n    # Sort a in descending order, b in descending order.\n\n    a_desc = sorted(a, reverse=True)\n    b_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n\n    count = 0\n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    while i < n and j < n:\n        if a_desc[i] + b_desc[j] > min_s:\n            count += 1\n            i += 1\n            j += 1\n        elif a_desc[i] > b_desc[j]:\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            j += 1\n\n    # The worst rank is count + 1.\n\n    # But wait, in the case where min_s is not found? But the problem says that it is guaranteed that there exists a pair with sum >=x.\n\n    # So the best rank is always 1.\n\n    print(1, count + 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
