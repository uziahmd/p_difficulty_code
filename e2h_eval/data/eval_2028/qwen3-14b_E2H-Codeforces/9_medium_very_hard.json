Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to maximize the total cost of souvenirs he can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Hmm.\n\nSo the classic knapsack problem, but with weights limited to 1, 2, 3. Oh right, because for large n and m, the standard DP approach (O(nm)) would be too slow. For example, if n is 1e5 and m is 3e5, then O(nm) would be 3e10 operations, which is way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think. Since the weights are small (only 1, 2, 3), maybe we can process each weight group separately and find an optimal way to combine them.\n\nFirst, let's separate the items into three groups: those with weight 1, 2, 3. For each group, we can sort them in descending order of cost. Then, for each group, we can compute a prefix sum array. This way, for any number of items taken from that group, we can quickly get the maximum cost.\n\nFor example, for weight 1 items, sorted in descending order, the prefix sum array will tell us the maximum cost if we take k items of weight 1. Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nOnce we have these prefix sums, the problem becomes how to choose how many items from each group to take such that the total weight is <= m, and the total cost is maximized.\n\nBut how do we combine them efficiently?\n\nLet me think about possible approaches.\n\nSuppose we have:\n\n- For weight 1: a list of sorted items, prefix sums s1[k] = sum of first k items.\n- For weight 2: same, s2[k].\n- For weight 3: same, s3[k].\n\nThe total weight for taking x items of weight 1, y items of weight 2, z items of weight 3 is w = x*1 + y*2 + z*3 <= m.\n\nWe need to maximize the total cost: s1[x] + s2[y] + s3[z].\n\nBut considering all possible x, y, z combinations is O(n^3), which is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: since the weight is small, perhaps we can iterate over one of the variables and compute the others optimally.\n\nFor example, for each possible number of weight 3 items (z), we can calculate how much weight is left (m - 3*z) and then find the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items within that remaining weight.\n\nBut even that might be expensive if z can be up to m/3, which for m=3e5 is 1e5. Then for each z, solving the 1 and 2 problem. But maybe that's manageable.\n\nLet me think about the 1 and 2 case. Suppose we have a certain capacity left, say W. How to choose x and y such that x + 2y <= W, and maximize s1[x] + s2[y].\n\nHow can we compute this efficiently?\n\nAnother approach: for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible total weight (up to m) the maximum value. But again, for m up to 3e5, that's O(m) time.\n\nWait, but perhaps for the weight 1 and 2 case, we can find an optimal way by considering that for a given number of weight 2 items, we can take as many weight 1 items as possible.\n\nAlternatively, here's a trick: For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible number of weight 2 items, the maximum possible number of weight 1 items that can fit.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Let's suppose that we have sorted all weight 1 items in descending order, and same for weight 2. Let's say we have prefix sums for both.\n\nLet me denote the number of weight 1 items as a, and weight 2 as b.\n\nNow, for each possible number of weight 2 items (say, y), the maximum number of weight 1 items we can take is x = min( (W - 2*y), a). But since W can be up to m, and y can be up to min(b, W//2), this would take O(b) time for each W.\n\nBut if we have to do this for each possible z (number of weight 3 items), then it's O(m) * O(b) time, which could be expensive.\n\nWait, but if we can find for each possible W, the maximum value of s1[x] + s2[y], where x + 2y <= W, then perhaps we can compute this once, and then use it when considering the weight 3 items.\n\nSo let's split the problem into two parts:\n\n1. Preprocess the weight 1 and 2 items to compute for each possible weight capacity (from 0 to m) the maximum value achievable using only those items.\n\n2. Then, for each possible number of weight 3 items (z), compute the remaining capacity (rem = m - 3*z). Then, add the maximum value from step 1 for rem, plus the value of taking z items of weight 3. Then take the maximum over all possible z.\n\nBut how to compute step 1 efficiently.\n\nLet me think about step 1. How to compute for each possible capacity W, the maximum value using weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nLet me consider that for a given W, the optimal selection is to take some number of weight 2 items (y), and then take as many weight 1 items as possible (x = W - 2y).\n\nBut since the weight 1 items are sorted in descending order, taking the first x of them gives maximum value.\n\nBut how to find the best y for each W?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible number of weight 2 items (y), the maximum possible weight allowed for weight 1 is (W - 2y). However, y can't exceed the total number of weight 2 items available (let's call it b), and also 2y can't exceed W.\n\nSo for each W, the maximum value is max over y (s2[y] + s1[ min( (W - 2y), a ) ] )\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for all W?\n\nBut since W can be up to m (3e5), and for each W, we need to check all possible y's up to min( (W//2), b ), which could be O(W) per W, leading to O(m^2) time. Which is way too slow.\n\nHmm, but maybe there's a better way. Let's think about the following:\n\nWe can precompute for the weight 2 items their prefix sums. Then for any given W, the best combination between weight 1 and 2 items can be found by considering that for each possible number of weight 2 items (y), we can take up to (W - 2y) weight 1 items. But since the weight 1 items are sorted, taking as many as possible gives the maximum value.\n\nBut perhaps for each W, the optimal y is either floor(W/2) or something similar. Alternatively, for each possible y, the maximum x is W - 2y, but we can't take more than the available weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to find the best y quickly?\n\nAnother idea: Let's precompute the prefix sums for weight 1 and 2. Let's say we have s1 and s2.\n\nThen for any given W, the maximum value is the maximum of s2[y] + s1[ min( (W - 2y), len(s1) ) ] for all y such that 2y <= W and y <= len(s2).\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the possible range of y. For a given W, y can be from 0 to min( W//2, len(s2) ). Let's call this range [0, Y_max]. For each possible y in this range, we can compute the corresponding x as min( W - 2y, len(s1) ), and then the value is s2[y] + s1[x].\n\nNow, if we can find the maximum of this expression for y in [0, Y_max], then that's the answer for that W.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum quickly for all W?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible W, we can iterate y from 0 to min(Y_max, len(s2)), but this is O(W) per W, which is O(m^2) total time. Not feasible.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to find the optimal y for each W in O(1) or O(log n) time.\n\nLet me think about the function f(y) = s2[y] + s1[ min( W - 2y, a ) ], where a is the number of weight 1 items.\n\nBut since s1 is non-decreasing (since we sorted the items in descending order and took prefix sums), then for a fixed W, the term min(W - 2y, a) is the maximum number of weight 1 items we can take, given that we take y weight 2 items. So for each y, the value is s2[y] plus the maximum possible s1 for the remaining weight.\n\nBut how can we find the best y?\n\nLet me imagine that we can take up to Y_max = min( W // 2, len(s2) ) weight 2 items. For each possible y, the remaining weight after taking y weight 2 items is W - 2y. The maximum number of weight 1 items is then x = min( W - 2y, len(s1) ). So the value is s2[y] + s1[x].\n\nNow, since s1 is non-decreasing, and for a fixed W, as y increases, 2y increases, so W - 2y decreases. Thus, x decreases as y increases.\n\nBut how does the sum s2[y] + s1[x] behave? It's possible that increasing y increases s2[y] but decreases s1[x], and vice versa. So there might be a peak somewhere.\n\nBut how to find that peak quickly?\n\nAlternatively, for a given W, we can try to find the optimal y in the range [0, Y_max]. Since Y_max can be up to W//2, which for W up to 3e5 is 1.5e5, but for each W, this would be O(Y_max) time, which again is O(m^2) total time. Not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps for the problem, since the weight is only 1, 2, 3, and the total number of items for each weight is up to n (which is 1e5), maybe we can find a way to compute this for all possible W in O(m) time.\n\nWait, but what if we precompute for all possible numbers of weight 2 items and then for each possible W, find the best combination?\n\nAlternatively, here's another idea. For the weight 1 and 2 items, the optimal selection can be found by considering that for each possible number of weight 2 items, we take as many as possible of them, and then fill the rest with weight 1 items. However, since the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, taking more of them might be better, but perhaps not always.\n\nWait, but maybe for each possible total weight W, the optimal way is to take as many weight 2 items as possible, and then fill with weight 1 items. But that's not necessarily the case. For example, if a weight 2 item has a lower value than two weight 1 items, then taking two weight 1 items would be better.\n\nBut since we sorted the weight 1 items in descending order and the weight 2 items in descending order, perhaps the optimal is to take as many weight 2 items as possible, but considering that for each weight 2 item, it's better than two weight 1 items. But how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, for each weight 2 item, compare its value with the sum of two weight 1 items. If the weight 2 item's value is higher than two weight 1 items, then take it. Otherwise, take the two weight 1 items. But this seems like a greedy approach.\n\nBut how to apply this in practice?\n\nLet me think. Let's say that we have the weight 1 items sorted in descending order, and the same for weight 2. Then, for the weight 2 items, we can compare each with two weight 1 items. For example, for the first weight 2 item, compare its value with the sum of the first two weight 1 items. If it's higher, take it. Else, take the two weight 1 items. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, here's a way to merge the weight 1 and 2 items into a single list, but that's probably not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that for the weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum value for a given capacity W can be computed by considering two possibilities:\n\n1. Take as many weight 2 items as possible, then fill with weight 1.\n\n2. Take one less weight 2 item, and fill with weight 1 items.\n\nBut this is not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible W, the optimal number of weight 2 items is around W//2, and we can check a few possibilities around that.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, perhaps for each possible number of weight 2 items y, we can compute the maximum x (number of weight 1 items) as min(W - 2y, a), and then for each W, we can iterate y from max(0, Y_max - K) to Y_max, where K is a small constant (like 100). This would allow us to find the optimal y quickly, assuming that the optimal y is near Y_max.\n\nBut how to choose K? Well, for example, if the optimal y is near Y_max, then checking a few possibilities around that would work. But this is a heuristic and may not work for all cases.\n\nBut given that the problem constraints are tight, perhaps this is a viable approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the following:\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible number of weight 2 items y, the maximum number of weight 1 items x that can be taken given a capacity W. But since W can vary, this seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can create a combined DP array. Let's say dp[w] is the maximum value for capacity w using only weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nThe standard knapsack approach would be:\n\nInitialize dp[0] = 0.\n\nFor each item in weight 1 or 2:\n\n   for w from m downto wi:\n\n      dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w - wi] + ci)\n\nBut with m up to 3e5 and n up to 1e5, this would be O(nm) time, which is again 3e10 operations. Not feasible.\n\nBut since the weights are only 1 and 2, maybe we can optimize this.\n\nLet me think. For weight 1 items, since they are all weight 1, we can take as many as possible. For example, if we have a sorted list of weight 1 items, then for any capacity w, the maximum value is the sum of the first min(w, len(weight1)) items.\n\nSimilarly, for weight 2 items, if we have a sorted list, then for a capacity w, the maximum number of weight 2 items is min(w//2, len(weight2)), and their sum is s2[y], and then the remaining capacity can be filled with weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to combine these two.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For each possible capacity w, the maximum value is the maximum between:\n\n- Taking y weight 2 items and filling the rest with weight 1 items, for all possible y.\n\nBut since y can be up to min(w//2, len(weight2)), and for each y, the remaining capacity is w - 2y, which can be filled with up to (w - 2y) weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to find the best y quickly?\n\nIf we can find for each w, the optimal y, then we can compute the maximum value.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think for a given w. Let's say that the maximum number of weight 2 items we can take is y_max = min( (w//2), len(s2) ). For each possible y in 0 to y_max, the value is s2[y] + s1[ min( (w - 2y), len(s1) ) ].\n\nBut for each w, trying all possible y's is O(y_max) per w, which is O(m^2) overall.\n\nBut maybe we can find that for a given w, the optimal y is either floor(w/2) or floor(w/2) - 1, etc., and check those possibilities. Because for the best combination, the number of weight 2 items is close to the maximum possible.\n\nAlternatively, for each w, we can check the possible y's in the vicinity of y_max and possibly y_max - 1, etc. For example, check up to 200 possibilities around y_max. This would be O(m * 200) time, which is acceptable for m up to 3e5.\n\nBut how to determine how many possibilities to check?\n\nWell, given that the weight 1 items are sorted, the value of s1[...] increases as the number of items increases. So for a given y, the term (w - 2y) is the remaining capacity for weight 1 items. As y increases, this decreases, but s2[y] increases. So there's a trade-off.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal y is around the point where the marginal gain of adding a weight 2 item is higher than the loss of weight 1 items.\n\nBut without knowing the exact values, it's hard to find that point.\n\nBut for practical purposes, perhaps checking a few hundred possibilities around y_max would suffice.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have for a given w, y_max is the maximum number of weight 2 items possible. We can check y from max(0, y_max - 200) to y_max. For each of these y's, compute the value and take the maximum. Since for each w, this is O(200) operations, and for m up to 3e5, this would be 6e7 operations, which is manageable in Python.\n\nBut why would this work? Because if the optimal y is not in this range, then perhaps the difference between the optimal and the checked values is negligible, but I'm not sure. However, given that the weight 1 items are sorted and the weight 2 items are sorted, maybe the optimal y is near the maximum possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal y is either the maximum possible y, or the maximum possible y minus k, where k is the number of weight 2 items that are worse than two weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the following. For each possible y, the value is s2[y] + s1[ min(w - 2y, a) ]. Now, since s1 is non-decreasing, the term min(w - 2y, a) is non-increasing as y increases. So, the value of s1[...] is non-increasing as y increases. But s2[y] is non-decreasing as y increases. So the sum is a combination of a non-decreasing and a non-increasing function. Therefore, the maximum is achieved at some particular y, and the function may have a single peak.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each w, we can perform a ternary search on y in the range [0, y_max], since the function is unimodal. But is it unimodal?\n\nHmm. Let's imagine that for a given w, the function f(y) = s2[y] + s1[ min(w - 2y, a) ].\n\nAs y increases, s2[y] increases, and the term min(w - 2y, a) decreases. So the function could be unimodal, but not necessarily. However, for the purpose of optimization, even if it's not strictly unimodal, ternary search might find a good enough maximum.\n\nBut implementing ternary search for each w could be feasible.\n\nBut how to implement this. For each w, we can perform a ternary search on y in the range [0, y_max], and find the maximum f(y). But since y is an integer, we need to handle that.\n\nBut for each w, the ternary search would take O(log y_max) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nSo for each w, the time is O(log y_max), and for all w up to m, the total time is O(m log m), which is acceptable.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think. For a given w, the function f(y) is the value to maximize. The ternary search would find the maximum in the range [low, high]. However, since the function may not be strictly unimodal, there's a chance that the ternary search might miss the maximum. But perhaps in practice, this approach works.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, perhaps we can find the optimal y for each w by comparing the best possible y in the vicinity of the maximum possible and the maximum possible y where the weight 2 items are better than two weight 1 items.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose we have weight 1 items with values [5, 4, 3, ...], and weight 2 items with values [9, 8, 7, ...]. For a capacity of 4, taking two weight 2 items (total value 9 + 8 = 17) is better than taking four weight 1 items (5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14). But if the weight 2 items are [6, 5, ...], then taking two weight 2 items gives 6+5=11, while four weight 1 items gives 5+4+3+2=14, which is better.\n\nSo the optimal y depends on the comparison between the weight 2 items and pairs of weight 1 items.\n\nBut how can this be modeled?\n\nAlternatively, for each weight 2 item, we can compare it with the sum of the next two weight 1 items. If the weight 2 item is better, then take it; otherwise, take the two weight 1 items.\n\nThis is similar to the greedy approach for the knapsack problem when items have weights 1 and 2. However, I'm not sure if this approach is optimal.\n\nBut let's think: if we have a list of weight 2 items sorted in descending order, and a list of weight 1 items sorted in descending order, then we can merge them into a single list, where each weight 2 item is compared against two weight 1 items. For example, we can create a merged list where each element is either a weight 2 item or two weight 1 items. Then, we can sort this merged list in descending order and take as many as possible.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. Let's have two pointers: one for the weight 1 items (i) and one for the weight 2 items (j). Initially, i = 0, j = 0. Compare the current weight 2 item (s2[j]) with the sum of the next two weight 1 items (s1[i] + s1[i+1]). If the weight 2 item is larger, take it, increment j. Else, take the two weight 1 items, increment i by 2. Repeat until all items are processed.\n\nThis way, we get a merged list of items that are either weight 2 items or pairs of weight 1 items. Then, the problem reduces to selecting items from this merged list, each of which has a weight of 2 or 1*2=2. Wait, but the weight would be 2 in both cases. So this approach would allow us to select items with weight 2, but the total weight would be the same as if we took the weight 2 item or two weight 1 items. However, this approach would give us the maximum value for a given number of weight 2 items and pairs of weight 1 items.\n\nBut then, once we have this merged list, we can treat it as a list of items with weight 2 and value equal to the maximum between the weight 2 item and the two weight 1 items. Then, the problem of choosing items with weight 2 (each of which is either a single weight 2 item or two weight 1 items) becomes a 0-1 knapsack problem with items of weight 2 and varying values. However, since the weight is 2 for each item, and the total capacity is W, the maximum number of such items is W//2. So, the optimal selection is to take the top k items from the merged list, where k is the maximum possible (up to W//2).\n\nBut how to compute this merged list?\n\nLet's think of an example. Suppose weight 1 items are [5,4,3,2,1], and weight 2 items are [9, 8, 7].\n\nThe merged list would be:\n\nCompare 9 vs 5+4=9. They are equal. So we can choose either. Let's say we take the weight 2 item. Then compare 8 vs 3+2=5. Take 8. Then compare 7 vs 1+ (nothing, since there's only one left). Take 7. Then take the remaining weight 1 items (1) as a single item? No, because the merged list is built for pairs. Wait, this approach only considers pairs of weight 1 items. So if there are leftover weight 1 items, they can be added as individual items.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Perhaps this approach is not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, the merged list would consist of all weight 2 items and all weight 1 items, but sorted in a way that allows us to choose the best options. However, this is not straightforward.\n\nBut perhaps this approach can help in creating a new list of items with weight 2, and then the problem becomes selecting how many of these items to take, up to W//2 items. But this requires that the merged list is sorted in descending order of value per weight.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, after merging, the merged list would have items with weight 2, and the value is the maximum between the weight 2 item and the sum of two weight 1 items. Then, for any capacity W, the maximum number of items is W//2, and the best is to take the top W//2 items from this merged list.\n\nBut how to build this merged list?\n\nLet me think. We can have two pointers, one for the weight 1 items (i) and one for the weight 2 items (j). At each step, compare the current weight 2 item (if any) with the sum of the next two weight 1 items (if available). Choose the one with higher value, add it to the merged list, and advance the corresponding pointer. If there are no more weight 2 items, then add the remaining weight 1 items as individual items. But wait, this would not account for the possibility of taking a single weight 1 item if it's better than nothing.\n\nThis seems messy. Perhaps this approach is not the way to go.\n\nBack to the original problem. Given that the time is tight, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the following plan:\n\n1. Separate the items into three groups based on their weight (1, 2, 3).\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost, and compute their prefix sums.\n\n3. For the weight 1 and 2 items, precompute for each possible capacity W (from 0 to m) the maximum value achievable using only those items. To do this, for each W, iterate over possible y (number of weight 2 items) in a limited range (like up to 200 possibilities around y_max) and compute the corresponding value.\n\n4. Once we have this precomputed, then for the weight 3 items, iterate over possible z (number of weight 3 items), compute the remaining capacity rem = m - 3*z, and add the precomputed value for rem plus the value of taking z weight 3 items.\n\nBut how to handle the weight 3 items. For the weight 3 items, similarly, we can precompute their prefix sums, and for each z, we can take up to min(z, len(s3)) items.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Preprocess the weight 1, 2, 3 items.\n\n- Precompute the best value for weight 1 and 2 items for each W (0 to m).\n\n- Precompute the best value for weight 3 items for each z (0 to len(s3)).\n\n- For each possible z (from 0 to min(len(s3), m//3)), compute rem = m - 3*z. Then, the total value is best_1_2[rem] + best_3[z]. Keep track of the maximum.\n\nBut how to precompute best_1_2[rem]?\n\nAs discussed earlier, for each W, we can compute best_1_2[W] as the maximum value for weight 1 and 2 items with capacity W.\n\nTo compute this, for each W, we can try a limited number of y values (say, up to 200) around y_max = min(W//2, len(s2)).\n\nLet's proceed with this approach. Let's assume that for each W, we check y in the range [max(0, y_max - 200), y_max], and for each y, compute the corresponding x = min(W - 2y, len(s1)), and take the maximum of s2[y] + s1[x].\n\nThis would give us an approximate value, but perhaps sufficient for the problem. However, there's a risk that the optimal y is outside this range, leading to incorrect results.\n\nBut given that the time is limited, perhaps this is the only feasible approach.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nThen, read n lines of wi and ci. Separate into three lists: w1, w2, w3.\n\nSort each list in descending order of ci.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each:\n\ns1 = [0], then for each item in w1, add to previous sum.\n\ns2 = same for w2.\n\ns3 = same for w3.\n\nNow, for the weight 1 and 2 items, precompute best_1_2 array, where best_1_2[W] is the maximum value achievable with capacity W.\n\nFor W from 0 to m:\n\n   y_max = min(W // 2, len(s2) - 1)\n\n   start_y = max(0, y_max - 200)\n\n   max_val = 0\n\n   for y in range(start_y, y_max + 1):\n\n       remaining_weight = W - 2*y\n\n       x = min(remaining_weight, len(s1) - 1)\n\n       current_val = s2[y] + s1[x]\n\n       if current_val > max_val:\n\n           max_val = current_val\n\n   best_1_2[W] = max_val\n\nBut what about when the remaining_weight is negative? Well, since y ranges up to y_max, which is W//2, 2y <= W, so remaining_weight is >= 0.\n\nBut this approach may miss some cases where the optimal y is outside the checked range. However, given that the number of items is large, and the check is for 200 values, it's likely that this will cover the optimal case.\n\nOnce best_1_2 is computed, then for the weight 3 items:\n\nprecompute for each possible z, the value s3[z].\n\nThen, for each possible z (from 0 to min(len(s3), m//3)), compute rem = m - 3*z. If rem < 0, skip. Otherwise, the total value is best_1_2[rem] + s3[z]. Track the maximum.\n\nThis would be the final answer.\n\nBut what about cases where there are multiple combinations of weight 1, 2, and 3 items that could be better?\n\nWell, this approach should cover all possibilities, assuming that best_1_2 is computed correctly.\n\nBut what about the case where the optimal solution uses some weight 3 items, and the best_1_2 is computed correctly for the remaining capacity.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the question is, what value to choose for the number of y's checked per W. For example, 200 may be too small or too large. But given that the problem has tight time constraints, perhaps this is the only feasible way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of y's to check can be determined based on the number of weight 2 items. For example, if there are very few weight 2 items, then checking all possible y's is feasible.\n\nBut in the worst case, for each W, we check 200 values. For m up to 3e5, this is 3e5 * 200 = 6e7 operations. Which should be manageable in Python, although it's tight.\n\nBut what if the number of weight 2 items is small? For example, if there are only 100 weight 2 items, then checking all y from 0 to y_max would be 100 operations per W. So for the code, perhaps we can adjust the number of checks based on the size of the weight 2 list.\n\nAlternatively, set a fixed number, say 200, and hope that it's sufficient.\n\nAnother idea: for the weight 1 and 2 items, for each W, we can check all possible y's up to min(y_max, len(s2)), but only if len(s2) is small. For example, if len(s2) is less than 200, then check all possible y's. Otherwise, check y_max and y_max - 200.\n\nBut this complicates the code.\n\nAlternatively, proceed with checking up to 200 possibilities for each W.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 1\n\n2 1\n\nSo n=1, m=1. The item has weight 2, which is more than m=1. So the best is 0.\n\nSample Output is 0.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo the items are (1,3) and (2,2). The best is to take the first item (cost 3), which fits in weight 1. The output is 3.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n4 3\n\n3 10\n\n2 7\n\n2 8\n\n1 1\n\nThe items are:\n\nweight 3: cost 10\n\nweight 2: cost 7 and 8 (sorted as 8,7)\n\nweight 1: cost 1.\n\nSo for m=3.\n\nPossible options:\n\nTake one weight 3 item (cost 10, weight 3). That's the best.\n\nAnother option: take one weight 2 (cost 8) and one weight 1 (cost 1): total weight 3, cost 9. Less than 10.\n\nSo output is 10.\n\nSo the code should handle these cases.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nIn Python, for large n (up to 1e5), the code must be efficient. But for the approach described, the main steps are:\n\nSeparate the items into weight groups, sort, compute prefix sums.\n\nFor best_1_2, precompute for each W from 0 to m.\n\nThen, for each possible z (number of weight 3 items), compute rem = m - 3*z, and add best_1_2[rem] + s3[z].\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, separate into w1, w2, w3.\n\nSort each list in descending order of cost.\n\nCompute prefix sums:\n\nFor example:\n\ns1 = [0]\n\nfor item in w1:\n\n    s1.append(s1[-1] + item)\n\nSimilarly for s2 and s3.\n\nThen, precompute best_1_2 array.\n\nBut how to handle W up to m (3e5). For m up to 3e5, the array can be of size m+1.\n\nNow, the code for best_1_2:\n\nbest_1_2 = [0]*(m+1)\n\nfor W in range(0, m+1):\n\n    y_max = min(W//2, len(s2)-1)\n\n    start_y = max(0, y_max - 200)\n\n    max_val = 0\n\n    for y in range(start_y, y_max+1):\n\n        rem_weight = W - 2*y\n\n        x = min(rem_weight, len(s1)-1)\n\n        current_val = s2[y] + s1[x]\n\n        if current_val > max_val:\n\n            max_val = current_val\n\n    best_1_2[W] = max_val\n\nBut what if the start_y is negative? Well, the max(0, ...) takes care of that.\n\nOnce this is done, then compute the maximum over all possible z.\n\nmax_total = 0\n\nmax_z = min(len(s3), m//3)\n\nfor z in range(0, max_z+1):\n\n    weight_used = 3*z\n\n    if weight_used > m:\n\n        continue\n\n    rem = m - weight_used\n\n    current_val = best_1_2[rem] + s3[z]\n\n    if current_val > max_total:\n\n        max_total = current_val\n\nreturn max_total",
