There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about the example given. For n=3, the output is 2. The winner plays two games. How does that work? Well, the first game is between two players, say 1 and 2. Then the winner (say 1) plays against player 3. But according to the rule, when the second game happens, player 1 has already played once, and player 3 hasn't played any. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's okay.\n\nBut for n=4, the output is 2. Wait, why can't the winner play three games? Let's see. If there are four players, the tournament would normally have three games (since each game eliminates one person, and you need to eliminate three to get a winner). But the maximum number of games the winner can play is two. How?\n\nThe note says that the winner can't play against the fourth player after two games. Because the winner has played two games, and the fourth player has played zero. The difference is two, which is not allowed. So the tournament structure must be such that the winner plays two games. Like, first two games: (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4). Then the winners (say 1 and 3) play each other. So the winner plays two games. Hence, the maximum is two.\n\nSo the problem is about finding the maximum possible number of games the winner can play, given that the tournament structure adheres to the rule that any two players can only play if their number of previous games differ by at most one.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. The maximum number of games the winner can play would be determined by how the players are arranged in the tournament. The idea is to arrange the matches so that the winner can play as many times as possible, but each time they play, their opponent has either the same number of previous games or one less.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose the winner plays k games. Each time they play, they must have an opponent who has played either the same number of games or one less. Let's think about the structure of the tournament.\n\nFor the winner to play k games, they must have defeated k opponents. Each of these opponents must have been in a situation where their number of previous games was either equal to the winner's previous games (before that match) or one less.\n\nWait, but each time the winner plays a game, they have already played some number of games. Let's think about the first game: the winner has 0 games before, so the opponent must also have 0. Then, after winning, the winner has 1 game. For the next game, the opponent must have either 1 or 0 games. But if the opponent has 0 games, then the winner's count is 1, which is allowed. So the opponent could be someone who hasn't played before. But then, how does that affect the rest of the tournament?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of games the winner can play is related to the Fibonacci sequence. Because each time, the number of players required to allow the winner to play k games might follow a pattern similar to Fibonacci numbers. Let me think.\n\nLet's consider that for the winner to play k games, the number of players needed is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number minus something? Let's think of it like this:\n\nLet f(k) be the minimum number of players required so that the winner can play k games. Then, for each game the winner plays, they must have an opponent. For the first game, the opponent is one player, so f(1) = 2 (since two players, one game).\n\nFor the winner to play two games, they need to have two opponents. But the second game's opponent must have played either 1 or 0 games. However, since the winner has already played one game (after the first game), the opponent for the second game must have played 1 or 0. But if the opponent has played 0 games, then that's possible. But how do we arrange that?\n\nWait, the second game's opponent must have played 0 or 1 games. Let's say the winner plays their second game against a player who has played 0 games. That would require that the opponent hasn't played any games yet. But for that player to exist, there must be enough players in the tournament. But how does that structure work?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a binary tree. Each time the winner plays a game, they need an opponent. The opponent must have a certain number of games played. For example, to play the k-th game, the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games. Wait, maybe this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: think of the maximum number of games the winner can play as the largest k such that the Fibonacci number F(k+2) is ≤ n. Wait, looking at examples:\n\nFor example, n=2. The answer is 1. Let's see Fibonacci numbers. Let's say F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, etc. For k=1, F(3)=2. Which is exactly n=2. So the answer is 1. For n=3, the answer is 2. Let's check F(4)=3. So k+2=4 → k=2. Which matches the sample. For n=4, the answer is 2. F(4) is 3, F(5) is 5. So the maximum k where F(k+2) ≤n is k=2 (F(4)=3 ≤4). So answer is 2. For n=10, the answer is 4. Let's see: F(6)=8, F(7)=13. So for k=4, F(6)=8 ≤10. Then the answer is 4. Which matches the sample input where n=10 gives output 4. So this seems to fit.\n\nSo the idea is that the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest k such that F(k+2) ≤n. Where F is the Fibonacci sequence starting with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum k where F(k+2) ≤n. Then the answer is k.\n\nSo how do we compute this?\n\nFirst, we need to generate Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n. Then, find the maximum k such that F(k+2) ≤n.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with the samples:\n\nSample Input 2: n=3. The Fibonacci numbers:\n\nF(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5. For k=2, F(2+2)=F(4)=3 ≤3. So answer is 2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 4: n=4. F(4)=3, F(5)=5. So the largest k is 2 (since F(4) is 3 ≤4, but F(5)=5>4). So answer is 2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 10: F(6)=8, F(7)=13. So k+2=6 →k=4. So answer is 4. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: n=5. F(5)=5. So k+2=5 →k=3. So answer is 3. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nFor n=5, the maximum number of games is 3. How?\n\nLet me think. Let's imagine the winner plays 3 games. Let's think about the structure.\n\nFirst, the winner plays against someone. Then, for the second game, the opponent must have 0 or 1 games. Let's say the winner plays against someone who has 1 game. How can that happen? That would require that the opponent had a previous match. So, for example, the tournament structure would have the winner's path as follows:\n\nGame 1: Winner (W) vs A. W wins. Now W has 1 game.\n\nGame 2: W vs B. But B must have played 0 or 1 games. Suppose B has played 1 game. How? B must have played against someone else. So, for example, in the first round, there's another match between C and D. Then the winner of that (say B) plays against W. Then W has 1 game, B has 1 game. So they can play. Then W wins again. Now W has 2 games.\n\nThen for the third game, W needs an opponent who has played 2 or 1 games. Let's say there's another player E. But how can E have played 1 game? Maybe E had to play against someone else. Let's see.\n\nBut total players are 5. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the initial matches are:\n\nMatch 1: W vs A → W wins.\n\nMatch 2: B vs C → B wins.\n\nMatch 3: D vs E → D wins.\n\nThen, next round, W (with 1 game) plays against B (with 1 game). W wins. Now W has 2 games.\n\nThen, next round, W (2 games) needs to play against someone with 2 or 1 games. The remaining player is D, who has 1 game. So W plays against D. W wins. Now W has 3 games. So yes, possible. So for n=5, answer is 3. Which would be according to the formula.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nSo the problem becomes, for given n, find the maximum k where F(k+2) ≤n. So the steps are:\n\nGenerate the Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n. Then find the maximum k such that F(k+2) ≤n.\n\nBut what about when n is not exactly a Fibonacci number? For example, n=6. The Fibonacci numbers are F(5)=5, F(6)=8. So the maximum k is 3 (since F(5)=5 ≤6, and F(5+2)=F(5) is 5? Wait, no. Wait, earlier we said that k+2 is the index. So for k=3, F(k+2) = F(5) =5 ≤6. So answer is 3. But for n=6, the maximum number of games is 3? Let's see.\n\nYes. For example, the same structure as for n=5, but with an extra player. Let's see. Let's imagine that the tournament is structured so that the winner plays 3 games. So the required players would be 5 (for k=3, F(5)=5). But since n=6 is larger than 5, it's possible. So the answer is 3. So for n=6, the answer is 3.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum k where F(k+2) <=n.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this for very large n (up to 1e18). So we need to generate the Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18, and for each n, find the maximum k.\n\nLet's think about generating the Fibonacci numbers. Let's start with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8, etc. For each step, we can generate until the value exceeds 1e18.\n\nLet me compute how many terms there are. Let's see:\n\nF(1) = 1\n\nF(2) = 1\n\nF(3) = 2\n\nF(4) = 3\n\nF(5) = 5\n\nF(6) = 8\n\nF(7) = 13\n\nF(8) = 21\n\nF(9) = 34\n\nF(10)=55\n\nF(11)=89\n\nF(12)=144\n\n...\n\nEach term grows exponentially. The Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so even for 1e18, the number of terms is manageable. Let's see:\n\nThe 90th Fibonacci number is around 2.8e18 (I think). So for n up to 1e18, we can generate all Fibonacci numbers up to that.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to the maximum possible value (like 1e18) and for each n, find the maximum k such that F(k+2) <=n.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nFor example, given n, we can generate the Fibonacci numbers in order, and track the index. For each generated F(m), we check if it is <=n. Once we find the maximum m where F(m) <=n, then k = m-2.\n\nWait, because for k, the required is F(k+2) <=n. So m = k+2. So k = m-2.\n\nSo for example, for n=2, m=3 (F(3)=2). So k=3-2=1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the problem is to find the maximum m where F(m) <=n. Then the answer is m-2.\n\nSo how do we find this m?\n\nWe can precompute the Fibonacci numbers in a list, and then for a given n, perform a binary search on the list to find the largest m where F(m) <=n.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, and the Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, the list will be small. For example, the 90th Fibonacci number is about 2.8e18, so for n up to 1e18, the list would have around 90 elements.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\n1. Precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to the maximum possible value (until it exceeds 1e18).\n\n2. For a given n, find the largest m such that F(m) <=n.\n\n3. The answer is m-2.\n\nBut wait, what if n is less than F(3) =2?\n\nFor example, n=1. But according to the problem statement, n starts from 2. So for n=2, F(3)=2, which is the first case.\n\nBut the input constraints say n is at least 2.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nGenerate the list of Fibonacci numbers, starting from F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc.\n\nOnce the list is generated, for a given n, find the maximum m where F(m) <=n. Then the answer is m-2.\n\nLet me test this with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=2 → F(3)=2. m=3 → answer is 3-2=1. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: n=3. F(4)=3 → m=4 → answer 4-2=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 4: n=4. F(4)=3, F(5)=5. So the maximum m is 4. Answer is 4-2=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 10: F(6)=8, F(7)=13. So m=6. Answer 6-2=4. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5. F(5)=5. m=5 → answer 5-2=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, how to generate the Fibonacci numbers. Let's code that.\n\nInitialize a list, say fib = [1, 1]. Then, for each next term, add the sum of the last two terms. Continue until the next term exceeds 1e18.\n\nBut for Python, even with big integers, this is manageable.\n\nOnce the list is generated, for each input n, we can perform a binary search on the list to find the largest m where fib[m] <=n.\n\nWait, but the list is built as follows:\n\nfib[0] = 1 (F(1))\n\nfib[1] = 1 (F(2))\n\nfib[2] = 2 (F(3))\n\nfib[3] = 3 (F(4))\n\nfib[4] = 5 (F(5))\n\netc.\n\nSo the index in the list is m-1. Because for m=1, the index is 0. So for the list, the index is i, and the value is F(i+1).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to generate the list as follows:\n\nLet me create a list where the index corresponds to m. For example, for m=1, F(1)=1. For m=2, F(2)=1. For m=3, F(3)=2, etc. So the list would be [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...].\n\nBut generating that list:\n\nWe can start with a list, say fibs = [1, 1]. Then, for each next term, append fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]. So:\n\nfibs = [1, 1]\n\nthen next term is 2 → append. Then 3 → append. Then 5, etc.\n\nSo for m=1, it's fibs[0], m=2 → fibs[1], m=3 → fibs[2], etc.\n\nSo for a given n, we need to find the maximum m such that fibs[m-1] <=n.\n\nSo for example, for n=3, the list is [1,1,2,3,5,...]. The m for which fibs[m-1] <=3 is m=4 (since fibs[3]=3). So m=4, answer is 4-2=2.\n\nSo the code can generate the list of fibs, and for a given n, find the maximum m such that fibs[m-1] <=n.\n\nBut how to find this m? We can loop through the list until we find the first value that exceeds n, then take the previous index.\n\nAlternatively, perform a binary search.\n\nBut since the list is small, even a linear search would be acceptable.\n\nFor example, for n=1e18, the list would have about 90 elements.\n\nSo the code can generate the list, then iterate through it until the value exceeds n, then take the previous index.\n\nLet me think about the code steps.\n\nIn Python:\n\nGenerate the list of Fibonacci numbers:\n\nfibs = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_val > 1e18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_val)\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, but the list is generated until the next value exceeds 1e18.\n\nOnce the list is generated, for a given n, find the largest m where fibs[m-1] <=n.\n\nFor example, for n=2:\n\nLoop through the list:\n\nfibs[0] =1 (m=1)\n\nfibs[1] =1 (m=2)\n\nfibs[2] =2 (m=3) → 2 <=2 → yes.\n\nfibs[3] =3 (m=4) → 3>2. So the maximum m is 3. Then answer is 3-2=1.\n\nSo the code can do:\n\nmax_m = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n\n    if fibs[i] <=n:\n\n        max_m = i+1  # because m is i+1? Wait, for i=0, fibs[i] is F(1) =1. So m=1.\n\nWait, the index i in fibs is for F(i+1) ?\n\nNo. Let's think:\n\nOriginal list:\n\nfibs = [F(1), F(2), F(3), F(4), ...]\n\nSo for index 0 → F(1) =1.\n\nindex 1 → F(2) =1.\n\nindex 2 → F(3)=2.\n\nindex 3 → F(4)=3.\n\nSo for a given index i, the value is F(i+1). So for m, which is the index in the problem, the value is F(m) = fibs[m-1].\n\nSo for example, m=3, F(3)=2 = fibs[2].\n\nSo for a given n, we want to find the maximum m such that F(m) <=n. Which is the same as finding the maximum i where fibs[i] <=n. Then m = i+1.\n\nWait, no:\n\nIf fibs[i] is F(i+1). So for example, i=2 → F(3) =2.\n\nSo for m=3, F(m) = F(3) =2. So if we find the maximum i such that fibs[i] <=n, then m is i+1?\n\nNo, because m is the value such that F(m) <=n. So for example, if the maximum i is such that fibs[i] = F(i+1) <=n, then m is i+1? No. Because F(m) is equal to fibs[m-1]. So for example, if we find that fibs[i] <=n, then m is i+1? Because F(m) = F(i+1) = fibs[i].\n\nSo for example, if i is 2, then m is i+1 =3. So F(m) = F(3) =2. So the maximum m for which F(m) <=n is i+1, where i is the index in the fibs list.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nFind the maximum i such that fibs[i] <=n. Then m =i+1. Then the answer is m-2 = (i+1) -2 = i-1.\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nThe answer is m-2, where m is the maximum such that F(m) <=n.\n\nSo if m is i+1, then answer is (i+1) -2 = i-1.\n\nBut how do we find i?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the list as containing F(1), F(2), F(3), ..., F(k). So for each element in the list, the index is (m-1), where m is the m in F(m). So for example, the list's element at index 2 is F(3).\n\nSo for a given n, we need to find the largest m such that F(m) <=n. Once found, the answer is m-2.\n\nSo for example, for n=3, F(4)=3. So m=4. answer is 4-2=2.\n\nTo find m, we can find the index in the list where F(m) is <=n. So for example, in the list, the elements are F(1), F(2), F(3), F(4), etc. So for each element in the list, we can check if it is <=n. The maximum m is the index (i) +1, where i is the index in the list.\n\nSo, for example, for the list [1,1,2,3,5], and n=3, the elements are:\n\ni=0: F(1)=1 <=3 → yes.\n\ni=1: F(2)=1 <=3 → yes.\n\ni=2: F(3)=2 <=3 → yes.\n\ni=3: F(4)=3 <=3 → yes.\n\ni=4: F(5)=5>3 → no.\n\nSo the maximum i is 3. m = i+1 =4. answer is 4-2=2.\n\nSo the code can:\n\nLoop through the fibs list, and find the maximum index i where fibs[i] <=n. Then m = i+1. answer is m-2 = (i+1) -2 = i-1.\n\nWait, for the example above, i=3. answer is 3-1=2? Yes. Because i-1 is 3-1=2. Which is correct.\n\nBut how to find i?\n\nWe can loop through the list and find the maximum i where fibs[i] <=n.\n\nBut since the list is generated in order, and each term is increasing, we can loop until we find the first element that is larger than n, then take the previous index.\n\nFor example:\n\nInitialize i=0.\n\nWhile i < len(fibs) and fibs[i] <=n: i +=1.\n\nThen, the maximum i where fibs[i] <=n is i-1.\n\nSo for example, in the case where n=3, the loop will increment i until i=4 (since fibs[4]=5>3). Then i is 4. The maximum valid index is 3.\n\nSo the code can be:\n\ni = 0\n\nwhile i < len(fibs) and fibs[i] <=n:\n\n    i +=1\n\nmax_i = i-1\n\nif max_i <0:\n\n    # no possible? but n >=2.\n\nBut for n>=2, the first element is 1, so for n=2, i would be incremented to 2 (since fibs[0]=1, fibs[1]=1, fibs[2]=2 <=2, then i increments to 3. fibs[3]=3>2. So max_i is 2. Then m = 2+1=3. answer is 3-2=1. Which is correct.\n\nSo once we find max_i, then m = max_i +1. answer is m-2 = (max_i +1) -2 = max_i -1.\n\nWait, no. m = max_i +1? Because the index is max_i, which is the index of F(m) = fibs[max_i]. So m = max_i +1?\n\nWait, for example, the index is 2. The value is F(3) =2. So m is 3. Which is index +1. So yes, m = max_i +1.\n\nThen answer is m-2 = (max_i +1) -2 = max_i -1.\n\nSo for the case where max_i is 2 (index 2), the answer is 2-1=1. Which is correct for n=2.\n\nAnother example: for n=3, max_i is 3. answer is 3-1=2. Correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nOnce we find max_i, the answer is max_i -1.\n\nBut what if the max_i is 0?\n\nFor example, n=1. But n is at least 2. So no problem.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nGenerate the fibs list.\n\nFor input n:\n\ni = 0\n\nwhile i < len(fibs) and fibs[i] <=n:\n\n    i +=1\n\nmax_i = i-1\n\nanswer = max_i -1.\n\nBut let's test for n=2:\n\ni starts at 0.\n\nCheck fibs[0] =1 <=2 → i=1.\n\nfibs[1]=1 <=2 → i=2.\n\nfibs[2]=2 <=2 → i=3.\n\nfibs[3]=3>2 → loop stops. max_i=2. answer is 2-1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example, n=3:\n\ni increments to 4. max_i=3. answer is 3-1=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example, n=5. The fibs list would have up to 5. Let's say the list is [1,1,2,3,5]. For n=5:\n\ni increments until it reaches 5 (len(fibs) is 5?), indexes 0-4. So:\n\ni starts at 0, increments until fibs[4] =5 <=5 → i=5. Then loop stops. max_i=4. answer is 4-1=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut what if n is larger than all elements in the fibs list?\n\nFor example, n=1e18. Let's say the fibs list was generated until the last element is less than or equal to 1e18. Suppose the last element is F(k) = something less than 1e18, and the next would be larger. Then, the code would take the max_i as the last index, and answer is max_i -1.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to generate the fibs list correctly.\n\nLet me think about the code for generating the fibs list.\n\nStart with [1, 1]. Then generate next terms until the next term exceeds 1e18.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nfibs = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_val > 1e18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_val)\n\nBut wait, 1e18 is a float. It's better to use integers. So perhaps 10**18.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, which is 10^18.\n\nSo code:\n\nfibs = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_val > 10**18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_val)\n\nBut in Python, integers can be as big as needed.\n\nBut let's check for the first few terms:\n\nfibs starts as [1, 1]\n\nnext_val is 2 → added.\n\nthen 1+2=3 → added.\n\nthen 2+3=5 → added.\n\nthen 3+5=8 → added.\n\nand so on.\n\nOnce generated, the list contains all F(1), F(2), ... up to the largest F(m) ≤1e18.\n\nNow, for n=10^18, the code would find the maximum i, and answer accordingly.\n\nNow, what about cases where n is not a Fibonacci number?\n\nFor example, n=4. The fibs list has up to 3, then 5. So for n=4, the loop will increment i until fibs[i] is 3 (index 3) and then next is 5 which is >4. So max_i is 3. answer is 3-1=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code for the problem:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nGenerate the fibs list.\n\nFind max_i as explained.\n\nThe answer is max_i -1.\n\nBut what if n is 1? Well, the input constraints say n ≥2.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut in code, the fibs list may not be generated correctly. Let's think about the initial code.\n\nWait, in the code, the fibs list starts with [1, 1], which are F(1) and F(2). Then, the next term is 2, which is F(3). So the list is [F(1), F(2), F(3), ...].\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nGenerate the fibs list as discussed.\n\nThen find i as explained.\n\nBut what if the generated fibs list doesn't contain a value that is exactly n? For example, n=4. The code finds the largest value <=n, which is 3 (F(4) =3). Then answer is 3-1=2.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, code steps in Python.\n\nBut first, generate the fibs list. Let's write that.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nfibs = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_val > 10**18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_val)\n\nBut wait, in Python, 10**18 is 1e18 as an integer.\n\nOnce that is done, for input n, process as follows.\n\nBut for n=2, the code works.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut in code, the input is a single integer. So:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nThen, generate the fibs list as above.\n\nThen, find i.\n\nBut in code, the code for finding i:\n\ni = 0\n\nwhile i < len(fibs) and fibs[i] <= n:\n\n    i +=1\n\nmax_i = i-1\n\nans = max_i -1\n\nprint(ans)\n\nBut let's test with sample input.\n\nSample Input 2: n=2.\n\nfibs is [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ... ]\n\ni starts at 0:\n\ni=0: fibs[0]=1 <=2 → i=1.\n\ni=1: 1 <=2 → i=2.\n\ni=2: 2 <=2 → i=3.\n\ni=3: 3>2 → loop stops. max_i = 2. ans = 2-1=1. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: n=3.\n\ni increments until i=4 (since fibs[3] is 3 <=3 → i=4. Then check fibs[4] is 5>3 → loop stops. max_i is 3. ans=3-1=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 4: n=4. fibs[3] is 3, fibs[4] is 5. So i increments to 4 (fibs[3] is 3 <=4 → i=4. Then check fibs[4]=5>4 → loop stops. max_i is 3. ans=3-1=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 10: n=10. The fibs list includes 8 (F(6)), then 13 (F(7)). So during the loop, i will be incremented until fibs[i] is 8 (i=5?), then next is 13>10. So max_i is 5. ans=5-1=4. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut what about when n is exactly a Fibonacci number?\n\nLike n=5. The code would find i=5 (assuming fibs[4] is 5?), let's check:\n\nThe fibs list is:\n\nindex 0 → F(1)=1\n\nindex 1 → F(2)=1\n\nindex 2 → F(3)=2\n\nindex 3 → F(4)=3\n\nindex 4 → F(5)=5\n\nso for n=5, during the loop:\n\ni starts at 0, increments until i=5 (because fibs[4]=5 <=5 → i becomes 5. Then check if i < len(fibs) (assuming len(fibs) is at least 5). Then, fibs[5] is 8 (if the next term is 8). So 8>5 → loop stops. max_i is 4. ans is 4-1=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nNow, what about n=1? Well, input constraints say n≥2.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut what if the generated fibs list is not long enough? For example, for n=1e18, but the code generated the list up to the last term before exceeding 1e18.\n\nBut the code for generating the list is correct.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut in Python, the code for generating the fibs list:\n\nfibs = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_val > 10**18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_val)\n\nBut what if the next_val is exactly 1e18? It will be added. Because the condition is 'if next_val > 1e18: break'.\n\nSo for example, if next_val is exactly 1e18, it's added. Because 1e18 is not greater than 1e18.\n\nSo that is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, 10**18 is a big integer. So the code should generate the list correctly.\n\nNow, the code for the problem:\n\nRead n.\n\nGenerate the fibs list.\n\nFind i.\n\nCompute ans.\n\nBut in code:\n\nBut the code must be written as a script that reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nGenerate the fibs list.\n\nThen find the max_i.\n\nBut in code:\n\nBut the code for generating the fibs list must be inside the code.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for Python, the code would be:\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    fibs = [1, 1]\n\n    while True:\n\n        next_val = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n        if next_val > 10**18:\n\n            break\n\n        fibs.append(next_val)\n\n    i = 0\n\n    while i < len(fibs) and fibs[i] <= n:\n\n        i += 1\n\n    max_i = i -1\n\n    ans = max_i -1\n\n    print(ans)\n\nBut wait, for cases where n is less than the first element? Well, n is at least 2, and the first element is 1. So for n=2, the code proceeds.\n\nBut what if the fibs list is [1,1], and the next_val is 2, which is added. So the list is [1,1,2, ... ].\n\nBut let's think about when n is 2. The code will process correctly.\n\nBut what if the fibs list is not generated properly?\n\nLet me test for n=2.\n\nBut in code, the fibs list is generated as follows:\n\nInitially [1,1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule about the difference in the number of games played by opponents. The key insight is that this problem can be reduced to finding the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to the given number of players, `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rule**: The rule states that two players can only play against each other if the difference in the number of games they have already played is at most one. This leads us to consider the structure of the tournament in terms of Fibonacci numbers, as each subsequent game requires a structure that can be modeled using these numbers.\n\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by the largest Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to `n`. This is because each game the winner plays requires a structure that follows the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring the rule is respected.\n\n3. **Generating Fibonacci Numbers**: We generate Fibonacci numbers up to a value that exceeds $10^{18}$ (the upper limit for `n`). This allows us to efficiently check against any input value of `n`.\n\n4. **Binary Search for Efficiency**: Using a linear search on the precomputed Fibonacci numbers, we find the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n`, which gives us the required result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    fibs = [1, 1]\n    while True:\n        next_val = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n        if next_val > 10**18:\n            break\n        fibs.append(next_val)\n    \n    i = 0\n    while i < len(fibs) and fibs[i] <= n:\n        i += 1\n    max_i = i - 1\n    ans = max_i - 1\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input value `n` is read from standard input.\n2. **Generating Fibonacci Numbers**: We generate Fibonacci numbers up to a value that exceeds $10^{18}$, ensuring we cover all possible values of `n`.\n3. **Finding Maximum Valid Fibonacci Number**: Using a linear search, we find the largest Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to `n`. This index helps us determine the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n4. **Computing Result**: The result is derived by adjusting the index of the found Fibonacci number to account for the initial offset in the sequence.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the properties of the Fibonacci sequence to solve the problem within the constraints, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n`.",
