Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers that don't overlap, and their total duration is exactly x. And find the minimal total cost. If impossible, output -1.\n\nThe input gives n vouchers, each with li, ri, costi. The duration is ri - li + 1. The two vouchers must not intersect, meaning one ends before the other starts. So for two vouchers i and j, either ri < lj or rj < li.\n\nHmm. The approach here is to find pairs of vouchers where their durations add up to x, and they don't overlap. And find the minimum sum of their costs.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to efficiently check all possible pairs that satisfy the duration condition and non-overlapping.\n\nBut with n up to 2e5, checking all pairs would be O(n²), which is way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think: For each voucher, its duration is d = ri - li + 1. We need to find another voucher with duration x - d. And these two vouchers must not overlap.\n\nSo perhaps for each voucher, we can check if there exists another voucher with duration (x - d) that ends before li, or starts after ri. Then take the minimum cost for those.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about pre-processing. For each possible duration, we can keep track of the minimum cost of vouchers with that duration, and also their start and end times.\n\nWait, but for a given duration, say d, we need to find vouchers with duration (x - d) that end before the current voucher's start time, or start after the current voucher's end time.\n\nSo here's an idea:\n\n- Precompute for each possible duration, the list of vouchers with that duration. Also, for each duration, we can have sorted lists of their end times and start times, along with the minimum cost up to certain points.\n\nAlternatively, for each voucher, check if there's a voucher with duration (x - d_i) that ends before l_i, or starts after r_i. For each such case, find the minimum cost of those vouchers.\n\nBut how to find the minimum cost for vouchers with duration (x - d_i) that end before l_i?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I have a list of vouchers with duration k. For each such voucher, I can note their end time. If I want to find vouchers with duration k that end before some value s (like l_i), then I can find the minimum cost among those vouchers whose end time is <= s.\n\nSimilarly for vouchers with duration k that start after some value e (like r_i). For those, their start time is >= e, so the minimum cost among them.\n\nSo, for each possible duration, I need to have two structures:\n\n1. A sorted list of end times, along with the minimum cost up to each end time. So that for a given s, I can find the minimum cost of vouchers with duration k that end before s.\n\n2. A sorted list of start times, along with the minimum cost up to each start time. So that for a given e, I can find the minimum cost of vouchers with duration k that start after e.\n\nWait, but how to compute that? For example, for the first case: vouchers with duration k, sorted by end time. Then, for a given s, find the earliest end time that is <= s, and get the minimum cost among all such vouchers.\n\nBut if the list is sorted, we can perform a binary search to find the largest end time that is <= s. Then, if we have a prefix minimum array, we can get the minimum cost up to that point.\n\nSimilarly, for the start times. For vouchers with duration k, sorted by start time. For a given e, find the earliest start time that is >= e. Then, the minimum cost among all vouchers with start time >= e.\n\nWait, but for that, perhaps we need to sort the start times and have a suffix minimum array. Because once you find the first start time >= e, all the ones after that in the sorted list will also be >= e. So the suffix minima from that index onwards would give the minimum cost.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. For each duration k, create two sorted lists:\n\n   a. A list of end times (sorted), along with a prefix minima array of the costs. So that for any s, we can find the minimum cost among vouchers with duration k and end time <= s.\n\n   b. A list of start times (sorted), along with a suffix minima array of the costs. So that for any e, we can find the minimum cost among vouchers with duration k and start time >= e.\n\nOnce that's done, for each voucher i with duration d_i, we check if x - d_i is a valid duration (i.e., there are vouchers with that duration). Let's call that target duration k = x - d_i.\n\nThen, for this voucher i, we need to find the minimum cost among vouchers with duration k that end before l_i (so that voucher i and the found voucher don't overlap), or start after r_i (again, no overlap).\n\nSo for each voucher i, we check both possibilities:\n\nCase 1: Find the minimum cost of vouchers with duration k that end before l_i.\n\nCase 2: Find the minimum cost of vouchers with duration k that start after r_i.\n\nIf either case has a valid voucher, then we take the minimum between the two and add it to the current voucher's cost. Then, keep track of the overall minimum.\n\nBut how to handle this for all vouchers?\n\nNow, the steps would be:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers into a dictionary, mapping durations to their sorted lists of end times and start times, along with the prefix and suffix minima.\n\nFor example:\n\nFor each duration k, we have:\n\n- sorted_ends: list of end times sorted in ascending order.\n\n- prefix_min_end: for each index i in sorted_ends, the minimum cost among the first i+1 vouchers.\n\n- sorted_starts: list of start times sorted in ascending order.\n\n- suffix_min_start: for each index i in sorted_starts, the minimum cost among the vouchers from i to the end.\n\nBut how to build these?\n\nLet me think for the first part:\n\nFor a given duration k, collect all vouchers with that duration. Then, sort them by end time. Then, create a prefix_min array where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost between the first voucher (index 0) to i-th voucher in the sorted_ends list.\n\nSimilarly, for the start times: sort the vouchers by start time, then create a suffix_min array where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i-th voucher to the end of the list.\n\nOnce this is done, for a given s (like l_i), when looking for vouchers with duration k that end before s, we can binary search in the sorted_ends list to find the largest end time <= s. If such exists, then the prefix_min up to that index gives the minimum cost.\n\nSimilarly, for a given e (like r_i), when looking for vouchers with duration k that start after e, we can binary search in the sorted_starts list to find the first start time >= e. If such exists, then the suffix_min from that index gives the minimum cost.\n\nNow, the question is how to implement this.\n\nBut first, what about when x - d_i is negative? Well, since x and durations are positive, but if x is less than the duration of a voucher, then x - d_i could be negative. So we need to check if k = x - d_i is positive. Because if k is zero or negative, then there's no possible voucher for that. So for each voucher, we compute k = x - d_i. If k <= 0, skip.\n\nSo, for each voucher i, compute d_i = ri - li + 1. Then check if k = x - d_i is positive. If not, skip. Else, check if there are any vouchers with duration k.\n\nNow, for the preprocessing step, we can create a dictionary, say, duration_map, which maps each duration to a structure containing sorted_ends, prefix_min_end, sorted_starts, suffix_min_start.\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nLet me outline the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen, for each voucher, compute d = ri - li + 1.\n\nWe need to collect all vouchers grouped by their duration.\n\nSo, create a dictionary, say, duration_dict, where keys are durations, and values are lists of vouchers (each voucher is a tuple of (li, ri, costi)).\n\nOnce all vouchers are grouped by duration, for each duration k in duration_dict, process the vouchers as follows:\n\nFor the sorted_ends and prefix_min_end:\n\nSort the list of vouchers by their end time (ri). Then, create a list of end times (sorted), and a prefix_min array. The prefix_min array is built by keeping track of the minimum cost up to each position.\n\nSimilarly, for sorted_starts and suffix_min_start:\n\nSort the list of vouchers by their start time (li). Then, create a list of start times (sorted), and a suffix_min array. The suffix_min array is built by starting from the end and tracking the minimum.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher i:\n\nCompute d_i = ri - li + 1.\n\nk = x - d_i. If k <=0, skip.\n\nCheck if k exists in duration_dict. If not, skip.\n\nElse, for the duration k, check both cases:\n\nCase 1: find vouchers with duration k that end before l_i.\n\nCase 2: find vouchers with duration k that start after r_i.\n\nFor each case, find the minimal cost, if any.\n\nTake the minimal of these two (if any) and add to the current voucher's cost. Keep track of the global minimum.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement these two cases efficiently.\n\nLet's think about Case 1: vouchers with duration k, end before l_i.\n\nIn the duration_dict[k], the sorted_ends list is sorted in ascending order. So, we can perform a binary search to find the largest end time <= l_i - 1 (since if a voucher ends at l_i -1, then it's before l_i). Wait, the voucher's end time is ri. So for voucher j to end before l_i, we need rj <= l_i -1. Because if rj is <= l_i -1, then the voucher j ends before l_i starts.\n\nSo the target is to find the maximum end time <= l_i -1.\n\nIf such exists, then the prefix_min_end up to that index gives the minimum cost for vouchers with duration k that end before l_i.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2: vouchers with duration k that start after r_i. So their li must be >= r_i + 1. So we need to find the first start time >= r_i + 1. Then, the suffix_min_start from that index gives the minimum cost of such vouchers.\n\nSo for each case, we need to perform a binary search.\n\nNow, how to implement the binary search.\n\nFor case 1:\n\nsorted_ends is a list of end times (sorted in ascending order). We can use bisect_right to find the insertion point of l_i. Then, the index is insertion_point - 1. If insertion_point is 0, then no such voucher exists.\n\nFor example, sorted_ends is [2,4,5], and l_i is 3. The insertion point for 3 in sorted_ends is 1 (since 3 would be inserted between 2 and 4). So the largest element <= 3 is 2, at index 0. So the insertion point is 1, and we take index 0.\n\nSo using bisect.bisect_right(sorted_ends, l_i - 1) gives us the insertion point. If insertion_point is 0, then no elements are <= l_i -1. Else, the index is insertion_point -1.\n\nIf that index is >=0, then we can get the prefix_min_end at that index.\n\nFor case 2:\n\nsorted_starts is a list of start times sorted in ascending order. We need to find the first start time >= r_i + 1.\n\nThis can be done with bisect_left. For example, if we have sorted_starts = [1,3,5], and looking for 4, bisect_left returns 2 (since 4 would be inserted between 3 and 5). Then, the elements from index 2 onwards are >=4.\n\nIf the insertion point is beyond the length of the list, then there are no such vouchers.\n\nOnce we have the insertion point, if it's within the list, then the suffix_min_start from that index gives the minimum cost.\n\nNow, the code steps for each case:\n\nFor case 1:\n\nIf the duration k exists in duration_dict:\n\n   get the sorted_ends list and prefix_min_end.\n\n   target = l_i - 1\n\n   using bisect.bisect_right(sorted_ends, target) to find pos.\n\n   if pos > 0:\n\n       min_cost_case1 = prefix_min_end[pos-1]\n\n   else:\n\n       no voucher for case 1.\n\nFor case 2:\n\n   get the sorted_starts list and suffix_min_start.\n\n   target = r_i + 1\n\n   using bisect.bisect_left(sorted_starts, target) to find pos.\n\n   if pos < len(sorted_starts):\n\n       min_cost_case2 = suffix_min_start[pos]\n\n   else:\n\n       no voucher for case 2.\n\nThen, for each voucher, if either case 1 or case 2 is possible, we take the minimum between them (if both are possible) and add to current voucher's cost. Then compare with the global minimum.\n\nBut we have to make sure that the voucher we are checking is not the same as the current voucher. Wait, no. Because the problem says i and j must be different. However, in our approach, when we check for k = x - d_i, the vouchers with duration k could include the same voucher if d_i + d_j = x and the voucher is same. But since i and j must be different, we need to ensure that when k = x - d_i, and the voucher is same as current, but since we are considering all vouchers with duration k, including possibly the same voucher, but in that case, the code would pick it, but then the two vouchers would be the same. However, the problem requires that i and j are different.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because suppose a voucher has duration d_i, and there's another voucher with duration k = x -d_i, but if the same voucher is considered (for example, if x is 2*d_i, and the voucher is the only one with duration d_i). Then, when processing this voucher, the code would look for vouchers with duration k = x -d_i = d_i, and possibly find the same voucher. But that would not be allowed, because i and j must be different.\n\nSo, how to avoid that?\n\nAh, right. For example, if there's only one voucher with duration k, and that voucher is the same as the current voucher. Then, when we check for case 1 or case 2, we might find that voucher, but it's the same as the current one. So, in that case, we need to ignore that possibility.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nThis seems complicated. How can we ensure that the voucher found is different from the current one?\n\nWell, during preprocessing, for each duration, we have all the vouchers. So, for example, when we process voucher i, and check for duration k = x -d_i, and find a voucher j in that group, we need to make sure that j is not the same as i.\n\nBut how?\n\nBecause when we are processing voucher i, and looking for vouchers in the group of duration k, which is x -d_i, which could be same as d_i (if x is even, etc). So, for example, if voucher i is in the group of duration k (since k = x -d_i, and d_i + k =x), then when processing voucher i, the group for k includes voucher i (if x -d_i is same as d_i, i.e., x=2d_i). So, when looking for vouchers in the group for k, the code may find voucher i itself. But that would be invalid, as i and j must be different.\n\nSo, how to avoid that?\n\nThis seems like a problem. How can we handle this?\n\nOne approach is, during the preprocessing, for each duration, we have all the vouchers. Then, when processing voucher i, and checking for vouchers in the group of duration k, we need to make sure that when we find the minimal cost, it's not the same voucher.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, when we are considering case 1 (vouchers with duration k that end before l_i), and the minimal cost comes from voucher j. But if voucher j is the same as voucher i (i.e., if voucher i has duration k and ends before l_i?), that would be invalid.\n\nBut wait, voucher i's own duration is d_i. For k = x -d_i. So, if k = d_i, then x = 2d_i. So, voucher i's duration is d_i, and k is d_i. So, when processing voucher i, we look for vouchers in the group with duration k = d_i. Now, the voucher i is in that group. But for case 1, we are looking for vouchers with duration k that end before l_i. So, for voucher i to be in that group and satisfy the condition, we need that voucher i's end time (ri) is <= l_i -1. But l_i is the departure day of voucher i. Since ri >= l_i (because li <= ri), ri can't be less than l_i -1. Because ri >= l_i implies ri >= l_i, which is l_i -1 +1. So ri >= l_i >= l_i -1 +1. Therefore, ri can't be <= l_i -1. Therefore, voucher i cannot be in the case 1 group. Similarly for case 2: voucher i's start time is li. To be in case 2, voucher j's start time must be >= r_i + 1. But voucher i's start time is li, and r_i is >= li. So, if voucher i's start time is li, then for it to be in case 2, we need li >= r_i +1. But since r_i >= li, this would imply li >= r_i +1 >= li +1, which is impossible. So voucher i cannot be in case 1 or case 2. Therefore, when we are looking for vouchers in the group of duration k, the voucher i itself is not included in the possible candidates for case 1 or case 2. Thus, even if the group contains voucher i, when we process case 1 and case 2, voucher i is not considered. Therefore, the code is safe.\n\nWait, that's a key insight! Because when processing voucher i, the case 1 and case 2 conditions can't be satisfied by voucher i itself. Therefore, even if the group for duration k includes voucher i, the code will not select it. Because for case 1, the voucher's end time must be <= l_i -1, which is impossible for voucher i (since ri >= l_i). Similarly for case 2.\n\nTherefore, the code is safe and doesn't need to worry about selecting the same voucher. That's great!\n\nSo, the code can proceed as described earlier.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this logic in Python.\n\nNow, the steps:\n\nImplement the preprocessing for each duration.\n\nFirst, for each duration k, collect all vouchers with that duration. Then, for each such group, sort by end time, and compute prefix_min_end. Similarly, sort by start time and compute suffix_min_start.\n\nLet me think about how to do that.\n\nFor example, for a group of vouchers with duration k:\n\nsorted_ends is sorted by ri.\n\nprefix_min_end is an array where prefix_min_end[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 vouchers in sorted_ends.\n\nSimilarly, sorted_starts is sorted by li.\n\nsuffix_min_start is an array where suffix_min_start[i] is the minimum cost among the vouchers from i to end.\n\nLet me think about how to compute these arrays.\n\nFor the prefix_min_end:\n\nInitialize min_so_far = infinity.\n\nFor each voucher in sorted_ends list (sorted by end time):\n\n   min_so_far = min(min_so_far, voucher's cost)\n\n   append min_so_far to prefix_min_end.\n\nSimilarly for the suffix_min_start:\n\nInitialize min_so_far = infinity.\n\nIterate from the end of the sorted_starts list to the beginning:\n\n   min_so_far = min(min_so_far, voucher's cost)\n\n   append min_so_far to a temporary list, then reverse it to get the suffix_min_start array.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nsorted_starts is [s1, s2, s3, s4], sorted in increasing order.\n\nWe want suffix_min_start[i] to be the minimum cost from i to end.\n\nSo for i=0, it's the min of all four.\n\nFor i=1, min of s2, s3, s4.\n\nSo, we can process from the end to the start.\n\nStart with min_so_far = infinity.\n\nFor i in reversed(range(len(sorted_starts))):\n\n   min_so_far = min( min_so_far, sorted_starts[i].cost )\n\n   suffix_min_start[i] = min_so_far\n\nThus, the suffix_min_start array is built.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nFor each duration k in duration_dict:\n\n   vouchers = list of vouchers with duration k.\n\n   sorted_ends = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v[1])  # v[1] is ri.\n\n   sorted_starts = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v[0])  # v[0] is li.\n\n   # compute prefix_min_end for sorted_ends:\n\n   prefix_min_end = []\n   min_cost = float('inf')\n   for v in sorted_ends:\n       min_cost = min(min_cost, v[2])\n       prefix_min_end.append( min_cost )\n\n   # compute suffix_min_start for sorted_starts:\n\n   suffix_min_start = [0]*len(sorted_starts)\n   min_cost = float('inf')\n   for i in range(len(sorted_starts)-1, -1, -1):\n       min_cost = min( min_cost, sorted_starts[i][2] )\n       suffix_min_start[i] = min_cost\n\n   # store these in the duration_dict for k.\n\nBut how to store them? For example, for each k, we need to have:\n\n- sorted_ends list (the list of end times, or the list of vouchers sorted by end time?)\n\nWait, for the binary search, we need the list of end times. So perhaps, for each k, we can store:\n\n- ends_list: list of end times (ri) sorted in ascending order.\n\n- prefix_min_end: list of min costs as computed above.\n\nSimilarly for starts_list: list of start times (li) sorted in ascending order.\n\n- suffix_min_start: list of min costs as computed above.\n\nSo, during preprocessing:\n\nfor each duration k in duration_dict:\n\n   vouchers = list of vouchers with duration k.\n\n   sorted_ends_vouchers = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n   ends_list = [v[1] for v in sorted_ends_vouchers]\n\n   prefix_min_end = ... as before.\n\n   sorted_starts_vouchers = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n   starts_list = [v[0] for v in sorted_starts_vouchers]\n\n   suffix_min_start = ... as before.\n\nBut storing the sorted_ends_vouchers and sorted_starts_vouchers may not be needed. Because for the binary search, we need the list of end times (ends_list) and the prefix_min_end. Similarly for starts_list and suffix_min_start.\n\nSo, perhaps for each k, we can store:\n\n- ends_list: sorted end times.\n\n- prefix_min_end: list of prefix minima.\n\n- starts_list: sorted start times.\n\n- suffix_min_start: list of suffix minima.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher i, we can process as follows:\n\nCompute d_i = ri - li + 1.\n\nk = x - d_i.\n\nif k <=0: continue.\n\nif k not in duration_dict: continue.\n\nElse, for the duration_dict[k], check case 1 and case 2.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this?\n\nIn Python, we can use a dictionary, say, for each k, we have a tuple (ends_list, prefix_min_end, starts_list, suffix_min_start).\n\nSo, during preprocessing, for each k in duration_dict:\n\n   process the vouchers as above and store these lists.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen, read n lines of li, ri, costi.\n\nWe can collect all vouchers in a list.\n\nThen, group them by duration.\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict.\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor each voucher in vouchers:\n\n   d = ri - li + 1\n\n   duration_dict[d].append( (li, ri, costi) )\n\nThen, for each duration in duration_dict, process the four lists (ends_list, prefix_min_end, starts_list, suffix_min_start).\n\nBut how to store them? Maybe create another dictionary, say, preprocessed = {k: (ends_list, prefix_min_end, starts_list, suffix_min_start)}.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher in the original list, process as follows:\n\nfor li, ri, costi in vouchers:\n\n   d_i = ri - li + 1\n\n   k = x - d_i\n\n   if k <=0: continue\n\n   if k not in preprocessed: continue\n\n   # process case 1 and case 2.\n\n   # get the preprocessed data for k.\n\n   ends_list, prefix_min_end, starts_list, suffix_min_start = preprocessed[k]\n\n   # case 1: find vouchers with duration k that end before li.\n\n   target = li -1\n\n   # binary search in ends_list for target.\n\n   # using bisect_right.\n\n   import bisect\n\n   pos = bisect.bisect_right(ends_list, target)\n\n   if pos > 0:\n\n       min_case1 = prefix_min_end[pos-1]\n\n   else:\n\n       min_case1 = infinity\n\n   # case 2: find vouchers with duration k that start after ri.\n\n   target = ri + 1\n\n   pos = bisect.bisect_left(starts_list, target)\n\n   if pos < len(starts_list):\n\n       min_case2 = suffix_min_start[pos]\n\n   else:\n\n       min_case2 = infinity\n\n   current_min = min( min_case1, min_case2 )\n\n   if current_min is not infinity:\n\n       total = current_min + costi\n\n       update the global minimum.\n\nSo, the global minimum is initialized to infinity, and after processing all vouchers, if it's still infinity, output -1, else output the value.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 --> duration 3-1+1=3\n\n1 2 5 --> 2-1+1=2\n\n5 6 1 --> 6-5+1=2\n\n1 2 4 --> 2-1+1=2\n\nSo, x is 5. For each voucher, check if x -d_i is positive and exists.\n\nFor example, first voucher has d_i=3. x -d_i =5-3=2. So check for duration 2.\n\npreprocessed for duration 2: vouchers are (1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4). Let's see:\n\nsorted_ends_vouchers for duration 2: sorted by ri. The ri's are 2, 6, 2. Wait, the vouchers are:\n\nvoucher 2: li=1, ri=2, cost 5.\n\nvoucher 3: li=5, ri=6, cost 1.\n\nvoucher 4: li=1, ri=2, cost 4.\n\nsorted by ri: the ri's are 2, 2, 6. So the sorted_ends_vouchers would be the ones with ri=2, then another with ri=2, then ri=6. So ends_list is [2, 2, 6]. prefix_min_end would be [5, min(5,4)=4, min(4,1)=1]. So prefix_min_end is [5,4,1].\n\nstarts_list for duration 2: sorted by li. The li's are 1,1,5. So starts_list is [1,1,5]. suffix_min_start is computed by starting from end:\n\nfor i=2 (start 5, cost 1): min is 1.\n\ni=1 (start 1, cost 4): min(4, 1) =1.\n\ni=0 (start 1, cost 5): min(5, 1) =1.\n\nso suffix_min_start is [1,1,1].\n\nNow, for the first voucher (li=1, ri=3, cost 4). d_i=3, k=2.\n\ncase 1: target = li-1 = 0. ends_list is [2,2,6]. bisect_right(ends_list, 0) returns 0. pos=0, which is not >0. So no case1.\n\ncase 2: target = ri+1 =3+1=4. starts_list is [1,1,5]. find first start >=4. bisect_left([1,1,5],4) returns 2. pos=2 < len(3). suffix_min_start[2] is 1. So case2 gives 1. So total cost is 4 + 1 =5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nAnother example: voucher 3 (li=5, ri=6, cost 1). duration is 2. x -d_i =5-2=3. So check for duration 3. Are there any vouchers with duration 3? Yes, the first voucher (1,3,4). So for this voucher, k=3. preprocessed for k=3 has ends_list [3], prefix_min_end [4], starts_list [1], suffix_min_start [4].\n\ncase 1: target = li-1 =5-1=4. ends_list is [3]. bisect_right([3],4) returns 1. pos>0 (1>0). so min_case1 is prefix_min_end[0] =4. So case1 is 4. So total cost is 1+4=5. Which is same as before.\n\nSo the code would find this pair as well.\n\nSo the code would find both possibilities and take the minimum.\n\nNow, the code needs to process all vouchers and for each, check both cases.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all these steps.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling the preprocessing correctly.\n\n- Edge cases where multiple vouchers have the same duration and overlapping times.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nImplementing the preprocessing:\n\nWe can create a dictionary called preprocessed, which maps each duration to (ends_list, prefix_min_end, starts_list, suffix_min_start).\n\nSo:\n\npreprocessed = {}\n\nfor duration in duration_dict:\n\n    vouchers = duration_dict[duration]\n\n    # process ends_list and prefix_min_end\n\n    sorted_ends_vouchers = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])  # sort by ri\n\n    ends_list = [v[1] for v in sorted_ends_vouchers]\n\n    prefix_min_end = []\n\n    min_cost = float('inf')\n\n    for v in sorted_ends_vouchers:\n\n        min_cost = min(min_cost, v[2])\n\n        prefix_min_end.append(min_cost)\n\n    # process starts_list and suffix_min_start\n\n    sorted_starts_vouchers = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])  # sort by li\n\n    starts_list = [v[0] for v in sorted_starts_vouchers]\n\n    suffix_min_start = [0]*len(sorted_starts_vouchers)\n\n    min_cost = float('inf')\n\n    for i in range(len(sorted_starts_vouchers)-1, -1, -1):\n\n        min_cost = min(min_cost, sorted_starts_vouchers[i][2])\n\n        suffix_min_start[i] = min_cost\n\n    # store in preprocessed\n\n    preprocessed[duration] = (ends_list, prefix_min_end, starts_list, suffix_min_start)\n\nOnce that is done.\n\nNow, for each voucher in the original list, we process as described.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut in Python, for the initial grouping, we can use a defaultdict(list).\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n\n    vouchers = []\n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        ri = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        costi = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        vouchers.append( (li, ri, costi) )\n        d = ri - li +1\n        duration_dict[d].append( (li, ri, costi) )\n\n    # Preprocess\n    preprocessed = dict()\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        vouchers_d = duration_dict[d]\n        # process ends\n        sorted_ends = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        ends_list = [v[1] for v in sorted_ends]\n        prefix_min_end = []\n        min_cost = float('inf')\n        for v in sorted_ends:\n            min_cost = min(min_cost, v[2])\n            prefix_min_end.append(min_cost)\n        # process starts\n        sorted_starts = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        starts_list = [v[0] for v in sorted_starts]\n        suffix_min_start = [0]*len(sorted_starts)\n        min_cost = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(sorted_starts)-1, -1, -1):\n            min_cost = min( min_cost, sorted_starts[i][2] )\n            suffix_min_start[i] = min_cost\n        preprocessed[d] = (ends_list, prefix_min_end, starts_list, suffix_min_start)\n\n    min_total = float('inf')\n\n    for li, ri, costi in vouchers:\n        d_i = ri - li +1\n        k = x - d_i\n        if k <=0:\n            continue\n        if k not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        ends_list, prefix_min_end, starts_list, suffix_min_start = preprocessed[k]\n        # case 1: end before li\n        target_case1 = li -1\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(ends_list, target_case1)\n        min_case1 = float('inf')\n        if pos >0:\n            min_case1 = prefix_min_end[pos-1]\n        # case 2: start after ri\n        target_case2 = ri +1\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(starts_list, target_case2)\n        min_case2 = float('inf')\n        if pos < len(starts_list):\n            min_case2 = suffix_min_start[pos]\n        current_min = min( min_case1, min_case2 )\n        if current_min != float('inf'):\n            total = current_min + costi\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n\n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first case has vouchers with duration 3 and 2. So when processing the first voucher (duration 3), k=5-3=2, which exists. So code proceeds.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple vouchers with the same duration and the same start/end times?\n\nBut the code should handle that.\n\nNow, let's test the second sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3 2\n\n4 6 3 --> duration 6-4+1=3\n\n2 4 1 --> duration 4-2+1=3\n\n3 5 4 --> duration 5-3+1=3\n\nSo x=2. Each voucher has duration 3. So for any voucher, k = 2-3 = -1. So no possible. Hence output is -1. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, x=4. vouchers are (1,2,1) (duration 2) and (3,4,1) (duration 2). So x=4. For each voucher, k = 4-2=2. So for first voucher, check for vouchers with duration 2.\n\ncase1: target is li-1 =1-1=0. ends_list is [2,4]. bisect_right([2,4], 0) is 0. no case1.\n\ncase2: target is ri+1 =2+1=3. starts_list is [1,3]. bisect_left([1,3], 3) returns 1. suffix_min_start[1] is 1. So total is 1+1=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo code would output 2.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, what about when there are multiple vouchers with the same duration and overlapping times?\n\nBut the code checks for non-overlapping.\n\nNow, what about when two vouchers are non-overlapping but have the same duration?\n\nThe code would find them.\n\nNow, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about when the same duration is processed multiple times?\n\nNo problem.\n\nNow, the code uses the preprocessed data for each duration. So, for example, if two vouchers have same duration, they are grouped and processed.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- All vouchers have duration less than x. So no possible pairs.\n\n- Some vouchers have duration exactly x/2, but no other vouchers with same duration.\n\n- Some vouchers have duration x, but no other vouchers (so can't pair with another voucher).\n\nBut the code would handle that.\n\nNow, for the code, what about when k is in preprocessed, but there are no vouchers that satisfy case1 or case2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers such that their combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently checking for pairs of vouchers that can sum up to the required duration.\n2. **Preprocess Data**: For each duration, we preprocess the vouchers to create sorted lists of their start and end times. Additionally, we compute prefix minimum costs for end times and suffix minimum costs for start times. This allows efficient querying of minimum costs for non-overlapping intervals.\n3. **Check for Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, we check if there exists another voucher with a duration that, when combined with the current voucher's duration, equals the required total duration. We use binary search on the preprocessed data to quickly find valid non-overlapping vouchers and compute the minimum cost.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    vouchers = []\n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        ri = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        costi = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, costi))\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        duration_dict[d].append((li, ri, costi))\n\n    # Preprocess the durations\n    preprocessed = {}\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        vouchers_d = duration_dict[d]\n        # Process ends list and prefix min end\n        sorted_ends = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        ends_list = [v[1] for v in sorted_ends]\n        prefix_min_end = []\n        min_cost = float('inf')\n        for v in sorted_ends:\n            min_cost = min(min_cost, v[2])\n            prefix_min_end.append(min_cost)\n        # Process starts list and suffix min start\n        sorted_starts = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        starts_list = [v[0] for v in sorted_starts]\n        suffix_min_start = [0] * len(sorted_starts)\n        min_cost = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(sorted_starts) - 1, -1, -1):\n            min_cost = min(min_cost, sorted_starts[i][2])\n            suffix_min_start[i] = min_cost\n        preprocessed[d] = (ends_list, prefix_min_end, starts_list, suffix_min_start)\n\n    min_total = float('inf')\n\n    for li, ri, costi in vouchers:\n        d_i = ri - li + 1\n        k = x - d_i\n        if k <= 0:\n            continue\n        if k not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        ends_list, prefix_min_end, starts_list, suffix_min_start = preprocessed[k]\n        # Case 1: end before li\n        target_case1 = li - 1\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(ends_list, target_case1)\n        min_case1 = float('inf')\n        if pos > 0:\n            min_case1 = prefix_min_end[pos - 1]\n        # Case 2: start after ri\n        target_case2 = ri + 1\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(starts_list, target_case2)\n        min_case2 = float('inf')\n        if pos < len(starts_list):\n            min_case2 = suffix_min_start[pos]\n        current_min = min(min_case1, min_case2)\n        if current_min != float('inf'):\n            total = current_min + costi\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n\n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration using a dictionary.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, vouchers are sorted by their end times and start times.
