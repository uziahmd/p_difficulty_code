    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe instability is defined as the maximum element minus the minimum in the array after removing one element. So, my goal is to find which element to remove such that this difference is minimized.\n\nFirst, let's think about the brute force approach. For each element in the array, if I remove it, compute the max and min of the remaining elements and calculate the difference. Then pick the minimum among all those differences. But with n up to 1e5, this approach would be O(n^2), which is definitely not feasible. So I need a smarter way.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum and minimum of the array when we remove one element? Let's think about the original array. Suppose the array is sorted. Because if the array is sorted, then the max and min are at the ends. So maybe sorting the array can help here.\n\nLet me think. If the array is sorted, then for each position i, when we remove the element at i, the new max and min would be:\n\nIf the array is sorted as a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]. If I remove a[i], then the new max is max(a[0], ..., a[i-1], a[i+1], ..., a[n-1]) which is the same as the original max except when i is the first or last element. Wait, no. If the array is sorted, then the original max is a[-1], min is a[0]. If I remove an element that's not the first or last, then the max and min remain the same. But if I remove the first element (a[0]), then the new min is a[1], and the max is a[-1]. Similarly, if I remove the last element, the new max is a[-2], min is a[0].\n\nSo for the sorted array, the instability after removing element i would be:\n\nIf i is not the first or last element, the instability is a[-1] - a[0], which is the same as the original instability. But if we remove the first element, then the instability is a[-1] - a[1]. If we remove the last element, it's a[-2] - a[0]. \n\nWait, but that's only true if the array is sorted. So perhaps the optimal way is to sort the array first, and then check the cases where removing the first element, the last element, or some other element. But wait, if the array is sorted, then the only way to reduce the instability is by removing either the first or last element. Because if you remove any element in the middle, the max and min remain the same. So the instability remains the same as the original. Therefore, the minimal instability would be the minimum between (max of original array minus min of original array) when you remove the first element, or when you remove the last element. Wait, but maybe there are cases where removing an element in the middle can lead to a smaller instability?\n\nWait, no. Because if the array is sorted, then the max is a[-1], min is a[0]. If I remove any element in the middle, the max and min remain the same. So the instability is a[-1] - a[0]. However, if I remove the first element, the new min is a[1], and the max is a[-1], so the instability is a[-1] - a[1]. Similarly, if I remove the last element, the instability is a[-2] - a[0]. So, the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0], and a[-1] - a[0]). Wait, but why is that?\n\nBecause when you remove the first element, the instability is a[-1] - a[1]. When you remove the last element, it's a[-2] - a[0]. When you remove any other element, the instability is a[-1] - a[0]. So the minimal possible is the minimum between these two possibilities (removing first, removing last, or removing some other element). But the other elements don't change the max and min. So the minimal instability would be the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0], and a[-1] - a[0]). Wait, but the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. If I remove an element in the middle, the instability is same as original. So, the minimal possible instability is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0], and the original instability? No, because the original instability is a[-1] - a[0], which is larger than a[-1] - a[1] if a[1] is larger than a[0]. So, for example, if the array is sorted, then the best options are to remove the first element or the last element. Because removing the first element gives us a[-1] - a[1], which may be smaller than the original instability. Similarly for removing the last element.\n\nSo, the answer would be the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]). Because when you remove the first element, the instability is a[-1] - a[1], and when you remove the last element, it's a[-2] - a[0]. And for all other elements, the instability remains the same as original, which is a[-1] - a[0]. So the minimal possible instability is the minimum between those two values.\n\nWait, but what if the array has multiple elements with the same value? Like the example given in the problem: [1,3,3,7]. When sorted, it's [1,3,3,7]. The original instability is 7-1=6. If you remove the first element (1), the instability is 7-3=4. If you remove the last element (7), the instability is 3-1=2. Which is better. So the answer is 2. Which matches the example. So in this case, the minimal is between a[-2] - a[0] (which is 3-1=2) and a[-1] - a[1] (7-3=4). So the minimum is 2.\n\nAnother example is when the array is [1, 100000]. Removing either element leaves a single element, so instability is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Sort the array.\n- Compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n- That's the answer.\n\nWait, but what about when n is 2? For example, n=2, the array is [a, b]. Then, when you remove one element, the array has one element, so the instability is zero. So in this case, the answer is zero. Which is covered by the above approach. Because sorted array is [a, b], a[-2] - a[0] is a - a = 0, and a[-1] - a[1] is b - a. So the minimum between 0 and (b - a) is 0, which is correct.\n\nSo the general approach would be:\n\nSort the array, then compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what about when n is 3? For example, array [1, 2, 3]. Original instability is 2. If we remove 1, the instability is 3-2=1. If we remove 3, instability is 2-1=1. If we remove 2, instability is 3-1=2. So the minimal is 1. Which is the minimum between (a[-1]-a[1] = 3-2=1) and (a[-2] - a[0] = 2-1=1). So the answer is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 3, 5, 7]. Original instability is 6. If we remove 1: instability is 7-3=4. Remove 7: 5-1=4. Remove 3: instability is 7-1=6. Remove 5: same as original. So the minimal is 4. Which is min(7-3, 5-1) = 4.\n\nSo yes, the approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple elements? For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Then, removing the first element gives 4-2=2. Removing the last element gives 4-1=3. So the minimum is 2. Which is better. But what if the array is [1, 2, 4, 5]. Then, removing first gives 5-2=3, removing last gives 4-1=3. So the answer is 3. But if you remove the 4, the instability is 5-1=4, which is worse. So the approach is correct.\n\nSo the conclusion is that after sorting, the minimal instability is the minimum between the instability when removing the first element (a[-1] - a[1]) and when removing the last element (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what if the array is [1, 1, 1, 1]. Then, removing any element gives instability 0. So the code would compute a[-1] - a[1] = 1-1=0, and a[-2] - a[0] = 1-1=0. So the minimum is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: [1, 2, 2, 3]. Original instability is 2. If you remove first element, instability is 3-2=1. If you remove last element, 2-1=1. So the answer is 1. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the approach is:\n\nSort the array, then compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nSo the code steps would be:\n\nRead n, read the array, sort it.\n\nIf n == 2, then the answer is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the two options: (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]), take the minimum between them.\n\nWait, but what about when n is 3? Let's see.\n\nFor example, n=3, array [1, 2, 3]. The options are (3-2) = 1 and (2-1) = 1. So the answer is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nSort the array, then compute min( a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0] )\n\nBut wait, what about if n is 4? Let's say the array is [1, 3, 5, 7]. Then, the options are 7-3=4 and 5-1=4. So the answer is 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nSort the array.\n\nIf n == 2, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nWait, but why not consider other possibilities? Like, for example, if there's an element in the middle that's very large or very small. But in the sorted array, the first element is the smallest, the last is the largest. So removing any element other than the first or last will leave the max and min as the same as before. So the instability is the same as original. So the minimal possible instability is the minimum between the two options of removing first or last.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the steps in Python would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the array as list of integers.\n\nSort the array.\n\nIf n == 2: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\noption2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\nresult = min(option1, option2)\n\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but what if n is 3? Let's see.\n\nFor example, array [1, 2, 3]. The options are 3-2=1 and 2-1=1. So min is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: array [1, 1, 3]. Sorted. Then option1 is 3 - 1 = 2, option2 is 1 - 1 = 0. So the answer is 0. Which is correct. Because removing the last element (3) gives [1,1], instability 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nLet's test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7 → sorted is [1,3,3,7]\n\noption1: a[-1] - a[1] = 7 - 3 = 4.\n\noption2: a[-2] - a[0] = 3 - 1 = 2. min is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2\n\n1 100000 → sorted is [1, 100000]. n is 2, output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, array [1, 2, 5]. options are 5-2=3 and 2-1=1. So answer is 1. Which is correct (remove the last element, array becomes [1,2], instability 1).\n\nAnother test case: n=3, array [1, 5, 5]. options are 5 - 5 = 0 and 5-1=4. So answer is 0. Which is correct (remove the first element, array [5,5], instability 0).\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead list of integers.\n\nSort.\n\nif n == 2: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\noption2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\nprint(min(option1, option2))\n\nBut wait, what about when n is 1? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 2. So no problem.\n\nSo code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nWait, but what about when n is larger than 2, but after removing some element in the middle, the instability is even less?\n\nWait, for example, let's say the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The original instability is 4. If we remove the first element, instability is 4 (5-2=3?), no. Wait, original array is [1,2,3,4,5]. After removing first element, array is [2,3,4,5]. Instability is 5-2=3. Which is option1. option2 is a[-2] - a[0] = 4 - 1 = 3. So min is 3. Which is correct.\n\nBut if I remove the third element (3), the array is [1,2,4,5], instability is 5-1=4, which is worse than 3. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother example: array [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Original instability is 5. If you remove 1, the instability is 6-3=3. If you remove 6, instability is 5-1=4. So the code returns min(3,4) = 3. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]. Then, the options are 6 - 2 =4, and 5 -1=4. So the answer is 4. But if you remove 4, the array is [1,2,5,6], instability is 5. Which is worse. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nLet me check the sample input again.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7 → sorted [1,3,3,7]\n\noption1 is 7 - 3 =4 (a[-1] - a[1])\n\noption2 is 3 -1 =2 (a[-2] - a[0])\n\nso min(4,2) is 2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n1 100000 → output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, array [5, 1, 1]. sorted is [1,1,5]. option1 is 5 -1 =4, option2 is 1 -1 =0. So answer is 0. Which is correct (remove 5, array [1,1]).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, write the Python code accordingly.\n\nBut wait, the code needs to read input from stdin. So in the example, the input is given as a list of lines. For example, the first input is '4\\n1 3 3 7', but in the code, the input is read via input().\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. First line is n, second line is the array. So the code should read n as int(input()), then the next line as list of integers.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\nSort a.\n\nIf n == 2: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute option1 and option2 as explained.\n\nPrint min(option1, option2).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nif n == 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nThis should work.\n\nLet me test the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7 → sorted [1,3,3,7]\n\noption1: 7 -3=4\n\noption2: 3 -1=2 → min is 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, input 1 100000 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1,2,5] → sorted [1,2,5]. option1: 5-2=3, option2: 2-1=1 → min is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, [1,2,3,4,5]. option1 is 5-2=3, option2 is 4-1=3. So answer 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the minimum and maximum values after removing an element.\n2. **Consider Edge Cases**: If the array has only two elements, removing either element results in zero instability.\n3. **Evaluate Key Scenarios**: After sorting, the optimal element to remove is either the first or the last element of the sorted array. This is because removing these elements reduces the range (difference between max and min) the most. We evaluate two scenarios:\n   - Removing the first element: The instability becomes the difference between the last element and the second element.\n   - Removing the last element: The instability becomes the difference between the second last element and the first element.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nif n == 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements, which are crucial for calculating instability.\n- **Handling Edge Case for Two Elements**: Directly return 0 since removing any element from a two-element array leaves a single element with zero instability.\n- **Evaluating Instability After Removal**: By considering the removal of the first and last elements in the sorted array, we efficiently determine the minimum possible instability by comparing the resulting ranges from these two scenarios.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum instability in O(n log n) time complexity due to sorting, followed by constant time operations for evaluating the instability scenarios.",
