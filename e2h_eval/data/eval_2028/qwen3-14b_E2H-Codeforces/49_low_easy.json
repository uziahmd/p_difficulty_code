They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on the given GCD and LCM values on the edges. Hmm. So each edge between two nodes (lawns) has a GCD and LCM of the mushrooms on those two nodes. My task is to find possible values for each node or determine that it's impossible.\n\nFirst, let's think about the constraints. For any two nodes u and v connected by an edge with GCD g and LCM l, we know that the numbers a_u and a_v must satisfy:\n\ngcd(a_u, a_v) = g\nlcm(a_u, a_v) = l\n\nBut there's a relationship between GCD and LCM: gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = a * b. So, for each edge, the product of the GCD and LCM should be equal to the product of the two node values. However, since the GCD and LCM are given, we can check if their product is a perfect square? No, wait. Wait, the product of the GCD and LCM is a*b. So, for example, if the GCD is g and LCM is l, then g*l must be equal to a*b. But since a and b are multiples of g, perhaps we can represent them as a = g * x, b = g * y, where x and y are coprime. Then, the LCM of a and b would be g * x * y. Because LCM(a,b) = (a*b)/gcd(a,b) = (g²xy)/g = gxy. So, in that case, the LCM is gxy. Which implies that l = gxy. Therefore, l must be divisible by g. So, for each edge, we must have that l % g == 0. Otherwise, it's impossible. That's a check we can do first. If any of the edges have l not divisible by g, then immediately output NO.\n\nSo first step: for each edge, check if LCM is divisible by GCD. If not, return NO.\n\nOnce that is done, for each edge, we can represent the two nodes as g*x and g*y, with x and y coprime, and l = g * x * y. Therefore, x * y = l / g. Let's call that value k. So x*y = k. Also, since x and y are coprime, then x and y must be divisors of k, and their product is k, and they are coprime. So for example, if k is 6, then possible (x,y) pairs are (1,6), (6,1), (2,3), (3,2). But since x and y are coprime, they can't share any factors.\n\nBut how does this help us? Well, for each edge, the two nodes must be multiples of g. And their ratio (when divided by g) must be coprime and multiply to k.\n\nBut how do we assign these values across the entire graph?\n\nThis seems like a graph problem where each node's value is determined by constraints from edges. Since each edge connects two nodes, the values are interdependent. So perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node's value is determined relative to others, and we need to assign values such that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet me think of this as a graph where each connected component can be handled separately. Because if two nodes are in different components, their values don't affect each other. So the first thing is to check for each connected component whether it's possible to assign values.\n\nBut how to model the relationships between nodes. For example, suppose we have a chain of nodes connected by edges. Let's say node A is connected to node B with some GCD and LCM, and node B is connected to node C with another GCD and LCM. How can we model the relations between A, B, and C?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a Union-Find data structure, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node has a value that is a multiple of certain factors, and we need to assign variables in a way that satisfies all constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each connected component, we can assign a base value to one of the nodes, and then compute the rest based on the edges. But how?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of variables. Suppose for each node, we have a value a_i. For each edge between u and v, we have:\n\ngcd(a_u, a_v) = g_uv\nlcm(a_u, a_v) = l_uv\n\nWhich implies that a_u = g_uv * x, a_v = g_uv * y, where x and y are coprime",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on given GCD and LCM values on edges between lawns. The solution involves checking constraints and using a graph traversal approach to assign valid mushroom counts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Validity of Edges**: For each edge, ensure that the LCM is divisible by the GCD. If not, it's impossible to satisfy the constraints, and we immediately return \"NO\".\n2. **Graph Traversal**: Use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the graph. For each connected component, assign mushroom counts starting from an arbitrary node and propagate values through the edges while ensuring the constraints are met.\n3. **Value Assignment**: For each edge, derive possible values for the nodes using the relationship between GCD and LCM. This involves checking if the derived values are consistent with existing assignments in the graph.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    m = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    edges = []\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(input[ptr]) - 1\n        ptr += 1\n        v = int(input[ptr]) - 1\n        ptr += 1\n        g = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        edges.append((u, v, g, l))\n        graph[u].append((v, g, l))\n        graph[v].append((u, g, l))\n\n    # Check for each edge if l % g == 0\n    for u, v, g, l in edges:\n        if l % g != 0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n\n    # Now, try to assign values\n    ans = [None] * n\n    visited = [False] * n\n\n    def dfs(u, value):\n        stack = [(u, value)]\n        visited[u] = True\n        ans[u] = value\n        while stack:\n            node, val = stack.pop()\n            for neighbor, g, l in graph[node]:\n                if visited[neighbor]:\n                    # Check if current assignment is consistent\n                    if ans[neighbor] is not None:\n                        if math.gcd(val, ans[neighbor]) != g or (val * ans[neighbor]) // math.gcd(val, ans[neighbor]) != l:\n                            return False\n                    continue\n                # Compute possible value for neighbor\n                k = l // g\n                # val = g * x, neighbor_val = g * y, x*y = k and gcd(x,y)=1\n                # So, x = val / g, y = k / x\n                x = val // g\n                if k % x != 0:\n                    return False\n                y = k // x\n                neighbor_val = g * y\n                # Check if x and y are coprime\n                if math.gcd(x, y) != 1:\n                    return False\n                visited[neighbor] = True\n                ans[neighbor] = neighbor_val\n                stack.append((neighbor, neighbor_val))\n        return True\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            # Start with some value, but what?\n            # Need to find a starting value for i\n            # Let's pick the first edge connected to i and try to assign\n            # But how?
