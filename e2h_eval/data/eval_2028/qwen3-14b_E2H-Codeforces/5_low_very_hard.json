Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color, which can be a lowercase letter or a question mark. The goal is to pair as many left-right boots as possible such that their colors are compatible. Compatibility rules: same specific color, or one of them is a question mark. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nThe output is the maximum number of pairs and their indices.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, think about how to maximize the pairs. Let's consider different cases.\n\nIdea: We can first pair the left boots with specific colors (non-?) with right boots that have the same specific color. Then, handle the remaining question marks.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\n1. For each color (excluding ?), count how many left boots have that color, and how many right boots have that color. For each color c, the number of pairs we can form here is min(left[c], right[c]). But since each boot can be used once, we need to track which ones are used.\n\nBut wait, maybe we should first pair the left and right boots with specific colors, then use the remaining question marks to pair with any remaining boots.\n\nBut how to handle the question marks? Because they can be paired with any other boots (including other ?s).\n\nSo perhaps the approach is:\n\n- First, pair all specific colors between left and right. For example, for each color c, pair as many left c with right c as possible. But how to do this without overlapping?\n\nWait, but if I process each color in order, and for each, pair as much as possible, then that might work. However, the order might affect the total. For example, if we have a lot of 'a's on left and right, but also some 'b's, but maybe pairing 'a's first is better than others. However, since the total is the sum over all min(left[c], right[c]), maybe processing each color in any order would give the same total. But maybe not, because after pairing some, the remaining may be better handled by the ?s.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to first pair the specific colors, then use the ?s to pair with the remaining.\n\nBut how to model that.\n\nAnother approach: Let's first pair left and right boots where both are specific colors. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which could include ?s), pair them using the ?s.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the data structures.\n\nFor the first step, we can create two dictionaries: left_count and right_count. For each color (not ?), left_count[c] is the number of left boots with color c. Similarly for right_count. Then, for each color c, the number of pairs we can make is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). But when we pair them, we need to track which specific boots are used. However, for the problem, we need to output the actual indices of the pairs, so we need to track which positions are used.\n\nBut perhaps for the first part, we can collect all the left and right boots with specific colors, and pair them. Let's think of it as follows:\n\nFor each color c (not '?'), collect all the left boots with color c, and all the right boots with color c. Then, pair them up as much as possible. For example, for each such c, we can pair the first min(len(left_c), len(right_c)) pairs.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used. So, perhaps we can create a list for each color, and then for each color, pair them in order.\n\nOnce those are paired, the remaining left and right boots (with specific colors) can't be paired with others of the same color. Then, we can use the ?s to pair with any remaining boots.\n\nBut then, the ?s can be used in two ways: as a left boot that can pair with any right boot (including ?s) or as a right boot that can pair with any left boot.\n\nSo, after pairing the specific colors, we have:\n\nLeft boots that are either ? or have colors that couldn't be matched (because the other side didn't have enough). Similarly for right boots.\n\nNow, for the ?s, perhaps we can pair them in a way that uses as many as possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Pair left and right boots with specific colors (same color). For each color, pair as many as possible. Record these pairs.\n\n2. Then, collect the remaining left boots (those not yet paired) and remaining right boots (those not yet paired).\n\n3. Now, the remaining left boots can be:\n\n   a. Those with specific colors (but their counterparts in the other side were not",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve the \"Colored Boots\" problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs between left and right boots. Each boot can be either a specific color or an indefinite color (denoted by '?'). The compatibility rules allow pairing specific colors with themselves, or any color with an indefinite ('?').\n\n### Approach\n1. **Pair Specific Colors First**: For each specific color (excluding '?'), pair as many left boots with the same color right boots as possible. This ensures that specific color pairs are maximized first.\n2. **Handle Indefinite Colors**: After pairing specific colors, use the remaining indefinite ('?') boots to pair with any remaining boots (specific or indefinite). This is done by pairing left '?' with right non-'?', and then remaining '?' with other '?'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n\n    # We need to read all test cases, but the input format is unclear from the example.\n    # Wait, the original problem says that the input is given in the standard way.\n    # But the user provided an example where the input is a list of test cases.
