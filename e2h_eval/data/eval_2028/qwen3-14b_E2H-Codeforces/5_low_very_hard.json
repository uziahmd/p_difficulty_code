Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color which can be a lowercase letter or '?'. The goal is to pair as many left-right boots as possible such that their colors are compatible. Compatibility is when both are same (if they are letters), or one is '?', which can match any. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nThe output needs to be the maximum number of pairs and their indices. If there are multiple solutions, any is acceptable.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, think about how to maximize the pairs. The challenge is to pair the left and right boots optimally.\n\nLet me think about possible strategies.\n\nAn initial idea: For each color (including '?'), count how many left and right boots have that color. Then, for each color, the maximum possible pairs would be min(left_count, right_count). However, since '?' can act as any color, this complicates things.\n\nBut maybe we can process specific colors first, then handle the '?'s.\n\nWait, but if we pair a '?' with a specific color, that uses up both. But perhaps we should first pair the specific colors, then use the remaining '?'s to pair with each other or with remaining specific colors.\n\nWait, here's an approach:\n\n1. For all colors except '?', pair them as much as possible between left and right. For example, for color 'a', take the minimum of the number of left 'a's and right 'a's, and pair them. Then subtract those from the counts.\n\n2. Then, handle the remaining '?'s. But how? Because '?' can be matched with any color, including other '?'s. But since the '?'s can be used as any color, perhaps we can pair them with each other, and also with the leftover specific colors.\n\nWait, but after step 1, there might be some left and right boots with specific colors that couldn't be paired because there were not enough on the other side. For example, if there are more left 'a's than right 'a's, then after pairing min(left_a, right_a), there are left_a - right_a left 'a's left. These can't be paired with any other specific color (since they are 'a's, and the other side may not have 'a's). But they can be paired with '?'s.\n\nSo perhaps the steps are:\n\n- First, pair all specific colors (non-?) between left and right. For each color c (not ?), pair as many as possible between left and right. For example, for each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_c, right_c). Then, subtract those from left and right counts.\n\n- Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which could be either specific or ?), pair the '?'s with each other and with the remaining specific colors.\n\nBut how to do that optimally?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as two parts:\n\n- Pairing between specific colors (non-?) on left and right. For each color c, pair as much as possible between left and right.\n\n- Then, pair the remaining left and right boots (could be ? or specific colors that couldn't be paired) with each other, using the ? as wildcards.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother approach: Let's create two dictionaries, left_counts and right_counts, which count the number of each color (including ?) in left and right strings.\n\nBut the problem is that the pairing is between individual boots, not just counts. So, we need to track which boots are used.\n\nBut for the purpose of maximizing the count, perhaps we can first process the specific colors (non-?), then process the ?.\n\nWait, but the problem requires us to output the actual pairs, not just the count. So the algorithm must track which boots are used.\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's think about the steps again.\n\nFirst, for each color c (excluding ?), we can pair left boots with color c with right boots with color c. For each such pair, we can find the indices and pair them. However, we need to make sure that once a boot is paired, it's not used again.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nAn alternative idea is to collect all the positions of each color in left and right. For example, for each color c, have a list of indices where left has color c, and similarly for right.\n\nThen, for each color c (not ?), we can pair the left and right positions in a way that uses as many as possible. For example, for color c, take the first min(len(left_c_list), len(right_c_list)) pairs.\n\nOnce these are paired, we can remove those positions from the available lists.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots (those not yet paired), we can pair the ?s with each other and with the remaining specific colors",
    "response": "To solve the Colored Boots problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs between left and right boots. Each boot can be either a specific color (lowercase letter) or an indefinite color (denoted by '?'). A pair is compatible if both are the same specific color or one of them is '?'.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Specific Colors**: First, count the occurrences of each specific color (excluding '?') in both left and right boots.\n2. **Pair Specific Colors**: For each specific color, pair as many left boots with right boots of the same color.\n3. **Handle Indefinite Colors**: After pairing specific colors, handle the remaining boots with '?' on both sides.
