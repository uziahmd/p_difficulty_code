In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The input is three tiles. We need to determine the minimum number of tiles to add so that there's at least one mentsu in the hand. The answer can be 0 if there's already a mentsu, otherwise calculate the minimal steps.\n\nSo the first thing I should do is check whether the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, then answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimal number of tiles needed to add to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases.\n\nCase 1: Check if the existing three tiles form a triplet. That's easy: all three are same. For example, 9m 9m 9m. Then answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: Check if they form a sequence. For that, they must be in the same suit, and their numbers are consecutive. Like 1s 2s 3s. But the order doesn't matter, so we can sort them and check.\n\nIf either of these is true, then answer is 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add. So how?\n\nLet me think about the possible ways to form a triplet or sequence with the existing tiles plus some added ones.\n\nFor example, in the third sample input: 3p 9m 2p. The existing tiles don't form any mentsu. But adding one tile (like 1p or 4p) allows forming a sequence with 2p,3p,1p or 2p,3p,4p.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nSo how to model this?\n\nThe approach would be to check for all possible ways to form a triplet or sequence with the existing tiles, and compute the minimal number of tiles needed to reach that.\n\nSo for each possible mentsu (triplet or sequence), calculate how many tiles are missing from the current hand, and take the minimal among all those possibilities.\n\nBut how to generate all possible mentsu that can be formed by adding some tiles?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider all possible triplets and sequences that could be formed with the existing tiles, and find the minimal number of tiles needed to reach that.\n\nBut since the existing tiles are only three, maybe we can look for possible ways to form a triplet or sequence by adding tiles.\n\nLet me think about possible scenarios:\n\nFor triplet:\n\nWe need three of the same tile. So, for each tile type in the current hand, we can check how many are present. For example, if there are two of a certain tile, then adding one more would make a triplet. Or if there is one, then adding two more. Or if there are zero, then adding three. But since the current hand has three tiles, maybe there's a possibility that two are same, but others are different.\n\nWait, but for example, if the current tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then to form a triplet, you can add another 1m (so total 3) or add two 2m's (but then you have 1m, 1m, 2m, 2m, 2m. But that would require adding two tiles. However, the triplet could be formed by adding one tile (the third 1m). So the minimal is 1.\n\nBut for the triplet case, the minimal number of tiles needed to add is (3 - count of that tile) in the current hand.\n\nSo for each possible tile (all possible 9*3 = 27 types?), we can check how many are present in the current hand, and compute the required additions. Then take the minimal of these values.\n\nBut since the current hand has three tiles, perhaps there are multiple possibilities here.\n\nFor example, if the current hand has two different tiles, like 1m, 1m, 2m. Then for the triplet of 1m, need 1 tile. For the triplet of 2m, need 2 tiles. For any other triplet, like 3m, need 3 tiles. So the minimal is 1.\n\nBut this is just for triplet possibilities. Similarly, for sequences, we need to find all possible sequences (three consecutive numbers in same suit) and see how many tiles are missing from the current hand.\n\nSo for example, if the current hand has 1s, 2s, 3s: already a sequence. So 0. If it has 1s, 2s, 4s: then the sequence could be formed by adding 3",
