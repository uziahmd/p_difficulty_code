Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum number of steps to move from a home block to a university block, moving through adjacent blocks. The adjacency is determined by sharing a nonzero boundary segment, which means that two blocks are adjacent if they are separated by exactly one road. \n\nFirst, let me understand the problem better. Each road divides the plane into regions. The key here is that moving from one block to another requires crossing a road. But the movement is allowed only if the two blocks share a common border of non-zero length. So, for example, if two blocks are on opposite sides of a single road, then they are adjacent and can be moved between in one step. However, if two blocks are separated by multiple roads, then you need to cross each road step by step.\n\nThe challenge is to model the blocks and their adjacency relationships, then find the shortest path from the home block to the university block. However, directly modeling all blocks is impossible because there are infinitely many blocks. So, I need a smarter way to represent the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node represents a region (block), and edges represent adjacency. But since there are infinitely many regions, how do we model this?\n\nAlternative approach: Think about the problem in terms of the roads. For any given point (like home or university), the position relative to each road can be determined. Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. The block that contains the home point can be uniquely determined by the signs of the equations of each road. For example, for each road, the home point is either on one side or the other. So, the home's block is determined by the sign of each road's equation evaluated at (x1, y1). Similarly for the university.\n\nNow, two blocks are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because moving across a road changes the sign of exactly that road's equation. So, if two blocks differ in exactly one road's sign, then they are adjacent. Because that implies that they share a common border (the road in question). But wait, what if there are multiple roads? For example, if two blocks differ in two roads' signs, then they are not adjacent. Because to get from one to the other, you'd have to cross two roads, which might not be possible in one step.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of roads' sign differences between the home and university blocks. Because each step can change one sign (crossing one road). Therefore, the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads where the sign of the home and university differ. Wait, no. Because maybe there's a way to reach the university block by changing signs in a different order. But perhaps the minimal steps is the number of differing signs, but that's not necessarily the case. Let me think again.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose there are two roads. Home is in a region that is positive for both roads. University is negative for both. Then, the number of differing signs is 2. So, you need to cross both roads. But how? Because each step crosses one road. So, you can go from home's block to a block that is negative for the first road, then to a block that is negative for both. So two steps. Which matches the number of differing signs. \n\nAnother example: suppose there are three roads. Home is positive for all. University is negative for road 1 and positive for others. Then, differing signs is 1. So, one step. Correct.\n\nBut what if the home and university differ in k roads. Then the minimal steps is k? Because each step can flip one sign. So, the minimal steps is the number of roads where the signs differ between home and university. \n\nWait, but how do we know that there's a path that allows flipping each differing sign one by one? Because each time, you can cross a road, changing the sign. So, for example, if you have two differing roads, you can cross one, then cross the other. So the minimal steps would be the number of differing signs.\n\nBut why can't there be a situation where some roads are overlapping in such a way that you can flip two signs with one step? No, because each step can only cross one road. Because crossing a road changes exactly one sign. So, the minimal steps is exactly the number of differing signs between home and university.\n\nWait, but this seems too straightforward. Let me check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university (-1,-1). There are two roads: 0x +1y +0 =0 → y=0, and 1x+0y +0=0 → x=0. \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nFor first road (y=0): 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1>0.",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a non-zero boundary segment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Block Representation**: Each block can be uniquely identified by the sign of the result when evaluating the coordinates of a point (home or university) against each road equation. This is because each road divides the plane into two half-planes, and a point's position relative to each road determines its block.\n\n2. **Sign Differences**: The key insight is that moving from one block to another adjacent block involves crossing exactly one road. Therefore, the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is determined by the number of roads where the signs of the results for the home and university coordinates differ.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: For each road, evaluate the sign of the result when substituting the home coordinates and the university coordinates into the road equation. Count the number of roads where these signs differ. This count directly gives the minimum number of steps needed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Calculate sign for home and university\n    home_signs = []\n    univ_signs = []\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val_univ = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        home_signs.append(1 if val_home > 0 else -1)\n        univ_signs.append(1 if val_univ > 0 else -1)\n    \n    # Count differing signs\n    diff = 0\n    for h, u in zip(home_signs, univ_signs):\n        if h != u:\n            diff += 1\n    print(diff)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the coordinates of the home, university, and the list of roads.\n2. **Sign Calculation**: For each road, compute the value of the road equation at the home and university coordinates. Determine the sign of these values (positive or negative).\n3. **Difference Counting**: Count how many roads have different signs for the home and university coordinates. This count represents the minimum number of steps needed, as each differing sign indicates a road that must be crossed to move between blocks.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
