Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. For every 'b' used candles, he can make a new one. And this new one can be used again, which in turn will become another used candle after burning.\n\nThe example given is when a=4 and b=2. The output is 7. Let me think through that example. \n\nFirst, he uses 4 candles, which gives 4 hours. Then, those 4 used candles are turned into 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those 2, adding 2 hours. Now, those 2 used ones are turned into 2/2=1 new. Use that, adding 1 hour. Now, that one is used, but 1 < 2, so no more. Total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Right.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the total hours, and also the number of used candles that can be recycled. \n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nInitially, total_hours = a. Because he uses all a candles first. Then, the used_candles = a. Then, while used_candles >= b, we can make new candles. Each time, the number of new candles is used_candles // b. Then, add that to total_hours. Then, the new used_candles is (used_candles % b) + (new_candles). Because the ones that were used to make the new ones are now gone (they were used to make the new ones), but the new ones will be used, so when they burn out, they add to the used_candles again.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's take the example:\n\nInitial a=4, total_hours=4. used_candles=4.\n\nThen, 4//2=2 new candles. Add 2 hours. Now total is 6. The used_candles now is 4 - (4//2)*2 + 2? Wait, no. Wait, when you make new candles, you take the used ones. So for each new candle made, you need to subtract b used candles and add 1 new candle. But the new candle is then used, so after making them, the used_candles would be (original_used_candles - (number of new candles * b)) + (number of new candles). Because the new candles are now used once, so they become part of the used_candles again.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to model it as:\n\nEach time, the number of new candles is floor(used_candles / b). Then, the remaining used_candles is (used_candles % b) + new_candles. Because the new_candles are now used once (so they are added to the used_candles when they burn out). Wait, no. Because when you make new candles, you take the used ones. So for example, if you have 4 used candles, and b=2, you make 2 new candles. The 4 used ones are consumed in the process. Then, those 2 new candles are used, which adds 2 to the used_candles. So after that, the used_candles is 0 (from the original 4) + 2 (the new ones that are now used). So the next step is 2, which can be divided by 2 again. So the process is:\n\nused_candles = 4\n\nnew_candles = 4 // 2 = 2. total_hours += 2 (now 6). Then, the used_candles becomes 4 % 2 = 0 + 2 (the new ones that are now used) = 2. \n\nThen, new_candles = 2//2=1. total_hours +=1 (7). used_candles becomes 0 +1 =1. Now, since 1 < 2, we stop. \n\nSo the way to model this is:\n\ntotal_hours = a\n\nused_candles = a\n\nwhile used_candles >= b:\n\n    new_candles = used_candles // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    used_candles = (used_candles % b) + new_candles\n\nSo that's the loop. \n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward. Let's test with the sample input.\n\nAnother example: input 6 3. Output is 8.\n\nLet's see:\n\ntotal_hours starts at 6. used_candles =6.\n\nLoop:\n\n6//3=2. total becomes 6+2=8. used_candles = 6%3=0 +2 =2. Now, 2 <3. So done. So total is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: suppose a=5, b=3.\n\nInitial total is 5. used_candles=5.\n\nFirst loop: 5//3=1. total becomes 6. used_candles =5%3=2 +1=3.\n\nNext loop: 3//3=1. total becomes 7. used_candles =0 +1=1. Now stop. So total is 7.\n\nAnother example: a=3, b=3. Initial total is 3. used_candles=3. Then 3//3=1. total is 4. used_candles is 0 +1=1. No more. So total is 4.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=3. Then initial total is 2. used_candles=2. Since 2 <3, done. So total is 2.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead a and b.\n\ntotal = a\n\nused = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    used = (used % b) + new\n\nreturn total.\n\nYes. So that's the logic.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nThe input is two integers per line. Wait, the input is a single line with two integers. Wait, the input example shows ['4 2', '6 3'] as input, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is a single line with two integers a and b. The output is a single integer.\n\nWait, the example shows two inputs, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases. But in the problem statement, the input is a single line. So perhaps the user is supposed to read a single line, split into a and b.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n4 2\n\nSample Output:\n\n7\n\nAnother sample input is 6 3, output 8.\n\nSo the code needs to read a single line, split into a and b, compute the answer.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead a and b from input.\n\nImplement the algorithm above.\n\nSo in Python:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nused = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    used = (used % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, let's test this with the sample.\n\nFor 4 2:\n\ntotal starts at 4, used=4.\n\nLoop: 4//2=2. total becomes 6. used = 4%2=0 +2=2.\n\nLoop again: 2//2=1. total 7. used = 0 +1=1. Loop ends.\n\nYes. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: 6 3.\n\ntotal=6, used=6.\n\n6//3=2. total 8. used=6%3=0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. Done. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=3. As discussed, returns 7. Let's see:\n\ntotal=5, used=5.\n\nLoop: 5//3=1. total=6. used=5%3=2 +1=3.\n\nLoop again: 3//3=1. total=7. used=0+1=1. Done. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=3. total=3, used=3. new=1. total=4. used=0+1=1. Done.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=3. total=2. used=2. No loop. Output 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nWhat if a=1, b=2. Then total is 1. Because used=1 <2. So output is 1.\n\nAnother case: a=1000, b=2. Let's see. How many times can we loop?\n\nWell, the process is similar to counting the number of times you can divide by b, accumulating the quotient each time.\n\nBut the code should handle that.\n\nAnother case: a=1, b=1. Wait, but according to the input constraints, b is at least 2. So no need to handle that.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases where a is between 1 and 1000, and b between 2 and 1000.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Vasily can light up his room using candles, considering he can reuse the burned-out candles to make new ones. The solution involves simulating the process of burning candles and reusing the remnants optimally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Burn**: Start by burning all the initial candles, which gives us the initial number of hours equal to the number of candles.\n2. **Recycling Process**: After burning all initial candles, use the burned-out candles to make new ones. For every `b` burned-out candles, a new candle can be made.\n3. **Iterative Recycling**: Continue the process of making new candles from the burned-out ones until there are not enough burned-out candles left to make a new one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nused = a\nwhile used >= b:\n    new = used // b\n    total += new\n    used = (used % b) + new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Read the input values `a` (number of initial candles) and `b` (number of burned-out candles needed to make a new one). Initialize `total` to `a` because each initial candle burns for one hour.\n2. **Track Used Candles**: Maintain a count of used candles (`used`) starting with the initial count `a`.\n3. **Recycling Loop**: While there are enough used candles to make at least one new candle:\n   - Calculate the number of new candles that can be made from the used ones.\n   - Add these new candles to the total hours.\n   - Update the count of used candles to include the remnants from the recycling process and the newly made candles that will be burned out in the future.\n4. **Termination**: The loop terminates when there are not enough used candles left to make a new one, at which point the total hours are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of recycling candles, ensuring that we maximize the number of hours the room can be illuminated. The algorithm runs in O(log a) time complexity due to the repeated division of used candles, making it efficient even for the upper constraint limits.",
