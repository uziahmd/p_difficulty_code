For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between the notes work. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order of 12, so each note has a position. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, and so on up to H (which is B in some notations, but here it's H). Wait, the problem statement says the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, that's 12 notes. Let me list them:\n\nLet me index them from 0 to 11. Let's create a list or a dictionary that maps each note to its index. For example:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but then after H comes C again. So the distance between two notes is calculated as (target - start) mod 12, but since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. Wait, the problem says: the distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of semitones from X to Y along the scale. So if X is C and Y is E, that's 4 semitones. Because C to C# is 1, then D (2), D# (3), E (4). So the distance from X to Y is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12? But if Y is after X in the list, then it's just the difference. But if Y is before X, then it's (Y's index + 12 - X's index) ?\n\nWait, for example, the distance between E and C. According to the problem, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. The distance between E and C is 8 semitones. So when you go from E to C, you have to go through F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C. That's 8 steps. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but if the distance is negative, then add 12? Or perhaps the distance is computed as (Y_index - X_index) if Y is higher than X, else (Y_index + 12 - X_index). But that's equivalent to (Y_index - X_index) mod 12? Wait no, because if Y is before X, then (Y - X) would be negative, and mod 12 would give the positive value. For example, if X is E (index 4), Y is C (index 0). Then Y - X is -4, mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then it's Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then it's (Y + 12 - X). So that's exactly (Y - X) mod 12, but since the problem says that the distance is always measured as the number of semitones from the lower to upper note. So when we have two notes, the distance between them is (Y - X) mod 12. But when considering the distance between X and Y, if X is lower than Y, then it's Y - X. Otherwise, it's 12 - (X - Y).\n\nBut for the problem, when checking for major or minor triads, the order of the notes matters. For example, a major triad is when there exists an ordering X, Y, Z such that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. So the total distance between X and Z would be 7 semitones. But since the triad is unordered, we have to check all possible permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies the conditions.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Convert each note into its index (like 0 for C, 1 for C#, etc.)\n- Generate all permutations of the three notes (since the order matters for checking the distances)\n- For each permutation (X, Y, Z), check if the distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3. If yes, then it's a major triad.\n- Similarly, check if for any permutation, the distance between X and Y is 3, and between Y and Z is 4. If yes, then it's a minor triad.\n- If none of the permutations satisfy either condition, output 'strange'.\n\nBut how do I generate all permutations of the three notes?\n\nWell, for three elements, there are 3! = 6 permutations. For each of them, check the two conditions (for major and minor).\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, for each possible ordering of the three notes, check if the first two steps meet the required distances.\n\nSo, first, I need to map the note names to their indices. Let's create a dictionary for that.\n\nThe notes are in the order:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nSo the indexes are 0 to 11. So the dictionary would be:\n\nnote_to_index = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is given in the notation with H as the last note. So that's correct.\n\nNow, for each note in the input, we can get their indexes.\n\nOnce I have the three indexes, let's call them a, b, c. But since the order is not fixed, I need to check all permutations of these three.\n\nBut how to generate permutations? Well, for three elements, there are six possible permutations. For example, for [a, b, c], the permutations are:\n\n(a, b, c), (a, c, b), (b, a, c), (b, c, a), (c, a, b), (c, b, a).\n\nFor each permutation, check if the first two steps meet the required distances.\n\nSo for each permutation (x, y, z):\n\ndistance between x and y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12?\n\nWait, no. Because the distance is measured as the number of semitones from X to Y. So if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then the distance is 4. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then the distance is 8. So the distance between X and Y is (y - x) if y > x, else (y + 12 - x). Which is the same as (y - x) % 12, but only if we take the positive value. Wait, (y - x) mod 12 gives the correct value. For example, when x is 4 (E), y is 0 (C), (0 -4) mod 12 is 8, which is correct. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So for example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is 12 - (X - Y). Which is the same as (Y - X) mod 12, but since mod can be negative, but in Python, the mod operator returns a non-negative result. Wait, for example, (0 -4) % 12 = 8. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. However, in the problem's definition, the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones from X to Y. So for example, when X is E and Y is C, the distance is 8 semitones, which is what (Y - X) mod 12 would give. So the correct way to compute the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12.\n\nWait, but for the major triad, the distance between X and Y must be exactly 4 semitones. So for a permutation (X, Y, Z), the distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3. So for that, the code would check:\n\ndistance_xy = (Y_index - X_index) mod 12\n\ndistance_yz = (Z_index - Y_index) mod 12\n\nIf distance_xy ==4 and distance_yz ==3, then it's a major triad.\n\nSimilarly for minor: distance_xy ==3 and distance_yz ==4.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lowest to the upper. So for example, in the case of X and Y, if X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). But that's the same as (Y - X) mod 12. So the calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each permutation of the three notes (as indexes):\n\nCheck if the distance between first and second is 4, and between second and third is 3. If yes, then it's a major.\n\nCheck if the distance between first and second is 3, and between second and third is 4. If yes, then it's a minor.\n\nSo, the code needs to generate all permutations of the three notes, check for each permutation whether it meets the major or minor conditions.\n\nNow, how to generate permutations of the three notes. Let's think: for three elements, the permutations can be generated using itertools.permutations.\n\nBut since the input is three notes, let's say the list is notes = [note1, note2, note3]. Then, for each permutation in permutations(notes), we can process them.\n\nBut for each permutation, we need to get their indexes.\n\nSo, for example, for a permutation (X, Y, Z), we can get their indexes as x, y, z.\n\nThen compute distance between X and Y: (y - x) % 12. If that equals 4, and distance between Y and Z is (z - y) % 12 equals 3, then it's a major.\n\nSimilarly for minor.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead the three notes from input. For example, input is a list of three strings. Then, for each of the three notes, convert to their indexes.\n\nThen generate all permutations of the three indexes.\n\nFor each permutation, check:\n\nif (distance between first and second is 4) and (distance between second and third is 3) → major.\n\nif (distance between first and second is 3) and (distance between second and third is 4) → minor.\n\nIf any permutation meets the major condition, then the answer is 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, there's no case where both are possible.\n\nSo the code can check all permutations, and if any permutation satisfies major, return 'major'; if any permutation satisfies minor, return 'minor'; else 'strange'.\n\nNow, let's think about possible test cases.\n\nFirst example input: ['C', 'E', 'G']\n\nTheir indexes are 0, 4, 7.\n\nPermutations include (C, E, G). Check distance between C and E is 4 (correct), E to G is 3 (7-4=3). So yes, major.\n\nAnother permutation like (E, G, C): distance between E and G is 3 (7-4=3?), wait E is 4, G is 7. So distance is 3. Then between G and C is (0 -7) mod 12 = 5? No, 0-7 is -7 mod 12 is 5. Which is 5. So that's not 3 or 4. So that permutation doesn't meet the conditions.\n\nBut in the permutation (C, G, E), the distance between C and G is 7-0=7 mod 12 is 7. Not 4. So that's not.\n\nBut the first permutation (C, E, G) meets the major condition. So the answer is major.\n\nAnother example: C# B F → the input is ['C#', 'B', 'F'].\n\nThe indexes are C# is 1, B is 10, F is 5.\n\nLooking for permutations. One possible permutation is B, C#, F. Let's check:\n\nB is 10, C# is 1. Distance between B and C# is (1 -10) mod 12 → (1 -10) = -9 mod 12 is 3. Then between C# (1) and F (5): 5 -1 =4. So that's 3 and 4 → minor.\n\nSo that permutation would trigger the minor condition.\n\nSo the code should find that.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, the note_to_index mapping. Let's create a dictionary.\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nBut wait, the note_order list is in the correct order. So the index of each note is its position in the list.\n\nSo the note_to_index can be built as:\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nBut what about the note_order list? Let's make sure that the list is correct.\n\nThe problem statement lists the notes as:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nYes. So the list is correct.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nnote_order[0] is 'C'\n\nnote_order[1] is 'C#'\n\nnote_order[2] is 'D'\n\nnote_order[3] is 'D#'\n\nnote_order[4] is 'E'\n\nnote_order[5] is 'F'\n\nnote_order[6] is 'F#'\n\nnote_order[7] is 'G'\n\nnote_order[8] is 'G#'\n\nnote_order[9] is 'A'\n\nnote_order[10] is 'B'\n\nnote_order[11] is 'H'\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead input: the input is a single line with three space-separated notes. For example, in the sample input, the first case is 'C E G'.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of three elements, but in the problem statement's example, the input is written as ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'], but that's probably a mistake. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo for example, the input is something like:\n\nC E G\n\nBut in the example given, the input is written as a list of three elements, but that's probably part of the example for the output. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nIn the example:\n\nInput:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nOutput:\n\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nAh, but that's probably a mistake. Because the actual input is one line with three notes. But the example seems to be showing three different test cases. So perhaps the input is three separate lines, but the problem says that the input is only one line. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo the input is a single line, for example, \"C E G\".\n\nBut in the sample input, the example shows three different test cases, which may be part of a test suite. However, the code must read a single line of input, split into three notes.\n\nSo, in the code, the input is read as a single line, split into three parts.\n\nSo in Python, the code would read:\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nWhich would give a list of three strings.\n\nOnce we have the three notes, we can get their indexes.\n\nThen, generate all permutations of the three indexes.\n\nFor each permutation, check for major or minor.\n\nSo, for example, in code:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    # Get the indexes of the three notes\n    a, b, c = notes\n    indexes = [note_to_index[a], note_to_index[b], note_to_index[c]]\n    \n    # Generate all permutations of the three indexes\n    for perm in permutations(indexes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        # Compute distances\n        d1 = (y - x) % 12\n        d2 = (z - y) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            return 'major'\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            return 'minor'\n    return 'strange'\n\nWait, but permutations returns all possible orderings. So for each permutation, we check if the first two steps meet the required distances. But since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, once any permutation meets the major or minor condition, we can return immediately.\n\nBut in code, for each permutation, check if it meets the major condition, and if so, return 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut the code above returns as soon as any permutation meets the condition. However, the code may check permutations in a certain order. For example, suppose there are multiple permutations that meet the major condition. But since the problem says that the answer is unique, once any of them is found, we can return.\n\nBut the code above returns as soon as any permutation meets the major or minor condition. However, the code may check permutations in an order that could miss some possibilities. Wait, no. Because for example, if a permutation meets the major condition, then the code returns 'major' immediately. But perhaps another permutation meets the minor condition. But according to the problem statement, the answer is unambiguous. So the code can safely return once any of the conditions is met.\n\nBut in reality, the code may check permutations in a certain order. For example, if there's a permutation that meets the minor condition and another that meets the major condition, but the code checks the minor first, then returns minor. But according to the problem statement, the answer is unambiguous. So this scenario is impossible. Therefore, the code can check for major and minor in any order, and return the first occurrence.\n\nBut in the code above, for each permutation, it checks for major first, then minor. So if a permutation meets both conditions (but according to the problem statement, that's impossible), but in practice, the code would return 'major' first.\n\nBut the problem says that the answer is unique. So for a valid input, there's no possibility of having both major and minor conditions satisfied. So the code is safe.\n\nBut let's think about the code. For example, if a permutation meets the major condition, then the code returns 'major'. Otherwise, for that permutation, it checks if it meets the minor condition. But other permutations may also meet the minor condition. However, since the code returns as soon as any permutation meets the condition, the code will return the correct answer.\n\nBut in the code above, for each permutation, the code checks for major first, then minor. So for example, if a permutation meets the minor condition, but another permutation meets the major condition, the code may return minor if the permutation checked first meets the minor condition. But according to the problem statement, this can't happen. Because the answer is unique.\n\nBut the code must check all permutations for major and minor. Because, for example, if the first permutation checked meets the minor condition, but there's another permutation that meets the major condition, then the code would return 'minor' even though there is a major. But according to the problem statement, that's impossible. So the code is safe.\n\nBut how can we ensure that?\n\nBecause the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So for any input, there's no possibility of being both major and minor. So the code can check all permutations, and if any of them meets the major condition, return 'major'; else, if any meets the minor condition, return 'minor'; else 'strange'.\n\nBut the code above returns as soon as any permutation meets the major or minor condition. However, the code may check permutations in an order where a minor condition is met first, but there's a major condition in another permutation. But according to the problem statement, that's impossible. So the code is correct.\n\nBut how to make sure that the code checks all permutations for major and minor conditions?\n\nWait, no. The code above returns as soon as a permutation meets the major or minor condition. For example, if the first permutation is not major or minor, but the second permutation is major, then the code would return 'major' once it reaches that permutation.\n\nBut the code's logic is correct. Because if any permutation meets the major condition, then the answer is 'major', regardless of other permutations. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut the code as written may not check all permutations. For example, if the first permutation meets the minor condition, but there's a permutation that meets the major condition. But according to the problem statement, this is impossible. So the code is safe.\n\nBut in reality, the code may return early. For example, suppose the first permutation is (X, Y, Z) which meets the minor condition, but there's another permutation that meets the major condition. However, the problem says that the answer is unique, so this scenario is impossible. Therefore, the code is correct.\n\nBut to make sure that the code checks all permutations for major and minor conditions, perhaps the code should check all permutations, and if any permutation meets the major condition, then it's major, and similarly for minor.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nAn alternative approach is to check all permutations, collect whether any of them meets the major or minor conditions, and then decide based on that.\n\nBut since the code can return early once a condition is found, it's more efficient.\n\nBut for the code to be correct, perhaps the code should check all permutations and see if any of them meets the major condition, and similarly for minor.\n\nBut in the code as written, the code returns as soon as a permutation meets the major or minor condition. So, for example, in the first permutation, if it meets the minor condition, the code returns 'minor', even if another permutation meets the major condition. However, according to the problem statement, that's impossible.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake here. Let's think of an example.\n\nSuppose a chord that can be ordered as X, Y, Z where it's major, and also ordered as A, B, C where it's minor. But the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So this can't happen. Therefore, the code is safe.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1: C E G.\n\nindexes are 0, 4, 7.\n\npermutations include (0,4,7). For that, d1 = (4-0) mod 12 =4. d2 = (7-4) mod 12=3. So returns 'major'.\n\nSample input 2: C# B F → indexes 1, 10, 5. Let's look for a permutation that meets minor. For example, (10,1,5). d1 is (1-10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. d2 is (5-1) mod 12 =4. So yes, returns 'minor'.\n\nSample input 3: A B H → indexes 9, 10, 11.\n\nCheck all permutations. For example:\n\n(9,10,11): d1=1, d2=1. Not.\n\n(9,11,10): d1= (11-9)=2 mod 12=2. d2= (10-11) mod 12 = 11. No.\n\n(10,9,11): d1= (9-10) mod 12 = 11. No.\n\n(10, 11, 9): d1 is 1, d2 is (9-11) mod 12 = 10. No.\n\n(11, 9, 10): d1 is (9-11) mod 12 = 10. No.\n\n(11, 10, 9): d1 is 10-11 mod 12 = 11. No.\n\nOther permutations?\n\nAnother permutation: (9, 10, 11) → d1 is 1, d2 is 1. No.\n\nAnother permutation: (10, 9, 11): d1 is (9-10) mod 12 = 11. d2 is (11 -9) = 2. Not 3 and 4.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So returns 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases correctly.\n\nNow, possible edge cases.\n\nWhat about a chord that is major in one permutation and minor in another? According to the problem statement, this is impossible. So the code can safely return the first occurrence.\n\nAnother case: the same notes in different order. For example, C, E, G. The code returns 'major' as soon as it finds the correct permutation.\n\nAnother case: a minor chord. For example, B, C#, F. Let's see:\n\nB is 10, C# is 1, F is 5. The permutation (10, 1, 5) → d1 is 3, d2 is 4. So returns minor.\n\nAnother case: what if the notes are C, E, G#, which would not form a major or minor. Let's check.\n\nC (0), E (4), G# (8). Let's check permutations.\n\nFor example, (0,4,8): d1 is 4, d2 is 4. So no. (0,8,4): d1 is 8-0=8 mod 12 is 8. Not 4. So no. Other permutations: (4, 0, 8). d1 is (0-4) mod 12 = 8. No. (4, 8, 0): d1 is 4 → 8-4=4. d2 is 0 -8 mod 12 is 4. So 4 and 4. Not 3 and 4. So no. So returns strange.\n\nAnother case: C, D#, G. Let's see:\n\nC is 0, D# is 3, G is 7. Permutation (0,3,7): d1 is 3, d2 is 4. So minor. So returns minor.\n\nSo the code would return minor.\n\nAnother case: C, E, B. Let's see. Let's check permutations.\n\nC (0), E (4), B (10). Let's check permutations.\n\n(0,4,10): d1=4, d2=6. Not. (0,10,4): d1 is 10-0=10 mod 12 → 10. Not 4. (4,0,10): d1 is 0-4 mod 12 is 8. No. (4,10,0): d1 is 10-4=6. No. (10, 0,4): d1 is 0-10 mod 12 = 2. No. (10,4,0): d1 is 4-10 mod 12 = 6. No. So returns strange.\n\nSo the code would return strange.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nNow, in Python, the code must read from stdin. So:\n\nRead the input line, split into three notes. Then process.\n\nBut the code must be written as a script that reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\ndef main():\n    notes = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    # Get the indexes of the three notes\n    indexes = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n    # Generate all permutations of the three indexes\n    for perm in permutations(indexes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        d1 = (y - x) % 12\n        d2 = (z - y) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is given as three space-separated notes. So the input is a single line. For example, the input for the first sample would be 'C E G' (without quotes). The code reads the entire line, splits into three elements.\n\nThis code should handle that.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample input: 'C E G' → outputs 'major'.\n\nSample input: 'C# B F' → outputs 'minor'.\n\nSample input: 'A B H' → outputs 'strange'.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the case where the same note is repeated? For example, input 'C C C'? Well, according to the problem statement, the chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. But the problem says that the input is three notes. However, the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. However, in this case, the code would check permutations. For example, all permutations would have x, y, z as same note. So d1 is 0, d2 is 0. So returns 'strange'.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a valid chord. But the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. However, the code handles that.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is three notes, but they may be same. However, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother case: input is C, E, G. The code returns 'major'.\n\nAnother case: input is C, E, G#. Let's see.\n\nC is 0, E is 4, G# is 8. Let's check permutations.\n\nFor (0,4,8): d1=4, d2=4. Not. So no. For (0,8,4): d1 is 8-0=8 mod 12 → 8. No. For (4, 0, 8): d1 is 0-4 mod 12 = 8. No. For (4,8,0): d1 is 4, d2 is (0-8) mod 12 = 4. So d1 is 4, d2 is 4. Not 3 and 4. So no. For (8,0,4): d1 is 0-8 mod 12 =4. d2 is 4-0=4. No. For (8,4,0): d1 is 4-8 mod 12 = 8. No. So returns strange.\n\nSo code returns strange.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code uses permutations from itertools. So the code must import that.\n\nBut in the code, the function main() is called when the script is run.\n\nNow, the code is written as per the problem's instructions. So the code should be correct.\n\nNow, check for possible errors.\n\nWhat about the note 'H'? For example, input is 'H C E' → H is 11, C is 0, E is 4.\n\nCheck permutations. Let's take permutation (H, C, E) → indexes 11, 0, 4.\n\nd1 = (0 -11) mod 12 → ( -11 ) mod 12 = 1. d2 = 4 -0 =4. So 1 and 4 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: (C, E, H) → indexes 0,4,11. d1=4, d2=7. Not 3 and 4. So no.\n\nAnother permutation: (C, H, E) → indexes 0,11,4. d1 is 11-0=11 mod 12 → 11. No.\n\nAnother permutation: (H, E, C) → indexes 11,4,0. d1 is 4-11 mod 12 → (4-11) =-7 mod 12 → 5. No.\n\nAnother permutation: (E, H, C) → indexes 4, 11, 0. d1 is 11-4=7 mod 12 →7. No.\n\nAnother permutation: (E, C, H) → indexes 4,0,11. d1 is 0-4 mod 12 → 8. No.\n\nSo returns strange.\n\nAnother case: input is B, D#, G. Let's see.\n\nB is 10, D# is 3, G is 7. Check permutations.\n\nPermutation (B, D#, G) → indexes 10,3,7. d1 is 3-10 mod 12 → (3-10) =-7 mod 12 →5. No.\n\nPermutation (D#, B, G) → 3,10,7. d1 is 10-3=7 mod 12 →7. No.\n\nPermutation (D#, G, B) → 3,7,10. d1 is 4, d2 is 3. So yes, major. So returns 'major'.\n\nYes. Because between D# and G is 4 semitones (7-3=4). Between G and B is 3 semitones (10-7=3). So that's a major triad.\n\nSo code would detect that.\n\nThus, the code should handle that.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor triad based on the distances between the notes in semitones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note to its corresponding index in a predefined list of musical notes. This helps in calculating the distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes in semitones.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Use modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of musical notes. Check if the distances between the first and second note, and the second and third note, match the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n4. **Determine Result**: If any permutation meets the criteria for a major triad, return \"major\". Similarly, check for a minor triad. If neither is found, return \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\ndef main():\n    notes = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    indexes = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n    for perm in permutations(indexes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        d1 = (y - x) % 12\n        d2 = (z - y) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Mapping Notes**: The `note_order` list defines the sequence of musical notes from C to H. Each note is mapped to an index using a dictionary for quick lookup.\n- **Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible orderings of the three input notes. This allows us to check every possible arrangement for the triad criteria.\n- **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale. This ensures that distances wrap around correctly when moving from higher to lower notes.\n- **Triad Check**: For each permutation, we check if the distances between consecutive notes match the criteria for a major or minor triad. If found, the result is printed immediately. If no valid triad is found after checking all permutations, \"strange\" is returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the three notes, ensuring that we correctly identify the type of triad or determine it as strange.",
