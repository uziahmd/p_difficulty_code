For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order. The list given is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then after H comes C again.\n\nEach consecutive pair is a semitone apart. So the distance between two notes is the number of steps between them in this cyclic list, moving forward. For example, C to E is 4 semitones (C to C# is 1, then D is 2, D# 3, E is 4). But if the distance is calculated from E to C, that would be 8 semitones because you go E to F (1), F# (2), G (3), G# (4), A (5), B (6), H (7), C (8). But according to the problem statement, the distance is always measured from the lower note to the upper one. Wait, but how do we determine which note is lower? Because the problem says that for the chord, when considering X, Y, Z, the distance between X and Y is measured as per the order. So perhaps when checking for major or minor, we need to arrange the three notes in some order such that the first to second is 4 semitones (for major) and second to third is 3 semitones. Similarly for minor, first to second is 3 and second to third is 4.\n\nBut how do I find the correct ordering? Since the triad is unordered, I need to check all permutations of the three notes and see if any permutation satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For the three given notes, generate all possible permutations (since the order matters for checking the distances).\n2. For each permutation (X, Y, Z), check:\n   a. For major: distance(X,Y) is 4 and distance(Y,Z) is 3.\n   b. For minor: distance(X,Y) is 3 and distance(Y,Z) is 4.\n3. If any permutation satisfies major, output 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, output 'strange'.\n\nBut how do I compute the distance between two notes?\n\nFirst, I need to map each note to its index in the list. Let's create a list of the notes in order, then for any note, its position can be found. Then, the distance between note A and note B (when A is lower than B) is (B's index - A's index) mod 12? Wait no. Wait, the distance is measured as the number of semitones from the lower note to the upper note. So if A comes before B in the list, then the distance is (B's index - A's index). But if B comes before A, then the distance would be (12 - (A's index - B's index))? Wait, no. Let me think. For example, the distance between C (index 0) and E (index 4) is 4 semitones. The distance between E (4) and C (0) would be 8 semitones because you have to go E->F (1), F# (2), G (3), G# (4), A (5), B (6), H (7), C (8). So the distance is (12 - (4 - 0)) mod 12? Or maybe the distance from A to B is (B - A) mod 12, but since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper note. Wait, but how do we know which is lower? Because the problem defines the distance between X and Y as the number of semitones along the scale from X to Y, but only if X is lower than Y. Otherwise, it's not. Wait, no. Wait the problem says:\n\n\"The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones.\"\n\nAh, so for any two distinct notes, the distance from X to Y is the number of semitones moving forward from X to Y. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is (Y index - X index). If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (12 - (X index - Y index))? Wait, no. For example, the distance between E (index 4) and C (index 0) is 8 semitones. Which is (0 + 12 - 4) = 8. So the formula for distance from X to Y is (Y_index - X_index) if Y is higher than X, else (Y_index + 12 - X_index). Wait, but that's equivalent to (Y_index - X_index) mod 12? No, because mod 12 would give a value between 0 and 11, but the distance is always positive. Wait, but in the problem statement, the distance between X and Y is measured as the number of semitones from X to Y, which is the minimal steps moving forward. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) if Y is after X in the list, otherwise (Y_index + 12 - X_index). So for example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then the distance is 4. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then the distance is 8. So the formula for the distance from X to Y is (Y_index - X_index) if Y_index >= X_index, else (Y_index + 12 - X_index). Which can also be written as (Y_index - X_index) % 12. Wait, no. Because (Y - X) mod 12 gives the same as (Y - X) if positive. For example, if Y is 0 and X is 4, then (0-4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance from X to Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But wait, if X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then (0 - 4) mod 12 is 8, which is correct. So that's the formula. So the distance from X to Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper note, but how do we know which is lower? Well, perhaps the formula is that the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) if Y is after X, else (Y_index + 12 - X_index). Which is equivalent to (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. However, when we are checking for major or minor triads, the problem says that for a major triad, the distance between X and Y must be 4 semitones, and between Y and Z must be 3. So in this case, the order of X, Y, Z must be such that X is before Y, and Y is before Z. Because the distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3. So the total distance between X and Z is 7. But how do we ensure that in the permutation?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the triad is unordered. So for example, given three notes, we can arrange them in any order. For example, if the three notes are C, E, G, then the permutation (C, E, G) would have distance between C and E as 4, and E to G as 3. So that's a major triad. But if someone permutes them as E, G, C, then the distance between E and G is 3, and between G and C is (C's index (0) - G's index (6) mod 12) → 0 - 6 = -6 mod 12 is 6. So that's 6 semitones. Which doesn't fit either major or minor. So for the major triad, we need to check all permutations of the three notes and see if any permutation has the first to second as 4, second to third as 3. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. Create a mapping from note names to their indices. For example, 'C' → 0, 'C#' → 1, 'D' → 2, etc. Let's create a list called note_order with the notes in order. Then, for a note, its index is note_order.index(note). But since the notes are unique, this will work.\n\nWait, the note names are given as: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, note that in the problem statement, the list is written as: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the order is important. Let me make sure that the list is correct.\n\nYes, the problem says: the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the order is as follows:\n\nIndices:\n\n0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nThen, after H (11) comes C again (0).\n\nSo the note_order list can be constructed as:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input uses the notation given. So the input will have notes like 'C', 'C#', 'D', etc. So for example, the third note in the sample input is 'A B H' — H is the last note.\n\nSo first, I need to create a dictionary that maps each note to its index. Let's create that.\n\nOnce I have that, for any two notes, I can compute the distance between them as (y_index - x_index) mod 12. But wait, for example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then (4-0) mod 12 is 4, which is correct. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then (0-4) mod 12 is 8, which is correct.\n\nSo the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. However, in the problem's definition, the distance between X and Y is measured from the lower note to the upper note. But how do we know which is lower? Well, the formula (y_index - x_index) mod 12 gives the distance from X to Y. But in the case where X is higher than Y, this would give the distance from X to Y as (y_index - x_index + 12) mod 12, which is the same as the number of semitones needed to go from X to Y by moving forward in the cycle.\n\nBut for the purposes of the problem, when checking for major and minor triads, the order of the notes in the permutation (X, Y, Z) must be such that the distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3. So, for example, in the case of a major triad, the distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3. So, the way to check this is, for a given permutation (X, Y, Z), calculate the distance between X and Y (using the formula above) and between Y and Z. If both are 4 and 3 respectively, then it's a major triad. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor the three given notes, generate all possible permutations (there are 3! = 6 permutations). For each permutation (X, Y, Z):\n\nCheck if distance(X,Y) is 4 and distance(Y,Z) is 3. If any permutation satisfies this, then it's a major chord.\n\nSimilarly, check if any permutation satisfies distance(X,Y) is 3 and distance(Y,Z) is 4. If yes, then it's a minor chord.\n\nIf neither is found, output 'strange'.\n\nNow, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so no need to check for overlapping cases.\n\nSo, the steps for code:\n\nRead the three notes. For example, input is a list of three strings. For example, input could be something like ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nFirst, create the note_order list and a dictionary mapping note names to their index.\n\nThen, generate all permutations of the three notes. For each permutation, check for major and minor conditions.\n\nBut how to generate permutations? In Python, itertools.permutations can be used. So for the three elements, permutations will generate all 6 possible orderings.\n\nSo, for each permutation in permutations(notes):\n\nCheck for major: distance between first and second is 4, and between second and third is 3.\n\nCheck for minor: distance between first and second is 3, and between second and third is 4.\n\nIf any permutation meets the major condition, then output 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo, the code structure:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\ndef get_distance(x, y):\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n    return (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n\nThen, for the input notes, say, notes = list_of_three_notes.\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = get_distance(x, y)\n    d2 = get_distance(y, z)\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So once any permutation meets the major condition, we can immediately return 'major' and not check further. Same for minor.\n\nBut in code, we need to check all permutations until we find one that meets the condition. However, for example, in the case of a major chord, there may be multiple permutations that satisfy the condition. But once we find one, we can return.\n\nSo the code would proceed as follows:\n\nRead the three notes.\n\nCheck all permutations for major or minor.\n\nOnce any permutation is found for major, output 'major' and exit. Similarly for minor.\n\nIf none found, output 'strange'.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nWait, the input is given as a list of three strings. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput is ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']? Or is it three separate inputs?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is the only line contains 3 space-separated notes. So the input is a single line with three notes. For example, in the sample input, the three examples are given as three separate cases. But in the actual code, the input is a single line with three notes. Wait, the sample input shows that the input is a list of three strings, but perhaps that's just for the example. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo for example, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nBut that's probably not the actual input. Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake in the problem statement. Because the actual input is one line with three notes. But in the example, perhaps the user provided three test cases, each with their own input. So for example, the code needs to process a single input line, but the sample shows three test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout. So in the code, the input is a single line with three notes, separated by spaces.\n\nSo for example, if the input is \"C E G\", the output is \"major\".\n\nSo in the code, the input is read as a single line, split into three parts.\n\nSo in the code, the input is:\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as three separate cases. But that's probably a formatting error. The actual code should handle a single input line with three notes.\n\nSo, for the sample input, the first case is input 'C E G' which outputs 'major'.\n\nNow, let's test the code with that case.\n\nFor the permutation (C, E, G):\n\ndistance(C,E) is 4, distance(E, G) is 2? Wait, E is index 4, G is index 7. So (7-4) = 3. So yes, distance is 3. So that's 4 and 3, which is major. So code returns 'major'.\n\nAnother example: 'C# B F' → the sample says it's minor. Let's see.\n\nThe correct permutation is B, C#, F.\n\nCheck distance between B and C#. Let's find their indices.\n\nB is index 10. C# is index 1. So distance from B to C# is (1 - 10) mod 12 → (1 -10) = -9 mod 12 is 3. So yes, 3 semitones. Then from C# (1) to F (5): 5 -1 = 4. So yes, 4. So this permutation meets the minor condition. So code would find it.\n\nAnother example: 'A B H' → check all permutations.\n\nNotes are A (9), B (10), H (11).\n\nLet's check all permutations.\n\nTake permutation (A, B, H):\n\ndistance(A,B) is 1 (10-9=1). Then B to H is 1 (11-10=1). Not 3 and 4.\n\nAnother permutation: A, H, B.\n\ndistance A to H is 2 (11-9=2). H to B is (10 - 11) mod 12 → (10 -11) is -1 mod 12 → 11. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H. Distance B to A is (9-10) mod 12 = ( -1 ) mod 12 → 11. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: B, H, A. Distance B to H is 1 (11-10=1). Then H to A is (9 - 11) mod 12 → -2 mod 12 → 10. Not 3/4.\n\nAnother permutation: H, A, B. Distance H (11) to A (9) is (9-11) mod 12 = -2 mod 12 → 10. Not 3. Then A to B is 1.\n\nAnother permutation: H, B, A. Distance H to B is (10 - 11) mod 12 → -1 mod 12 → 11. Then B to A is 11 mod 12? No, distance from B to A is (A's index - B's index) mod 12 → 9 -10 = -1 mod 12 → 11. So no.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. Hence output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code works for the sample.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nEdge case 1: All three notes are same? But according to the problem statement, the input is three notes. However, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. But the problem says that the input is three notes. However, the problem says that the answer will always be unambiguous. However, in reality, the code would check permutations, but for three same notes, all distances would be zero, so no match. So output 'strange'.\n\nAnother edge case: notes that wrap around. For example, H, C, E. Let's check if this is a major chord.\n\nPermutation (H, C, E). Distance from H (11) to C (0) is (0 - 11) mod 12 → -11 mod 12 → 1. No. Not 4. Another permutation: C, E, H. Distance C to E is 4. E to H is (11 - 4) = 7 mod 12 → 7. Not 3. So no. What about permutation C, H, E? Distance C to H is (11 - 0) = 11 mod 12 → 11. Not 4. So no. So not major.\n\nAnother case: C, E, G. As sample.\n\nAnother case for minor: B, C#, F. Which is the sample.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple permutations that satisfy the condition? For example, suppose a chord can be ordered as X, Y, Z and also Y, Z, X (but that would not fit). But the code checks all permutations, so once any permutation is found, it returns.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code would generate all permutations, and for each, check for major and minor conditions.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut first, note that the note_order list must be correctly constructed. Let me check:\n\nThe order is:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nSo the note_order list is:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nWe can create this list, then the note_to_index is a dictionary.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead input as three notes.\n\nThen generate all permutations of the three notes.\n\nFor each permutation, check for major and minor.\n\nOnce any is found, output accordingly.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\ndef get_distance(x, y):\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n    return (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n\ndef main():\n    notes = input().split()\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        d1 = get_distance(x, y)\n        d2 = get_distance(y, z)\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input is given as three space-separated notes. So input().split() would split them correctly.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\nC E G → output 'major'\n\nSample Input: C# B F → output 'minor'\n\nSample Input: A B H → output 'strange'\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: let's take the minor example. For example, the permutation B, C#, F. Let's check.\n\nB is 'B' → index 10. C# is index 1. F is index 5.\n\ndistance between B and C#: (1 - 10) mod 12 = -9 mod 12 = 3. Correct. Then between C# and F: 5 - 1 =4. So yes, 3 and 4 → minor.\n\nSo code would catch that.\n\nAnother test case: C, E, G → major.\n\nWhat about a case where the same notes are in different order but still form a major chord?\n\nFor example, E, G, C. Let's check:\n\ndistance E to G is (7-4) = 3. Then G to C is (0 -7) mod 12 → 5. So no. So this permutation would not trigger major. However, another permutation (E, G, C) is not a major. But the code would check all permutations. For example, in the permutation (C, G, E), distance from C to G is 7 (G is index 7, 7-0=7). Then G to E is (4 -7) mod 12 = -3 mod 12 =9. Not 3. So no. Only the permutation (C, E, G) would trigger the major condition.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about a case where a minor triad is present in another permutation?\n\nFor example, the notes B, C#, F. The code would check all permutations. For example, permutation (C#, B, F) → distance C# to B is (10 - 1) mod 12 → 9 mod 12 → 9. Not 3. So no. But the permutation (B, C#, F) would be checked, and that would trigger minor.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, possible errors:\n\nWhat if the same note is present multiple times? For example, input is ['C', 'C', 'C'] → output 'strange'.\n\nAnother case: input is ['C', 'E', 'G'] → major.\n\nAnother case: input is ['E', 'G', 'B'] → check if it's major or minor.\n\nLet's see:\n\nE is index 4, G is 7, B is 10.\n\nCheck permutations. For example, E, G, B. distance E to G is 3, G to B is 3 (10 -7 = 3). So no. Another permutation: E, B, G. distance E to B is (10 -4) =6. Then B to G is (7 -10) mod 12 → (7 -10) is -3 mod 12 → 9. No. Another permutation: G, B, E. distance G to B is 3 (10 -7 =3). B to E is (4 -10) mod 12 → ( -6 ) mod 12 → 6. So not 3 and 4. Another permutation: G, E, B. distance G to E is (4 -7) mod 12 → -3 mod 12 → 9. No. So this is not major or minor. So output strange.\n\nBut what about a minor triad?\n\nSuppose the notes are C#, E, G. Let's check.\n\nPossible permutations. Let's think of a minor triad. For example, if the notes are C#, E, G. Let's see:\n\nIs there a permutation where distance between first and second is 3, and second to third is 4?\n\nCheck permutation (C#, E, G). Distance C# to E is (4 - 1) =3. Then E to G is 2 (7-4=3? Wait, E is index 4, G is 7 → 7-4=3. So 3. So that's 3 and 3. Not minor. So no.\n\nAnother permutation: E, C#, G. Distance E to C# is (1 -4) mod 12 → -3 mod 12 → 9. No.\n\nAnother permutation: C#, G, E. Distance C# to G is 7-1=6. Then G to E is (4 -7) mod 12 → -3 → 9. No.\n\nNot minor. So output strange.\n\nAnother example: the minor triad B, C#, F. Let's check all permutations.\n\nAnother permutation: C#, F, B. Distance between C# and F is 5-1=4. Then F to B is 10 -5 =5. Not 3 and 4. So no. But the permutation B, C#, F is the one that triggers minor.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, the code uses itertools.permutations, which is acceptable for three elements.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor triad based on semitone distances.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Mapping**: First, map each note to its corresponding index in the musical scale. This helps in quickly calculating the distance between any two notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two notes using their indices. The distance is determined by taking the modulo 12 difference of their indices, which accounts for the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation, check if it meets the criteria for a major or minor triad:\n   - A major triad has a distance of 4 semitones between the first and second note, and 3 semitones between the second and third note.\n   - A minor triad has a distance of 3 semitones between the first and second note, and 4 semitones between the second and third note.\n4. **Result Determination**: If any permutation meets the criteria for a major or minor triad, print the corresponding result. If none do, print \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\ndef get_distance(x, y):\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n    return (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n\ndef main():\n    notes = input().split()\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        d1 = get_distance(x, y)\n        d2 = get_distance(y, z)\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Note Mapping**: The `note_order` list defines the sequence of musical notes, and `note_to_index` maps each note to its index for quick lookup.\n- **Distance Calculation**: The `get_distance` function computes the semitone distance between two notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n- **Permutations Check**: By generating all permutations of the input notes, we ensure that every possible ordering is checked for both major and minor triad conditions.\n- **Efficiency**: The approach efficiently checks all permutations (only 6 for three notes) and uses modular arithmetic for quick distance calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for edge cases.",
