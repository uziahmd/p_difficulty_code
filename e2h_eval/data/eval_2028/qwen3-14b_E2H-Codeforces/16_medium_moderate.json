Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, moving through adjacent blocks. Each step allows moving between blocks that share a common border (non-zero length). The roads are infinite lines dividing the plane into regions (blocks). \n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. The key is to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how do I represent the blocks? Since there are n roads, each road divides the plane, and the arrangement of roads creates regions. However, directly representing each region isn't feasible because the number of regions can be huge, especially with many roads.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. Since movement between blocks is allowed if they share a common border (so they are separated by exactly one road), perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node represents a block, and edges exist between adjacent blocks. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home block to the university block.\n\nBut how do I represent the blocks and determine adjacency? That seems challenging. Another approach: think about each block being determined by the signs of the equations of the roads. For example, for each road, a point lies on one side or the other. So, each block can be represented by a vector of signs (for each road, whether the point is on the positive or negative side of the line). However, since there are n roads, each block would have a unique combination of these signs. But with n up to 300, this would be 2^300 possibilities, which is impossible to handle directly.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another way. Since moving from one block to another requires crossing a road (so changing the sign of exactly one equation). Therefore, two blocks are adjacent if their sign vectors differ in exactly one position. However, that's only if the roads are arranged in such a way. But maybe this is not entirely accurate. Because two regions separated by a single road would differ in exactly one sign. However, if two regions are separated by multiple roads, then their sign vectors would differ in more than one. But adjacency requires that the two regions share a common border, which implies that they are separated by exactly one road. Therefore, the adjacency is determined by differing in exactly one sign. \n\nSo, the problem becomes similar to a hypercube graph where each node is a binary vector of length n, and edges connect nodes that differ in exactly one bit. However, in reality, the actual adjacency depends on the roads. But perhaps the sign vectors can be used to model the regions. However, the problem is that for some roads, the sign might not be sufficient. For example, two different regions could have the same sign vector if they are on the same side of all roads. But that's impossible because each road divides the plane into two regions. So, the sign vector for each region is unique? No, because if two regions are separated by multiple roads, but their sign vectors differ in multiple positions. However, each region is uniquely determined by the sign of each road. So, the sign vector would uniquely identify the region. \n\nSo, the idea is: for each point (home and university), compute their sign vector (for each road, compute the value a_i x + b_i y + c_i, and check if it's positive or negative). Then, the problem becomes finding the minimum number of steps (each step flipping one bit) to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector. However, this is only possible if the sign vectors differ in some number of bits. But wait, how does that relate to the actual adjacency steps?\n\nBecause each step in the problem corresponds to moving across a road. So, moving from one region to an adjacent one requires flipping exactly one sign. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. Wait, no. Because the Hamming distance is the number of differing bits. But each step can change exactly one bit. So, the minimal steps would be the Hamming distance. But that can't be right. For example, suppose the home and university are in regions that differ in two bits. Then, you can flip one bit at a time, so two steps. Which would be the Hamming distance. But is that correct?\n\nBut wait, this would imply that the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the sign vectors. But why is that the case?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that the home is in a region S, and the university is in region T. Let the sign vectors be s and t. The Hamming distance between s and t is k. Then, can you reach T from S in k steps?\n\nYes, because each step can flip one bit. So, each step moves across a road. So, the minimal steps would be the Hamming distance. However, this seems too simple. But why does the sample input match this?\n\nLooking at the first sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are two roads: 0x+1y+0=0 (which is y=0) and 1x+0y+0=0 (x=0). \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nFor first road (y=0): 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1>0 → sign is +1.\n\nSecond road (x=0): 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1>0 → sign +1. So sign vector is (+, +).\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nFirst road: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → sign -.\n\nSecond road: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1 <0 → sign -. So sign vector is (-, -). Hamming distance is 2. Which matches the output of 2. \n\nIn the second sample input, the output is also 2. Let me check that. \n\nSample input 2:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads:\n\n1 0 0 → x=0.\n\n0 1 0 → y=0.\n\n1 1 -3 → x + y -3 = 0 → x + y =3.\n\nHome (1,1):\n\nFor first road x=0: 1>0 → +.\n\nSecond road y=0: 1>0 → +.\n\nThird road: 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → -.\n\nSign vector: + + -.\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nFirst road: -1 <0 → -.\n\nSecond road: -1 <0 → -.\n\nThird road: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → -.\n\nSign vector: - - -.\n\nSo the Hamming distance is 2 (the first two bits differ). So steps required is 2. Which matches the output. \n\nSo the sample outputs are indeed the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and university. \n\nSo the problem reduces to computing the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and the university. \n\nBut why is this correct? Because each step can cross a single road, changing one sign. So, the minimal steps is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nBut how can that be? Because when you cross a road, you flip the sign for that road. So, if the home and university have different signs for k roads, then you need to cross those roads once each. But how can you cross them in sequence? Because crossing one road may affect the path to cross others. But according to the model, the Hamming distance gives the minimal steps. \n\nBut why is that possible? Because each step can flip one bit. So, regardless of the order, you need to flip each differing bit once. So the minimal steps is the Hamming distance. \n\nThis seems to be the case. Therefore, the solution is to compute for each road, whether the home and university are on opposite sides of the road. The count of such roads is the answer. \n\nWait, that's a very simple solution. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose that for each road, we check if the home and university are on opposite sides. For each such road, you have to cross it once. But the minimal steps is the number of roads where they are on opposite sides. \n\nBut how does that work? Because when you cross a road, you can move from one region to another. But if two regions are separated by multiple roads, then you need to cross each of those roads once. \n\nBut according to the Hamming distance model, the minimal steps is the Hamming distance. \n\nBut how can that be? Let me take an example. Suppose there are two roads, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both roads. Then, the Hamming distance is 2. So the answer is 2. \n\nBut how can you cross both roads? Let's imagine the roads are x=0 and y=0. Home is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). So to get from home to university, you need to cross x=0 and y=0. But you can cross x=0 first, then y=0. Each step crosses a road. So two steps, which is the Hamming distance. \n\nAnother example: if the home and university are on opposite sides of one road, but same on others. Then, the answer is 1. Which makes sense. \n\nBut what about if the home and university are on opposite sides of two roads, but those roads are parallel? Like, two parallel roads. Suppose the home is on one side of both roads, and the university is on the other side of both. Then, the Hamming distance is 2. But can you cross them in two steps? Well, each road is a line. If they are parallel, then the regions are divided into three parts. So the home is in one region, and the university is in another. To get from home to university, you need to cross both roads. But since they are parallel, you can cross one road, then cross the other. So two steps. Which matches the Hamming distance. \n\nTherefore, the answer is simply the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides of that road. \n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each road, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). If these two values have different signs (i.e., their product is negative), then this road contributes 1 to the answer. The total number of such roads is the answer.\n\nWait, but why is that the case? Because each such road is a boundary between the home's block and the university's block. But how do we know that the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate them?\n\nBecause each road that separates them must be crossed once. And each step can cross exactly one road. So, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. \n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses each of those roads once, and no more? Because each time you cross a road, you can move into a new block. So, if the two points are separated by k roads, then you can cross each of those roads once, and thus reach the target in k steps. \n\nBut how do we know that the two points are in regions that are separated by exactly those roads? Well, the sign vectors are different for exactly those roads. So, the home and university are on opposite sides of those roads. \n\nThis seems to be correct. Therefore, the solution is to compute for each road whether the home and university are on opposite sides. The count of such roads is the answer.\n\nThis is a very simple solution. Let me check the sample input again. \n\nFirst sample input has two roads. For each road, the home and university are on opposite sides. So the answer is 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nSecond sample input has three roads. The home and university are on opposite sides of the first two roads. The third road: for home, the value is 1+1-3 = -1. For university, -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. Both are negative. So same sign. So the count is 2, which matches the sample output. \n\nSo this approach works. \n\nSo the steps to code this are:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1), university coordinates (x2, y2). Read n roads. For each road, compute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c, f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If f1 * f2 < 0, then increment the answer. \n\nSo the answer is the count of roads where the product of f1 and f2 is negative. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that neither home nor university is on any road. So f1 and f2 can't be zero. So their product is non-zero. So, for each road, we can check if f1 and f2 have different signs. \n\nThat's a very straightforward solution. \n\nBut why wasn't this problem mentioned in the initial problem statement? Because the problem seems to be much simpler than I thought. \n\nBut why is this the case? Because the problem is equivalent to counting how many roads separate the two points. Because each such road must be crossed once, and each step can cross exactly one road. Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of roads separating the two points. \n\nThis seems correct. \n\nTherefore, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nFor each of the next n lines, read a, b, c.\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nFor each road:\n\ncompute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\nval2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\nif val1 * val2 < 0: count +=1\n\nOutput count.\n\nBut wait, this seems too easy. Let me think of some test cases. \n\nTest case 1: home and university are in the same region. Then, the answer is 0. \n\nAnother test case: home and university are separated by 3 roads. Answer is 3. \n\nBut how can that be? For example, three roads arranged in such a way that the home and university are on opposite sides of each. \n\nBut how can that happen? For example, three roads that are all crossing each other. \n\nBut the code would count the number of roads that separate the two points. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer is the minimal steps. \n\nBut according to this approach, the answer is the number of roads separating them. \n\nBut why is that correct?\n\nBecause each road that separates them must be crossed once. So, the minimal steps is the number of such roads. \n\nBut how can you cross them in sequence? Because each step crosses a road. For example, if there are two roads that separate them, you can cross one road, then cross the other. \n\nBut how can you cross them in sequence? Because after crossing the first road, you are in a region that is adjacent to the original region. Then, crossing the second road would take you to another region. \n\nBut if the two roads are not parallel, then crossing one road may take you to a region that is adjacent to the other road. \n\nBut the problem states that the movement is allowed between adjacent blocks (sharing a common border). So, each step can cross exactly one road. \n\nTherefore, the minimal steps is indeed the number of roads that separate the two points. \n\nThis seems to be correct. \n\nThus, the code is straightforward. \n\nNow, let me check the sample input again. \n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are y=0 and x=0. \n\nFor the first road, val1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1, val2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. 1 * -1 = -1 <0 → count +=1. \n\nSecond road: val1 = 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1, val2 = 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 → product is -1 → count +=1. Total 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nRoads are x=0, y=0, x+y=3. \n\nHome (1,1) → val for x=0 is 1, val for university (-1,-1) is -1 → product negative. Same for y=0. For the third road, val1 is 1+1-3 = -1. val2 is -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. product is positive. So count is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: if the home and university are on the same side of all roads. Then answer is 0. \n\nAnother test case: home and university are separated by one road. Answer is 1. \n\nThus, the code is correct. \n\nTherefore, the Python code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the home and university coordinates. Then read the n roads. For each road, compute the values and check if their product is negative. \n\nNow, coding this in Python. \n\nThe input is read from stdin. The input is given as multiple lines. For example, the first input is given as:\n\nFirst line: '1 1' (home)\n\nSecond line: '-1 -1' (university)\n\nThird line: 2 (number of roads)\n\nThen two lines for the roads. \n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, but in the actual code, the code should read from stdin. \n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each road:\n\n    a, b, c = ... \n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So val1 and val2 can't be zero. So we don't have to worry about division by zero. \n\nThus, the code is correct. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. \n\nNow, let me test this against the sample input. \n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nProcessing:\n\nx1=1, y1=1; x2=-1, y2=-1.\n\nFor first road: a=0, b=1, c=0. \n\nval1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1. \n\nval2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. \n\nproduct is -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: a=1, b=0, c=0. \n\nval1 = 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. \n\nval2 = 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1. product -1 → count +=1. \n\nTotal 2 → correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nProcessing:\n\nFor first road (a=1, b=0, c=0):\n\nval1 = 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 = 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road (a=0, b=1, c=0): val1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. val2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1)+0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nThird road: a=1, b=1, c=-3. \n\nval1 = 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 1+1-3 = -1. \n\nval2 = 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 = -5. \n\nproduct is (-1)*(-5) =5>0 → no count. \n\nTotal count is 2. Correct.\n\nThus, the code works for samples. \n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead from stdin. \n\nBut in Python, the code needs to read from stdin. So, for example, the input may be given as multiple lines. \n\nThe code:\n\nRead first line as x1, y1.\n\nRead second line as x2, y2.\n\nRead third line as n.\n\nThen read n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nBut in Python, we can read via input().split().\n\nBut sometimes, for multiple lines, it's better to read all input at once. However, for code submission, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nYes. \n\nThis code should work. \n\nBut let me check for some edge cases. \n\nEdge case 1: n=0? But according to input constraints, n is at least 1. Wait, the input says third line is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). So no. So code is safe. \n\nAnother edge case: when a road is vertical or horizontal. But code handles that. \n\nAnother case: when a road is x + y = 0. \n\nAnother case: home and university are separated by 0 roads. For example, same region. Then output is 0. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this code should handle all cases. \n\nThus, the answer is this code.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step allows moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road divides the plane into two regions. If a road separates the home and university blocks, it must be crossed to move between these blocks. The minimum number of steps required is equivalent to the number of roads that separate the home and university blocks. This can be determined by checking if the home and university points lie on opposite sides of each road.\n\n1. **Reading Input**: Read the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Check Separation**: For each road, compute the values of the linear equation at the home and university coordinates.
