Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum number of steps to move from a home block to a university block, moving through adjacent blocks. The adjacency here is defined by sharing a common border of non-zero length. So, the problem is essentially about finding the shortest path between two regions divided by lines.\n\nFirst, I need to model the blocks and their adjacencies. But how can I represent each block? Since there are infinite regions, I can't list them all. However, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node represents a region (block), and edges exist between regions that share a common border. Then, the problem becomes a BFS from the home region to the university region.\n\nBut how do I determine which regions are adjacent? The key is that two regions are adjacent if they are separated by exactly one line. Wait, no. Because each line divides the plane into two parts. So, any two regions that are on opposite sides of a line and share that line as their boundary would be adjacent. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, think about the parity of the regions. For example, each line divides the plane into two halves. If we can assign a unique identifier to each region based on the position relative to each line, then two regions are adjacent if they differ in exactly one line's sign. But since there are n lines, each with two possibilities (on one side or the other), the total number of regions could be up to 2^n, but that's only if all lines are in general position. However, for n=300, 2^300 is way too big to handle directly.\n\nSo that approach isn't feasible. So what else can I do?\n\nAnother idea: Since moving from one block to another requires crossing a line (i.e., the two regions are separated by that line), then each step corresponds to changing the sign of exactly one line equation. So, for each line, the home point is on one side of it, and the university is on some side. But how does that help?\n\nWait, here's a thought: Each region can be uniquely identified by the set of signs of the equations evaluated at a point in that region. For example, for each line i, evaluate a_i x + b_i y + c_i. The sign of this value determines which side of the line the point is on. So, for each line, the sign is either positive or negative. So, the region can be represented as a vector of signs for each line. But since there are n lines, this gives 2^n possible regions, which is way too big for n=300. However, the problem is that even for n=300, 2^300 is impossible to store.\n\nBut maybe the actual number of regions is not that large. However, given that n can be up to 300, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of considering regions, model the problem as a graph where nodes are the regions, and edges represent adjacency. However, how to compute adjacency between regions without knowing all regions?\n\nBut perhaps we can model the problem as a BFS where each state is determined by the signs of the equations. However, even that seems impossible due to the size.\n\nWait, but the problem is not to find the regions, but to find the minimal steps between two regions. Let me think about the movement. Each step moves across a line. So, moving from one region to another adjacent region requires that they share a common line. Therefore, the minimal steps between home and university is the minimal number of lines that you have to cross to get from the home region to the university region.\n\nBut how to model that? Well, perhaps the minimal steps is the minimal number of lines that separate the home and the university. But how to compute that?\n\nWait, think of it as a graph where each node is a region. Each region is connected to others that are separated by exactly one line. So, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path between two nodes in this graph. But how can I model this without knowing the regions?\n\nAn alternative idea comes from the concept of duality. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a BFS where each state is the current set of signs. However, since the number of possible states is 2^n, which is way too big for n=300, that's not feasible. So, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose that each line can be considered as a hyperplane dividing the space. The regions are connected components. The minimal number of steps needed to go from home to university is the minimal number of hyperplanes (lines) that you have to cross. Each time you cross a line, you change the sign of that line's equation.\n\nSo, the problem is similar to finding the minimal number of hyperplanes that separate the home and the university points. However, since the home and university points are in different regions, there must be some lines that separate them. But how to find the minimal number of lines that need to be crossed?\n\nWait, but the minimal number of steps is equal to the minimal number of lines that separate the home and university. Because each step crosses exactly one line. However, this is not necessarily true. For example, suppose that there are two lines that separate the home and university. Then, you can cross one line and then another, which would take two steps. But maybe there's a way to cross a single line? No, because if the two points are on opposite sides of a single line, then the minimal steps is 1. If they are not, then you need to cross multiple lines.\n\nBut how to compute this minimal number of lines?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that the home point is in region H and the university is in region U. The minimal number of steps is the minimal number of lines that you have to cross to get from H to U. Each time you cross a line, you switch from one region to another. However, the problem is that the regions are connected by adjacency via shared borders, so the minimal steps is the minimal number of crossings required.\n\nBut how to model this as a graph? Let's think of the problem as a BFS where each node is the set of lines that you have crossed. Wait, but that might not capture the state properly.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the problem as a BFS where the state is the current \"sign configuration\" of the home point. Wait, but the home point's sign configuration is fixed. Wait, no. Because when you cross a line, you flip the sign of that line. So, the initial state is the sign configuration of the home point. The goal is to reach the sign configuration of the university point. Each step allows flipping exactly one sign (crossing a line). However, this is only possible if the two regions are separated by exactly one line. But this may not be the case.\n\nWait, no. Because when you cross a line, you flip the sign of that line. So, the minimal steps between the home and university is the minimal number of lines whose signs differ between the home and the university. For example, if the home and university have different signs for exactly k lines, then the minimal steps is k. Because you can cross those lines one by one. But wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that the home and university differ in exactly k lines. Then, can you reach the university's region by crossing those k lines? Because each time you cross a line, you flip the sign of that line. So, the minimal steps would be the number of differing lines. But that's only if each flip can be done independently. However, that's not necessarily the case. Because crossing a line may not be possible if the current region is not adjacent to the next region. Wait, but if you start from the home region, and cross a line that separates it, then you can reach the region on the other side. Then, crossing another line, etc. So, if the home and university differ in k lines, then the minimal steps is k. But is that always true?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose that home and university differ in two lines. So, the minimal steps would be 2. Because you can cross one line, then another. But perhaps there's a scenario where you can't do that. For example, imagine two lines that cross each other. The home is in a region that is on the positive side of both lines. The university is on the negative side of both lines. So, the differing lines are two. But you can cross one line first, then the other. So, two steps. Which matches the number of differing lines.\n\nAnother example: suppose three lines arranged in such a way that the home and university differ in three lines. Then, the minimal steps would be three.\n\nBut what if the home and university differ in two lines, but those two lines are parallel? Then, the regions are separated by two lines. So, you need to cross both lines. So, two steps. So yes, the minimal steps is the number of differing lines.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is the number of lines that separate the home and the university. That is, for each line, check whether the home and university are on opposite sides of the line. The count of such lines is the minimal steps.\n\nWait, but that seems too easy. Let's check the examples.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are two roads: 0x +1y +0 = 0 → y=0, and 1x +0y +0 = 0 → x=0.\n\nFor the home (1,1):\n\nFor line 1 (y=0): 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1 >0 → positive.\n\nFor line 2 (x=0): 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1>0 → positive.\n\nFor university (-1,-1):\n\nLine 1: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → negative.\n\nLine 2: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1 <0 → negative.\n\nSo, the home and university differ in both lines. So the count is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nIn the second sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are three roads: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0.\n\nCheck for each line:\n\nFor the home (1,1):\n\nLine 1 (x=0): 1>0 → positive.\n\nLine 2 (y=0): 1>0 → positive.\n\nLine 3 (x + y -3 = 0): 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → negative.\n\nFor the university (-1,-1):\n\nLine 1: -1 <0 → negative.\n\nLine 2: -1 <0 → negative.\n\nLine 3: (-1)+(-1) -3 = -5 <0 → negative.\n\nSo, home and university differ in lines 1 and 2. So count is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSo that seems to work. So the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the home and the university. But why is this the case?\n\nBecause each time you cross a line that separates them, you can flip the sign. So, for each line that separates them, you need to cross it once. So the minimal steps is the number of such lines.\n\nBut why is this correct? Let me think again. Suppose there are two lines that separate the home and university. Then, the minimal steps is 2. But what if there is a path that crosses one line, then another, but the two lines are not separating them? Or maybe not. Because the home and university are in regions that differ in exactly those lines.\n\nBut how can we be sure that the minimal steps is exactly the number of lines that separate them?\n\nLet me think of another example. Suppose that there are two lines, L1 and L2, which cross each other. Home is in the region that is positive for both lines. University is in the region that is negative for both lines. Then, the minimal steps is 2. Because you can cross L1, then cross L2. But if there's another way to cross them in fewer steps? No, because you have to cross both lines. So the minimal steps is 2.\n\nAnother example: suppose home and university differ in three lines. Then, you need to cross all three lines. So steps is 3.\n\nBut what if there's a line that is not separating them, but crossing it allows you to reach the university in fewer steps? For example, suppose that home and university differ in two lines, but there's a third line that they are both on the same side. But crossing that third line would somehow allow you to reach the university in one step. But that's impossible. Because crossing that line would flip the sign of that line, but since the home and university are on the same side of that line, after flipping, they would be on opposite sides. But that's not the case. So, perhaps the minimal steps is indeed the number of lines that separate them.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides of the line.\n\nBut how to check if two points are on opposite sides of a line?\n\nFor a line ax + by + c = 0, the value of ax + by + c for a point (x,y) tells us which side of the line the point is on. If the values for the two points have opposite signs, then they are on opposite sides. However, if one of them is zero, but the problem says that neither home nor university lies on any road. So, we don't have to worry about that.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\nFor each line, compute the value of (a*x1 + b*y1 + c) and (a*x2 + b*y2 + c). If their product is negative, then the line separates the two points. Count the number of such lines. That's the answer.\n\nWait, but why? Because each such line must be crossed once. And the minimal steps is exactly the number of such lines.\n\nBut why can't there be a path that crosses some lines and then crosses them again, leading to a shorter path?\n\nFor example, suppose that there are two lines that separate the home and university. But there's a third line that is not separating them. Suppose that crossing that third line allows you to cross the two lines in a way that requires less steps. But that's not possible. Because the two points are on the same side of the third line. So, crossing it would take you to the other side, but that would not help in getting to the university.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each node is a region, and edges connect regions that are separated by exactly one line. Then, the minimal steps between home and university is the minimal number of edges in the path from home region to university region.\n\nBut how to find that? Well, the home region can be represented by the signs of all lines. The university region is represented by the signs of all lines. The minimal steps between them is the minimal number of sign changes needed to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector, changing one sign at a time. Each step changes exactly one sign (crossing a line). The minimal steps would be the number of differing signs, because each differing sign can be changed one by one. Because changing a sign that differs is necessary. So the minimal steps is the number of differing signs.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. For each line, compute the value for home and university. If their product is negative, increment the count. Output that count.\n\nWait, but let me test this against the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nLines are 0 1 0 (y=0) and 1 0 0 (x=0).\n\nHome (1,1): for first line, 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1. For university (-1,-1): 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. Product is -1 → negative. So count +=1.\n\nSecond line: 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. For university: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1. Product is -1. Count is 2. Output 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nLines are x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0.\n\nHome (1,1) and university (-1,-1):\n\nFor line x=0: home is 1, university is -1. Product negative → count +=1.\n\nFor line y=0: same as above → count +=1.\n\nFor line x + y -3 = 0: home is 1+1-3 = -1. University is -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. Both negative. Product is positive → no count. So total count is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: suppose home and university are separated by 0 lines. Then, they are in the same region. So steps is 0. But according to the problem statement, it is guaranteed that neither home nor university is on a road. But what if they are in the same region? Then the answer is 0.\n\nBut the problem says that the university is located in some block. So, the answer is 0 if the home and university are in the same region.\n\nBut according to the code, if for all lines, the product is positive (so no lines separate them), then the count is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nBut why is this the case? Because each line that separates them must be crossed once. And each such line is a step. So the minimal steps is the number of such lines.\n\nThis seems surprisingly simple, but the sample cases fit. So perhaps this is the correct approach.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1), university (x2, y2), n lines.\n\nFor each line (a, b, c):\n\nCompute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\nval2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\nif val1 * val2 < 0 → count +=1\n\nOutput count.\n\nBut wait, why is this correct? Because each line that separates them must be crossed once. But how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses exactly those lines?\n\nWell, imagine that the home and university are separated by k lines. Then, you can cross each of these lines once. Each crossing takes you to a region that is different. But how can you cross them in sequence?\n\nBut the problem says that the movement is allowed if the two regions share a common border. So, each time you cross a line, you move to an adjacent region.\n\nSo, the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the home and the university.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut why? Because the regions are connected. So, you can cross each of the separating lines once, in any order, and reach the destination.\n\nSo this approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code is straightforward. Now, implement this.\n\nNow, handling the input:\n\nThe input is read as follows:\n\nFirst line: x1 y1\n\nSecond line: x2 y2\n\nThird line: n\n\nThen n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo, in Python, read the input lines.\n\nBut note that the input may be given as a single string with newlines, but for the code, it's easier to read from stdin.\n\nBut for the code, the code should read from stdin. For example, the first input is:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nSample Output: 2\n\nSo, code:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nFor each of these lines, compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n\nval2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n\nif val1 * val2 < 0 → count +=1.\n\nFinally, print count.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let me think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: n=0. But according to input constraints, n is at least 1. Wait, no. The third line says n is given as 1 ≤ n ≤ 300. Wait, the problem says:\n\nThird line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). So n is at least 1. So no case where n is 0.\n\nAnother Edge Case: home and university are separated by zero lines. So answer is 0.\n\nAnother Edge Case: All lines separate them. So answer is n.\n\nAnother case: some lines separate, others not.\n\nBut the code seems to handle it.\n\nSo, the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead the input. For example, read the first two lines as home and university coordinates.\n\nBut the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as per the problem. The sample input shows two examples, but the code is supposed to process one input. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says that the input is given as per the following:\n\nThe first line contains two integers x1, y1.\n\nSecond line contains two integers x2, y2.\n\nThird line contains n.\n\nThen n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo, the code should process a single test case. The sample input shows two examples, but that's probably for the purpose of the problem description. The actual code will process one input.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a, b, c.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each line:\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what about if the line is the same as another line? But the problem says that no two roads are the same. So, no need to worry about that.\n\nBut the code doesn't need to check for that.\n\nSo, this code should work.\n\nLet me check the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nProcessing:\n\nFor first line (0,1,0):\n\nval1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1.\n\nval2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 → product is -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond line (1,0,0):\n\nval1 = 1*1 + 0*1 +0 =1.\n\nval2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) +0 = -1 → product -1 → count +=1. Total is 2. Output 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nProcessing:\n\nFor first line (1,0,0):\n\nval1 = 1*1 + 0*1 +0 =1.\n\nval2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) +0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond line (0,1,0):\n\nval1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1.\n\nval2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nThird line (1,1,-3):\n\nval1 = 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1.\n\nval2 = 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0 → no count. So total is 2. Output 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: home and university are in same region. For example, home (1,1), university (2,2), and lines are x=0, y=0. Then, for each line, val1 and val2 are positive. So count is 0. Output 0.\n\nAnother case: home (1,1), university (1,-1). Lines: y=0. val1 is 1*0 + 1*1 +0? Wait, line is y=0 → equation is 0x +1y +0=0. So for home (1,1): 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. For university (1,-1): 0*1 +1*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 → count 1. So answer is 1.\n\nYes. Which is correct, because you have to cross the line y=0 once.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
