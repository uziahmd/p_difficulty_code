In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the minimum number of tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu, which can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The input is three tiles, and I have to find the minimum draws required.\n\nFirst, let me understand the requirements. The initial hand has three tiles. After drawing some tiles (possibly zero), she must have at least one mentsu. The task is to find the minimum number of tiles to draw.\n\nSo, for each case, I need to check if the current tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimal number of tiles needed to add to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, check if the existing three tiles already form a mentsu. If so, return 0.\n\nIf not, then consider all possibilities of adding tiles to form a mentsu. The minimal steps would be the minimal between the steps needed for a triplet and the steps needed for a sequence.\n\nBut how do I check for possible sequences or triplets when adding tiles?\n\nLet me break it down.\n\nCase 1: Check if the current tiles can form a triplet. For that, all three must be same. So if the three tiles are same, then it's already a triplet. Otherwise, maybe adding two more tiles of same type. Wait, but the initial three may have two same. Like, if two are same, then adding one more would make a triplet. So for example, if the three tiles are [1m, 1m, 2m], then adding one more 1m would form a triplet. But how does that fit into the problem?\n\nWait, the problem says that after drawing tiles, she can have any number of tiles. So, for example, if she has three tiles, she can draw one more tile (total four) and then select three of them to form a triplet. But the problem is that the mentsu can be formed by any subset of the tiles in her hand. So, when considering the minimal steps, we need to see what's the minimal number of tiles to add so that there exists a subset of three tiles that form a mentsu.\n\nSo, the problem is not about the entire set of tiles, but whether there exists a subset of three tiles (after adding some) that forms a mentsu.\n\nSo, for example, if the original three tiles are [1s, 2s, 3s], then they already form a shuntsu. So answer is 0.\n\nIf the original three are [1s, 1s, 2s], then adding one more 1s would form a triplet. Or adding one more 3s to make a sequence (1s, 2s, 3s). So the minimal is 1.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor the given three tiles, check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, find the minimal number of tiles to add so that after adding, there exists a mentsu.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles to add such that:\n\nEither:\n\n- There exists a triplet (three same tiles) in the collection (original + added tiles)\n\nOR\n\n- There exists a sequence (three consecutive numbers in same suit) in the collection.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find the minimal number of tiles to add for either case.\n\nSo, for each possible way to form a mentsu, compute how many tiles need to be added, and take the minimum among all possibilities.\n\nLet me think about how to check for possible triplet and sequence possibilities.\n\nFirst, for the triplet case:\n\nWe can have a triplet if there are three same tiles. So, the original tiles may have 1, 2, or 3 of a certain tile.\n\nFor example, if the original has two of a tile, then adding one more will form a triplet. So the number of tiles to add is 1.\n\nIf the original has one of a tile, then adding two more. So number of tiles to add is 2.\n\nBut maybe there are other possibilities. For example, if the original has three different tiles, but adding two tiles of same type (say, adding two of tile A) would allow forming a triplet (with two original tiles plus the two added? No, because you need three. So if original has one, adding two gives three. So yes.\n\nSo, for the triplet possibility, the minimal steps required is (3 - count of same tile) for each possible tile. Then, take the minimum of those values.\n\nBut since the original three tiles may have multiple counts of different tiles, for example, if original has two of tile A and one of tile",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand. The solution involves checking if the current tiles already form a mentsu and, if not, calculating the minimum tiles required to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, check if the given three tiles already form a valid mentsu (triplet or sequence). If they do, the answer is 0.\n2. **Triplet Check**: If the current tiles do not form a mentsu, evaluate the possibility of forming a triplet by considering how many additional tiles are needed to make three identical tiles.\n3. **Sequence Check**: Evaluate the possibility of forming a sequence by checking all possible sequences that can be formed with the current tiles and any additional tiles needed to complete the sequence.\n4. **Determine Minimum Tiles**: Calculate the minimum number of tiles required for both triplet and sequence possibilities and return the smallest value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_tiles_to_win(tiles):\n    from collections import Counter\n\n    # Parse the input tiles into a list of (number, suit)\n    tile_list = []\n    for t in tiles:\n        num = int(t[0])\n        suit = t[1]\n        tile_list.append((num, suit))\n    \n    # Check if already has a mentsu\n    def has_mentsu():\n        # Check for triplet\n        counts = Counter(tile_list)\n        for key, val in counts.items():\n            if val >= 3:\n                return True\n        # Check for sequence\n        # Group by suit\n        suits = {}\n        for num, suit in tile_list:\n            if suit not in suits:\n                suits[suit] = []\n            suits[suit].append(num)\n        # For each suit, check if there's a sequence\n        for suit, nums in suits.items():\n            if len(nums) < 3:\n                continue\n            # Sort the numbers\n            sorted_nums = sorted(nums)\n            # Check for any consecutive triplet\n            for i in range(len(sorted_nums) -

For each string, the first character is a digit...\n\n    # So the input is a single line with three strings, e.g., \"1s 2s 3s\" (but that would be three strings separated by spaces? Or is it three separate strings in a list?)\n\n    # However, the sample input shows something like ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'] which is a list of three test cases. But that's just the example. So for the actual code, the input is three strings in one line, e.g., \"1s 2s 3s\" (but that's one string), but the problem's sample input may be using a list format for explanation.\n\n    # Wait, looking at the problem's sample input:\n\n    # Input:\n    # ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n    # Output:\n    # ['0', '0', '1']\n\n    # So the input is three test cases, each consisting of three tiles. So the actual input is three lines, each with three tiles? Or perhaps the input is a single line containing three strings, each being a tile.\n\n    # Wait, the problem says: the only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. So for each test case, the input is three strings. But the sample input shows three different test cases. Therefore, the code must read multiple test cases.\n\n    # However, the problem's sample input seems to be written as a list of three test cases. However, in practice, the code should read three test cases, each on their own line.\n\n    # But the way the problem is presented is ambiguous. However, looking at the sample input and output, the code should process three test cases, each with three tiles. So the input is three lines, each line containing three tiles separated by spaces.\n\n    # For example, the first line is \"1s 2s 3s\", the second line is \"9m 9m 9m\", the third line is \"3p 9m 2p\".\n\n    # Therefore, the code should read three lines, each line representing a test case with three tiles.\n\n    # However, in the sample input given in the problem, the input is written as a list of three strings. But in reality, the input is three lines, each with three tiles.\n\n    # So for the code, we need to read three lines from stdin, each line containing three tiles separated by spaces.\n\n    # Let me adjust the code accordingly.\n\n    # So the code will read three lines, each line represents a test case.\n\n    # For example, the input is:\n\n    # 1s 2s 3s\n    # 9m 9m 9m\n    # 3p 9m 2p\n\n    # And the output is:\n\n    # 0\n    # 0\n    # 1\n\n    # So the code should read three lines, each line is a test case.\n\n    # However, the original code's input processing may vary. Let me adjust the code accordingly.\n\n    # Read all input lines\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    results = []\n    for line in input_lines:\n        tiles = line.strip().split()\n        # Now, tiles is a list of three strings, e.g., ['1s', '2s', '3s']\n        res = min_tiles_to_win(tiles)\n        results.append(str(res))\n    \n    print('\\n'.join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
