    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum lexicographical string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But I can't swap 0 and 2 directly. Hmm.\n\nSo the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1 (if adjacent), and between 1 and 2 (if adjacent). So what does that mean for the order of characters?\n\nLet me think about the possible rearrangements. Since 0 can be swapped with 1, and 1 can be swapped with 2, but 0 and 2 can't be swapped directly. However, maybe through some steps? Like, if I have a 0 and a 2 separated by some 1s, can I move them past each other?\n\nWait, suppose I have 0 1 2. Then I can swap the 0 and 1 to get 1 0 2. Then swap the 0 and 2? No, because they are not adjacent. Wait, but 0 and 2 can't be swapped directly. So maybe the 0 can't pass through the 2. Wait, but maybe the 1 can be moved around?\n\nWait, let's think of this as groups. Because 0 can be swapped with 1, and 1 can be swapped with 2. So, the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed? Or can they?\n\nWait, for example, suppose I have a 0 followed by a 2. Can I swap them? No. But if there's a 1 in between, maybe I can move the 0 to the right of the 1, and the 2 to the left of the 1? Let me think.\n\nLike, suppose the sequence is 0 1 2. Then I can swap the 0 and 1 to get 1 0 2. Then swap the 0 and 2? No, they are not adjacent. But then I can swap the 0 and 2? No. So maybe the 0 can't get past the 2. So the relative positions of 0s and 2s can't be changed? Because they can't be swapped directly and can't be swapped via 1s?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think of another example. Suppose we have 0 2. Can't swap. But if there's a 1 in between, like 0 1 2. Then perhaps we can move the 0 to the right of the 1, and the 2 to the left of the 1? But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0 can move past the 1, and the 2 can move past the 1. So, if you have 0 1 2, you can swap the 1 and 2 to get 0 2 1. Then swap the 0 and 2? No. So the 0 is stuck. So the original 0 is before the 2, but after some steps, you can get 0 2 1, but the 0 is still before the 2. So maybe the relative order between 0s and 2s can't be changed. Because 0 can't move past 2. So the 0s and 2s can't be reordered relative to each other. Only the 1s can be moved around between 0s and 2s?\n\nWait, that seems important. Because if that's the case, then the positions of 0s and 2s are fixed relative to each other. Only the 1s can be moved between them. So for example, if the original string has a 0 followed by a 2, then in the minimal string, the 0 will still be before the 2. But the 1s can be arranged in between.\n\nBut how to confirm that?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the string is \"02\". We can't swap them. So the minimal is \"02\".\n\nAnother example: \"20\". Can't swap. So the minimal is \"20\".\n\nAnother example: \"012\". The original string is 0, 1, 2. We can swap 0 and 1 to get 1 0 2. Then swap 1 and 2 to get 1 2 0. But then, can we do anything else? Well, the 0 is at the end. But if we have 1 2 0, then the 0 can't move further left. So the minimal would be 0 1 2? Wait, no. Because the original string is 0 1 2, which is already the minimal. But if you have \"012\", the minimal is \"012\".\n\nBut wait, what if the string is \"201\"? Let's see. The original is 2 0 1. Can I swap the 0 and 1? Yes. So 2 0 1 → 2 1 0. Then, can I swap 2 and 1? No. Because they are not adjacent. Wait, the 2 is first, then 1. So they are adjacent. Oh, right! Because the 2 and 1 are adjacent. So in \"210\", can I swap 2 and 1? Because they are adjacent. So that's allowed. So 210 can become 120. Then, the 1 and 2 can be swapped again. Wait, but 120 can be swapped to 102? No, because the 1 and 2 are adjacent. Wait, the 1 and 2 can be swapped. So 120 can become 210. Hmm, but that's going back. So maybe the minimal possible is 012. How?\n\nLet me think again. The original string is \"201\". How can I arrange it?\n\nOriginal is 2 0 1. Let's see:\n\nWe can swap 0 and 1 (they are adjacent) to get 2 1 0. Then, can we swap the 2 and 1? Yes, since they are adjacent. So swap them to get 1 2 0. Then swap the 2 and 0? No. But the 2 and 0 are not adjacent. So then, can we swap the 1 and 2? No, because they are adjacent. So the string is 1 2 0. Then, can we swap the 2 and 0? Not directly. So the minimal possible would be 0 1 2? How?\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. How can I get the 0 to the front? Let's see:\n\nOriginal: 2 0 1.\n\nWe can swap the 0 and 1 first to get 2 1 0. Then swap the 1 and 2 to get 1 2 0. Then, can I swap the 2 and 0? No. But maybe there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, can I swap the 2 and 0? No. Because they are not adjacent. So the 0 is stuck between 2 and 1. So the minimal string would be 0 1 2? How?\n\nWait, perhaps I can't. Because the 0 is originally after the 2. So according to the earlier hypothesis, the relative order of 0 and 2 can't be changed. So if the original string has 2 before 0, then in the minimal string, the 2 must still be before the 0. So the minimal string would be 2 0 1 → but how to arrange it?\n\nWait, but the 0 is after the 2. So in the minimal string, the 0 can't come before the 2. So the minimal possible is 0 1 2? But how can that be achieved?\n\nHmm, perhaps my initial hypothesis is wrong. Because in the example \"201\", maybe the 0 can be moved before the 2? But how?\n\nWait, maybe I can't. Because the 0 can't pass through the 2. So in the original string, the 2 is before the 0. So in the minimal string, the 2 must be before the 0. So the minimal possible string would be 0 1 2? No, because that would have the 0 before the 2. Which is not allowed. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, but how can that be? Because the original string is 2 0 1. So the 2 is before the 0. So the minimal possible string would be 0 1 2? But that would require moving the 0 before the 2, which is not allowed. So the minimal possible would be 0 1 2? No, that's not possible. So what is the minimal possible?\n\nWait, the 2 and 0 can't be swapped directly. So the minimal possible string would be 0 1 2 if possible, but if that's not possible, then the minimal would be 0 1 2? Or not?\n\nWait, maybe I can't move the 0 before the 2. So the minimal string would be 0 1 2? Or 0 1 2 is not possible. Let me think again.\n\nIn the original string \"201\", the 0 is after the 2. So the 2 must stay before the 0. So the minimal string would be 0 1 2? No. Because that would have 0 before 2. Which is not possible. So the minimal string would be 0 1 2? No. Wait, I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0 can be moved to the left of the 2 via some steps. Let me think again. Suppose the string is \"201\".\n\nLet me think of the positions. The 2 is at position 0, 0 at position 1, 1 at position 2.\n\nWe can swap the 0 and 1 (adjacent) to get \"210\".\n\nThen, the 2 and 1 are adjacent. So swap them to get \"120\".\n\nNow, the 1 is at position 0, 2 at 1, 0 at 2. Now, can we swap the 2 and 0? No. But the 1 and 2 can be swapped again. Wait, but they are adjacent. So swap them again to get \"210\" again. So it's not helpful.\n\nSo the minimal possible string would be \"012\"? But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can't. So the minimal possible string is \"012\" only if the 0 is before the 2 in the original string. Otherwise, the 2 must stay before the 0. So in this case, the original has 2 before 0. So the minimal string would have 2 before 0. So the minimal possible is 0 1 2? No, that's not possible. So what's the minimal possible string?\n\nWait, in the current scenario, the possible strings are:\n\n- 201 → original.\n\n- 210 → after swapping 0 and 1.\n\n- 120 → after swapping 2 and 1.\n\n- 102 → can we get here? Let's see. From 120, can we swap the 2 and 0? No. So no. But from 120, can we swap the 1 and 2? They are adjacent, so yes. That gives 210 again.\n\nSo the possible options are 201, 210, 120. Which of these is the lex smallest?\n\nThe lex order is 0 < 1 < 2.\n\nSo the lex smallest is 120. Because the first character is 1, which is smaller than 2. So the minimal possible is 120. But how?\n\nSo in this case, the original string is 201, and the minimal is 120. Which has 2 before 0. Wait, no. The string 120 is 1, 2, 0. So the 0 is after the 2. So the relative positions of 2 and 0 are preserved. Because in the original, the 2 was before the 0. In the final string, the 2 is before the 0. So that's allowed. So the 0 can't be moved before the 2, but the 1 can be moved around.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the relative order of 0s and 2s cannot be changed. Because you can't swap them directly, and you can't move them past each other. So the 0s and 2s are fixed in their original order. Only the 1s can be moved around between them.\n\nSo the problem reduces to grouping the 0s, 1s, and 2s, but maintaining the order of 0s and 2s. The 1s can be moved freely between the 0s and 2s. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, if the original string has a 0 followed by a 2, then the 0 must remain before the 2. But the 1s can be placed in between. For example, if the original is 0 2, then the minimal is 0 2. But if the original is 0 1 2, then the 1 can be moved around. But how?\n\nWait, in the original 0 1 2, the 1 can be moved to the left or right. But since the 0 and 2 are fixed in their order, the 1 can be placed anywhere between them. So the minimal string would be 0 1 2, which is already sorted. But if the original is 0 2 1, then the 1 can be moved to the right of the 2. But the 0 and 2 are in order. So the minimal string would be 0 1 2. How?\n\nWait, original is 0 2 1. Then, the 1 can be swapped with the 2 to get 0 1 2. So that's possible. So the 1 can move between the 0 and 2. So the 1s can be moved between the 0s and 2s, but the 0s and 2s are fixed in their original order.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- The relative order of 0s and 2s must remain the same. So the 0s and 2s in the original string must appear in the same order in the final string.\n\n- The 1s can be placed anywhere between the 0s and 2s. But how?\n\nSo the idea is to collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order, and then insert the 1s in between them in such a way that the lex order is minimized.\n\nWait, but how to arrange the 1s. Since 1 is larger than 0 and smaller than 2. So to minimize the string, we want as many 0s as possible at the beginning, followed by 1s, then 2s.\n\nBut given that the 0s and 2s are in their original order. So perhaps the optimal way is to arrange all the 0s first (in their original order), then all the 1s, then all the 2s (in their original order). But that's not possible because the original order of 0s and 2s must be preserved. For example, if the original string is 0 2 0, then the 0s and 2s are in order 0, 2, 0. So in the minimal string, the 0s and 2s must be in the same order. So the 0s and 2s can't be rearranged. So the 0s and 2s in the original string are fixed in their order. So the 0s and 2s can be thought of as a sequence, and the 1s can be inserted into any positions between them.\n\nWait, but the 1s can be moved between the 0s and 2s. So for example, if the original string is 0 2 1, then the 1 can be moved to between the 0 and 2, resulting in 0 1 2. Which is better.\n\nSo the idea is to arrange the 1s between the 0s and 2s. But how?\n\nLet me think of the entire process. Let's separate the original string into three parts: the 0s, 1s, and 2s. But no, that's not correct. Because the 0s and 2s are in their original order. So perhaps the algorithm is:\n\n- Collect all the 0s and 2s in the original string, preserving their order. Then, insert the 1s into the positions between them.\n\nBut where to insert the 1s?\n\nSince 1 is larger than 0 and smaller than 2, inserting all 1s between the 0s and 2s would be optimal. For example, if the original 0s and 2s are [0, 2, 0], then the minimal string would be 0 followed by 1s, then 2 followed by 1s, then 0 followed by 1s. Wait, but the 0s and 2s are fixed in their order. So the 0s and 2s are in the same order as in the original string. But between each pair of consecutive 0s and 2s, we can insert the 1s.\n\nWait, but the 1s can be placed anywhere in between. For example, between the 0 and 2, between the 2 and 0, etc. But since the 1s are smaller than 2, but larger than 0, placing them as early as possible would be better.\n\nSo the optimal approach is to collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order. Then, insert all the 1s between them, but where? Let's think of the 0s and 2s as a list. For example, suppose the original string is 0 2 0. Then the 0s and 2s are [0, 2, 0]. Between these elements, we can insert 1s. So between the first 0 and the 2, and between the 2 and the 0. But inserting 1s between the 0 and 2 would be better than between the 2 and 0. Because inserting the 1s between the 0 and 2 would make the string 0 followed by 1s, then 2, then 1s, then 0. Which is better than putting the 1s after the 2 and before the 0. Because the 0 comes before the 2 in the original, and the 1s are placed in between.\n\nWait, but how to decide where to put the 1s. For example, between two elements in the 0/2 sequence. Let's say the elements are A and B (each being 0 or 2). If A is 0 and B is 2, then inserting the 1s between them would be better than putting them elsewhere. If A is 0 and B is 0, inserting 1s between them would not be helpful, but since 0 is the smallest, perhaps the 1s should be placed after the 0s. Similarly, if A is 2 and B is 0, inserting 1s between them would not be allowed? Because the 2 is before the 0 in the original. So in that case, inserting the 1s between them would be allowed, but since 2 is larger than 1, and 0 is smaller than 1, inserting the 1s between 2 and 0 would create 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is worse than putting the 1s before the 2. But how?\n\nWait, but the 1s can be placed anywhere between the 0s and 2s. So perhaps the optimal way is to collect all the 1s and place them in the earliest possible positions where they can be placed. For example, between 0 and 2, between 0 and 0, between 2 and 0, etc. But how to determine where to place them.\n\nBut since 1 is larger than 0, but smaller than 2, placing the 1s after the 0s and before the 2s would be better. For example, between a 0 and a 2, inserting 1s would make the string 0...1...2, which is better than having 0...2...1.\n\nBut if there are 0s followed by 2s, then inserting the 1s between them would be optimal. But if there are 2s followed by 0s, which is not allowed, but according to the original order, the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. So for example, if the original sequence is 2 followed by 0, then the 2 must come before the 0. So inserting 1s between them would result in 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is worse than 0 followed by 1s followed by 2. But since the original sequence has 2 before 0, we can't change that. So the minimal possible would be 2...1s...0. Which is worse than if the 0 was before the 2. So the conclusion is that the 1s can be placed in between the 0s and 2s in the original order.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Split the original string into two parts: the 0s and 2s in their original order, and the 1s.\n\n2. Then, for the 0s and 2s, insert the 1s between them in a way that minimizes the lex order.\n\nBut how to insert the 1s. For example, between two consecutive elements in the 0/2 sequence. Let's take the 0/2 sequence as a list. For example, if the original string is \"012\", the 0/2 sequence is [0, 2], and the 1s are [1]. Inserting the 1 between 0 and 2 would give 0 1 2, which is optimal.\n\nAnother example: original string is \"201\". The 0/2 sequence is [2, 0], and the 1s are [1]. Inserting the 1 between 2 and 0 gives 2 1 0. Which is better than inserting it elsewhere. But that's the minimal possible.\n\nAnother example: original string is \"2012\". The 0/2 sequence is [2, 0, 2], and the 1s are [1]. Inserting the 1 between 2 and 0 gives 2 1 0 2. Which is better than inserting between 0 and 2. Which would be 2 0 1 2. But 2 0 1 2 is lex smaller than 2 1 0 2. Wait, which one is better?\n\nComparing \"2012\" vs \"2102\". The first character is 2. Second character is 0 vs 1. So 0 is smaller than 1. So 2012 is better. So why would inserting between 2 and 0 be better than inserting between 0 and 2?\n\nAh, this shows that the way we insert the 1s depends on the positions between the 0/2 elements. So for each pair of consecutive elements in the 0/2 sequence, we can decide where to insert the 1s.\n\nBut how?\n\nThe key is that inserting the 1s between two elements in the 0/2 sequence is better if that insertion leads to a smaller lex order.\n\nFor example, consider two consecutive elements in the 0/2 sequence: A and B. If A is 0 and B is 2, inserting the 1s between them would be good. If A is 0 and B is 0, inserting the 1s between them would be bad, since 0 is smaller than 1. So inserting the 1s after A (the 0) would be better. But since the 1s can be placed anywhere, perhaps the optimal way is to collect all the 1s and insert them in the earliest possible positions where they can contribute to the minimal lex order.\n\nWait, but the 1s can be inserted between any of the elements in the 0/2 sequence. For example, between A and B, between B and C, etc.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal way is to insert all the 1s as early as possible. For example, inserting them between the first possible pair of elements in the 0/2 sequence where inserting them would not increase the lex order.\n\nAlternatively, since inserting 1s between a 0 and a 2 is better than inserting between a 2 and a 0. So the idea is to insert all the 1s between 0 and 2, then between 0 and 0, then between 2 and 0, etc.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet me think of the 0/2 sequence as a list. For example, for the original string \"2012\", the 0/2 sequence is [2, 0, 2].\n\nNow, the 1s are [1].\n\nWe need to insert the 1s into the 0/2 sequence. Where?\n\nBetween the first element (2) and the second (0): inserting 1 would give 2 1 0 2. Which is lex order 2102.\n\nAlternatively, inserting between the second (0) and third (2): 2 0 1 2 → lex order 2012. Which is better than 2102. So inserting between 0 and 2 is better.\n\nSo the conclusion is that inserting the 1s between pairs where the first element is 0 and the second is 2 is better than inserting between pairs where the first is 2 and the second is 0. Also, inserting between 0 and 0 would allow us to have 0 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is worse than inserting the 1s after the first 0 and before the next 0. But since 0 is the smallest, inserting the 1s after the 0s would be better.\n\nBut how to find the best positions to insert the 1s.\n\nThe optimal way is to insert the 1s in the earliest possible positions where inserting them would not cause a larger character to appear earlier. For example, inserting between a 0 and a 2 would allow the 1 to be placed between them, which is better than inserting between a 2 and a 0.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\n- Collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order. Let's call this list 'fixed'.\n\n- Collect all the 1s into a list 'ones'.\n\n- Now, insert the ones into the 'fixed' list in the following way:\n\n   For each possible position between elements in 'fixed', determine where inserting the 1s would be optimal. The optimal position is the earliest possible position where inserting the 1s would not lead to a larger character in the earlier positions.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nAlternatively, since the 1s can be placed anywhere between the elements of 'fixed', and since inserting them between 0 and 2 is better than inserting between 2 and 0, perhaps the best way is to insert all the 1s between the 0s and 2s in the 'fixed' list. For example, between any two elements in 'fixed' where the first is 0 and the second is 2.\n\nBut how to handle cases where there are multiple such positions.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 'fixed' list as a sequence of blocks. We can insert the 1s into the 'fixed' list in such a way that all the 1s are placed between the 0s and the 2s, and as early as possible.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to insert all the 1s in between the 0s and the 2s. For example, between any 0 and 2 in the fixed sequence. If there are multiple 0-2 transitions, insert the 1s in the earliest possible transition.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 'fixed' list as a sequence of 0s and 2s. We want to insert all the 1s into the 'fixed' list in positions where they can be as far left as possible. For example, inserting the 1s between 0 and 2 would be better than inserting them between 2 and 0.\n\nSo the idea is to find all the positions between elements in the 'fixed' list where inserting a 1 would be beneficial, and insert all the 1s there.\n\nBut how to find those positions.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nThe 1s can be inserted between any two elements in the 'fixed' list. The optimal way is to insert all the 1s between the earliest possible positions where inserting them would not increase the lex order.\n\nFor example, between two elements A and B in 'fixed', inserting 1s would be better if A is 0 and B is 2. Because inserting the 1s between them would make the sequence 0...1...2, which is better than 0...2...1. But if A is 0 and B is 0, inserting the 1s between them would create 0...1...0, which is worse than 0...0...1. But since the 1s can be inserted anywhere, perhaps the best way is to insert them after all the 0s and before the 2s.\n\nWait, but how can I know that?\n\nMaybe the correct approach is to collect all the 1s and insert them into the 'fixed' list in such a way that all the 1s are placed between the 0s and the 2s. So, for example, if the 'fixed' list is [0, 2, 0, 2], then inserting all the 1s between the 0 and 2, and between the 0 and 2 again.\n\nBut how to find where to insert them.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal string would have all the 0s first (in their original order), followed by all the 1s, followed by all the 2s (in their original order). But this is only possible if the original 'fixed' list is all 0s followed by all 2s. Otherwise, the original order of 0s and 2s may have 2s followed by 0s, which would prevent this arrangement.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is:\n\n- Split the original string into 0s, 1s, and 2s.\n\n- Then, arrange the 0s in their original order, followed by the 1s, followed by the 2s in their original order.\n\nBut this is not correct. For example, if the original string is '20', then the 0s and 2s are [2, 0]. Arranging them as 0s first (but there are none), then 1s (none), then 2s (original order). So the result is 20, which is correct. Another example: '02' → same as original. But if the original is '021', then the 0s are [0], 2s are [2], and 1s are [1]. So the minimal is 0 1 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about the original '201'? The 0s are [0], 2s are [2], and 1s are [1]. According to this approach, arrange 0s (original order [0]) then 1s then 2s (original order [2]). So the result is 0 1 2. But the original 'fixed' list is [2, 0]. So according to this approach, it's not considering the original order of the 0s and 2s.\n\nAh, so this approach is invalid. Because the original order of 0s and 2s must be preserved.\n\nSo the correct approach is to keep the 0s and 2s in their original order, and insert the 1s between them. But how to decide where to insert them.\n\nAlternative idea: the 1s can be inserted anywhere between the 0s and 2s. So the minimal string is obtained by inserting the 1s into the 'fixed' list in such a way that they are placed as far to the left as possible, but without violating the order of the 0s and 2s.\n\nFor example, between any two elements in the 'fixed' list, we can insert the 1s. To minimize the lex order, we should insert the 1s as early as possible.\n\nBut how to determine where that is.\n\nLet me think of the 'fixed' list as a sequence of elements. For example, [2, 0, 2].\n\nWe can insert the 1s between positions:\n\n- Before the first element (i.e., at the beginning).\n\n- Between the first and second element.\n\n- Between the second and third element.\n\n- After the third element.\n\nInserting the 1s in the earliest possible positions would help. So for example, inserting them at the beginning (before the first element) would be better than inserting between the first and second element. But inserting before the first element would add the 1s before the 2. Which is worse than inserting after the 2. Wait, but inserting before the first element (which is 2) would give 1 2 0 2. Which is better than inserting between 2 and 0 (which gives 2 1 0 2). Because the first character is 1, which is smaller than 2.\n\nBut why is that possible? Because the original 'fixed' list is [2, 0, 2]. But inserting the 1s before the first element is allowed? But according to the earlier analysis, the 0s and 2s are in their original order. But inserting the 1s before the first element doesn't affect the order of the 0s and 2s. So that's allowed.\n\nAh! So the 1s can be inserted anywhere, even at the beginning or end of the 'fixed' list. So the 1s can be placed anywhere, as long as the 0s and 2s are in their original order.\n\nTherefore, the optimal approach is to insert all the 1s as early as possible in the 'fixed' list. But how to determine where that is.\n\nThe earliest possible positions are the beginning of the 'fixed' list. Because inserting the 1s at the beginning makes the string start with 1s, which is better than having 2s first. But wait, if the 'fixed' list starts with a 2, then inserting the 1s before the 2 would make the string start with 1, which is better than starting with 2. So that's better.\n\nSo the optimal strategy is to insert all the 1s at the very beginning of the 'fixed' list. But that's not possible if there are elements before them. Wait, no. For example, the 'fixed' list is [2, 0, 2]. Inserting the 1s before the first element would give 1...2 0 2. Which is better than inserting them later.\n\nSo the minimal possible string would be to insert all the 1s at the beginning of the 'fixed' list. But why not?\n\nWait, but what if the 'fixed' list starts with 0. For example, [0, 2, 0]. Inserting the 1s at the beginning would give 1 0 2 0. Which is worse than 0 1 2 0. Because the first character is 1 vs 0. So inserting the 1s at the beginning is worse than inserting them after the 0.\n\nAh, so inserting the 1s at the earliest possible position depends on the elements in the 'fixed' list. So the optimal way is to insert the 1s in the earliest possible position where inserting them would not cause a larger character to appear earlier.\n\nThus, the problem becomes: find the earliest position in the 'fixed' list where inserting the 1s would not cause the lex order to increase. For example, inserting the 1s before the first element if the first element is 2, but inserting after the first element if it's 0.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 'fixed' list as a sequence of characters. We can imagine that the 1s can be placed in any positions, but the 0s and 2s are fixed. The minimal string is obtained by inserting the 1s in the earliest possible positions where they are as small as possible.\n\nSo for example, the minimal string would be formed by:\n\n- All the 1s are placed as far to the left as possible, but in such a way that they are not before a 0 (since that would make the string start with 1, which is worse than 0).\n\nWait, no. If the 'fixed' list has a 0, then inserting the 1s before the 0 would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. So the optimal way is to insert the 1s after the 0s and before the 2s.\n\nSo the idea is to find all the positions in the 'fixed' list where inserting the 1s would be beneficial. For example, between a 0 and a 2, or after all the 0s, before any 2s.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nPerhaps the solution is to split the 'fixed' list into segments of 0s and 2s. For example, the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing specific adjacent swaps on a ternary string (composed of '0', '1', and '2'). The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. However, '0' and '2' cannot be swapped directly. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Constraints**: \n   - We can swap adjacent '0' and '1', and adjacent '1' and '2'. This means that '1's can be freely moved between '0's and '2's, but the relative order of '0's and '2's must remain unchanged.\n   \n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - The relative order of '0's and '2's in the original string must remain the same. However, '1's can be placed anywhere between these characters to minimize the lexicographical order.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Separate the original string into two parts: one containing all '0's and '2's in their original order, and another containing all '1's.\n   - Insert all '1's into the part with '0's and '2's at the earliest possible positions where they do not disrupt the order of '0's and '2's. Specifically, insert '1's after '0's and before '2's to ensure minimal lexicographical order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef minimum_ternary_string(s):\n    fixed = []\n    ones = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '1':\n            ones.append(c)\n        else:\n            fixed.append(c)\n    \n    result = []\n    i = 0\n    # Insert all 1s as early as possible\n    while i < len(fixed) and fixed[i] == '0':\n        result.append(fixed[i])\n        i += 1\n    # Insert all 1s here\n    result.extend(ones)\n    # Now append the remaining fixed elements\n    while i < len(fixed):\n        result.append(fixed[i])\n        i += 1\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Read input and process each test case\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    # Split input into individual test cases\n    test_cases = input_str.split()\n    for case in test_cases:\n        print(minimum_ternary_string(case))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Separation of Characters**: The input string is split into two parts: `fixed` which contains all '0's and '2's in their original order, and `ones` which collects all '1's.\n- **Insertion of '1's**: After collecting '0's and '2's, we first append all '0's to the result list. Then, we insert all '1's immediately after these '0's. Finally, we append the remaining '2's from the `fixed` list.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach ensures that we maintain the relative order of '0's and '2's while inserting '1's optimally to achieve the smallest lexicographical order. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, making it efficient for large inputs.",
