For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem seems a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the task is to compute the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s of length 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to do this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let me understand what a beautiful multiset is. From the example given, a beautiful multiset must satisfy that for every prefix s (of any length up to n), the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. And the multiset is of exactly n-length strings. The maximum possible size of such a multiset is exactly f. So our goal is to count the number of c configurations where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think about the constraints on the c_s values. For each possible configuration of c_s, there's a maximum size of a beautiful multiset. We need to count those configurations where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nLet me think about how to find the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset given the c_s values. That maximum would be determined by some constraints based on the c_s's. Maybe this is similar to a tree structure where each node represents a binary string, and the constraints propagate upwards.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For a binary string s of length l, the number of times it can appear as a prefix in the multiset is limited by c_s. But also, the count for longer prefixes depends on their parents. For example, if a string of length l is in the multiset, then all its prefixes (shorter strings) will have their counts increased by 1. Therefore, the constraints form a hierarchy.\n\nThis feels like a problem where the maximum size of the multiset is determined by the minimum of certain constraints. Maybe the maximum possible size is the minimum over all nodes of (sum of c_s along some path?), but I'm not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a trie of all binary strings of length up to n. Each node represents a binary string. The root is the empty string (but maybe not considered here). Each node has two children: appending 0 or 1. The multiset consists of n-length strings, and for each node (prefix s), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut how to model the maximum possible size of such a multiset? Well, the maximum size is the largest number of n-length strings that can be placed in the multiset without violating any of the constraints.\n\nThis sounds like a flow problem, but perhaps there's a way to model it with constraints. Alternatively, think recursively. For each node (string s), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix can't exceed c_s. However, for a node s of length l, the number of strings that have s as a prefix is equal to the sum of the number of strings in the multiset that start with s followed by 0 or 1, etc. Wait, but the multiset contains only strings of length exactly n. So for a string s of length l < n, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the number of strings in the multiset that are extensions of s to length n. So for example, for a string s of length l, the number of such strings is the number of ways to extend s to length n, considering the constraints on all prefixes of s.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled with constraints on the number of strings that can be assigned to each node. Let's consider the following approach:\n\nEach node (binary string) s has a capacity c_s. For the maximum possible size of the multiset, we want to assign as many n-length strings as possible, such that for every node s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the maximum number of n-length strings that can be chosen such that for every s, the count of strings in the multiset that start with s is ≤ c_s. This seems like a problem that can be modeled with a tree structure, where each node's capacity constrains the number of leaves under it.\n\nFor example, the root (empty string) has capacity c_root. The number of strings in the multiset can't exceed c_root. But each of those strings is a full n-length string. However, each such string contributes to the counts of all its prefixes. Therefore, the constraints form a hierarchy.\n\nThe maximum number of strings in the multiset is the minimum between the capacities of all the nodes along the paths from the root to the leaves. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose values for each binary string's capacity such that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly `f`. This involves understanding constraints on binary strings and their prefixes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: Consider all binary strings of lengths from 1 to `n` as nodes in a trie (tree structure). Each node has two children, representing appending '0' or '1'.\n2. **Constraints Propagation**: For each node (binary string), the number of times it can be a prefix in the multiset is limited by its capacity `c_s`. The maximum size of the multiset is constrained by the minimum capacities along paths from the root to the leaves.\n3. **Dynamic Programming with Combinatorics**: Use dynamic programming to compute the number of valid configurations for capacities, ensuring the maximum size of the multiset is exactly `f`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        k = int(input[idx+1])\n        f = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n        \n        # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo MOD\n        max_n = n\n        fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n        for i in range(1, max_n + 1):\n            fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n        \n        inv_fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n        inv_fact[max_n] = pow(fact[max_n], MOD-2, MOD)\n        for i in range(max_n - 1, -1, -1):\n            inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n        \n        def comb(a, b):\n            if a < 0 or b < 0 or a < b:\n                return 0\n            return fact[a] * inv_fact[b] % MOD * inv_fact[a - b] % MOD\n        \n        # We need to calculate the number of ways to assign c_s such that the maximum possible size is exactly f.\n        # First, find the total number of ways where the maximum is <= f, then subtract those where it is <= f-1.\n        \n        # However, since n is small (up to 15), we can model the problem using DP on the trie structure.\n        \n        # For each node, we can think of the minimal capacity constraint along the path from the root to the node.\n        # The maximum size of the multiset is the minimum over all nodes of the sum of capacities along their paths?\n        # Wait, perhaps the maximum size is determined by the minimal value of c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)}, but this is not accurate.\n        \n        # Another approach: For a given set of c_s, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is the minimum over all s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}), but only if the constraints are consistent.\n        # But this seems incorrect.

Hence, for each node s, c_s must be >= ceil(f / (2^{n - len(s)})). However, this may not be feasible if for some node, the required lower bound exceeds k.\n        \n        # So the number of valid assignments where min(m_s) >= f is the product over all nodes s of (k - lower_bound_s + 1), provided that lower_bound_s <= k for all s. Otherwise, it's zero.\n        \n        # Similarly for min(m_s) >= f+1.\n        \n        # Therefore, our approach is:\n        # Compute total_ways(f) = product for all nodes s of (number of possible c_s values that satisfy c_s >= ceil(f / 2^{n - len(s)})), if all such lower bounds are <=k. Else zero.\n        # Then, the answer is total_ways(f) - total_ways(f+1).\n        \n        # But wait, the problem requires that the minimum is exactly f. So the answer is total_ways(f) - total_ways(f+1).\n        \n        # Now, how to compute total_ways(x)?\n        \n        # For each x, compute for each node s, the minimal c_s that ensures m_s >=x.

Otherwise, it's zero.\n        \n        # Similarly for min(m_s) >= f+1.\n        \n        # Therefore, our approach is:\n        # Compute total_ways(f) = product for all nodes s of (number of possible c_s values that satisfy c_s >= ceil(f / 2^{n - len(s)})), if all such lower bounds are <=k. Else zero.\n        # Then, the answer is total_ways(f) - total_ways(f+1).\n        \n        # But wait, the problem requires that the minimum is exactly f.

That is, c_s >= ceil(x / (2^{n - len(s)})). Let's compute this for each node.\n        \n        # Let's precompute for each node s (of length l) the value of 2^{n - l}.\n        # Since n can be up to 15, the maximum exponent is 15.\n        # For each node of length l, the exponent is n - l.\n        # The number of nodes of length l is 2^l.\n        \n        # So for each length l from 1 to n, we have 2^l nodes. For each such node, the required c_s is at least ceil(x / (2^{n - l})).\n        \n        # Now, for each x, we compute for each l from 1 to n, the value of d = 2^{n - l}, and compute the minimal c_s for that l, which is ceil(x / d).\n        # For each l, the number of nodes is 2^l, and each contributes a factor of (k - lower + 1) if lower <=k, else zero.\n        \n        # So the total_ways(x) is the product over all l from 1 to n of [ (k - lower_l + 1)^{2^l} ] where lower_l = ceil(x / (2^{n - l} )) if lower_l <=k, else 0.\n        \n        # However, for x=0, we need to handle it carefully, but according to the problem statement, f is at least 1.\n        \n        # So let's proceed with this plan.\n        \n        # Now, for the given n, k, f, compute total_ways(f) - total_ways(f+1).\n        \n        # But first, check if f is larger than the maximum possible value. For example, if even when all c_s are set to k, the minimal m_s is less than f, then total_ways(f) is zero.\n        \n        # Let's implement a function to compute total_ways(x).\n        \n        def compute_total(x):\n            res = 1\n            for l in range(1, n+1):\n                d = 1 << (n - l)  # 2^{n - l}\n                if d == 0:\n                    continue\n                lower = (x + d - 1) // d  # ceil(x / d)\n                if lower > k:\n                    return 0\n                cnt = (k - lower + 1)\n                # There are 2^l nodes of length l\n                power = 2 ** l\n                # Compute cnt^power mod MOD\n                # To compute this efficiently, we can use pow with mod\n                term = pow(cnt, power, MOD)\n                res = res * term % MOD\n            return res\n        \n        # Now, compute ans = compute_total(f) - compute_total(f+1)\n        # But need to handle cases where compute_total(f) or compute_total(f+1) is zero.\n        \n        total_f = compute_total(f)\n        total_f_plus_1 = compute_total(f + 1)\n        ans = (total_f - total_f_plus_1) % MOD\n        print(ans)\n        \nmain()",
