The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The problem is about calculating the probability that after randomly building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 50% chance), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what configurations of towers allow such a setup. Let's think about the conditions required for the towers.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower's signal. So, for any tower, its signal power can't reach beyond those towns. For example, if there's a tower at position i, then its power p must be such that i - p + 1 > 0? Wait, the signal reaches cities c where |c - i| < p. So for town 0, which is at position 0, the distance from a tower at i is i. So, to not cover town 0, we need that for any tower, i >= p. Because if p is the power, then |0 - i| < p implies i < p. So to prevent town 0 from being covered, for all towers, their power p must be <= i. Similarly for town n+1: for any tower at position i, the distance to n+1 is (n+1 - i). To avoid covering it, we need that (n+1 - i) >= p. So p <= (n+1 -i). Therefore, the maximum possible power for a tower at i is min(i, n+1 -i). But since the power can be set as needed, perhaps the arrangement of towers must be such that each tower can be assigned a power that covers exactly certain towns, without overlapping in a way that causes any town to be covered by multiple towers or none.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nAnother approach: think of the problem as needing to have a valid arrangement where each town is covered exactly once. This sounds similar to some kind of partitioning of the towns into intervals, each covered by a tower. But how?\n\nLet me think of the constraints again. Each tower's coverage is a range (i - p + 1, i + p - 1) or something? Wait, the signal reaches cities c where |c - i| < p. So the range is (i - p + 1) to (i + p - 1)? No, because |c -i| < p means c can be from i-p+1 to i+p-1? Wait, for example, if p is 2, then |c-i| < 2 means c can be i-1, i, or i+1. So the range is [i - p + 1, i + p -1] ?\n\nWait, no. The inequality |c - i| < p is equivalent to c ∈ (i - p, i + p). Since c is an integer, this would be the integers from i - p + 1 up to i + p - 1. Because for example, if p is 2, then the range is i-1 to i+1. So yes, the coverage is a continuous interval of length 2p-1 centered at i.\n\nBut the problem requires that each town from 1 to n is covered exactly once. Also, towns 0 and n+1 are not covered by any tower.\n\nSo, the towers must be arranged in such a way that their coverage regions form a partition of the towns 1..n, with each region being covered by exactly one tower, and none of the regions extending beyond town 0 or n+1.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of tiling the line with intervals, where each interval corresponds to a tower's coverage. However, the intervals must be such that each is centered at a tower's position, and the length of the interval depends on the power of that tower.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think recursively. Suppose that for the towns 1 to n, the towers are placed in such a way that there's a way to assign power so that each town is covered exactly once.\n\nAn important observation here is that for a tower at position i, the coverage must start at some position s and end at e, such that s ≤ i ≤ e. Moreover, the coverage must not include town 0 or n+1. So, for the tower at i, the maximum possible coverage is up to i + p -1. But since town n+1 cannot be covered, we have that i + p -1 ≤ n. Similarly, i - p +1 ≥ 1. Wait, no. Because town 0 can't be covered. So for a tower at i, the leftmost town it can cover is 1. So, i - p + 1 ≥ 1?",

This means the maximum power for a tower at position i is constrained by its distance from these towns.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: We use dynamic programming to count valid configurations of towers that can be assigned signal powers meeting the constraints. Let `dp[i]` represent the number of valid configurations for the first i towns.\n3. **Transition Between States**: For each position i, we consider two cases:\n   - If a tower is built at position i, it can cover from i-1 to i+1 (power 1).\n   - If a tower is not built at position i, we look back to the previous valid configuration.\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be modulo 998244353, we use modular inverses to handle divisions efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # dp[i] is the number of valid configurations for the first i towns\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case: no towns\n    dp[1] = 1  # only town 1 can be built, then set power 1\n    \n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        # Case 1: tower is built at i, and it covers i-1 and i\n        # Then the previous must be valid up to i-2\n        dp[i] = dp[i - 1]  # if tower is not built at i, but this is not correct\n        # Wait, need to rethink the transition\n        \n        # Actually, the recurrence is more complex. Let's think again.\n        # The recurrence is similar to tiling problem.\n        # The correct recurrence is dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]\n        # Because:\n        # - If there is a tower at i, then it must cover i-1 and i. So the previous part is up to i-2.\n        # - If there is no tower at i, then it must be covered by the tower at i-1. But that would require that i-1 is built, and the tower at i-1 has power 2, which covers i.\n        # However, this seems to not directly apply here. So perhaps another approach.\n        \n        # Let's refer to the problem as similar to the tiling problem where each tile is of length 1 or 2.\n        # But the correct recurrence is dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2], but with some modifications.\n        \n        # Let me re-derive the recurrence.\n        # The valid configurations are those where the towers can be arranged such that each town is covered exactly once.\n        # This is equivalent to the number of ways to arrange the towers such that they form a valid partition of the towns into intervals covered by a single tower.\n        # For example, for each position i, either:\n        # 1. There is a tower at i, and it covers i-1 and i. Then the previous part is up to i-2.\n        # 2. There is a tower at i-1, which covers i-1 and i. Then the previous part is up to i-3.\n        # But this seems to not capture all possibilities. However, in the problem's note, for n=2, the valid configuration is when both towers are built (probability 1/4). For n=3, the valid configurations are when towers are built in 1,2,3 (probability 1/8) or only in 2 (probability 1/8). So total is 2/8 = 1/4.
