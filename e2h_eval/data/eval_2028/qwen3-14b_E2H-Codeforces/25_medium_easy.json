При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string t could have been formed by merging two identical messages s with an error. The error occurs when two same messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap has to be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second. The overlapping part must be a positive number of characters, but less than the length of s. Also, the case where the two messages are completely overlapping (so the merged string is exactly s) or just concatenated (like s + s) is not considered an error. So, for example, if t is \"abcd\", it's not considered an error. Similarly, \"abcabc\" is not considered an error.\n\nOur task is to check if such an error could have happened. If yes, output \"YES\" and a possible s. Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the merged string t must be formed by two copies of s overlapping. So, the length of t must be equal to 2*len(s) - k, where k is the overlap length. Since k is between 1 and len(s)-1, then the length of t would be between len(s) + 1 (when k is len(s)-1) and 2*len(s) - 1 (when k is 1). \n\nBut since we don't know s, perhaps we can find possible candidates for s based on the length of t.\n\nLet me denote the length of t as n. For the original s, the length of s must be such that:\n\nn = 2 * len(s) - k, where 1 ≤ k < len(s).\n\nRearranging this equation: len(s) = (n + k)/2. But since k is between 1 and len(s)-1, substituting len(s) into the equation gives:\n\nk must be in [1, len(s)-1] → substituting len(s) = (n + k)/2:\n\nk must be between 1 and ((n +k)/2) - 1 → solving this inequality might be complicated. Maybe there's a better way to think about possible lengths of s.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the merged string t is formed by two s's overlapping by k characters. So, the total length of t is len(s) + len(s) - k = 2*len(s) -k. So, len(t) = 2L -k, where L is the length of s, and 1 ≤k < L.\n\nSo, rearranged, L must be greater than k, and k is 2L -n. Wait, solving for k: 2L -n =k. Since k must be at least 1 and less than L, substituting:\n\n1 ≤ 2L -n < L → \n\nLet me solve these inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: 2L -n ≥ 1 → 2L ≥ n+1 → L ≥ (n+1)/2.\n\nSecond inequality: 2L -n < L → 2L -n < L → L < n.\n\nSo combining these, L must satisfy (n+1)/2 ≤ L < n.\n\nSince L must be an integer (as it's the length of s), possible values for L are from ceil((n+1)/2) up to n-1.\n\nBut wait, let's take an example. Suppose n is 5. Then (n+1)/2 is 3. So possible L is 3,4.\n\nFor each possible L, we can check if there exists a k such that k = 2L -n. And since k must be between 1 and L-1, we can check that.\n\nWait, for each possible L (from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1), compute k = 2L -n. Then check if 1 ≤ k < L.\n\nBecause for L to be valid, k must be in that range.\n\nLet me see:\n\nTake L in the range (n+1)/2 ≤ L <n. Let's compute k=2L -n.\n\nFor example, if n is 5, and L is 3: k=6-5=1. Which is between 1 and 2 (since L=3, L-1=2). So valid.\n\nIf L is 4, k=8-5=3. L-1 is 3, so k=3 is not less than L. So invalid. Hence, for L=4, k=3 which is equal to L-1 (since L=4, L-1=3). So 3 < L is true (since 3 <4). So yes, k is allowed. Because the condition is that k must be less than L. So for k=3 and L=4, 3 <4 is true. So yes. So for L=4, k=3 is allowed.\n\nSo for L in that range, k will be between 1 and L-1?\n\nLet me check:\n\nWe have L >= (n+1)/2. Let's express n as 2L -k. Since k is positive, n = 2L -k < 2L. So for L <n → 2L -k <n → but maybe that's not helpful.\n\nBut given that L is between (n+1)/2 and n-1, then for k = 2L -n:\n\nLet me see for L in that range.\n\nFor example, when L is (n+1)/2, then k = 2*(n+1)/2 -n = n+1 -n = 1. Which is valid.\n\nWhen L is n-1, then k = 2(n-1) -n = 2n-2 -n = n-2. Now, since L is n-1, L-1 = n-2. So k = n-2 is equal to L-1. Which is allowed because the condition is that k must be less than L. Since n-2 < n-1, yes. So k is valid.\n\nThus, for all L in the range ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1, the k is between 1 and L-1. So for each possible L in that range, we can check if the string t can be formed by overlapping two copies of s, where s has length L, and overlapping by k=2L -n characters.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible L values (possible lengths of s) in the range from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1.\n\nFor each L:\n\n   a. Compute k = 2L -n.\n\n   b. Check if the first k characters of t's prefix match the last k characters of t's suffix. Because when two s's are merged with overlap k, the first s ends with the k characters that are the same as the start of the second s. So the entire merged string t must have the first part (the first s) and the second part (the second s) overlapping. So the first L characters of t (the first s) must have their last k characters equal to the first k characters of the second s. But since the second s starts at position L -k (since the overlap is k), the first k characters of the second s would be the first k characters of s. Therefore, the last k characters of the first s (which is the first L characters of t) must be equal to the first k characters of s. But since s is the same as the first s, the first k characters of s are the same as the first k characters of the first s. So, the first L characters of t (which is s) must have their last k characters equal to the first k characters of s. Therefore, the first L characters of t must have their last k characters equal to the first k characters of the same s. Which implies that the first k characters of the first s (i.e., the first k characters of the first L characters of t) must equal the last k characters of the first s. So, the first L characters of t must have their first k characters equal to their last k characters. \n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nThe merged string t is formed by overlapping two copies of s. Let me imagine that the first s is s, and the second s is also s. When overlapping by k characters, the merged string is s[0...L-k-1] + s. Because the overlapping part is the last k characters of the first s and the first k of the second s. So the merged string is s concatenated with s, but overlapping the last k of first and first k of second. So the merged string has length L + (L -k) = 2L -k. Which equals n. So the merged string is s concatenated with s[k:].\n\nTherefore, the merged string t should be equal to s + s[k:]. So the entire string t must be equal to this.\n\nBut since s is of length L, then the first L characters of t must be s. Then, the rest of the string (from position L -k onwards) must be s[k:].\n\nAlternatively, the entire string t must be equal to s + s[k:], which is of length L + (L -k) = 2L -k = n. So for the given t, if we can find s such that this holds, then it's valid.\n\nBut how to find s? Well, for a given L, the s would be the first L characters of t, but only if the overlapping part is correct.\n\nWait, because the merged string is formed by overlapping two s's. So, the first s is s, and the second s is s. The merged string t is s[0 ... L -k -1] + s. But since the overlapping part is k characters, the first s's last k characters must equal the second s's first k characters. Since both are s, the first k characters of s must equal the last k characters of s.\n\nSo, for the given t, if we take s as the first L characters of t, then we need to check that the last k characters of s equal the first k characters of s. Also, the rest of the t (after the first L -k characters) must be equal to s. Because the merged string is s concatenated with s[k:].\n\nSo, for example, the merged string t should be equal to s + s[k:]. Which is the same as s concatenated with s starting from index k. So the entire t should be equal to this.\n\nAlternatively, the entire string t must be equal to s + s[k:], and the length is n = 2L -k. So for a given L and k, we can check if the first L characters of t (s_candidate) satisfies that the last k characters of s_candidate equals the first k characters of s_candidate, and that the rest of the string (from position L -k onwards) equals s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nLet me think. Let me take s_candidate as the first L characters of t. Then, the merged string should be s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. So the total length is L + (L -k) = 2L -k = n. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the entire string t must be equal to s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. Which can be checked by taking the first L characters as s_candidate, then checking if the rest of the string (from index L -k onwards) is equal to s_candidate[k:].\n\nWait, but the entire t is supposed to be s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:]. So the first L characters are s_candidate, and the next (L -k) characters are s_candidate[k:]. Therefore, the entire string t should be equal to s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:]. So the total length is L + (L -k) = 2L -k = n. Which is correct.\n\nSo for example, the first part is s_candidate, then the next part is s_candidate[k:].\n\nSo, the entire t should be equal to s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut how do I check that? Well, the entire t is of length n. So, the first L characters are s_candidate. The rest of the string (from position L onwards) should be equal to s_candidate[k:].\n\nWait, no. Because the merged string is s_candidate (length L) plus s_candidate[k:] (length L -k). So the total length is L + (L -k) = 2L -k. Which is n. Therefore, the entire t should be equal to the concatenation of s_candidate and s_candidate[k:]. So the first L characters are s_candidate, then the next (L -k) characters are s_candidate[k:]. So, the entire t should be equal to this concatenation.\n\nBut how to check that? Let's take the first L characters as s_candidate. Then, the rest of the string (t[L:]) should be equal to s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut what about the overlapping part? For example, the first L -k characters of the first s_candidate are followed by the second s_candidate's part. But the overlapping is handled by merging. So, the first L characters of t is s_candidate, and the rest of the string (from position L -k onwards) must be s_candidate[k:].\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. The merged string is formed by overlapping the two s_candidate's. So the first s_candidate is written, but the second s_candidate starts overlapping with the first. So the merged string is s_candidate's first (L -k) characters, followed by the second s_candidate. So the entire string is s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate. But that's not correct. Because the overlapping is k characters. So the first s_candidate ends with the k characters that are the same as the beginning of the second s_candidate. Therefore, the merged string is the first s_candidate without its last k characters, followed by the entire second s_candidate. Which is s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate. But that would be length (L -k) + L = 2L -k, which is n. So the entire t should be equal to s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate. But the first L characters of t are s_candidate. So the first L -k characters of s_candidate are the first L -k characters of t, and then the next k characters of s_candidate are overlapped with the second s_candidate. Therefore, the rest of the t (after the first L -k characters) must be equal to s_candidate. Wait, but the entire t is s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate. Which is of length (L -k) + L = 2L -k = n. Therefore, the entire t can be split into two parts: the first part is s_candidate[:L -k], and the second part is s_candidate. So, the entire t is s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate. Therefore, the entire t must be equal to that.\n\nBut since the first L characters of t are s_candidate, then the first L -k characters of t are s_candidate[:L -k], and the next k characters are s_candidate[L -k : L]. Then, the rest of the string (from position L onwards) is s_candidate. So, the entire t must be s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate. Which is the same as the first L characters (s_candidate) plus s_candidate[L -k : ] ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think with an example. Let's say s is \"abcd\", and k is 2. Then the merged string would be \"ab\" + \"abcd\" (since the first two letters of the second s are overlapping with the last two of the first s). So the merged string is \"abcd\" + \"cd\" → wait no. Wait, the first s is abcd, the second is abcd. They overlap by 2 characters. So the merged string is abcd (first s) overlapping with the second s's first two characters. So the merged string is abcd (first s) but the last two letters (cd) are overlapping with the first two letters of the second s. So the merged string is abcd concatenated with the remaining letters of the second s after the first two. The second s is abcd. After overlapping the first two letters (ab?), no, wait the overlapping is that the last k letters of the first s (cd) are the same as the first k letters of the second s (ab?), which would not be the case here. So perhaps my example is not correct. Let me pick a correct example.\n\nTake s = \"abab\", and k = 2. The first s is abab, the second is abab. Overlap by 2 characters. The last two letters of the first s are 'ab', and the first two of the second s are 'ab'. So the merged string is 'abab' merged with 'abab' overlapping by 2 letters. The merged string would be 'abab' + 'ab' (the part after the overlapping) → 'ababab'? Wait, no. The first s is abab, the second s is abab. When overlapping by two letters, the merged string would be the first s (abab) with the second s's part after the overlapping. So the merged string would be abab (first s) but overlapping the last two letters (ab) with the first two letters of the second s (ab). So the merged string is abab (the first s) followed by the second s's letters after the first two. So the second s is abab, after the first two letters (ab) comes ab. So the merged string is abab + ab → ababab. Which is length 6. Original length of s is 4. 2L -k = 8 -2=6. Correct.\n\nSo the merged string is s_candidate (abab) concatenated with s_candidate[k:] (ab). So the entire t is abab + ab = ababab. Which is correct.\n\nSo in this case, the entire t is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. Which is what I thought earlier. So for the general case, the entire t must be equal to s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nSo, for a given L and k, the steps are:\n\n1. Take s_candidate = t[0:L]\n\n2. Check if the last k characters of s_candidate equals the first k characters of s_candidate. Because when overlapping, the overlapping part must be same. So, the last k of s_candidate (the first s) must equal the first k of the second s (which is same as s_candidate's first k). So, this check is necessary.\n\n3. Then, check if the entire t is equal to s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nIf both conditions are true, then it's a valid case.\n\nSo, for each possible L in the range [(n+1)//2, n-1], we compute k = 2L -n. Then check the above conditions.\n\nOnce any such L is found, we can return the s_candidate as the answer.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nRead the input string t.\n\nCompute n = len(t).\n\nIf n is 1, then it's impossible (since you need two messages, but merged string can't be formed. Because the merged string length would be 2L -k, but for L >= (n+1)/2, but n is 1, then L must be >= (1+1)/2 = 1. So L can be 1, but then k = 2*1 -1 = 1. But k must be less than L (1 < 1?), which is false. So no possible L. So output NO.\n\nSo for the general code:\n\nLoop L from (n+1)//2 to n-1 inclusive.\n\nFor each L:\n\n   compute k = 2L -n.\n\n   check if 1 <=k < L. Well, according to previous analysis, since L is in the range [(n+1)/2, n-1], then k is between 1 and L-1. So this is always true. So no need to check again.\n\n   Then, take s_candidate = t[0:L]\n\n   check if the last k characters of s_candidate == first k characters of s_candidate.\n\n   Also, check if the entire t equals s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nIf both conditions are true, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf none of the L's work, return NO.\n\nBut why do we need to check both conditions? Because even if the overlapping part is correct, the rest of the string may not match. For example, suppose s_candidate's last k chars match the first k, but the rest of the string doesn't match.\n\nBut maybe checking the second condition (t == s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]) automatically includes the first condition. Because, for example, if the last k of s_candidate is not equal to the first k of s_candidate, then s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] would have overlapping part that doesn't match, leading to the merged string not matching t. However, the first check is redundant? Or not?\n\nLet me think. For example, if the first check is not done, but the second check is done. Suppose the s_candidate is such that the last k characters are not equal to the first k. Then, the merged string would be s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], which would have the first L characters as s_candidate, and then the rest as s_candidate[k:]. However, the actual t is supposed to be the merged string. So, in this case, the merged string would not be correct, but how?\n\nWait, the merged string is formed by overlapping the two s's. So the merged string must be the same as s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:], but the way the overlapping works requires that the overlapping parts are equal. So, if the overlapping parts are not equal, then the merged string would not be the same as s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nWait, for example, suppose s_candidate is 'abc', and k=1. Then, the merged string would be the first s (abc) overlapping with the second s (abc) by 1 character. So the merged string is 'ab' + 'abc' → 'ababc'? Wait, no. Because the overlapping is the last 1 character of the first s (c) and the first 1 character of the second s (a). Since they are not equal, the merging would not happen. But the problem says that the error occurs when the two messages are merged by overlapping. So the merging can only happen if the overlapping parts are equal. Therefore, in our code, we need to ensure that the overlapping parts are equal. So the first check (last k of s_candidate == first k of s_candidate) is necessary. Because otherwise, the merging would not have happened. Thus, the code needs to check that.\n\nSo, the two checks are needed. Because even if the merged string t equals s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], but the overlapping part isn't correct, that would be invalid. However, in reality, if the overlapping part is not correct, then the merged string would not be formed. Therefore, the code must check that the overlapping part is correct.\n\nBut how can the merged string be equal to s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] if the overlapping part is not correct? Because that would imply that the first s_candidate's last k characters are not equal to the second s_candidate's first k characters, but the merged string is formed by overlapping them. Which would not be possible. Therefore, the code must ensure that the overlapping part is correct.\n\nSo, the two checks are necessary.\n\nBut perhaps the second check (t == s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]) already implies that the overlapping part is correct. Because, for example, the first L characters of t is s_candidate, and the rest is s_candidate[k:]. So, the entire t is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. Let's take the example where the overlapping part is not correct. Let's say s_candidate is 'abc', k=1. Then s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] is 'abc' + 'bc' = 'abcbc'. Now, the merged string would be formed by overlapping the two s_candidates by k=1. However, the overlapping part is 'c' (from first s_candidate) and 'a' (from the second s_candidate). These are not equal. So the merged string would not be formed correctly. However, the code would check if t equals 'abcbc'. If t is indeed 'abcbc', then according to the problem's scenario, this would be considered as an error. But according to the problem statement, the error can only occur if the overlapping is possible. So in this case, the code would think that it's a valid case, but in reality, the merging couldn't have happened because the overlapping parts are not equal. Therefore, the code must check that the overlapping parts are equal.\n\nTherefore, the two checks are needed.\n\nSo, in code, for each L, we need to:\n\nCheck if the last k characters of s_candidate == first k characters of s_candidate.\n\nThen check if the entire t is equal to s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nOnly if both are true, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nNow, let's think about examples.\n\nTake the first sample input: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (the first example in the sample input, which outputs YES and 'abrakadabra').\n\nThe length of t is len('abrakadabrabrakadabra') → let's count. Let me see:\n\nOriginal string is 'abrakadabra' (length 11) + 'abrakadabra' (another 11). But merged with some overlap. For example, the sample input says that the merged string could be 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (which is 21 characters). Let's check the length.\n\nOriginal t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → let's count the letters. Let me see:\n\nabrakadabra is 11 letters. Then, the merged string is abrakadabra (11) + brakadabra (but overlapping by 1 character). So total length is 11 + 11 -1 = 21. So n is 21.\n\nSo for this case, n is 21.\n\nPossible L ranges from (21 +1)/2 = 11 to 20.\n\nSo L can be 11, 12, ..., 20.\n\nFor L=11, k = 2*11 -21 = 22-21=1. So k=1.\n\nCheck s_candidate is the first 11 characters: 'abrakadabra'.\n\nCheck if last 1 character of s_candidate (a) equals first 1 character of s_candidate (a). Yes.\n\nThen check if t equals s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] → s_candidate is 11 characters, s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[1:] → 'brakadabra' (length 10). So concatenated, it's 11 + 10 = 21, which is the length of t. The concatenation is 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → which is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → which is the given t. So yes. So this is a valid case. So the code returns YES and s_candidate.\n\nAnother example: sample input 'acacacaca' (output 'YES' and 'acaca').\n\nn is 9.\n\nPossible L ranges from (9+1)/2 = 5 to 8.\n\nSo L can be 5,6,7,8.\n\nLet's check for L=5: k=2*5 -9 =1. So k=1.\n\ns_candidate is first 5 characters: 'acaca'.\n\nCheck if last 1 character (a) equals first 1 character (a). Yes.\n\nCheck if t equals 'acaca' + 'caca' → 'acacacaca' which is the input. So yes. So output is YES and 'acaca'.\n\nAnother possible L is 6. k=2*6 -9= 3. So k=3.\n\ns_candidate is first 6 characters: 'acacac'.\n\nCheck if last 3 characters of s_candidate (cac) equals first 3 (aca)? No. So this is invalid.\n\nAnother L=7: k=2*7-9=5. So k=5.\n\ns_candidate is first 7 characters: 'acacaca'.\n\nCheck if last 5 characters of s_candidate (c a c a c a? Wait, let me think. The s_candidate is 'acacaca' (length 7). Last 5 characters are positions 2 to 6: 'cacac'? Let me write the string:\n\nIndices 0-6: a c a c a c a. Last 5 characters are positions 2-6: a c a c a? Wait, no. Last 5 characters are positions 7-5=2? Wait, for length 7, last 5 characters are from index 2 to 6 (inclusive). So the substring is 'acaca'.\n\nThe first 5 characters of s_candidate are 'acaca'. So they are equal. So check passes.\n\nThen, check if t equals s_candidate + s_candidate[5:]. s_candidate[5:] is 'ca' (positions 5 and 6). So concatenated, it's 'acacaca' + 'ca' → 'acacacaca', which is the input. So this is also a valid case. So the code could return 'acacaca' as another possible answer. But the sample output says that 'acaca' is acceptable. So the code can return any valid s_candidate.\n\nSo the code would find multiple possible L's, but we can return the first one found.\n\nNow, the code needs to check all possible L's in the range and return the first valid one.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input string t.\n\nThen, n = len(t).\n\nIf n < 2: output NO. Because for example, if n is 1, you can't have two messages. Even if n is 2, possible L would be (2+1)/2 = 1.5 → ceil(1.5) is 2. But L must be up to n-1 =1. So no possible L. So output NO.\n\nSo for n < 2, output NO.\n\nElse:\n\nLoop L from (n+1)//2 to n-1 inclusive.\n\nFor each L:\n\n   k = 2*L -n.\n\n   s_candidate = t[:L]\n\n   if len(s_candidate) != L: ?? Well, since t is of length n, and L is up to n-1, then t[:L] is valid.\n\n   check if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]\n\n   if that's true, then check if t == s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]\n\n   if both are true, then output YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf after checking all L's, none found, output NO.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nTest case 1: 'abcabc' → output NO.\n\nn=6.\n\nPossible L ranges from (6+1)/2=3.5 → ceil is 4. So L can be 4,5.\n\nFor L=4: k=2*4 -6= 2. So check if last 2 characters of first 4 letters (t[:4] is 'abca') → last 2 is 'ca', first 2 is 'ab' → not equal. So invalid.\n\nFor L=5: k= 2*5 -6=4. Check if last 4 of s_candidate (t[:5] is 'abcab') → last 4 is 'bcab', first 4 is 'abca' → not equal. So invalid. So output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'abababab' → sample output is YES and 'ababab'.\n\nLet me see. Input is 'abababab' (n=8).\n\nPossible L ranges from (8+1)/2=4.5 → 5 to 7.\n\nCheck L=5: k= 2*5 -8 = 2.\n\ns_candidate is t[:5] = 'ababa'.\n\nCheck last 2 chars of 'ababa' → 'ba' and first 2 chars 'ab' → not equal. So invalid.\n\nL=6: k= 2*6 -8=4.\n\ns_candidate is t[:6] = 'ababab'.\n\nCheck last 4 chars: 'baba' (positions 2-5?), wait:\n\ns_candidate is 'ababab' (length 6). last 4 is 'abab'? Wait:\n\ns_candidate[-k:] is s_candidate[-4:] → indexes 2 to 5: 'abab'.\n\ns_candidate[:k] is first 4 characters: 'abab'. So they are equal. Then check if t equals s_candidate + s_candidate[4:].\n\ns_candidate[4:] is 'ab' (positions 4 and 5). So concatenated, it's 'ababab' + 'ab' → 'abababab', which is the input. So yes. So output YES and 'ababab'.\n\nSo the code would find this.\n\nAnother example: 'tatbt' → output NO.\n\nn=5. Possible L ranges from (5+1)/2=3 to 4.\n\nCheck L=3: k= 2*3 -5=1.\n\ns_candidate is 'tat'.\n\nCheck last 1 char 't' vs first 1 char 't' → equal. Then check if t is 'tat' + 'at' → 'tatat' → but input is 'tatbt' → no. So invalid.\n\nFor L=4: k= 2*4 -5=3.\n\ns_candidate is 'tatb'.\n\nCheck last 3 chars: 'atb' vs first 3 chars 'tat' → not equal. So invalid. So output NO.\n\nSo the code returns NO.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead the input string t. Then:\n\nn = len(t)\n\nif n < 2:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    found = False\n\n    for L in range( (n+1)//2, n ):\n\n        k = 2*L -n\n\n        # check if k is between 1 and L-1. But according to previous analysis, since L is in the range (n+1)/2 to n-1, k is between 1 and L-1.\n\n        # proceed\n\n        s_candidate = t[:L]\n\n        # check if last k chars of s_candidate == first k chars\n\n        if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n\n            # check if t equals s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]\n\n            if s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] == t:\n\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n                print(s_candidate)\n\n                found = True\n\n                break\n\n    if not found:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you slice a string with [a:b], if a is larger than the length, it returns up to the end. But in our code, for s_candidate[-k:], when k is positive and L is at least (n+1)/2, which is >= 1 for n >= 2. For example, for L= (n+1)//2, which for n=2, (2+1)//2=1.5 floored to 1? Wait no, in Python, (n+1)//2 for n=2 is (3)//2=1. So for n=2, L ranges from 1 to 1 (since n-1=1). So L=1. Then k=2*1 -2=0. But according to our previous analysis, k is 1<=k <L. But here, L=1 and k=0. Which is invalid. Wait, but earlier analysis said that for L in the range [(n+1)/2, n-1], k is between 1 and L-1. But for n=2, (n+1)/2 is 1.5, so the range is from 2 (ceil(1.5) is 2?), but n-1 is 1. So the loop for L in range( (n+1)//2, n ) would be for L in range(2, 2), which is empty. So for n=2, the code would not enter the loop, and output NO. Which is correct, since for n=2, the possible L is 1. But for L=1, k=2*1 -2=0, which is invalid. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the range is exclusive of the upper bound. For example, range(a, b) includes a, a+1, ..., b-1. So for the code:\n\nfor L in range( (n+1)//2, n ):\n\nSo for example, if n=5, then (n+1)//2 is 3. So L runs from 3, 4 (since n is 5, and the upper bound is 5, so range(3,5) is 3 and 4).\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, testing for the sample input:\n\nSample input 3: 'abcabc' → output 'NO'.\n\nSample input 4: 'abababab' → output 'YES' and 'ababab'.\n\nAnother sample input is 'acacacaca' → output 'YES' and 'acaca'.\n\nSo the code should handle these.\n\nPotential issues:\n\nWhat if there are multiple possible L's? For example, in the second sample input, 'acacacaca' (n=9), possible L's are 5,6,7,8.\n\nFor L=5, k=1, which works.\n\nFor L=7, k=5, which also works.\n\nThe code would return the first one found, which is L=5, and output 'acaca'.\n\nAnother possible case is when the code finds multiple possibilities. But the problem allows any of them.\n\nAnother edge case: t is 'aaaaa' (n=5). Possible L ranges from 3",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages `s` with an error. The error occurs when two identical messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap must be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second, with the overlap length being a positive number less than the length of the message.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Overlap Requirements**: The merged string `t` must be formed by two identical messages `s` overlapping by some positive length `k`, where `1 ≤ k < len(s)`. The length of `t` (denoted as `n`) must satisfy the equation `n = 2 * len(s) - k`.\n\n2. **Determine Possible Lengths for `s`**: For each possible length `L` of `s`, check if it can be derived from the length of `t` using the formula `k = 2 * L - n`. Valid values of `L` range from `(n + 1) // 2` to `n - 1`.\n\n3. **Check Validity of Overlap**: For each valid length `L`, extract the candidate string `s_candidate` from the beginning of `t` and verify if the overlap condition is met. Specifically, check if the last `k` characters of `s_candidate` match the first `k` characters of `s_candidate`.\n\n4. **Verify Merged String**: Ensure that the entire string `t` can be reconstructed by concatenating `s_candidate` with the substring starting from index `k` of `s_candidate`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nn = len(t)\n\nif n < 2:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    found = False\n    # Iterate over possible lengths L of s\n    for L in range((n + 1) // 2, n):\n        k = 2 * L - n\n        s_candidate = t[:L]\n        # Check if the overlapping part matches\n        if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n            # Check if the entire t is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]\n            if s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] == t:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                print(s_candidate)\n                found = True\n                break\n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and its length `n` is determined.\n2. **Edge Case Check**: If the length of `t` is less than 2, it's impossible to form the required overlap, so \"NO\" is printed immediately.\n3. **Loop Through Possible Lengths**: For each possible length `L` of the original message `s`, compute the overlap length `k`.\n4. **Overlap Check**: Verify if the overlap condition is satisfied by comparing the relevant substrings of the candidate message `s_candidate`.\n5. **Reconstruction Check**: Ensure that the candidate message `s_candidate` can form the original string `t` when concatenated with the appropriate substring.\n6. **Output Result**: If a valid candidate is found, print \"YES\" followed by the candidate message. If no valid candidate is found after all iterations, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible valid lengths for the original message and ensures correctness by verifying both the overlap and reconstruction conditions.",
