The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$. Print the number of such pairs modulo $$$mod$$$. Note that $$$mod$$$ may not be a prime.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$mod$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 500$$$, $$$1\\le mod\\le 10^9$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer, which is the answer modulo $$$mod$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 403458273']\n\n### Output\n['17']\n\n## Note\nThe following are all valid pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ when $$$n=4$$$.  $$$p=[1,3,4,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,3,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,2,3]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,3,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,3,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,4,3]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,3,1,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,3,4,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,1,3]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,4,2]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,2,1,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,2,4,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,1,2]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,2,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,2,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,3,2]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,2,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,2,1,3]$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And then return this count modulo a given mod. The constraints are n up to 500, which is pretty big. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. For all possible pairs of permutations (p, q), we need to check two conditions:\n\n1. p is lexicographically smaller than q.\n2. inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut considering all possible pairs directly is impossible because the number of permutations is n! and for n=500, that's way too big. So we need an efficient approach.\n\nLet me think about the total number of pairs where p < q lex. Since for any two distinct permutations, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. And since there are n! permutations, the total number of unordered pairs is (n! * (n! -1 )) / 2. But the number of ordered pairs where p < q lex is exactly (total number of ordered pairs) / 2 when all permutations are distinct. Wait, no. For each pair (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of ordered pairs where p < q is (n! * (n! -1 )) / 2. Because for each of the n! * (n! -1 ) ordered pairs (since p can be equal to q?), but since p and q are permutations, they are distinct if and only if they are different. So the number of ordered pairs where p != q is n! * (n! - 1). And exactly half of them have p < q and the other half have q < p. So the total number of (p, q) pairs where p < q lex is (n! * (n! -1 )) / 2.\n\nBut our problem isn't just counting all those pairs. We need to find how many of them satisfy inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nLet me think about the relationship between inv(p) and inv(q) for p < q. If we can compute for all possible pairs (p, q) with p < q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q), that's our answer.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach: Let's consider all pairs of permutations (p, q) where p < q. Let's denote the number of such pairs as T. Then, among these T pairs, how many have inv(p) > inv(q)?\n\nLet me think about the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) plus the number of pairs with inv(p) < inv(q) plus the number of pairs with inv(p) = inv(q) equals T. But since inv(p) and inv(q) are integers, maybe there's some symmetry here.\n\nBut for each pair (p, q) where p < q, and inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds. However, if we consider all pairs (p, q) with p < q and (q, p) with q < p, then for each such pair, one has inv(p) > inv(q) and the other inv(q) > inv(p) (if they are different). But since the pairs (p, q) and (q, p) are mutually exclusive and cover all possibilities except when inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nSo, let's consider that for all pairs (p, q) with p != q, exactly one of the following holds: inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or inv(p) = inv(q). Now, the total number of ordered pairs where p != q is n! * (n! - 1). Let's denote S as the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q and inv(p) > inv(q). Then, the number of ordered pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) is also S, because for every such pair (p, q), there's a corresponding (q, p) with inv(q) < inv(p). Unless inv(p) = inv(q), but those cases are excluded here. Therefore, S + S + C = total, where C is the number of pairs with inv(p) = inv(q). So 2S + C = n!*(n! - 1).\n\nNow, the answer we want is the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Let's call this value X. Similarly, the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q) is Y",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to count the number of permutation pairs $(p, q)$ such that:\n\n1. $p$ is lexicographically smaller than $q$.\n2. The number of inversions in $p$ is greater than the number of inversions in $q$.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n- **Total Number of Pairs:** For $n$, the total number of permutations is $n!$. The number of pairs $(p, q)$ where $p \\neq q$ is $n! \\times (n! - 1)$. Since for every pair $(p, q)$, exactly one of $p < q$ or $q < p$ holds, the number of pairs where $p < q$ is:\n  $$\n  T = \\frac{n! \\times (n! - 1)}{2}\n  $$\n\n- **Inversion Count Symmetry:** If we consider all pairs $(p, q)$ where $p \\neq q$, and let $S$ be the number of such pairs where the inversion count of $p$ is greater than that of $q$, then the number of such pairs where the inversion count of $q$ is greater than that of $p$ is also $S$. The remaining pairs have equal inversion counts. So:\n  $$\n  2S + C = n! \\times (n! - 1)\n  $$\n  where $C$ is the number of pairs with equal inversion counts.\n\n- **Answer Derivation:** The number of valid pairs $(p, q)$ where $p < q$ and $\\text{inv}(p) > \\text{inv}(q)$ is:\n  $$\n  X = S - \\frac{C}{2}\n  $$\n  This is because exactly half of the pairs with $p < q$ and $\\text{inv}(p) = \\text{inv}(q)$ contribute to both $X$ and its complement.\n\n### Efficient Computation:\n\nWe can precompute the number of permutations of size $n$ with a given number of inversions using dynamic programming. Let `dp[i][j]` represent the number of permutations of size $i$ with $j$ inversions.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n$$\ndp[i][j] = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\min(j, i-1)} dp[i-1][j-k]\n$$\nThis is based on inserting the new element into a position that adds $k$ inversions.\n\nOnce we have the inversion counts for all permutations, we compute:\n- The total number of permutations $n!$.\n- The number of pairs with equal inversion counts $C$.\n- Then use the formula above to get the final result modulo `mod`.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this logic:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n, mod = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    # Precompute factorials modulo mod\n    fact = [1] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % mod\n    \n    # Maximum number of inversions for a permutation of size n is n*(n-1)//2\n    max_inv = n * (n - 1) // 2\n    \n    # Initialize DP table for inversion counts\n    dp = [[0] * (max_inv + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    dp[1][0] = 1  # One permutation of size 1 with 0 inversions\n    \n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        for j in range(max_inv + 1):\n            for k in range(min(i - 1, j) + 1):\n                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][j - k]) % mod\n    \n    # Total number of permutations of size n\n    total_perm = fact[n]\n    \n    # Compute the number of pairs with equal inversion counts\n    C = 0\n    for inv in range(max_inv + 1):\n        cnt = dp[n][inv]\n        C = (C + cnt * cnt) % mod\n    \n    # Compute S = (total_perm * (total_perm - 1) - C) // 2\n    total_pairs = (fact[n] * (fact[n] - 1)) % mod\n    S = (total_pairs - C) * pow(2, mod - 2, mod) % mod\n    \n    # Final answer is X = S - C // 2\n    # Since C is even, we can compute it as (C * inv(2, mod)) % mod\n    half_C = (C * pow(2, mod - 2, mod)) % mod\n    ans = (S - half_C + mod) % mod\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```",
