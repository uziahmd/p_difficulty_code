Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum radius d for the lanterns so that the entire street is covered. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says that each lantern can light up points within a distance d. So the goal is to find the smallest d such that every point on the street from 0 to l is within d of at least one lantern.\n\nHmm. So the key idea here is to check the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, then the middle of that gap would require a larger d to cover.\n\nBut wait, also need to consider the ends. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is a candidate for d. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo the steps I think are:\n\n1. Sort the positions of the lanterns. Because if they are not sorted, the gaps between consecutive ones can't be properly checked.\n2. Check the distance from the start (0) to the first lantern. That's a candidate for d.\n3. Check the distance from the last lantern to the end (l). Another candidate.\n4. Then for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them. The maximum of these divided by 2 would be the required d for that gap. Because if two lanterns are s units apart, the middle point between them is s/2 away from each. So the maximum of these values would be the required d.\n5. The answer is the maximum among all these candidates.\n\nWait, right. Because if two lanterns are next to each other, the worst case is the middle of the gap between them. So the required d for that gap is half the distance between them. But for the ends, it's the distance to the first lantern or the last lantern.\n\nSo let's take the example given. For the second sample input: 2 5, with lanterns at 2 and 5. The first lantern is at 2, so the distance from 0 to 2 is 2. The second lantern is at 5, which is the end of the street. So the distance from 5 to l (which is 5) is zero. Then the gap between the two lanterns is 5-2=3. Half of that is 1.5. But the maximum between 2 and 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: the first sample input. The lanterns are at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, they are 0, 3,5,7,9,14,15. Then the first gap is 3-0=3, so half is 1.5. Then between 3 and 5 is 2, half is 1. Between 5 and 7 is 2, same. Between 7 and 9 is 2. Between 9 and 14 is 5, half is 2.5. Between 14 and 15 is 1, half is 0.5. Then the first part is 0 to 0, which is zero. The last part is 15 to 15, zero. So the maximum is 2.5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo that seems to work. So the plan is:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial distance from 0 to first lantern. Then compute the distance from last lantern to l. Then for each consecutive pair, compute the difference and divide by two. Take the maximum of all these values.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Sort them. Then:\n\nmax_d = 0\n\nif there are no lanterns? Well, according to input constraints, n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nCheck the first lantern's position. The initial distance is a[0] - 0. So that's a candidate. Similarly, the last lantern's position is a[-1], so l - a[-1] is another candidate.\n\nThen for i from 1 to n-1:\n\ncurrent gap is a[i] - a[i-1]. The required d for this gap is (gap)/2. So compare with max_d.\n\nSo after all these steps, the maximum of all these is the answer.\n\nWait, but what if there is only one lantern? For example, n=1, l=5. The lantern is at position 0. Then the initial distance is 0, the last distance is 5-0=5. So the maximum is 5. Which is correct because the lantern needs to cover from 0 to 5, so radius 5.\n\nYes. So that case is handled.\n\nAnother example: n=1, l=10, lantern at 5. Then the initial distance is 5, the last distance is 5. So max is 5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of ai. Sort them.\n\nCompute initial_max = a[0] - 0. Then last_max = l - a[-1]. Then for each pair, compute (a[i] - a[i-1])/2. Then the maximum of all these is the answer.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead input. Then:\n\nsorted_ai = sorted(ai)\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif n == 0: ... but n >=1.\n\nmax_d = max( sorted_ai[0], l - sorted_ai[-1] )\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = sorted_ai[i] - sorted_ai[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nreturn max_d.\n\nWait, but why is the initial max_d set to sorted_ai[0]?\n\nBecause the first part is the distance from 0 to the first lantern. For example, if the first lantern is at position 3, then the distance from 0 to 3 is 3, which is the required d for that part. Similarly for the end.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the approach.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is given as two lines. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first example input is:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWait, maybe the input is given as multiple test cases? Or perhaps the first line is the first test case, and the second line is the second test case? Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line, but in the sample input, it's given as two separate lines. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says that the input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo for the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nThe second test case is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nBut in the sample input, it's written as two separate lines. So perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases? But the problem says that the code should read input from stdin. But the way the sample input is presented is perhaps for multiple test cases. However, the problem's original description may have different input format.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the code should read two lines. But the sample input shows two test cases. Wait, perhaps the user is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description doesn't mention that. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem's input is described as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ... The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo it's a single test case. But in the sample input, there are two examples. So perhaps the sample input is showing two separate test cases, but the actual code should process a single test case.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. But the problem's input description doesn't say that. Wait, perhaps the original problem is from Codeforces, and the sample input shows two test cases. But the original problem's input may be for a single test case. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that shows two separate test cases, but the code should process a single test case. But in that case, the sample input would have two test cases, but the code would need to process them. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement again. The problem says:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ... The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the input is two lines. So the sample input must be two separate test cases. So for example, the first test case is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nThe second test case is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nBut the code is supposed to read from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem's input description is unclear. However, looking at the original problem's sample input, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But in the problem statement, it's not mentioned. However, in the problem's sample input, the input has two test cases, and the output has two outputs.\n\nBut how do I know how many test cases there are? Because in the problem's input description, it's not stated. However, looking at the original problem's source, perhaps this is from Codeforces problem 584A. Let me check.\n\nWell, the problem title is \"Vanya and Lanterns\" which is Codeforces problem 584A. Let me check the input format for that problem.\n\nIn the original problem, the input is a single test case. The sample input shows two test cases, but perhaps that's because the sample input is given as two separate examples. For example, in the problem's sample input, it's possible that the first line is the first test case, and the second line is the second test case. But the problem says that the code should process a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, the problem's input says that the first line contains n and l. The next line contains the list of a_i. So for each test case, there are two lines. So the code should read multiple test cases until the end of input. But how to handle that?\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the input is given as two test cases. However, the problem's original input description may not mention that. But in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is a single test case, but sometimes multiple. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So the code should read two lines. But perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's sample input shows two test cases, but the output also shows two outputs. So the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into pairs of lines, and process each pair as a test case.\n\nBut the problem's input may not specify that. However, the original problem's input is given as follows: the first line contains n and l, the second line contains the list of a_i. So the code should read two lines per test case. But how many test cases are there? Well, the problem's sample input shows two, but the problem's description may not mention that. However, in the problem's original statement, perhaps there's only one test case. However, the sample input shows two, but perhaps that's just an example.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the first line is the first test case's input, and the second line is the second test case's input. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input description is ambiguous. However, looking at the problem's sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python? For example, in programming competitions, sometimes the code is expected to read from standard input, which can have multiple test cases. However, in this case, the problem's input may have multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the code should process exactly one test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the problem is that the user has to read multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input may be for a single test case. So perhaps the sample input is given as two test cases, but the code should read one.\n\nThis is confusing. But looking back at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is the first test case's input, the second line is the second test case's input. The output is two lines. So the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how? How many test cases are there? Well, the problem's input is given as per the first line. But in the sample input, there are two test cases. So perhaps the code should read all test cases until the end of input.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python. For example, the code can read all lines from stdin, and process them in pairs. For example, read two lines per test case.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, in Python, the code could read all lines at once, then process them in pairs.\n\nBut in practice, when you have multiple test cases, the code can read until EOF.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's actual input is only one test case. However, the sample input shows two. But the user's code is supposed to handle that. But the problem's original input may not have multiple test cases.\n\nBut the user's code needs to pass the sample input. So for example, the sample input is given as two test cases. So the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how? Let's look at the sample input again. The first line is \"7 15\", then the next line is the list of numbers. Then the third line is \"2 5\", then the fourth line is the list of numbers. So the code should read two lines per test case.\n\nSo the code needs to read all test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut how to read that in Python? Well, perhaps the code can read all lines from stdin, then process them in pairs. For example, read all lines into a list, then iterate over them two at a time.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\ni = 0\n\nwhile i < len(lines):\n\n    n, l = map(int, lines[i].split())\n\n    a = list(map(int, lines[i+1].split()))\n\n    # process this test case\n\n    i += 2\n\nBut this would handle multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input may not have multiple test cases. But the sample input does. However, the problem's original description may not mention that. But given the sample input and output, it's necessary to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's original input description, it says that the first line contains n and l. The next line contains n integers. So the code is supposed to read two lines. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that shows two test cases. But the actual code is supposed to read one test case.\n\nBut in that case, the sample input would have two test cases, but the code is supposed to read one. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's input is as follows: the first line contains the number of test cases. Then for each test case, two lines follow. But the problem's input description does not mention that.\n\nBut the problem's original input description does not mention that. So this is a problem. However, the sample input and output suggest that there are multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input may not have that. But the user's code must pass the sample input.\n\nLooking back at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as two test cases, and the output is two lines. So the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how? For example, in Codeforces, the problem may have multiple test cases. But the problem's original input description may not mention it. However, the problem's input may have only one test case.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's original input is only one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. But perhaps the user is supposed to process only one test case. In that case, the code would read two lines. But in the sample input, the code would read the first two lines, and then the second two lines would be ignored. Which would not match the sample output.\n\nThis is a problem. However, looking back at the problem statement, the user is told that the code should read input from stdin and print output to stdout. The sample input is given as two test cases, but perhaps the actual problem is expecting a single test case. But the sample input may be presented in a way that shows two test cases, but in reality, the code should read a single test case.\n\nBut the problem's sample input and output is given as follows:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nSample Output:\n\n2.5000000000\n\n2.0000000000\n\nWhich implies that there are two test cases. Therefore, the code must read multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code should process multiple test cases. Hence, in Python, the code will read all lines, process them in pairs.\n\nSo now, the code structure would be:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nProcess each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the maximum d as discussed.\n\nPrint the result with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to handle that.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        # Read n and l\n\n        n, l = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        # process\n\n        a_sorted = sorted(a)\n\n        max_d = 0.0\n\n        # first part: distance from 0 to first lantern\n\n        first = a_sorted[0]\n\n        max_d = first\n\n        # last part: distance from last lantern to l\n\n        last = l - a_sorted[-1]\n\n        max_d = max(max_d, last)\n\n        # check between consecutive lanterns\n\n        for i in range(1, n):\n\n            gap = a_sorted[i] - a_sorted[i-1]\n\n            current = gap / 2.0\n\n            if current > max_d:\n\n                max_d = current\n\n        # print with 10 decimal digits\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nBut wait, in the first test case, the first lantern is at 0. So the first part is 0, which is correct. Then the last lantern is at 15, so last part is 15-15=0. Then the gaps between the lanterns are checked.\n\nBut in the first sample input, the maximum is 2.5, which is from the gap between 9 and 14 (distance 5, divided by 2 is 2.5).\n\nYes.\n\nBut in code, the initial max_d is set to first (a_sorted[0]), which is 0. Then the last part is l - a_sorted[-1], which is 15-15=0. Then the max_d is max(0, 0) = 0. Then, during the loop, the gaps are checked. For example, between 0 and 3, the gap is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the max_d becomes 1.5. Then between 3 and 5, 2/2=1.0. Then between 5 and 7, 1.0. Between 7 and 9, 1.0. Between 9 and 14, 5/2=2.5. Then between 14 and 15, 1/2=0.5. So the max_d is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nBut in the code, the first part is a_sorted[0], which is the distance from 0 to the first lantern. But what if the first lantern is at position 0? Then that distance is zero. But the code takes that into account.\n\nBut what about the case where the first lantern is at position 0, but the next lantern is at position 3. So the gap between 0 and 3 is 3. The maximum required d is 1.5. Which would be captured by the code.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code prints the max_d with 10 decimal digits. But in the sample output, for example, the first case is 2.5, which is printed as 2.5000000000.\n\nBut in Python, when using the format string, it will format it with 10 decimal digits. However, if the value is an integer, like 2, it will print 2.0000000000.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then the first part is 5, the last part is 5. The max is 5. Which is correct.\n\nCase 2: n=2, l=5, a=[0,5]. The first part is 0, last part is 0. The gap between them is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So the max is 2.5. But according to the sample input, the second test case is n=2, l=5, a=[2,5]. The first part is 2, the last part is 0. The gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. The max is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=5, a=[0,5]. Then the max is 2.5.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then the first part is 0, last part is 0. The gaps are 5 and 5. Divided by 2 gives 2.5. So the max is 2.5.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 3, 10]. Then first part is 0, last part is 0. The gaps are 3 (between 0 and 3) and 7 (between 3 and 10). The max of (3/2=1.5, 7/2=3.5) is 3.5. So the answer is 3.5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, in the code, when the input is read, the a list is read as integers. Then sorted.\n\nNow, what about if the input has multiple lanterns at the same position? For example, n=3, l=5, a=[0, 0, 5]. Then sorted a is [0,0,5]. The first part is 0. Last part is 0. The gaps between first and second is 0, divided by 2 is 0. Between second and third is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So the max is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python. Also, note that in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines for each test case. The code reads all lines, processes them in pairs.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but the code uses split(), which handles that.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nProcessing first test case: n=7, l=15. a is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. Sorted is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. First is 0, last is 15-15=0. The gaps between consecutive elements are 3, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1. Divided by 2: 1.5, 1, 1, 1, 2.5, 0.5. Max is 2.5. So output is 2.5000000000.\n\nSecond test case: n=2, l=5. a is [2,5]. sorted is [2,5]. first is 2. last is 5-5=0. The gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. The max between 2 and 0 and 1.5 is 2. So output is 2.0000000000. Which matches the sample.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nNeed to make sure that when reading the input, the code handles all test cases. Also, the code should not have any extra output.\n\nSo the code would be as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        # Read n and l\n        n_l_line = lines[idx]\n        idx += 1\n        a_line = lines[idx]\n        idx += 1\n        n, l = map(int, n_l_line.split())\n        a = list(map(int, a_line.split()))\n        a_sorted = sorted(a)\n        max_d = 0.0\n        # Check first part\n        first = a_sorted[0]\n        max_d = first\n        # Check last part\n        last = l - a_sorted[-1]\n        max_d = max(max_d, last)\n        # Check gaps between lanterns\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a_sorted[i] - a_sorted[i-1]\n            current = gap / 2.0\n            if current > max_d:\n                max_d = current\n        # Print with 10 decimal digits\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, what if the input has multiple test cases, but the lines are not even? Like, if there's an odd number of lines. But according to the problem's input description, each test case has two lines. So the code assumes that the input is correct.\n\nBut in practice, the code would process pairs of lines. For example, if there's an odd number of lines, the last line would be ignored. But the problem's input should be correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, check the case where the street length is zero? But according to the problem statement, l is at least 1. Because in the input constraints, l is 1 ≤ l ≤ 1e9.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, l=1, a=[0]. Then first is 0, last is 1-0=1. So max_d is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=1, a=[1]. Then first is 1, last is 0. So max_d is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then first is 0, last is 0. The gap between them is 10, divided by 2 is 5. So answer is 5.0.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns such that the entire street is illuminated. The key idea is to consider the maximum distance between consecutive lanterns and the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify checking the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Endpoints**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l).\n3. **Check Gaps Between Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them and determine the radius needed to cover the midpoint of this gap. This radius is half the gap length.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The required radius is the maximum value among the distances calculated for the endpoints and the midpoints of the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        # Read n and l\n        n_l_line = lines[idx]\n        idx += 1\n        a_line = lines[idx]\n        idx += 1\n        n, l = map(int, n_l_line.split())\n        a = list(map(int, a_line.split()))\n        a_sorted = sorted(a)\n        max_d = 0.0\n        # Check first part\n        first = a_sorted[0]\n        max_d = first\n        # Check last part\n        last = l - a_sorted[-1]\n        max_d = max(max_d, last)\n        # Check gaps between lanterns\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a_sorted[i] - a_sorted[i-1]\n            current = gap / 2.0\n            if current > max_d:\n                max_d = current\n        # Print with 10 decimal digits\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions allows us to sequentially check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Endpoint Distances**: The distances from the start and end of the street to the nearest lanterns are critical because these areas might not be covered by any other lanterns.\n- **Gap Calculation**: The maximum gap between consecutive lanterns determines the minimum radius required to ensure coverage of the entire street. The radius needed for each gap is half the gap length since the worst-case point to cover in a gap is its midpoint.\n- **Precision Handling**: The result is printed with 10 decimal places to meet the problem's precision requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum radius required, ensuring all parts of the street are illuminated with the smallest possible radius.",
