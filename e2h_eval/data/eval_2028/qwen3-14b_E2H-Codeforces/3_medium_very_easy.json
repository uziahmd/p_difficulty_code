Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum radius d for lanterns so that the entire street is lit. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says that each lantern can light up points within a distance d from it. So, the goal is to find the smallest d such that every point on the street (from 0 to l) is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nLet me think about the steps required here. \n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is that the lanterns' positions might not be sorted. So, maybe I should start by sorting them. Because if they are sorted, I can check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and see what's the maximum gap that needs to be covered. But wait, how does that work?\n\nFor example, if two lanterns are at positions a and b (a < b), then the area between them that isn't covered by either lantern would be the middle part. The maximum distance from the nearest lantern in that area would be (b - a)/2. Because if you have two lanterns, the worst case is the midpoint between them. So the required d for that segment is half the distance between the two lanterns. But then, there's also the ends of the street to consider. Like, the first lantern might not be at 0, so the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is important. Similarly for the last lantern and the end of the street (l).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance between the first lantern and 0. The required d must be at least that distance.\n3. Check the distance between the last lantern and l. Again, required d must be at least that.\n4. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them, divide by 2. The maximum of these values is a candidate for d.\n5. The answer is the maximum between all these candidates.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for the entire street to be covered, the largest gap between consecutive lanterns (divided by 2) must be covered. Also, the ends of the street need to be covered. So the minimal d is the maximum of those three values: first part, last part, and the max gap between consecutive lanterns divided by two.\n\nLet me test this logic with the examples given.\n\nTake the second example input: 2 5, lanterns at 2 and 5. After sorting, they are [2,5]. \n\nFirst, the distance from 0 to first lantern (2) is 2. The distance from last lantern (5) to l (5) is 0. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the maximum of 2, 0, 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output. Correct.\n\nAnother example: the first input is 7 15 with lanterns at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. When sorted, they are [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. Let's check the gaps:\n\nBetween 0 and 3: 3. Divided by 2 is 1.5.\n\nBetween 3 and 5: 2 → 1.\n\nBetween 5 and 7: 2 → 1.\n\nBetween 7 and 9: 2 → 1.\n\nBetween 9 and 14: 5 → 2.5.\n\nBetween 14 and 15: 1 → 0.5.\n\nSo the max of these is 2.5. Then check the first part (distance from 0 to first lantern is 0, since the first lantern is at 0). The last part is 15-15=0. So overall, the maximum is 2.5, which matches the sample output. So this logic works.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: n=1. Suppose l=10, and the lantern is at 5. Then the distance from 0 to 5 is 5, and from 5 to 10 is 5. So d must be 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, lantern at 0. Then the distance from 0 to 0 is zero, but the other end is l. So d must be l. For example, if l=10, then d is 10. Because the lantern is at 0, and the light must cover up to 10. So the radius needs to be 10.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are all at the same position. For example, n=3, l=10, all lanterns at 5. Then the first part is 5, last part is 5. The gaps between consecutive lanterns are zero, so their half is zero. So maximum is 5. So d is 5.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the maximum of:\n\n- the first lantern's position (since 0 to a[0] is a[0] - 0 = a[0], so the required d is a[0] if that's the first part.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first part is the distance from 0 to the first lantern. So if the first lantern is at a[0], then the distance is a[0] - 0 = a[0]. But the required d must be at least that, because otherwise the area from 0 to a[0] -d would not be covered. Wait, but the lantern's light covers up to a[0] +d. So for the beginning of the street (0) to be covered, the lantern's light must reach 0. So the distance between the first lantern and 0 must be <=d. So d must be >= a[0] - 0. Similarly for the end: the last lantern is at a[-1], so the distance from a[-1] to l is l - a[-1]. So d must be >= that.\n\nThen, between consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap is (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2. Because the middle of the gap is (a[i] + a[i+1])/2. The distance from that point to either lantern is (a[i+1] -a[i])/2. So d must be at least that.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first part: current_max = a[0] - 0. If this is larger than current max_d, update.\n\nCheck the last part: current_max = l - a[-1]. Compare to max_d.\n\nThen for each i from 0 to n-2:\n\ngap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\ncurrent = gap / 2.0\n\nif current > max_d, update.\n\nFinally, the answer is max_d.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple lanterns? For example, if the lanterns are sorted, and there's a gap between two consecutive ones. The maximum of those gaps divided by two is the critical part.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial max_d as 0.\n\nCheck first lantern's position: a[0] - 0. So max_d = max(max_d, a[0]).\n\nCheck last lantern's position: l - a[-1]. max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1]).\n\nThen for i in 0 to len(a)-2:\n\ngap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\ncurrent = gap / 2.0\n\nmax_d = max(max_d, current)\n\nThen output max_d.\n\nWait, but what if n is zero? Oh, no, according to the input constraints, n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nBut let's check for n=1. For example, n=1, l=10, a = [5]. Then first part is 5, last part is 5. The max_d is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=2, l=5, a=[2,5]. Then first part is 2, last part is 0. The gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So max is 2. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle this.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is given as two lines. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nSo the first line is n and l. The second line is the list of a_i.\n\nBut in the sample input, the second input is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nSo the code needs to read two lines. But how to read them? For example, in Python, the input could be read via input().split().\n\nBut sometimes, when the input is given through standard input, the code may need to read from stdin. So, in Python, perhaps:\n\nRead the first line, split into n and l.\n\nRead the second line, split into list of integers.\n\nBut sometimes, when there are multiple test cases, but in this problem, the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line has n and l, the next line has n integers. So the code needs to read two lines.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of two inputs. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWhich suggests that there are two test cases. But the problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, no, looking back, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. But perhaps the sample input is showing two different test cases, each with their own input. For example, the first test case is 7 15 and the lanterns list, and the second is 2 5 and lanterns list. But the code is supposed to process a single test case. So perhaps the user is supposed to read from stdin, which may contain multiple test cases? Or is it that the code is supposed to process one test case?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. So the code should read two lines. But in the sample input, there are two test cases. However, the problem's input is probably for one test case. Wait, the problem says:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers. So the code is supposed to read one test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases. However, in the problem statement, the sample input is given as two separate examples. So perhaps the code is supposed to read one test case. Therefore, the code should read two lines from stdin. But in the sample input, the first line is the first test case, and the second line is the second test case. But perhaps the actual input is for a single test case.\n\nSo, for the code, the input is two lines. So the code should read the first line as n and l, the second line as the list of a_i.\n\nBut in Python, when you read from stdin, you can read using input().split(), but sometimes when the input is given with multiple lines, you can read via sys.stdin.\n\nBut for the code, the code needs to read from stdin. So in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nBut then, what if there are multiple test cases? Well, the problem says that the input is for one test case. So the code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases. But perhaps that's just the way the sample is presented. For example, the first sample input is for the first example, and the second is for the second example. But the code is supposed to process one test case per run.\n\nSo the code will process one test case, reading two lines.\n\nOnce the code reads the list, then sort it.\n\nThen compute the max_d as discussed.\n\nBut what about if the list is empty? Well, n is at least 1, so the list has at least one element.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead list a.\n\nSort a.\n\nCompute max_d as 0.\n\nCheck first element: a[0] - 0.0. So max_d is max( max_d, a[0] )\n\nCheck last element: l - a[-1]. max_d is max( max_d, l - a[-1] )\n\nThen for each i from 0 to n-2:\n\ncurrent_gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\ncurrent = current_gap / 2.0\n\nif current > max_d: update.\n\nFinally, print max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you print, how to format it?\n\nFor example, in the sample outputs, the first output is 2.5000000000, which is 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo the code needs to print the value with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo, the code would output something like \"{:.10f}\".format(max_d).\n\nBut what about when the value is an integer? For example, in the second sample, the answer is 2.0. The output is 2.0000000000.\n\nSo the code needs to format it with 10 decimal places.\n\nSo, the code would do:\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nBut in Python, the code must make sure that floating point numbers are handled properly. For example, when the max_d is an integer, like 2, then formatting as 2.0000000000.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut wait, what if the list is sorted, but there are multiple lanterns at the same position? For example, if two lanterns are at the same position. Then the gap between them is zero, so the current is zero. Which is fine.\n\nAnother edge case: when the street is length 0. But according to input constraints, l is at least 1. So no.\n\nAnother edge case: when n is 1, and the lantern is at 0. Then the first part is 0, the last part is l - 0 = l. So max_d is l. Which is correct.\n\nNow, code.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting, a becomes [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nFirst part: 0.0 - 0 is 0. So max_d is 0.\n\nLast part: 15 -15 is 0. So max_d remains 0.\n\nThen check the gaps between consecutive elements:\n\n3-0 =3 → 1.5 → max_d is 1.5.\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5 → now max_d is 2.5.\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5 → no change.\n\nSo the answer is 2.5, which is correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]\n\nFirst part is 2 → max_d is 2.\n\nLast part is 5-5=0 → no change.\n\nGap between 2 and 5 is 3 → 1.5. So max_d is 2. So output is 2.0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then first part is 5, last part is 5. So max_d is 5.0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=5, a=[0,5]. Then first part is 0, last part is 0. The gap is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So answer is 2.5.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, when we read the list, the a list may have elements in any order. So we need to sort them.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute max_d.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\n# first part\nmax_d = max(max_d, a[0])\n# last part\nmax_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but what if the first lantern is at 0? Then a[0] is 0, so the first part is 0. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if the first lantern is at position 0, but the last lantern is at l. Then the first and last parts are 0, and the max is the max gap between consecutive lanterns divided by two.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, for example, if the lanterns are [0, l], then the gap between them is l, divided by two is l/2. Which is correct. Because the middle of the street is at l/2. So the radius needs to be l/2.\n\nBut the first part is 0, last part is 0. So max_d is l/2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: n=3, l=10, a = [0, 5, 10]. Then the gaps are 5 and 5. Each divided by 2 is 2.5. So the max_d is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nBut the first and last parts are 0 and 0. So the answer is 2.5.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut what if the lanterns are [0, 3, 6, 9, 10]. l=10. Then the first part is 0, last part is 0. The gaps are 3, 3, 3, 1. The max gap is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the answer is 1.5. But the street is covered? Let's see. Each lantern's coverage is up to d=1.5. So:\n\nFirst lantern covers 0-1.5. Second covers 3-4.5. Third covers 6-7.5. Fourth covers 9-10.5. But the street ends at 10. So the fourth lantern covers up to 10.5, which covers 10. So the entire street is covered. But what about between 1.5 and 3? The first lantern covers up to 1.5, the second starts at 3. So the point 1.5 to 3 is covered? No. Wait, the second lantern is at 3. The distance from 3 to 1.5 is 1.5. So the lantern at 3 covers up to 3 + 1.5 = 4.5. So the point 1.5 is at distance 1.5 from the lantern at 3. So yes, it's covered. So the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns is 3, which requires d of 1.5. So the code is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, check the sample input again.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=2, l=5, a=[2,5]. After sorting [2,5].\n\nmax_d is initially 2.0 (from a[0] = 2). Then last part is 5-5=0. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So max_d is 2.0. So output is 2.0000000000. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[0]. Then first part is 0, last part is 10-0=10. So max_d is 10. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[10]. Then first part is 10, last part is 0. So max_d is 10. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 10, 10]. Then sorted as [0,10,10]. First part is 0. Last part is 10-10=0. The gaps are 10-0=10 (divided by 2 is 5), and 0. So max_d is 5. Which is correct. Because the first lantern covers from 0 to 5. The second lantern is at 10, which covers from 5 to 10 + d. But since d is 5, the second lantern covers from 5 to 15. So the entire street (up to 10) is covered.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to ensure that the entire street is illuminated. The key insight is to consider the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Endpoints**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are critical as they determine the minimum radius needed to cover the ends of the street.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum gap divided by two will give the minimum radius required to ensure the area between these two lanterns is fully covered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the first part\n    max_d = max(max_d, float(a[0]))\n    # Check the last part\n    max_d = max(max_d, float(l - a[-1]))\n    \n    # Check gaps between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains the number of lanterns (n) and the length of the street (l). The second line contains the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to facilitate the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Initial Checks**: The initial checks for the distances from the start and end of the street to the nearest lanterns are performed.\n4. **Gap Calculation**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the gap is calculated. The maximum gap divided by two is considered because the worst-case point in the middle of the gap would be equidistant from both lanterns.\n5. **Output**: The result is formatted to ensure it has 10 decimal places, ensuring the required precision.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum radius required using sorting and linear traversal, making it both optimal and straightforward.",
