Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where we have a string of digits and perform multiple substitution queries. Then compute the number modulo 1e9+7. The challenge is to handle these substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be large and substitutions can be applied in sequence.\n\nFirst, the straightforward approach would be to process each query by replacing all instances of di with ti in the string. But if the string is big and there are many queries, this could be very slow. For example, if the original string is 1e5 characters long and each query replaces a digit that appears many times, then doing this naively for each query would result in O(n * m) time where m is the length of the string, which might be too slow for the constraints given.\n\nSo, we need a smarter way. Let me think about how to model the substitutions. Since each substitution is applied in order, and each substitution replaces a digit with another string, perhaps we can track for each digit what it's currently replaced with. However, since substitutions can overwrite previous ones, we need to process them in the order they are given.\n\nWait, but if we process substitutions in reverse order? Or maybe model the transformations as a mapping from each digit to its replacement string. However, when a substitution is done, it's possible that a digit is replaced by a string that contains other digits which may themselves be replaced in later queries. So, the order of processing the queries matters.\n\nFor example, suppose the first query is 2→00, then a query 0→5. Then, the original 2 would first be replaced by 00, then each 0 would be replaced by 5. So the final result would be 55. If we process the queries in reverse order, that's not possible. So, we need to process the queries in the order they are given.\n\nBut how can we represent the substitutions efficiently? Let's think of each digit as having a \"replacement\" string. However, when a substitution is applied, any occurrence of that digit in the current string is replaced with the new string. However, if we do this naively for each query, replacing all instances of di in the current string, then for each query, we have to scan the entire string and replace each occurrence. But with n up to 1e5 and the string length up to 1e5, this would be O(n * m) time, which would be 1e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nTherefore, we need a more efficient way. Let's think about the problem in terms of building a tree of substitutions. For each digit, we can track what it expands to. However, when a substitution is applied, it's possible that the replacement string contains digits that have their own substitutions. But since substitutions are processed in order, when we process a query, we can update the mapping for that digit, but we need to make sure that when we expand the digits, we use the latest substitutions.\n\nWait, here's an idea: instead of keeping the actual string, we can model the substitutions in a way that allows us to compute the final value without expanding the entire string. For example, we can represent each digit as a value that, when expanded, contributes a certain number to the final modulus. But how?\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of dynamic programming. Suppose we have a mapping for each digit (from 0-9) to a certain value that represents the contribution of that digit when expanded. However, when a substitution is made, say replacing 'd' with a string t, we need to compute the value of t, considering the current mappings of the digits in t. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. For each digit d, we can precompute what it represents as a number. For example, initially, each digit d maps to itself. When a substitution is made, say d → t, then the value of d becomes the value of t. But the value of t is computed based on the current mappings of each digit in t. However, since the substitution is applied to all occurrences of d in the current string, perhaps we can model this with some kind of memoization.\n\nBut how to compute the value of the entire string after all substitutions?\n\nLet me consider that the final value of the string is the concatenation of all the substitutions applied. So, for example, if the original string is s, and we apply substitutions in order, each substitution replaces certain digits with other strings. The final string is the result of applying all substitutions in order.\n\nBut even if we can't store the entire string, perhaps we can compute the value mod 1e9+7 directly. Because the modulus is 1e9+7, which is a prime, and we can compute the value as we process substitutions.\n\nThe key insight here is that when we replace a digit d with a string t, the contribution of each occurrence of d in the original string can be replaced with the value of t. But since the substitutions are applied in sequence, each substitution affects the current state of the string.\n\nBut how can we represent this? Let's think of each digit as having a value that represents the number it would contribute when expanded. For example, initially, each digit d has a value of d. When we perform a substitution d → t, we need to compute the value of t, considering the current mappings of the digits in t. Then, the new value of d is this computed value.\n\nWait, but how does that help with the original string? Let's take an example. Suppose the original string is s = \"123\", and we have a substitution 2 → \"45\". Then the string becomes \"1453\". Now, if we have another substitution 4 → \"6\", then the string becomes \"1653\".\n\nBut if we model each digit's value as the number it represents, then:\n\nInitially, 1 → 1, 2 → 2, 3 → 3.\n\nAfter substitution 2 → \"45\", the value of 2 is the value of \"45\". But what's the value of \"45\"? Well, it's 4*10^1 + 5. But the values of 4 and 5 are their current values. So, if 4 hasn't been substituted yet, then it's 4, and 5 is 5. So the value of \"45\" is 45. Therefore, the new value of 2 is 45.\n\nThen, when we substitute 4 → \"6\", the value of 4 is 6. So, if we had previously calculated the value of 2 as 45, which was based on 4 being 4, now we need to re-calculate the value of 2. Because the substitution of 4 changes the value of the previous substitution.\n\nAh, this is a problem. Because when we substitute a digit that is part of a previous substitution's replacement string, the value of the previous substitution's replacement string changes. So, our initial approach of tracking for each digit its value isn't sufficient, because when a substitution is made for a different digit, it can affect existing substitutions.\n\nThis suggests that we need to track for each digit, the replacement string, and then when computing the value of the entire string, we need to expand all the substitutions recursively. However, expanding the entire string recursively for each substitution would be expensive.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each substitution replaces a digit with a string, and once a substitution is made, any subsequent substitution on that same digit will overwrite the previous one. However, substitutions on other digits may affect the expansion of the replacement strings.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model the substitutions in a way that allows us to compute the value of the entire string as a combination of the current mappings. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have a mapping for each digit d, which is the string that it gets replaced with. Initially, each digit is mapped to itself. When we process a substitution query, say d → t, we update the mapping for d to be t. However, when we need to compute the value of the entire string, we need to expand all digits according to the current mappings, recursively.\n\nFor example, if the original string is \"123\", and the mapping is 1→\"a\", 2→\"b\", 3→\"c\", then the expanded string is \"abc\". But if \"a\" is \"x\", \"b\" is \"y\", etc., then we need to expand recursively.\n\nBut the problem is that for each substitution, we can't store the entire expanded string, because it can be very long. However, we need to compute the value mod 1e9+7. So, perhaps we can compute for each digit, the value of the replacement string mod MOD, and also the length of the replacement string (since when you append digits, you need to multiply by 10^length).\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's model for each digit d, two values:\n\n- val[d]: the numeric value of the replacement string for d, mod MOD.\n- len[d]: the length of the replacement string for d.\n\nThen, when we need to compute the value of a string, we can process each character in the original string, and for each character c, we compute its contribution based on val[c] and len[c], considering the current position in the overall number.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the original string as a sequence of digits. Each digit in the original string is replaced by some string. The final number is the concatenation of all these replacements. For example, if the original string is \"12\", and 1→\"ab\", 2→\"c\", then the final string is \"abc\".\n\nTo compute the value mod MOD, we can process each character of the original string in order. For each character c in the original string, we need to compute the value of the replacement string for c, and then combine it with the current total.\n\nBut combining them requires knowing how much the current total is multiplied by 10^len(replacement). For example, suppose the current total is T, and we have a new replacement string with value V and length L. Then, the new total is (T * 10^L + V) mod MOD.\n\nSo, if we can compute for each digit d, the value of its replacement (val[d]) and the length (len[d]), then we can process the original string character by character, maintaining a current total. For each character c in the original string, we multiply the current total by 10^len[c], add val[c], and mod MOD.\n\nBut how do we compute val and len for each digit, considering that substitutions can change the mappings over time?\n\nLet me think. Initially, for each digit d, val[d] is d, len[d] is 1. Then, when a substitution is made: for example, d → t. Then, the new val[d] is the value of the string t, which depends on the current val and len of the digits in t. Similarly, len[d] is the length of t.\n\nBut how do we compute the value of t? For example, if t is \"abc\", then the value of t is (val[a] * 10^{len[b] + len[c]} + val[b] * 10^{len[c]} + val[c}) mod MOD. Wait, no. Wait, the value of the string \"abc\" is a*10^{2} + b*10^1 + c. But if each of a, b, c is replaced by their respective replacement strings, then the value of \"abc\" is the value of a's replacement string followed by b's replacement string followed by c's replacement string. So, the value is:\n\nvalue = (value_a * 10^{len_b + len_c} + value_b * 10^{len_c} + value_c) mod MOD.\n\nBut how can we compute this for a string t? For example, for each character in t, we can process them sequentially, keeping track of the current value and the current length. Let me think.\n\nSuppose we have a string t. To compute its value and length, we can process each character in t in order. Let's say we have variables current_val and current_len. Initially, current_val is 0, current_len is 0. For each character c in t:\n\ncurrent_val = (current_val * pow(10, len[c], MOD) + val[c]) % MOD\ncurrent_len += len[c]\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because adding a new character c to the end of the string. The existing value is multiplied by 10^len(c), and then adding val(c). For example, if the existing value is V with length L, and we append a string with value v and length l, then the new value is V * 10^l + v, and the new length is L + l.\n\nSo, for the string t, we can compute its value and length by processing each character in order, using the current val and len of each digit.\n\nTherefore, when we have a substitution query d → t, we can compute the new val and len for d by processing each character in t, using the current val and len of the digits. Once we have these new val and len for d, we can update the mapping for d.\n\nThis approach would allow us to process each substitution query in O(len(t)) time, which is acceptable given the constraints (sum of len(t) across all queries is 1e5). Then, once all substitutions are processed, we can process the original string s, character by character, and compute the final value by using the val and len for each digit.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Initialize for each digit (0-9), val[d] = d, len[d] = 1.\n\n2. For each query in order:\n   a. Parse the query to get the digit d and the replacement string t.\n   b. Compute the new_val and new_len for d by processing each character in t, using the current val and len of the digits.\n   c. Update val[d] and len[d] to new_val and new_len.\n\n3. After processing all queries, process the original string s character by character, maintaining a current total. For each character c in s:\n   a. Multiply the current total by 10^len[c], add val[c], mod MOD.\n\nBut wait, how do we compute 10^len[c] efficiently? Because for each step, when processing the original string, we need to compute 10^len[c] mod MOD, where len[c] is the length of the replacement for c.\n\nBut len[c] can be up to ... well, the sum of the lengths of the replacement strings can be up to 1e5, but during the substitution processing, each len is stored as an integer. However, when processing the original string, for each character, we need to compute pow(10, len[c], MOD). However, if len[c] is large, computing pow(10, len[c], MOD) each time could be expensive. But we can precompute powers of 10 mod MOD as needed.\n\nBut wait, during the processing of the original string, for each character c, the len[c] is known. So, for each character in the original string, we need to compute 10^len[c], but that's a single exponentiation per character. However, if we have to compute it each time, that would be O(1) per character with fast exponentiation. But since len[c] can be up to something like 1e5 (for example, if a substitution replaces a digit with a string of length 1e5), then for each character, calculating pow(10, len[c], MOD) could take O(log len[c)) time.\n\nBut since the original string can be up to 1e5 characters, and each character's pow(10, len[c]) calculation is O(log len[c)), that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute all the powers of 10 mod MOD up to the maximum possible len[c]. However, since len[c] can be up to ... well, each substitution can add more length. For example, if we have a substitution that replaces a digit with a string of length 1e5, then len[c] could be up to 1e5. So, the maximum possible len[c] is up to 1e5. So, precomputing 10^k mod MOD for k up to 1e5 would be feasible.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nAlternatively, during the processing of the original string, for each character c, we can compute pow(10, len[c], MOD) on the fly. Let's see.\n\nBut for each character in the original string, during step 3, when we process it, we need to compute 10^len[c], mod MOD. So, for example, if the current total is T, and we have a new character c, then the new total is (T * pow(10, len[c], MOD) + val[c]) % MOD.\n\nBut how to compute pow(10, len[c], MOD) quickly. Well, Python's built-in pow function can do this efficiently with three arguments. So, for each c, we can compute pow(10, len[c], MOD) as needed.\n\nBut for each character in the original string, this is O(1) time (with the pow function being O(log exponent) time, but log is manageable).\n\nSo, putting this all together, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute for each digit, val and len. Initially, val[d] = d, len[d] = 1.\n\n- For each query, process the replacement string t for digit d. To compute the new_val and new_len for d, process each character in t, and compute the value and length of t based on the current val and len of the digits.\n\n- Once all queries are processed, process the original string s, and compute the final value by iterating through each character, multiplying the current total by 10^len[c], adding val[c], mod MOD.\n\nNow, the key part is how to compute the new_val and new_len for a replacement string t when a query comes in. Let's think of that as a helper function.\n\nFor example, when processing a query \"d -> t\", we need to compute the value and length of the string t. How?\n\nWe can process each character in t in order, and for each character, we take the current val and len of that character, and accumulate into a new_val and new_len.\n\nLet me think of this as follows:\n\ndef compute_value_and_length(s, val, len_dict):\n    current_val = 0\n    current_len = 0\n    for c in s:\n        # For each character in the string s, get its val and len\n        # current_val = current_val * 10^len[c] + val[c]\n        power = pow(10, len_dict[c], MOD)\n        current_val = (current_val * power + val[c]) % MOD\n        current_len += len_dict[c]\n    return current_val, current_len\n\nWait, yes. For example, if the string is \"ab\", then the value is (val[a] * 10^len[b] + val[b]) mod MOD. And the length is len[a] + len[b].\n\nSo, for the replacement string t, when we process it, we can compute its value and length using this method.\n\nThus, during the substitution processing, for each query, we take the replacement string t, compute its value and length using the current val and len of the digits, and set the new val and len for the digit d.\n\nBut what about when the replacement string t is empty? For example, a query like \"3->\". In that case, the value is 0, and the length is 0. So, for that case, the code above would process each character in t (which is none), so current_val is 0, current_len is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo, this seems correct.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the examples.\n\nTake the first example from the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: '123123\\n1\\n2->00'\n\nOriginal string is '123123'. One query: replace 2 with '00'.\n\nLet's process the query:\n\nInitially, for each digit, val is d, len is 1.\n\nProcessing the query for d=2, t='00'.\n\nCompute the value and length of '00':\n\nFor first '0', current_val is 0 * 10^1 (since len[0] is 1) + 0 (val[0] is 0) → 0. current_len is 1.\n\nThen, second '0': current_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 → 0. current_len is 2.\n\nSo, new_val for 2 is 0, new_len is 2.\n\nThen, processing the original string '123123'.\n\nEach character is processed:\n\nStart with total = 0.\n\nFirst character is '1':\n\ntotal = (0 * 10^len[1] + val[1]) mod MOD → len[1] is 1, val[1] is 1 → 0*10 + 1 = 1.\n\nSecond character is '2' → len[2] is 2, val[2] is 0.\n\ntotal = (1 * 10^2 + 0) → 100 + 0 = 100.\n\nThird character is '3' → len is 1, val is 3. total = 100 * 10^1 + 3 → 1000 + 3 = 1003.\n\nFourth character is '1' → same as before. total = 1003 * 10^1 + 1 = 10030 + 1 = 10031.\n\nFifth character is '2' → same as before. total = 10031 * 10^2 + 0 → 1003100 + 0 = 1003100.\n\nSixth character is '3' → total = 1003100 * 10^1 + 3 → 10031000 + 3 = 10031003.\n\nWhich matches the sample output. So the code works here.\n\nAnother sample: the third input in the example is:\n\nInput: '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7'\n\nOriginal string is '222'. Two queries: first 2 → 0, then 0 →7.\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitial val and len for digits:\n\nval[2] = 2, len[2] = 1.\n\nFirst query: replace 2 with '0'.\n\nCompute the value and length of '0' → val[0] is 0, len[0] is 1. So new_val for 2 is 0, new_len is 1.\n\nThen, the second query: replace 0 with '7'. Compute the value and length of '7' → val[7] is 7, len is 1. So new_val for 0 is 7, new_len is 1.\n\nNow, processing the original string '222'.\n\nEach character is 2. For each 2, len[2] is 1, val is 0. So:\n\ntotal starts at 0.\n\nFirst 2: 0 * 10^1 + 0 → 0.\n\nSecond 2: 0 * 10^1 + 0 → 0.\n\nThird 2: 0 * 10^1 + 0 → 0.\n\nWait, but according to the sample output, the answer is 777. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, wait! Because after the first query, 2 is replaced with 0. Then, the second query replaces 0 with 7. So, the replacement for 2 is 0, but 0 is then replaced with 7. But how is this handled in our approach?\n\nAh, here's the problem. When we process the query 2 → 0, we compute the value of '0' as 0 (since at that time, val[0] is 0). But then, when we process the query 0 →7, we need to recompute the value of 0. However, the value of 2 is still based on the previous value of 0. So, when the second query is processed, the value of 0 is updated, but the value of 2 is not automatically updated. Because the substitution for 2 was done earlier, and when we processed the query for 2, we computed the value of '0' at that time. However, after that, the substitution for 0 is changed, which would affect the value of 2's replacement string.\n\nWait, this is a critical issue. Our approach assumes that once we compute the value of a replacement string for a digit, it's fixed. But in reality, if a substitution for another digit is made later, which is part of the replacement string of an earlier substitution, then the earlier substitution's value is not updated.\n\nIn the example above, after the first substitution (2 → 0), the value of 2 is 0 (val[2] = 0, len[2] = 1). Then, when the second substitution (0 →7) is processed, the value of 0 is updated to 7 (val[0] =7, len[0]=1). However, the value of 2 is still 0. But when we process the original string, which is '222', each '2' is replaced by '0', which is now replaced by '7'. But according to our approach, the replacement for 2 is '0', which has a value of 0. However, in reality, the replacement for 2 should be '0', which is then replaced by '7', so the replacement for 2 is '7'.\n\nSo, the problem is that when a substitution is made for a digit d, the replacement string is stored as a string, but our approach stores only the value and length of that string. However, if the replacement string contains digits that are later substituted, those substitutions are not reflected in the stored value and length of d. Because the value and length of d's replacement string was computed at the time of the substitution, not dynamically.\n\nSo, our initial approach is incorrect. It doesn't account for the fact that substitutions can change the value of digits that were part of previous replacement strings.\n\nThis is a major flaw. How can we resolve this?\n\nThe crux of the problem is that when a substitution is made for a digit d, the replacement string is processed once, and the val and len for d are stored. But if later substitutions affect the digits in the replacement string, the val and len for d should be recomputed. However, since the replacement string for d is fixed once the substitution is applied, this is impossible.\n\nWait, but the replacement string for d is fixed once the substitution is applied. For example, if we have a substitution d → t, then the replacement string for d is t. So, when we later substitute other digits, that doesn't change the fact that the replacement string for d is t. However, the value of t depends on the current val and len of the digits in t. So, if we process the substitution for d → t, and then later substitute a digit that is present in t, then the value of t would have changed. But our approach doesn't account for that. It stores the value of t as computed at the time of substitution.\n\nThus, the approach is incorrect. How can we handle this?\n\nHmm. Let's think again. For example, in the third sample input:\n\nOriginal string is '222', and queries are 2→0, then 0→7.\n\nAfter the first substitution, 2 is replaced with '0'. The value of '0' at that time is 0, len is 1. So, the val[2] is 0, len[2] is 1.\n\nThen, when we process the second substitution (0→7), we compute the value of '7' (which is 7, len 1), and set val[0] =7, len[0] =1.\n\nNow, when processing the original string, the '2's are replaced by '0's. But the '0's are now replaced by '7's. However, according to our approach, the val[2] is 0 (the value of the string '0' at the time of substitution). However, in reality, the '0's in the replacement string of 2 would now be replaced by '7's. Therefore, the actual value of the replacement string for 2 is 7, not 0. But our approach doesn't track that.\n\nThis suggests that our approach is incorrect. So, what's the solution here?\n\nThe problem arises because when we replace a digit d with a string t, the value of t is computed based on the current state of the val and len of the digits in t. However, if later substitutions change the val or len of any digits in t, the value of t would change, but our approach does not recompute it.\n\nThis seems like a fundamental problem. How can we model this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to track for each digit, the replacement string (as a string), not just its computed value and length. Then, when we need to compute the value of a digit, we recursively compute it based on the current val and len of the digits in the replacement string.\n\nBut this would require that for each digit, we store the replacement string, and when we need to compute the value of that digit, we process the replacement string recursively, using the current val and len of the digits in it.\n\nThis would allow for dynamic updates. However, this would require recomputing the value and length of the replacement string each time it is needed. But that would be computationally expensive if done naively.\n\nBut how can we manage this?\n\nLet me think. For example, when a query is processed, we store the replacement string for the digit. Then, whenever we need to compute the value of a digit, we compute it by processing its replacement string, using the current val and len of the digits in it. However, this would mean that for each substitution, the value of the digit is computed on the fly, not stored. This would lead to O(1) time for substitution processing, but O(k) time for each query to the value of a digit, where k is the length of the replacement string.\n\nBut during the final processing of the original string, each character in the original string may require multiple recursive computations. For example, if the original string is s, and each character is replaced by a string that itself is replaced by other strings, then the processing of the original string would involve recursively expanding each digit's replacement string.\n\nBut how to compute the value of the entire string efficiently?\n\nThis seems like a recursive problem. However, given the constraints, perhaps memoization can be used. For example, for each digit, cache the current value and length. When a substitution is made for a digit, the cached value and length are invalidated, and recomputed when needed.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For each digit, maintain a replacement string (the string to replace it with). Then, for each digit, we can compute its current value and length on demand. However, since substitutions can happen, we need to recompute the value and length when necessary.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently. Let me think of this as a memoization problem. We can have for each digit, a value and length, but when a substitution is made for any digit, we invalidate the cached value and length for all digits that depend on it. But this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, when we need to compute the value of a digit, we recursively compute it by expanding the replacement string. This would be O(1) for substitutions, but O(L) for each query to the value of a digit, where L is the length of the replacement string.\n\nBut during the processing of the original string, for each character, we need to compute the value of that digit's replacement string. For example, during the processing of the original string, for each character c in s, we need to compute the value and length of c's replacement string. Let's call this function get_val(c) and get_len(c).\n\nSo, get_val(c) would be:\n\nif the replacement string of c is empty, return 0 and 0.\n\nelse:\n\nprocess the replacement string, recursively computing for each character in it the get_val and get_len, and compute the overall value and length.\n\nBut this would be very slow for large replacement strings. However, given that the sum of the lengths of the replacement strings is up to 1e5, and that the processing of the original string is O(m) where m is the length of the original string (up to 1e5), the total time would be O(m * L), which could be up to 1e10, which is not feasible.\n\nThus, this approach is not efficient enough.\n\nAlternative idea: for each digit, store the current replacement string. Then, whenever we need to compute the value of a digit, we process its replacement string once and cache the value and length. However, whenever a substitution is made for a digit that is part of the replacement string of another digit, we need to invalidate the cached value and length of that other digit.\n\nThis sounds like a dependency graph problem, which can be complex to manage.\n\nAlternatively, we can use memoization with a timestamp. For example, each time a substitution is made, we increment a global version number. For each digit, we store the current value and length, along with the version number when they were computed. When we need to get the value of a digit, we check if the version number is up to date. If not, we recompute it based on the current replacement string.\n\nBut how to determine whether the replacement string of a digit has changed due to substitutions. For example, if a substitution is made for a digit d, then any digit whose replacement string contains d would need to have their cached values recomputed. However, this seems complex to track.\n\nPerhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's think back to the example where the problem occurred.\n\nIn the third sample input, the original string is '222', and the substitutions are 2→0, then 0→7. According to the correct answer, the result is 777. However, with our initial approach, the val[2] is 0 (computed when the replacement string was '0'), and when the second substitution happens, val[0] is updated to 7. But the val[2] is not updated, because it was computed earlier.\n\nSo, the problem is that the value of the replacement string for 2 is computed once and never updated. Thus, the approach needs to recompute the value of the replacement string for 2 when the substitution for 0 is made.\n\nBut how can we do that? It seems that whenever a substitution is made for a digit, it may affect the value of other digits that have replacement strings containing that digit.\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem with dependencies. It's challenging to find an efficient way to manage this.\n\nAlternative approach: instead of storing val and len for each digit, store the replacement string for each digit. Then, during the processing of the original string, for each character, we recursively expand the replacement strings, and compute the value and length on the fly. This would be accurate, but may be too slow for large inputs.\n\nBut perhaps with memoization, it can be optimized.\n\nLet me think of this as a recursive function. For each digit d, the value and length of its replacement string can be computed as follows:\n\ndef compute_val(d):\n\n    if d is not replaced (i.e., the replacement string is None or itself), then return d's value and length.\n\n    else:\n\n        process the replacement string of d, recursively compute the value and length of each character in it.\n\n        combine them to get the overall value and length.\n\nBut to avoid recomputing, we can memoize the computed value and length for each digit. However, if a substitution is made for a digit, we need to invalidate the memoized values for all digits that depend on it. This seems complex.\n\nBut during the substitution processing, when we replace a digit d with a new replacement string, we can invalidate the memoized values for all digits that have a replacement string containing d. But this seems impractical.\n\nAlternatively, we can memoize the computed value and length for each digit, and whenever a substitution is made for any digit, we clear the memoization for all digits. Then, when we need to compute the value of a digit, we recompute it from scratch. This would be O(1) for substitutions, but O(k) for each computation of the value of a digit, where k is the length of the replacement string.\n\nHowever, for the worst case, this could be O(m * k), where m is the number of times we compute the value of a digit during the processing of the original string, and k is the length of the replacement string. But if the number of substitutions is large, this could be expensive.\n\nLet's try this approach with the third sample input.\n\nInitially, for each digit d, replacement string is d itself.\n\nFirst query: replace 2 with '0'. So, replacement[2] = '0'.\n\nSecond query: replace 0 with '7'. So, replacement[0] = '7'.\n\nNow, during the processing of the original string '222', for each '2', we need to compute the value of its replacement string, which is '0'. To compute the value of '0', we look at its replacement string, which is '7'. So, the value of '0' is the value of '7', which is 7. So, the value of '0' is 7, and its length is 1. Thus, the value of '2' is 7, length 1. Hence, each '2' in the original string contributes 7, and the total is 777, which matches the sample.\n\nSo, this approach would work correctly.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nWe can use memoization with a cache that stores for each digit its current value and length. Whenever a substitution is made, we",
