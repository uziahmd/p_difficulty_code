You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to replace digits in a number a with digits from a sequence s to make the maximum possible number. The constraints are that each element in s can be used at most once, and I can choose to use any subset of them. The goal is to maximize the number a after replacements.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the approach. The key here is to replace the digits in a with the largest possible digits from s, but in the optimal positions. Since we want the maximum number, we should prioritize replacing the leftmost digits first with the largest possible digits available.\n\nWait, right. For example, if the original number is 1024 and s is 010, then the best is to replace the first 1 with 1 (no change?), but wait the s is 0,1,0. Oh, but the example input given in the problem says that for input '1024' and s '010', the output is '1124'. Oh right, because the first digit is 1, and the s has digits 0,1,0. So the best is to replace the second digit (0) with 1, which gives 1124. So the idea is that we need to go through each digit of a from left to right, and for each position, replace it with the largest possible digit from s that hasn't been used yet. But how?\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Sort the sequence s in descending order. That way, we can pick the largest available digits first.\n2. Then, iterate through each digit of a from left to right. For each digit, if there's a digit in the sorted s that is larger than the current digit, replace it with the largest possible available digit from s. Once a digit is used, it's removed from the available s digits.\n3. However, if the current digit is already larger than all remaining digits in s, we can skip it and move on.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that each element in s can be used once. So the process is: for each position in a, we check if there's a digit in s that's larger than the current digit. If so, we take the largest possible one from s and replace it. Otherwise, we leave it as is.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nLet me think. Let's take the example. Suppose a is '1024', and s is '010' (digits ['0','1','0']). Sorting s in descending order gives ['1','0','0'].\n\nNow, iterate through each digit of a:\n\n- First digit is '1'. The largest available in s is '1'. Since it's equal, do we replace? Well, replacing with same digit doesn't help, but maybe we can save the higher digits for later positions. Wait, no. Because if we replace a digit with same value, it's not helpful. So maybe we should only replace when the digit in s is larger than the current digit. So for the first digit, since the s's largest is 1, same as current, we don't replace. Then proceed to next digit.\n\nSecond digit is '0'. The largest available is '1' (from s). Since 1>0, replace. So now, the s list becomes ['0','0'].\n\nThird digit is '2'. The largest available is '0', which is less than 2. So no replacement.\n\nFourth digit is '4', same as before. No replacement.\n\nSo the result is 1124, which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: if a is '987' and s is '1234567', then the sorted s is ['7','6','5','4','3','2','1']. Now, for each digit in a:\n\nFirst digit is '9'. The largest in s is 7, which is less than 9. So no replacement. Second digit is '8', same as before. 7 is less than 8. Third digit is '7', which is equal to the largest in s (7). So again, no replacement. So the result is 987. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the algorithm seems to be:\n\nSort s in descending order. Then for each digit in a from left to right, check if the current digit can be replaced with the largest available in s. If yes, replace and remove that digit from s. Else, proceed.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nSince the length of a and s can be up to 1e5, we need an efficient way to process this.\n\nThe straightforward approach would be:\n\n- Sort s in descending order. Let's say we have a list sorted_s.\n\n- Then, for each digit in a, check if the first element in sorted_s is larger than",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we aim to maximize the value of a given number `a` by replacing its digits with a sequence of digits `s`, ensuring that each digit in `s` is used at most once. The optimal approach involves leveraging the largest available digits from `s` and applying them to the leftmost positions in `a` where they can provide the greatest increase in value.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach**\n\n1. **Sort the Sequence `s`:**  \n   We first sort the sequence `s` in descending order. This allows us to always consider the largest available digit for replacement.\n\n2. **Iterate Through `a`:**  \n   Traverse through each digit of the number `a` from left to right. For each digit:\n   - If the largest available digit in `s` is greater than the current digit of `a`, replace it with that digit.\n   - Remove the used digit from the sorted list of `s` so that it cannot be reused.\n   - If the largest digit in `s` is not larger than the current digit, skip it.\n\n3. **Construct Result:**  \n   After processing all digits of `a`, the result is constructed by combining the modified digits.\n\nThis greedy strategy ensures that the number is maximized as early as possible (from left to right), which gives the maximum overall value.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementation**\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split('\\n')\n    \n    a = data[0]\n    s = data[1]\n    \n    # Convert the string s into a list of characters\n    s_list = list(s)\n    # Sort the list in descending order\n    s_list.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Convert the number a into a list of characters for easy manipulation\n    a_list = list(a)\n    \n    # Pointer for the sorted s list\n    s_index = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each digit of a\n    for i in range(len(a_list)):\n        if s_index < len(s_list) and s_list[s_index] > a_list[i]:\n            a_list[i] = s_list[s_index]\n            s_index += 1\n    \n    # Join the list back into a string and print\n    print(''.join(a_list))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of Key Steps**\n\n- **Sorting `s` in Descending Order:**  \n  This ensures that the largest available digits are always considered first, which is crucial for maximizing the number.\n\n- **Left-to-Right Digit Replacement:**  \n  By replacing from left to right, we prioritize increasing the more significant digits of the number, which has the most impact on the final value.\n\n- **Efficient Use of Resources:**  \n  We only use each digit from `s` once, and stop using them once they are applied or no longer beneficial.\n\nThis solution is efficient with a time complexity of **O(m log m + n)**, where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `a`. Sorting `s` dominates the time complexity, and the rest is linear traversal.\n\n---\n\n### **Edge Cases Handled**\n- Leading zeros in `s` are handled naturally since we only replace when the digit in `s` is larger than the current digit in `a`.\n- If `s` contains digits smaller than all digits in `a`, no replacements will be made.\n- The original number `a` is guaranteed to have no leading zeros, and the output also avoids leading zeros due to the nature of the replacement logic.",
