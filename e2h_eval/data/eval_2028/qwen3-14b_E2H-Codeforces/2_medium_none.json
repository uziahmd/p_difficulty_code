Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (where n is odd), the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left. All elements on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all other elements must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check that all elements not on either diagonal are the same, and that they are different from 'd_char'.\n\nBut how to check these?\n\nFirst, let's collect all the characters on the diagonals. For each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell in the grid, check if it's on either diagonal.\n\nBut since n is odd, the center cell (i = j = n//2) is part of both diagonals. So when collecting the diagonal characters, we need to make sure that we don't have duplicates. But for checking, the main thing is that all elements on the diagonals are the same. So even if there's overlap (like the center cell), as long as all elements in the diagonals are same, it's okay.\n\nSo first, collect all the characters from both diagonals. Then check that they are all the same.\n\nThen, collect all the other characters (those not on the diagonals) and check that they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nFor the first part:\n\nLoop through each cell (i, j). For each cell, check if it's on either diagonal. If yes, collect its character. Then check that all of them are the same.\n\nFor the second part:\n\nCollect all characters that are not on either diagonal. Check that all are same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nLet me think about possible code structure.\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is n, then n lines of strings.\n\nSo, for example, for the first sample input:\n\nn is 5, then the grid is:\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo, the diagonals would be:\n\nPositions (0,0) = x; (0,4) = x; (1,1) = o; (1,3) = o; (2,2) = x; (3,1) = o; (3,3) = o; (4,0) = x; (4,4) = x. Wait, but the center cell is (2,2) which is x. Wait, but in the sample input, the third row is 'soxoo' — so (2,0) is 's', (2,1) is 'o', (2,2) is 'x', etc. So the diagonals here would have x, o, x, o, x, o, o, x, x? Or maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait for n=5, the main diagonal is positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4). The anti-diagonal is (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0). So the diagonals combined have the cells:\n\n(0,0), (0,4), (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3), (4,0), (4,4). Wait, but (2,2) is part of both diagonals. So when collecting all the diagonal elements, the total number is 2n-1 (since for n=5, 2*5-1=9 elements). But in this case, the center cell is counted once.\n\nSo for the first sample input, the diagonals would be:\n\nLooking at the first sample input:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x → (0,0) is x, (0,4) is x.\n\nRow 1: o x o x o → (1,1) is x, (1,3) is x.\n\nRow 2: s o x o o → (2,2) is x.\n\nRow 3: o x o x o → (3,1) is x, (3,3) is x.\n\nRow 4: x o o o x → (4,0) is x, (4,4) is x.\n\nSo the diagonal elements are x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x? Wait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nFor the main diagonal (i==j):\n\n(0,0) → x\n\n(1,1) → x\n\n(2,2) → x\n\n(3,3) → x\n\n(4,4) → x\n\nAnti-diagonal (i + j = 4):\n\n(0,4) → x\n\n(1,3) → x\n\n(2,2) → x\n\n(3,1) → x\n\n(4,0) → x\n\nSo all the diagonal elements are x. So the first condition is satisfied. Then the other elements must be same and different from x.\n\nBut looking at the first sample input, the third row is 'soxoo'. Let's look at cells not on the diagonals.\n\nFor example, cell (0,1) is o. Cell (0,2) is o. Cell (0,3) is o. Then row 1: (1,0) is o, (1,2) is o. Row 2: (2,0) is s, (2,1) is o, (2,3) is o, (2,4) is o. Row 3: (3,0) is o, (3,2) is o. Row 4: (4,1) is o, (4,2) is o, (4,3) is o.\n\nSo the non-diagonal elements include s, o, etc. So the first sample input has some non-diagonal elements that are 's' and others 'o', which are different. Therefore, the output is 'NO' as per the sample.\n\nSo the code needs to check:\n\n- All diagonal elements are same (d_char).\n\n- All non-diagonal elements are same (other_char).\n\n- d_char != other_char.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nFirst, collect all the diagonal characters. Then check that they are all same.\n\nThen collect all non-diagonal characters, check that they are all same and different from d_char.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonal and non-diagonal characters?\n\nLet me think about code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string. So grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, for each cell (i,j):\n\nCheck if i == j or i + j == n-1. If yes, it's a diagonal cell.\n\nElse, it's a non-diagonal cell.\n\nSo for all cells, we can iterate through each i and j.\n\nNow, for the diagonal cells:\n\nWe can collect all the characters in a set. If the length of the set is 1, then all are same.\n\nBut for the non-diagonal cells, same approach: collect all their characters into a set, check if length is 1.\n\nBut also, check that the two sets are different.\n\nBut wait, what if the non-diagonal cells are empty? Well, for n >=3, and odd, n is at least 3. For n=3, the diagonals have 2*3-1=5 elements. The total cells is 9. So non-diagonal cells are 9-5=4. So for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nCollect all diagonal characters into a set. If len(set) != 1 → return NO.\n\nElse, collect all non-diagonal characters into another set. If len(set) != 1 → return NO.\n\nElse, check that the two sets are different. If they are same → return NO. Else, return YES.\n\nBut how to collect the characters?\n\nLet me code this.\n\nInitialize diagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1 → NO\n\nelse if len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1 → NO\n\nelse if diagonal_chars == non_diagonal_chars → NO\n\nelse → YES\n\nWait, but for the case where the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no, for n >=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut for example, n=3, the diagonals have 5 elements, and the non-diagonal has 4 elements.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 5, with the grid:\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo, the diagonal characters are all x. So diagonal_chars is {'x'}, len 1.\n\nnon_diagonal_chars includes the 's' in (2,0), and others. So for example, (0,1) is o, (0,2) is o, (0,3) is o. Then (1,0) is o, (1,2) is o. (2,0) is s, (2,1) is o, (2,3) is o, (2,4) is o. Then (3,0) is o, (3,2) is o. (4,1) is o, etc. So non_diagonal_chars contains 's' and 'o' → len is 2. So the code returns NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nDiagonals:\n\ncells (0,0) → w, (0,2) → w; (1,1) → w; (2,0) → w; (2,2) → w. So diagonal_chars is {w}.\n\nNon-diagonal cells: (0,1) is s; (1,0) is s; (1,2) is s; (2,1) is s. So non_diagonal_chars is {s}. So diagonal and non-diagonal are different. So output YES.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nGrid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nDiagonals: (0,0) x; (0,2) x; (1,1) x; (2,0) x; (2,2) e. So diagonal_chars is {x, e} → len is 2 → invalid. So output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: what if non-diagonal is same as diagonal?\n\nLike for n=3:\n\nxxx\n\nxxx\n\nxxx\n\nThen, all cells are on diagonals (since for n=3, the diagonals include all cells except the center? No. Wait for n=3, the diagonals are (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). So the non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). So if all cells are x, then non-diagonal chars are x, same as diagonal. So code will check that the non-diagonal set is same as diagonal. So returns NO.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string. So grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, collect the diagonal and non-diagonal characters.\n\nBut in Python, for each i and j, loop through all cells.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1 or len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if diagonal_chars == non_diagonal_chars:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n >=3, there are non-diagonal cells. For example, n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells. So the code is safe.\n\nBut what if all non-diagonal cells are same, but same as diagonal? Then the code returns NO.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=5, grid as described. diagonal_chars is {'x'}, non_diagonal has 's' and 'o', so len is 2 → output NO.\n\nSample input 2: n=3, grid as described. diagonal is {'w'}, non-diagonal {'s'}, different → YES.\n\nSample input 3: n=3, grid has diagonal chars {x, e} → len is 2 → output NO.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nDiagonals are (0,0) a, (0,2) a, (1,1) b, (2,0) a, (2,2) a. So diagonal_chars is {a, b} → len 2 → output NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naba\n\nbaa\n\naba\n\nDiagonals: (0,0) a, (0,2) a, (1,1) a, (2,0) a, (2,2) a → diagonal_chars is {a}.\n\nnon-diagonal cells: (0,1) b, (1,0) b, (1,2) a, (2,1) b. So non_diagonal_chars is {a, b} → len 2 → output NO.\n\nAnother case where non-diagonal is same but same as diagonal: n=3, all cells are a. Then, diagonal is a, non-diagonal is a → output NO.\n\nAnother case where non-diagonal is same and different: n=3, diagonals are a, non-diagonal are b. Then output YES.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the code must read from stdin. The input is given as per the problem statement.\n\nBut the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nThen n lines follow, each with n letters.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is given as a list of strings. However, the actual input is read from stdin.\n\nSo for example, the first sample input in the problem is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the code must read n, then read n lines.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n as int(input()), then read n lines as [input().strip() for ...]\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces? Probably not, as per the problem statement, each of the next n lines contains n small letters.\n\nSo code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen proceed as before.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for the code, the code must process multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input shows that the input is a list of test cases. Wait, no. Wait the problem says:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Each of the next n lines contains n letters.\n\nBut the sample input shows something different. Wait, the sample input is given as:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\xpe']\n\nBut that's probably a way to represent multiple test cases in the sample. However, the actual code must process a single test case. Because the problem says, \"the first line contains integer n...\", which implies that each input is a single test case.\n\nWait, the sample input is given as a list of three test cases. But in reality, the code is supposed to read one test case per run. So perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but in practice, the code is called once per test case.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the code should read one test case, process it, and output the result.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, that's probably just for the purpose of the example. For example, the sample input is given as a list of three test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to read one test case at a time. So the code should read n, then n lines, process, output YES or NO.\n\nSo the code is written for a single test case.\n\nTherefore, the code is as follows:\n\nRead n, read n lines, process, output.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal = set()\nnon_diagonal = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal) != 1 or len(non_diagonal) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if diagonal == non_diagonal:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but in the case where non_diagonal is empty? Well, for n >=3, the non_diagonal is not empty. For example, n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut what if n=1? Well, according to the problem, n is at least 3 and odd. So n is 3, 5, etc. So code is safe.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=5, grid as given. The code will collect diagonal as {'x'}, non_diagonal has 's' and 'o' → len(non_diagonal) is 2 → print NO.\n\nSample 2: n=3, grid:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThe diagonals are (0,0) w, (0,2) w, (1,1) w, (2,0) w, (2,2) w → diagonal is {'w'}, non-diagonal cells are (0,1) s, (1,0) s, (1,2) s, (2,1) s → non_diagonal is {'s'}, so output YES.\n\nSample 3: n=3, grid:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nThe diagonals are (0,0) x, (0,2) x, (1,1) x, (2,0) x, (2,2) e → diagonal is {x, e} → len is 2 → output NO.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nThe diagonals are (0,0) a, (0,2) a, (1,1) b, (2,0) a, (2,2) a → diagonal set is {a, b} → len 2 → output NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naba\n\nbaa\n\naba\n\nDiagonals are (0,0) a, (0,2) a, (1,1) a, (2,0) a, (2,2) a → diagonal is {a}, non-diagonal cells are (0,1) b, (1,0) b, (1,2) a, (2,1) b. So non_diagonal is {a, b} → len is 2 → output NO.\n\nAnother test case where non-diagonal is same but different from diagonal: n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naab\n\naaa\n\nDiagonals are (0,0) a, (0,2) a, (1,1) a, (2,0) a, (2,2) a → diagonal is {a}. Non-diagonal cells: (0,1) a, (1,0) a, (1,2) b, (2,1) a. So non_diagonal is {a, b} → len 2 → output NO.\n\nAnother case where non-diagonal is same and different. For example, grid:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa → non-diagonal is {b} and diagonal is {a} → output YES.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nDiagonals are (0,0) a, (0,2) a, (1,1) b, (2,0) a, (2,2) a → diagonal set is {a, b} → len is 2 → output NO. Oh right, because the diagonals have both a and b. So code returns NO.\n\nBut suppose the diagonals are all same, and non-diagonal is same and different. Like:\n\nn=3:\n\naaa\n\nbaa\n\naaa\n\nThen diagonals are (0,0) a, (0,2) a, (1,1) a, (2,0) a, (2,2) a → diagonal is {a}.\n\nNon-diagonal cells: (0,1) a, (1,0) b, (1,2) a, (2,1) a → non_diagonal is {a, b} → len 2 → output NO.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother case where non-diagonal is all same, but same as diagonal. For example, grid:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa → diagonals are {a}, non-diagonal is {a} → code returns NO.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, code in Python. Need to make sure that the code reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n, read n lines, process as above.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal = set()\nnon_diagonal = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal) != 1 or len(non_diagonal) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if diagonal == non_diagonal:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diagonal is empty? Well, for n >=3, it's not possible. For example, n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells. So the code is safe.\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe code will collect diagonal as {'x'}, non_diagonal has 's' and 'o' → len 2 → output NO.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\ndiagonal is {'w'}, non_diagonal {'s'} → output YES.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\ndiagonal has x and e → len 2 → output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
