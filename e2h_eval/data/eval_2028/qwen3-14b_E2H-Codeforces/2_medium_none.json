Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1), and the anti-diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must have the same character. Also, all other cells must have the same character, different from the diagonal's.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check that all elements not on the diagonals are the same, and that they are different from 'd_char'.\n\nBut how to check these?\n\nFirst, let's collect all the characters on the diagonals. For each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. But since the diagonals intersect at the center cell (for odd n), we need to make sure that we don't count that cell twice. However, in the problem statement, the diagonals are considered as both, so the center cell is part of both. But when checking, the cell is part of both diagonals, so it's included once in each. However, when checking all elements on the diagonals, we need to collect all the elements in both diagonals and ensure they are all the same.\n\nWait, but for example, in a 3x3 grid, the main diagonal has (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). The anti-diagonal has (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So the center cell (1,1) is part of both. So when collecting all the diagonal elements, we need to collect all the cells that are in either of the two diagonals. But for checking, all of them must be the same. So for example, in the 3x3 case, the diagonals have 3 + 3 - 1 = 5 cells (since the center is counted twice). So the total number of cells in the diagonals is 2n - 1 (since for each diagonal, n cells, but overlapping in one cell).\n\nSo first, for all cells in the diagonals, check that they are all the same. Then, for all other cells, check that they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell, check if it's on either diagonal. Collect all the characters from these cells. Check that they are all the same. Let's call this 'd_char'.\n\n2. Then, iterate through all cells not on the diagonals. Collect their characters. Check that they are all the same and different from 'd_char'.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n. Then read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen:\n\n- Collect all the diagonal characters.\n\nFor each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   for j in 0 to n-1:\n\n      if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n          add to diagonal_chars.\n\nThen, check that all elements in diagonal_chars are the same. If not, return NO.\n\nThen, collect all non-diagonal characters. Check that they are all the same and not equal to diagonal_char.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no non-diagonal characters? For example, when n=1. But the input constraints say n is at least 3. So for n=3, there are 2n-1 = 5 diagonal cells. Total cells is 9. Non-diagonal cells are 4. So in that case, the non-diagonal cells must all be same and different from diagonal.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, collect diagonal characters:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n\n    # Now check non-diagonal cells\n\n    non_diagonal_chars = set()\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        for j in range(n):\n\n            if not (i == j or i + j == n -1):\n\n                non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n    if len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        nd_char = non_diagonal_chars.pop()\n\n        if nd_char == d_char:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but that's the approach. But what about cases where there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut let's think about the example given.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\nFor i=0, j=0 and j=4 (since 0+4=4, which is 5-1=4 for n=5). So (0,0) is x, (0,4) is x.\n\ni=1: j=1 (x) and j=3 (x). So for row 1, j=1 is x, j=3 is x.\n\ni=2: j=2 (x) and j=2 (since i + j = 2 + 2 = 4? Wait n=5, so n-1=4. So for i=2, j=2: i+j=4? 2+2=4. Yes. So that's the center cell. So for i=2, j=2 is part of both diagonals. So the diagonal cells include all the positions where i == j or i + j = 4.\n\nNow, looking at the sample input. The diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,0): x, (0,4): x.\n\n(1,1): x, (1,3): x.\n\n(2,2): x.\n\n(3,3): x, (3,1): x?\n\nWait, for i=3, j=1: 3+1=4. So yes, part of anti-diagonal. So for row 3, j=1 is x, and j=3 is x. So for the diagonals, all the cells are x except for (2,2)? Wait, in row 2, the third character (j=2) is x. So the diagonals are all x. But then the non-diagonal cells: for example, row 2, j=0 is s. Which is not on the diagonal. So the non-diagonal cells would include s, o, etc. So in this case, the non-diagonal characters are not all same. So the output is NO. Which matches the first sample.\n\nAnother sample input is '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw'. Let's see:\n\nn=3. The grid is:\n\nw s w\n\ns w s\n\nw s w\n\nThe diagonals are (0,0) w, (0,2) w; (1,1) w; (2,0) w, (2,2) w. So all diagonals are w. Then non-diagonal cells are (0,1) s, (1,0) s, (1,2) s, (2,1) s. So all non-diagonal are s. Which is different from w. So output YES.\n\nThird sample input is 3:\n\nx p x\n\np x p\n\nx p e\n\nSo the diagonals are (0,0) x, (0,2) x; (1,1) x; (2,0) x, (2,2) e. So the diagonal characters are x, x, x, x, e. So the set of diagonal characters is {x, e} which has length 2. So the first check fails, output NO.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python:\n\nBut how to read the input? The input is given as per the first line being n, then n lines of strings.\n\nBut the sample input given in the problem is a list of inputs, but the actual input for the code is from stdin. So for example, the first input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nBut in the code, the code should read from stdin.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n from input. Then read n lines, each line being a string.\n\nBut in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut need to make sure that each line is exactly n characters. But the problem says that each of the next n lines contains n letters, so that's given.\n\nNow, collect the diagonal characters.\n\nBut for each cell (i,j), check if i == j or i + j == n-1.\n\nSo, for all i and j in 0..n-1.\n\nBut in code:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nIf the length of diagonal_chars is not 1, then output NO.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nThen collect non-diagonal characters:\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nIf the length of non_diagonal_chars is not 1, output NO.\n\nElse, check if the non_diagonal_char is different from diagonal_char.\n\nIf all conditions met, output YES else NO.\n\nBut what about when there are no non-diagonal characters? For example, n=1. But n is at least 3. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut for n=3, the number of diagonal cells is 2*3 -1 = 5. Total cells is 9. So non-diagonal is 4. So the code will process them.\n\nNow, code:\n\nSo in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n\n    non_diagonal_chars = set()\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        for j in range(n):\n\n            if not (i == j or i + j == n -1):\n\n                non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n    if len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        nd_char = non_diagonal_chars.pop()\n\n        if nd_char == d_char:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but what if all non-diagonal cells are empty? Like, when n=1. But n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=5.\n\nThe grid is:\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo, the diagonals are:\n\nLooking at each cell:\n\nFor i=0, j=0 (x) and j=4 (x). So added to diagonal_chars.\n\ni=1, j=1 (x) and j=3 (x). Added.\n\ni=2, j=2 (x) and j=2 (since i + j = 2+2=4 (n-1=5-1=4). So yes. So j=2. So cell (2,2) is x. So added.\n\ni=3, j=3 (x) and j=1 (x). So added.\n\ni=4, j=4 (x) and j=0 (x). So added.\n\nSo diagonal_chars is {x} ?\n\nBut in the third row (i=2), the row is 'soxoo'.\n\nSo grid[2][0] is 's', grid[2][1] is 'o', grid[2][2] is 'x', grid[2][3] is 'o', grid[2][4] is 'o'.\n\nSo for i=2, j=2 is x. But for j=2, i=2. So that's part of the diagonal. But for i=2, j=2 is part of the main diagonal. So in the code, the diagonal_chars includes x. But what about other cells?\n\nWait, for i=2, j=0: i + j = 2+0=2, which is not equal to 4 (n-1=5-1=4). So not part of the anti-diagonal. So that cell is not in the diagonal. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the first sample input, the diagonal_chars is {x}? Because all the cells on the diagonals are x?\n\nBut looking at the third row (i=2), the cell (2,2) is x. But what about the cell (2, 2) is part of the main diagonal. So yes. But the other cells on the diagonals are x. So the diagonal_chars is {x}.\n\nBut in the first sample input, the output is NO. Because the non-diagonal cells have different characters. Let's see.\n\nIn the first sample input, the non-diagonal cells include the cell (2,0) which is 's', and others. So the non_diagonal_chars would have 's', 'o', etc. So the code would check that the non-diagonal set has more than one element, thus outputting NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nDiagonals:\n\ni=0, j=0 (w) and j=2 (w).\n\ni=1, j=1 (w).\n\ni=2, j=0 (w) and j=2 (w).\n\nSo all diagonals are w. So diagonal_chars is {w}.\n\nNon-diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,1) s, (1,0) s, (1,2) s, (2,1) s. So non_diagonal_chars is {s}, which is different from w. So output YES.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nThe grid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ni=0, j=0 (x) and j=2 (x).\n\ni=1, j=1 (x) and j=1 (i + j = 1+1=2, which is n-1=2 for n=3. So yes. So cell (1,1) is x.\n\ni=2, j=0 (x) and j=2 (e). So for cell (2,0) is x, and (2,2) is e.\n\nSo the diagonal_chars is {x, e} (since x and e are present). So the first check fails, output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases correctly.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nTest case where n=3, all diagonals are same, non-diagonal are same but same as diagonal. Then output is NO.\n\nFor example:\n\nn=3\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nThen diagonals are all a, non-diagonal are all a. So the code checks that non-diagonal is same, but same as diagonal. So output NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, diagonals are a, non-diagonal are b. So output YES.\n\nAnother case: diagonals have two different letters. For example:\n\nn=3\n\naba\n\nbaa\n\naba\n\nThen diagonals: (0,0) a, (0,2) a; (1,1) a; (2,0) a, (2,2) a. So all a. But if in row 1, j=1 is b? Then the diagonal_chars would be {a, b}.\n\nSo code returns NO.\n\nAnother case: non-diagonal has multiple letters. For example:\n\nn=3\n\naxa\n\nxaa\n\naxa\n\nDiagonals are a. Non-diagonal cells: (0,1) x, (1,0) x, (1,2) a, (2,1) x. So non-diagonal chars are {x, a} → len is 2 → output NO.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the non-diagonal set is empty? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, when you read the input, each line is read as a string. So for example, input().strip() is used. But perhaps, the input may have leading or trailing spaces? According to the problem statement, each of the next n lines contains n small letters. So the input lines are exactly of length n. So using input().strip() may be wrong if the input has leading or trailing whitespace. However, the problem says that each line contains exactly n letters. So perhaps, the correct way is to read the line as input().strip()? Or perhaps, just input().strip() is not needed. For example, if the input is given as 'xooox' (without any whitespace), then input().strip() is same as the original. But perhaps, the code can read each line as input().strip() to avoid any leading/trailing whitespace. However, the problem says that each line contains exactly n letters. So perhaps, the code can read each line as input().strip().\n\nBut perhaps, in some cases, the input lines may have leading or trailing spaces. But according to the problem statement, each line contains exactly n letters. So the code can read each line as input().strip(), but maybe not necessary. For example, if the line is read as input().strip(), then for a line like 'xooox' (with no whitespace), it's correct. But if the line has leading or trailing whitespace, then the code would read it as a string with those stripped. However, the problem says that each line has exactly n letters. So perhaps, the code can read each line as input().strip(), but perhaps the correct way is to read the line as input().strip().\n\nBut for example, in the sample input, the first input is '5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox' — each line after the first is a string of 5 letters. So, in code, reading each line with input().strip() is safe.\n\nSo the code should be as follows.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, then read n lines, each line being input().strip().\n\nNow, code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n    non_diagonal_chars = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n                non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n    if len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        nd_char = non_diagonal_chars.pop()\n        if nd_char == d_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nThis should work.\n\nBut let's check the sample input.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\ngrid is ['wsw', 'sws', 'wsw']\n\nFor i=0, j=0: 'w', j=2: 'w' → added.\n\ni=1, j=1: 'w' → added. Also, i + j = 1 + 1 = 2 (n-1 is 2). So added.\n\ni=2, j=0: 'w', j=2: 'w' → added.\n\nSo diagonal_chars is {'w'}, len 1.\n\nnon-diagonal cells:\n\nfor i=0, j=1: 's'.\n\ni=1, j=0: 's'; j=2: 's'.\n\ni=2, j=1: 's'.\n\nSo non_diagonal_chars is {'s'}, len 1. nd_char is 's' != 'w' → output YES.\n\nSample input 3:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\ngrid is ['xpx', 'pxp', 'xpe']\n\ndiagonal cells:\n\ni=0, j=0: 'x'; j=2: 'x'.\n\ni=1, j=1: 'x'; i + j = 1+1=2 → yes.\n\ni=2, j=0: 'x'; j=2: 'e'.\n\nSo diagonal_chars is {'x', 'e'} → len 2 → output NO.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case where non-diagonal is same as diagonal. For example, n=3:\n\nall cells are 'a'.\n\ndiagonal_chars is {'a'}, non-diagonal is {'a'}, so nd_char == d_char → output NO.\n\nAnother case where non-diagonal is empty? Not possible.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code seems correct. Let's write it.\n",
