He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, but we don't know which is prefix or suffix). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one possible string s that is consistent with this assignment.\n\nThe output should be a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The key is that there must be at least one possible s that matches the assignments.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the main idea is that for the correct string s, the prefixes and suffixes must match. For example, the prefix of length k is the first k characters of s, and the suffix of length k is the last k characters.\n\nBut since we have all the prefixes and suffixes, but not knowing which is which, we need to find an assignment of P and S such that:\n\n- For each input string, if it's marked as a prefix, then it must be a prefix of s.\n- Similarly for suffixes.\n\nBut since s is unknown, how can we find this?\n\nThe key observation here is that the correct s must have certain properties. For example, the longest prefix (of length n-1) must be a prefix of s, and the longest suffix (also of length n-1) must be a suffix of s. Also, the full string s can be determined by combining the longest prefix and suffix in some way. Wait, maybe not. But perhaps the correct s can be determined by looking at the longest prefix and suffix.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For the correct string s, the longest prefix (length n-1) must be the first n-1 characters of s, and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be the last n-1 characters of s. Therefore, the correct s must be such that the longest prefix and the longest suffix overlap in a way that their combination forms s. For example, if the longest prefix is P and the longest suffix is S, then s must be P + last character of S, but also S must start with the first n-2 characters of P. Or maybe not. Let me think.\n\nLet me take the example given. For the first sample input, the correct s is ababa. The longest prefix (length 4) is abab, and the longest suffix (length 4) is baba. Then the full string is ababa. So the longest prefix is abab, and the longest suffix is baba. So the first n-1 characters are abab, and the last n-1 are baba. So the full string is ababa. So the first n-1 characters plus the last character of the suffix (which is a) gives the full string. But the first n-1 characters (abab) and the last n-1 characters (baba) share some overlapping parts. So, combining them, the full string s must be equal to the longest prefix plus the last character of the longest suffix, but also the longest suffix must start with the first (n-2) characters of the longest prefix. Because the first n-1 characters of s is the longest prefix, and the last n-1 is the longest suffix. So the first n-2 characters of the longest prefix must be the same as the first n-2 characters of the longest suffix. Because the first n-1 characters of s is the longest prefix, and the last n-1 is the longest suffix. So the first n-2 characters of the longest prefix are the same as the first n-2 characters of the longest suffix. Because the first n-2 characters of the longest prefix are the first n-2 characters of s. The first n-2 characters of the longest suffix are the last n-2 characters of s. Wait, no. The longest suffix is the last n-1 characters of s. So the first n-2 characters of the longest suffix would be the last n-2 characters of s. But the first n-2 characters of the longest prefix are the first n-2 of s. These two may not be the same unless s has some specific structure.\n\nBut perhaps the correct approach is to find for each possible candidate of the longest prefix and longest suffix, check if they can form a valid s. Then once s is determined, check whether all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nBut how do we find which of the input strings are the longest prefix and longest suffix?\n\nThe input has exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1.

    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the correct string `s` that is consistent with the given input strings and then assigning 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest prefix and suffix (each of length `n-1`) can help reconstruct the original string `s`. By checking all possible combinations of these longest strings, we can determine a candidate for `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct the Original String**: For each valid combination of the longest prefix and suffix, check if they can form a consistent string `s` such that the longest prefix is the first `n-1` characters and the longest suffix is the last `n-1` characters of `s`.\n3. **Validate All Strings**: Once a candidate string `s` is determined, validate all given input strings to check if they are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n4. **Assign Labels**: Based on the validation, assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Group strings by their lengths\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    len_to_strings = defaultdict(list)\n    for s in strings:\n        len_to_strings[len(s)].append(s)\n    \n    # Find the longest prefix and suffix candidates (length n-1)\n    candidates = len_to_strings[n-1]\n    \n    # Try all possible pairs of prefix and suffix\n    for i in range(len(candidates)):\n        for j in range(len(candidates)):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n            suffix_candidate = candidates[j]\n            \n            # Check if they can form a valid s\n            # s must be prefix_candidate + last_char of suffix_candidate\n            # and suffix_candidate must start with prefix_candidate[:-1]\n            possible_s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n            if possible_s[-(n-1):] == suffix_candidate:\n                # Now check if all other strings are prefixes or suffixes of possible_s\n                # We need to assign P/S labels\n                # First, collect all prefixes and suffixes of possible_s\n                prefixes = set()\n                suffixes = set()\n                for l in range(1, n):\n                    prefixes.add(possible_s[:l])\n                    suffixes.add(possible_s[-l:])\n                \n                # Now, check if all input strings are in prefixes or suffixes\n                # Also, for each input string, determine if it's a prefix or suffix\n                # We need to assign P or S for each input string\n                # But since there are two strings per length, we need to check which ones are in prefixes and suffixes\n                # However, the problem allows any valid assignment as long as it's consistent with some s\n                # So once we find a valid s, we can proceed to generate the answer\n                \n                # Now, for each input string, check if it is a prefix or suffix of possible_s\n                # We need to assign P or S for each input string\n                result = []\n                for s in strings:\n                    is_prefix = s in prefixes\n                    is_suffix = s in suffixes\n                    # Since the input strings are exactly the prefixes and suffixes of s, at least one of them must be true\n                    # But how to choose between P and S?\n                    # We can prioritize prefix or suffix based on the count, but since the problem allows any valid assignment, we can just assign based on which one it is\n                    # However, we need to ensure that the number of P and S is equal\n                    # But since the input has exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes, and we have 2n-2 strings, we can assign accordingly\n                    \n                    # Here, we can check whether the string is a prefix or suffix, but if it's both, we can choose arbitrarily\n                    # For example, we can prefer prefix first\n                    # But how to make sure that the assignment is valid?\n                    # For this, we can check if the string is a prefix, assign 'P', else 'S'\n                    # But since the same string can be both a prefix and a suffix, we need to make sure that the count is balanced\n                    # However, since the problem allows any valid assignment, we can proceed with the following approach:\n                    # For each input string, check if it is a prefix of possible_s.
