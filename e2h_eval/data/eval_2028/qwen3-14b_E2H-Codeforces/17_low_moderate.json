He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine for each given string whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. The input gives me all the improper prefixes and suffixes of s, but mixed up. My job is to assign P or S to each input string such that there's at least one possible s that fits.\n\nHmm. The key here is to figure out which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes. But how?\n\nLet me think about the properties. For example, the longest prefix (of length n-1) must be the original string minus its last character. Similarly, the longest suffix (of length n-1) is the original string minus the first character. But since the input has all the prefixes and suffixes, including those of length n-1, maybe I can find the original string by checking possible combinations.\n\nWait, but the original string is not known. However, for any valid original string s, the set of prefixes and suffixes must include all the given strings. So, perhaps the approach is to find a candidate string s that could generate all the given strings as prefixes and suffixes. Once we find such an s, we can then check for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix of s, and assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how do I find s? Because there might be multiple possibilities, but the problem allows any valid assignment as long as there exists at least one s that matches.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Generate possible candidates for s based on the given strings.\n\nBut how? Well, the original string s must have all the given strings as either prefixes or suffixes. So, for example, the original string s must be such that all the given strings of length n-1 are either the prefix (s[0..n-2]) or the suffix (s[1..n-1]) of s.\n\nWait, but there are two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. For example, for length n-1, there are exactly two strings. One of them must be the prefix of s (since there's exactly one prefix of length n-1), and the other must be the suffix. Wait, no. Wait, for a string of length n, there's exactly one prefix of length k (for each k from 1 to n). Similarly for suffix. But in the input, for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings. So, for each length k, one of the two strings is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. Except for the case when the prefix and suffix of length k are the same. But the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there exists at least one s that satisfies the conditions.\n\nSo, for the case of length n-1, the two strings in the input must be the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1. But since the original string s has length n, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0...n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1...n-1]. Therefore, combining these two, the original string s must be the concatenation of the prefix of length n-1 and the last character of the suffix of length n-1. Or wait, if the prefix of length n-1 is P and the suffix of length n-1 is S, then the original string s would be P + (last character of S), because S is s[1..n-1], so the first character of S is s[1], and the last character is s[n-1]. But P is s[0..n-2], so the original string is P + (S[-1]).\n\nAlternatively, if the two strings of length n-1 are P and S, then s could be P + S[-1], but also, S must be the suffix of s. Let's check: if s is P + S[-1], then the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:] which is P[1:] + S[-1]. But S is supposed to be the suffix of length n-1. So, S must equal P[1:] + S[-1]. That seems like a condition that must be satisfied.\n\nWait, but how do I know which of the two strings of length n-1 is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nSo for each possible pair of the two strings of length n-1, we can try to build a candidate s. Then, check if that candidate s's prefixes and suffixes include all the given strings.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me take the example from the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nba\n\na\n\nabab\n\na\n\naba\n\nbaba\n\nab\n\naba\n\nThe input strings are:\n\nFor n=5, there are",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying a valid string `s` that can generate all the given strings as either prefixes or suffixes, and then assigning 'P' or 'S' to each input string accordingly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Candidate Strings**: The original string `s` must be such that it can generate all given strings as either prefixes or suffixes. For each possible combination of the two strings of length `n-1`, we can construct candidate strings for `s`.\n2. **Validation of Candidates**: For each candidate string, check if all given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of this candidate.\n3. **Determine Assignments**: Once a valid candidate string is found, determine for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of the candidate and assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find all strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try all possible pairs of the two strings of length n-1\n    # One is prefix, the other is suffix\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for pair in permutations(candidates, 2):\n        prefix_candidate = pair[0]\n        suffix_candidate = pair[1]\n        # Construct possible s\n        # s should be prefix_candidate + last character of suffix_candidate\n        # Also, the suffix of s of length n-1 should be suffix_candidate\n        # Check if the constructed s has suffix_candidate as its suffix\n        possible_s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n        if possible_s[len(possible_s)-len_n_minus_1:] == suffix_candidate:\n            # Now check if all strings are prefixes or suffixes of possible_s\n            valid = True\n            for s in strings:\n                is_prefix = possible_s.startswith(s)\n                is_suffix = possible_s.endswith(s)\n                if not is_prefix and not is_suffix:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if valid:\n                # Now assign P and S\n                result = []\n                for s_str in strings:\n                    if possible_s.startswith(s_str):\n                        result.append('P')\n                    else:\n                        result.append('S')\n                print(''.join(result))\n                return\n\n    # If no candidate found (shouldn't happen as per problem statement)\n    # But handle just in case\n    print(''.join(['P' if i % 2 == 0 else 'S' for i in range(2 * n - 2)]))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Identifying Candidates**: We identify the two strings of length `n-1` which are potential candidates for being the prefix and suffix of the original string `s`.\n3. **Constructing Possible Strings**: For each permutation of these two strings, we construct a potential string `s` by combining the prefix candidate with the last character of the suffix candidate.\n4. **Validation**: We validate if the constructed string `s` can generate all given strings as either prefixes or suffixes.\n5. **Assignment**: Once a valid string `s` is found, we determine the assignment of 'P' or 'S' for each input string based on whether it is a prefix or suffix of `s`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine a valid configuration for the given problem constraints.",
