Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new) equals zero. The original cards have numbers within -x to x. So, the approach here is to calculate the total sum of the found cards first. Then, determine what additional sum is needed to reach zero. The challenge is to find the minimal number of cards required to achieve that additional sum, considering the constraints of the card values.\n\nLet me think. Let's take the first example: input is 3 2 with numbers -1, 1, 2. The sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So we need to add -2 to make the total sum zero. Since the maximum absolute value is 2, we can add one card of -2. Hence, answer is 1.\n\nIn the second example, input is 2 3 with numbers -2 and -2. Sum is -4. To reach zero, we need +4. The maximum allowed per card is 3. So, what's the minimal number of cards? Let's see: 3 + 1 = 4. But 1 is allowed? Wait, the maximum absolute value is 3. So each card can be between -3 and 3. So adding two cards: 3 and 1. But wait, but maybe there's a better way. Wait, 3 + 1 is 4. But that's two cards. Alternatively, can we do 2+2? But 2 is allowed. Oh, but wait the sum needed is +4. So two cards of 2 each would sum to 4. But each card can be up to 3. So yes, two cards. So answer is 2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: find the minimal number of cards (each with value between -x and x) that sum up to the required value (which is -sum of the found cards). Let's call this required value 's'. So the problem becomes: find the minimal number of cards to sum to s, with each card's absolute value <= x.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think about the required sum. Let's say the required sum is 's'. We need to find the minimal number of cards to reach 's', where each card can contribute between -x and x.\n\nWait, but since the cards can be any integers in that range, the minimal number of cards would be determined by how much 's' is, and the maximum possible per card.\n\nFor example, if s is positive, then each card can contribute up to x. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(s / x). But wait, if s is exactly divisible by x, then it's s/x. Otherwise, it's (s//x) + 1. Wait, but for example, if s is 4 and x is 3. Then 4/3 is 1.333, so ceil is 2. Which is correct, as 3 + 1 = 4, two cards. Similarly, if s is 5 and x is 3, then 5//3 is 1, remainder 2. So 2 cards (3 + 2).\n\nBut what if s is negative? Well, since the cards can be negative. For example, if s is -4, then we can take two cards of -2 each, but if x is 3, then we can take one card of -3 and another of -1, which is two cards. So the same logic applies. So the minimal number of cards is ceil( |s| / x ), but since the sign can be handled by choosing the appropriate cards.\n\nWait, but the absolute value of s divided by x, rounded up. Because each card can contribute at most x towards the required sum. So for example, if s is 5, and x is 3, then 5/3 is 1.666, so ceil is 2. So two cards. Similarly, if s is 6, then 6/3 is 2, so two cards. So the minimal number of cards is ceil( |s| / x ). But wait, what if s is zero? Then no cards needed. But in that case, the sum is already zero, so the answer is zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the found cards. Let's call it current_sum.\n\n2. The required sum is -current_sum. Let's call it s.\n\n3. If s is zero, then answer is 0.\n\n4. Else, compute the minimal number of cards needed to reach s. Which is ceil( |s| / x ), but wait, because each card can contribute up to x. Let me think again.\n\nWait, for example, if s is 4 and x is 3. The minimal number is 2. Because 3 + 1. But 1 is allowed. So the minimal number is ceil(4/3) = 2. Similarly, for s=5, x=3: ceil(5/3) = 2. So yes, that seems to work.\n\nBut what about when x is larger than |s|? For example, s=2, x=3. Then you can take one card of 2. So the minimal number is 1. Which is ceil(2/3) = 1. Correct.\n\nSo the formula is: if s is zero, 0. Otherwise, the minimal number is ceil( |s| / x ). But how to compute that in Python?\n\nWell, in Python, we can compute it as (abs(s) + x - 1) // x. Because for example, 4 +3-1 =6, divided by 3 gives 2. Which is correct. For 5 +3-1=7 divided by 3 is 2.333 floored to 2. Which is correct. For 2 +3-1=4 divided by 3 is 1.333 floored to 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo that's the formula. So the steps are:\n\nCalculate the sum of the given numbers. Let's call it sum_found.\n\ns = -sum_found.\n\nif s is 0: return 0.\n\nelse, compute (abs(s) + x -1 ) // x.\n\nBut wait, let's test the examples.\n\nFirst example: sum is -1 +1 +2 = 2. s is -2. So abs(s) is 2. x is 2. (2 + 2-1) // 2 = (3)//2 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nSecond example: sum is -2 + (-2) = -4. s is 4. x is 3. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: if sum is 0, then answer is 0.\n\nAnother example: sum is 5, x is 3. (5 +3-1) //3 = 7//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 3, x is 3. (3 +3-1)/3 = 5//3=1. Correct.\n\nWhat if sum is 1, x is 1? Then (1 +1-1)/1 = 1/1=1. Correct.\n\nSo yes, this formula works.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of numbers.\n\nCompute sum_found = sum of the list.\n\ns = -sum_found.\n\nif s == 0: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute (abs(s) + x -1 ) // x.\n\nBut wait, what about when x is 0? Wait, no, the input constraints say x is at least 1. Because in the input description, x is given as 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000. So no division by zero here.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 3 2, numbers -1 1 2. sum is 2. s is -2. abs(s) is 2. (2 + 2-1) // 2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSample 2: input is 2 3, numbers -2 -2. sum is -4. s is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: if sum is 0, output 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x=5. Then (5 +5-1)/5 = 9//5=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 6, x=5. (6 +5-1)/5 = 10/5=2. Which is correct (5+1=6, two cards).\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead list of numbers.\n\nsum_found = sum of list.\n\ns = -sum_found.\n\nif s == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    print( (abs(s) + x -1 ) // x )\n\nBut wait, what if the required sum is negative? For example, sum_found is 3, so s is -3. Then, the code computes (3 +x-1)//x. Which is the same as if s was 3. Because the absolute value is taken. So yes, correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's code it.\n\nRead input from stdin. The input is two lines. First line has n and x. Second line has n numbers.\n\nIn Python, the code could be:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_found = sum(nums)\n\ns = -sum_found\n\nif s == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    print( (abs(s) + x -1 ) // x )\n\nWait, but what if the numbers are like sum_found is 0? For example, input is 1 5, and the number is 0. Then sum_found is 0, so s is 0. Output is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: sum_found is 5, x is 5. Then the required is -5. So the code computes (5 +5-1)//5 = 9//5=1. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2 → sum is 2. s=-2 → abs(s)=2. (2 +2-1)/2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2 → sum is -4. s is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nCase where sum_found is zero: output 0.\n\nCase where sum is exactly divisible by x. Like sum is 3x → requires 3 cards.\n\nBut if sum is 3x, then (3x +x -1) //x = (4x -1) //x → 3. Because 4x-1 divided by x is 4 - 1/x, which floored is 3. So yes.\n\nWait, for example, x=2, sum is 6. So s is -6. abs(s) is 6. (6 + 2-1)/2 = 7/2=3.5 floored to 3. Which is correct: 2+2+2=6. Three cards.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: sum is 1, x=1. Then (1 +1-1)/1 = 1/1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 1, x=2. (1 +2-1)/2 = 2/2=1. Correct, since one card of 1.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo this is the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards equals zero. The cards can have values ranging from -x to x, where x is a given maximum absolute value.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Required Sum**: Calculate the required sum needed to make the total sum zero. This is simply the negative of the sum of the found cards.\n3. **Check for Zero Requirement**: If the required sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Compute Minimum Cards Needed**: If the required sum is non-zero, compute the minimum number of cards needed using the formula `ceil(|required_sum| / x)`. This can be efficiently computed using integer arithmetic as `(abs(required_sum) + x - 1) // x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_found = sum(nums)\ns = -sum_found\nif s == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    print((abs(s) + x - 1) // x)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of a card). The second line contains the list of integers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is calculated to determine how much more is needed to reach zero.\n3. **Required Sum Calculation**: The required sum is the negative of the sum of the found cards. If this value is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: Using integer arithmetic, we determine the minimum number of cards required to reach the required sum. This is done by effectively computing the ceiling of the division of the absolute value of the required sum by `x`, which ensures we use the fewest possible cards.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result in constant time after reading the input, making it optimal for the given constraints.",
