He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that a string is formed in a specific way. Let me break down the steps:\n\nFirst, A has a string with some number of 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's to the end, ensuring there's at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends 'c's. The number of 'c's added must be equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string at that point. Also, it's possible that the count of 'c's equals both.\n\nSo, given a string S, I need to check if it could have been formed in this way.\n\nLet me think about the conditions that the string must satisfy.\n\nFirst, the string must consist of some a's followed by some b's followed by some c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order of characters must be all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. If there are any other orderings, like a c before a b, that's invalid. So the first check is that the string is in the form a*b*c*.\n\nWait, but what if there are other letters? Well, the input is guaranteed to consist only of a, b, c. So that's not a problem. But the structure must be a's, then b's, then c's. So for example, the string 'abac' would be invalid because after the initial a's and b's, there's an a again. So the first thing I need to do is check that the string is in the form of a's followed by b's followed by c's.\n\nSo the first step is to check the order of characters. Let's think: the string should have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So for example, the string can't have a 'b' followed by an 'a', or a 'c' followed by a 'b' or 'a'.\n\nSo how can I check that?\n\nI can iterate through the string and check that the characters are non-decreasing in the order a < b < c. For example, once a 'b' is encountered, there should be no 'a's after that. Similarly, once a 'c' is encountered, there should be no 'a's or 'b's after that.\n\nSo for the string, the characters must be in the order a's, then b's, then c's. So the first check is that the string is in this order.\n\nIf that's not the case, then the answer is immediately NO.\n\nOnce that is confirmed, then we can proceed to check the counts.\n\nNow, let's think about the counts.\n\nLet me denote:\n\ncount_a = number of a's in the string.\n\ncount_b = number of b's.\n\ncount_c = number of c's.\n\nAccording to the problem, the steps are:\n\nOriginal string from A: some a's (at least 1).\n\nThen B adds some b's (so count_b >= 1).\n\nThen C adds some c's. The number of c's added must be equal to count_a (original a's) or count_b (original b's). Wait, but when C adds the c's, the count of a's and b's is the original ones. Because the original a's and b's are already present. For example, the original a's are from A, and B added the b's. So when C appends the c's, the count of a's is the original count (from A), and the count of b's is the original count (from B). So the count_c must be equal to either count_a or count_b.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the number of c's added is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's in the string. At that time, the string is the original a's + b's. So the count of a's is the original count, and the count of b's is the original count. So the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut the string that we have now is the original a's + original b's + added c's. So the count_c in the final string is exactly the number of c's added. Because the original string had no c's. So the count_c in the final string must be equal to the count of a's (original) or count of b's (original).\n\nSo, for the final string, the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut also, the original string (before adding c's) had at least one a and one b. So in the final string, count_a >= 1, count_b >= 1, and count_c >= 1 (since C added some c's, and the problem says that the number of c's is equal to count_a or count_b, which are at least 1).\n\nWait, but what if count_c is zero? No, because C appends some number of c's. The problem says that C appends some number of c's. So the count_c must be at least 1. So the final string must have count_c >= 1.\n\nSo putting this together, the conditions are:\n\n1. The string is composed of a's followed by b's followed by c's.\n\n2. The count of c's is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\n3. Also, count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nBut wait, the original string (before adding c's) had count_a >=1 and count_b >=1. Because B made sure that after appending b's, there was at least one a and one b. So in the final string, count_a and count_b are same as before adding c's. So the count_a and count_b in the final string are >=1. And count_c is >=1.\n\nSo for the final string, the counts must satisfy:\n\ncount_a >= 1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nBut since the string is formed by adding c's, the count_c is equal to the number of c's added. Which is equal to count_a_original (which is same as count_a in final string) or count_b_original (same as count_b in final string).\n\nSo the conditions for the final string are:\n\ncount_c == count_a OR count_c == count_b.\n\nBut also, the string must be in the order a's followed by b's followed by c's.\n\nSo, the steps for the solution are:\n\n- Check that the string is in the form a*b*c*. If not, return NO.\n\n- Then check that count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\n- Then check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, return YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is all a's and c's? For example, suppose the string is 'aacc'. Then according to the steps, B added some b's. But in the string, there are no b's. So that's invalid. So the second condition is that count_b must be >=1. So in that case, the code would check that count_b is >=1. So the code would return NO.\n\nSo let's take the example given in the problem.\n\nFirst example input: 'aaabccc'\n\ncount_a is 3, count_b is 1, count_c is 3. So count_c equals count_a (3). So yes. Also, the string is a's followed by b's followed by c's. So output is YES.\n\nSecond example: 'bbacc' → the order is b, then a, then c. Which is invalid. So the first check fails. So output NO.\n\nThird example: 'aabc' → counts are a:2, b:1, c:1. count_c is 1, which equals count_b (1). So yes. Also, the string is a's followed by b's followed by c's. So output YES.\n\nSo the code needs to check these conditions.\n\nNow, how to implement the first check: that the string is in order a's followed by b's followed by c's.\n\nHow can I check that?\n\nWell, the string must have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So for example, the string can't have a 'b' followed by an 'a', or a 'c' followed by a 'b' or 'a'.\n\nSo, the approach is to check that the characters are non-decreasing in the order a < b < c.\n\nSo, for each character in the string, it must be >= the previous character. Because once you have a 'b', all following characters must be 'b' or 'c'. Once you have a 'c', all following must be 'c'.\n\nSo, for example, the string 'aabbc' is okay. 'abba' is not.\n\nSo, to check this, we can iterate through the string and check that each character is not less than the previous one.\n\nSo, for i from 1 to len(s)-1:\n\nif s[i] < s[i-1], then return False.\n\nBut how does that work for the order a, b, c?\n\nYes, because 'a' < 'b' < 'c'. So, if the string is in order, then each character is >= the previous.\n\nSo that's a valid check.\n\nSo, first step: check that the string is non-decreasing in terms of the characters.\n\nOnce that is done, check that the counts are correct.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead the input string S.\n\nCheck that the characters are non-decreasing.\n\nIf not, return NO.\n\nElse, compute counts of a, b, c.\n\nCheck that count_a >= 1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nIf not, return NO.\n\nElse, check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf yes, return YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the case where the string is all a's, then all b's, then all c's, but the count_c is not equal to count_a or count_b. For example, 'aabbc' → count_c is 1, count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So count_c is not equal to either. So answer is NO.\n\nAnother example: 'abc' → counts are 1,1,1. count_c is 1, which equals count_a and count_b. So yes.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: 'aaabccc' → counts are a=3, b=1, c=3. c equals a. So yes.\n\nSample input 2: 'bbacc' → the string is 'b', 'b', 'a', ... which is invalid because 'a' comes after 'b' (so the first check fails). So output NO.\n\nSample input 3: 'aabc' → counts a=2, b=1, c=1. c equals b. So yes.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'abbbc'? Let's see. The counts are a=1, b=3, c=1. Then count_c is 1, which equals count_a. So yes.\n\nAnother case: 'abcc' → counts a=1, b=1, c=2. count_c is 2, which is not equal to a or b. So answer is NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: 'abc' → yes. Because counts are 1,1,1. c equals a and b.\n\nEdge case 2: 'aabbc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=1. c is 1. Not equal to a or b. So no.\n\nEdge case 3: 'aabbcc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=2. So c equals a and b. So yes.\n\nEdge case 4: 'aaaabbbbcccc' → counts a=4, b=4, c=4. So yes.\n\nEdge case 5: 'a' → but the string is only a. Then count_b is zero, so invalid. So returns no.\n\nAnother edge case: 'ab' → count_c is zero. So returns no.\n\nAnother case: 'abcc' → count_c is 2. count_a is 1, count_b is 1. So 2 is not equal to 1 or 1. So no.\n\nAnother case: 'abbcc' → counts a=1, b=2, c=2. So c equals b. So yes.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nImplementing the checks:\n\nFirst, check the order of characters. How to do that?\n\nIn Python, for the string S, iterate from index 1 to end, and check if each character is >= previous.\n\nFor example:\n\nfor i in range(1, len(S)):\n\n    if S[i] < S[i-1]:\n\n        return False\n\nSo, if this is true for all i, then the order is correct.\n\nOnce that is done, compute counts.\n\ncount_a = S.count('a')\n\ncount_b = S.count('b')\n\ncount_c = S.count('c')\n\nThen check:\n\nif count_a >=1 and count_b >=1 and count_c >=1:\n\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n        return YES\n\n    else:\n\n        return NO\n\nelse:\n\n    return NO\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'aabbaacc'? Wait, no, because the order check would fail. Because after the first two a's, then two b's, then a's again. So the third character is 'b', then next is 'a' which is less than 'b', so the order check would fail.\n\nSo the code would return no.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, let's think about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=2. So yes.\n\nAnother case: 'abbccc' → count_c is 3. count_a is 1, count_b is 2. So 3 is not equal to 1 or 2. So answer is no.\n\nBut what if the string is 'abbcc'? count_c is 2. count_b is 2. So yes.\n\nNow, code.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead the input string S.\n\nCheck the order.\n\nCheck the counts.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead S from input. For example, input().strip()\n\nThen, check the order:\n\ndef is_ordered(s):\n\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\nThen, compute counts.\n\nThen check the conditions.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nif not is_ordered(s):\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n\n    if count_a >=1 and count_b >=1 and count_c >=1:\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' → counts are 2, 2, 2. So yes.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'aabbc' → counts are 2, 2, 1. Then count_c is 1, which is not equal to 2 or 2. So returns no.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' → counts are 2, 2, 2. So count_c equals count_a and count_b. So returns yes.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'abbbc'? count_a is 1, count_b is 3, count_c is 1. So count_c equals count_a. So returns yes.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1: 'aaabccc' → order is correct. counts a=3, b=1, c=3. So yes.\n\nSample input 2: 'bbacc' → order is not correct. Because after 'b's, there is 'a' which is less than 'b'. So returns no.\n\nSample input 3: 'aabc' → order is correct. counts a=2, b=1, c=1. count_c equals count_b. So yes.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → count_c is zero. So returns no.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaacc' → order check fails (after 'b's, there is 'a'). So returns no.\n\nWhat about 'aabbcc' → yes.\n\nWhat about 'abcc' → count_c is 2, count_a is 1, count_b is 1. So 2 not equal to 1 or 1. So returns no.\n\nAnother case: 'abbcc' → count_c is 2, count_b is 2. So returns yes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'c'? Then the order is correct (only one character). But count_a is 0, count_b is 0, count_c is 1. So the check for count_a and count_b >=1 fails. So returns no.\n\nAnother case: 'ac' → order is correct. count_b is 0. So returns no.\n\nAnother case: 'acb' → order check fails (c comes before b). So returns no.\n\nAnother case: 'abbc' → counts a=1, b=2, c=1. So count_c is 1, which equals count_a. So returns yes.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's think about the case where the string is 'aaaabbbbcccc' → counts a=4, b=4, c=4. So yes.\n\nAnother case where count_c is equal to count_a and count_b. For example, 'abc' → counts are 1,1,1. So yes.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the string S.\n\nCheck if the string is ordered.\n\nThen check counts.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is empty? According to the input constraints, the length is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nNow, code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\ndef is_ordered(s):\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nif not is_ordered(s):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    if count_a >=1 and count_b >=1 and count_c >=1:\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' → counts are 2, 2, 2. So yes.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'aabbc' → counts are 2, 2, 1. Then count_c is 1. So no.\n\nBut what if the string is 'aabbc' → the order is correct. So the code proceeds to check counts.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbbccc' → counts a=3, b=3, c=3. So yes.\n\nNow, let's think about the case where the string is 'aabcc' → counts a=2, b=1, c=2. So count_c is 2, which equals count_a. So yes.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nBut let's think about the case where the string is 'abba' → the order check would fail because the third character is 'b' and the fourth is 'a', which is less than 'b'.\n\nSo code returns no.\n\nAnother case: 'abcb' → order check fails.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → code returns yes.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → order is 'b', 'b', 'a' → which is invalid. So returns no.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → order is a, a, b, c → correct. counts are 2,1,1. So yes.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about a string that has all a's, then all c's. For example, 'aacc' → the order is correct. But count_b is zero. So returns no.\n\nAnother case: 'abcc' → count_b is 1, count_c is 2. count_c is not equal to count_a (1) or count_b (1). So returns no.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, this code should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by appending 'b's to a string of 'a's, followed by appending 'c's such that the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order**: The string must be composed of 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's. This ensures that the characters are in non-decreasing order.\n2. **Count Characters**: Calculate the counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string.\n3. **Validation Checks**:\n   - Ensure there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n   - Check if the count of 'c's is equal to the count of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\ndef is_ordered(s):\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nif not is_ordered(s):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    if count_a >= 1 and count_b >= 1 and count_c >= 1:\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The function `is_ordered` checks if the string is in non-decreasing order of characters.
