After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A successful student is one who is the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, the approach here is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where they have the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The first line is n and m. Then there are n lines each with m characters. Each character is a digit from 1-9. So, for example, if the input is '223', that's the marks for a student in three subjects.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each subject (columns), find the maximum mark.\n2. For each student, check if there's at least one subject where their mark in that subject equals the maximum for that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n3. Count how many such students there are.\n\nWait, but how do I process the data? Let's think about the structure.\n\nLet me think of the data as a 2D array. Each row is a student, each column is a subject. For each column, find the maximum value. Then, for each student (row), check if any of their entries in the columns is equal to the maximum of that column. If at least one exists, count them.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the next n lines, each line being a string of m digits. Convert each line into a list of integers, perhaps. Or maybe just process them as strings, but for comparison, we need to compare numbers. So for each student's marks, we can have a list of integers.\n\nBut for checking the maximums per subject, we need to look at each column across all students.\n\nFor example, for the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nThe subjects are columns 0,1,2 (assuming 0-based). Let's see:\n\nColumn 0: 2, 2, 1 → max is 2. So any student with 2 in column 0 is best here. So student 1 and 2 have 2 in column 0. But wait, the first student's first subject is 2, which is the max. So student 1 is best in subject 0. Student 2 also has 2 in subject 0, which is the max. So both are best in that subject. But then for subject 1, the column is 2, 3, 1. Max is 3. Only student 2 has 3 here. So student 2 is best in subject 1. For subject 2, the column is 3, 2, 2. Max is 3. Only student 1 has 3 here. So student 1 is best in subject 2. So student 1 is successful (has subjects 0 and 2), student 2 is successful (subject 0 and 1). Student 3 has 1 in all subjects. So total successful is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- For each column (subject), find the maximum value.\n\nThen, for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the maximum of that column. If yes, then count them.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string. Then convert each line into a list of integers. For example, for the first line, '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n\nOnce we have the data as a 2D list, then for each column j (from 0 to m-1), compute the maximum value among all students in that column.\n\nOnce we have the max values for each column, then for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns equals the max of that column. If at least one, then count them.\n\nSo, how to compute the max for each column?\n\nLet's think: for each column j, iterate through all rows (students) and collect the j-th element, then take the max.\n\nSo for example, in Python:\n\ngrades = [[int(c) for c in input().strip()] for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, for each column j in 0..m-1:\n\nmax_per_subject = [max(grades[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\nWait, but that would be a list of max values for each subject.\n\nOnce that is computed, then for each student (each row in grades), check if any of their elements in the columns is equal to the max_per_subject for that column.\n\nSo for a student's row, say row = [2,2,3], check for each j, if",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their grades in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no other student has a higher grade in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m). Then read the gradebook which consists of n lines, each containing m digits representing the grades of students in different subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Grades per Subject**: For each subject (column), compute the maximum grade achieved by any student.\n3. **Identify Successful Students**: For each student, check if there exists at least one subject where their grade matches the maximum grade for that subject. If so, the student is considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    grades.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\nmax_per_subject = [0] * m\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grades[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = grades[i][j]\n    max_per_subject[j] = max_val\n\nsuccessful = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if grades[i][j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            successful += 1\n            break\n\nprint(successful)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as integers for the number of students and subjects, followed by the gradebook entries which are converted into a list of lists for easier manipulation.\n2. **Finding Maximum Grades per Subject**: For each subject (column), iterate through all students to determine the highest grade achieved in that subject. This is stored in an array `max_per_subject`.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, check if their grade in any subject matches the maximum grade for that subject. If a match is found, the student is counted as successful and we move to the next student.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging the maximum grades per subject and checking each student against these maxima. The complexity is linear with respect to the number of students and subjects, making it efficient for the given constraints.",
