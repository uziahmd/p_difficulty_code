For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the task is to find the number of ways to choose c_s for all binary strings s (of lengths 1 to n) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to compute this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a beautiful multiset is. From the description, for every binary string s (of length from 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. The multiset consists of binary strings of exactly length n.\n\nThe maximum possible size of such a multiset depends on the choices of c_s. Our goal is to count the number of c_s assignments where this maximum size is exactly f.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. For each possible assignment of c_s values, there's a maximum size of a beautiful multiset. We need to count those assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute this maximum size given the c_s values?\n\nThis feels like a problem related to constraints on the prefixes. For example, if you have a binary string of length n, each of its prefixes (from length 1 up to n) imposes a constraint on how many times it can appear as a prefix in the multiset. The maximum size of the multiset would be determined by these constraints.\n\nWait, but the multiset is made of strings of length exactly n. So, each string in the multiset contributes to the count of all its prefixes. For example, the string '01' of length 2 contributes to the count of prefixes '0' (length 1) and '01' (length 2).\n\nSo, the problem is similar to building a trie structure where each node (representing a prefix) has a capacity c_s. The total number of strings in the multiset is limited by the capacities of all the prefixes along their paths. The maximum possible size of the multiset is the maximum number of strings that can be placed without violating any of the constraints.\n\nBut how do we compute this maximum? It seems like a problem of finding the minimum sum over some paths, or maybe something with flows. Alternatively, perhaps it's equivalent to the minimum of the sum of capacities along certain paths. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nEach string in the multiset contributes exactly once to each of its prefixes. So, for the entire multiset, the count of strings that have a particular prefix s is equal to the number of strings in the multiset that start with s. Therefore, for each s, the number of such strings must be ≤ c_s.\n\nNow, the maximum possible size of the multiset is the maximum number of strings m such that for every s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut how to find this m given the c_s values?\n\nThis sounds like a problem of finding the maximum m such that there exists a collection of m binary strings of length n, where for each s, the number of strings in the collection that start with s is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut how to compute this m?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m is the minimum over all nodes (prefixes) of (the sum of capacities along the path from root to that node). Wait, that's an idea from the problem of counting the maximum number of strings possible under constraints on prefixes.\n\nWait, for example, in the case where each prefix s has capacity c_s. Then, the maximum number of strings is the minimum over all s of (c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)}), but that might not be correct. Or maybe it's the minimum of the sum of capacities along the paths from the root to the leaves.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. Each string of length n can be thought of as a path from the root (empty string) to a leaf (the full string). For each node (prefix), the number of strings that pass through it is the number of strings in the multiset that have that prefix. This must be ≤ c_s.\n\nBut for the maximum m, we need to find the maximum m such that for all prefixes s, the number of strings passing through s is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis seems similar to a flow problem, but perhaps there's a more straightforward way. For example, the maximum m is the minimum over all nodes (prefixes) of (c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)}). Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because each node's capacity c_s limits how many strings can pass through it. However, the capacity of a longer prefix s may be smaller than that of a shorter one. For instance, if a parent node has a higher capacity than its child, then the child's capacity could be the limiting",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose values for each binary string prefix such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly `f`. This involves understanding how constraints on prefixes affect the maximum size of the multiset and efficiently counting valid configurations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: Each binary string of length from 1 to `n` has a constraint `c_s` which limits how many times it can appear as a prefix in the multiset.\n2. **Prefix Tree Structure**: The problem can be visualized using a trie (prefix tree) where each node represents a binary string prefix. The root is the empty string, and each level corresponds to increasing string lengths.\n3. **Maximum Multiset Size**: For a given configuration of `c_s`, the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the minimum capacity along all paths from the root to the leaves (strings of length `n`). This is because each path (string) must respect all its prefix constraints.\n4. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**: We use dynamic programming to count valid configurations. For each prefix length `l` (from `n` down to 1), we compute the number of valid configurations considering the constraints and the required maximum size `f`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        k = int(input[idx+1])\n        f = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n        \n        # Precompute powers of 2\n        max_len = n\n        power = [1] * (max_len + 1)\n        for i in range(1, max_len + 1):\n            power[i] = (power[i-1] * 2) % MOD\n        \n        # dp[l] will store the number of ways for prefixes of length l\n        # We'll build from l = n down to l = 1\n        dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n        dp[n] = 1  # For length n, the only way is to have c_s >= 1 if needed\n        \n        # For each level l from n-1 down to 1:\n        for l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            # For each node at level l, the number of ways depends on its children\n            # Each node has two children (0 and 1)\n            # The value for dp[l] is the product of possibilities for each node\n            # But since all nodes at level l are symmetric, we can compute per node and raise to the number of nodes\n            # The number of nodes at level l is 2^l\n            # For each node, the number of choices is the number of ways that the constraints on the node and its subtree allow\n            # The constraint for the node is that the minimum between its c_s and the min of its children's constraints\n            # But since we are trying to find the total number of configurations that make the maximum size exactly f,\n            # we need to model this with dynamic programming\n            \n            # However, the actual approach here is inspired by the fact that for the maximum size to be exactly f,\n            # the minimal value of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) over all s must be exactly f.\n            # So, for each node, the value of c_s must be chosen such that when multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)}, the minimum is f.\n            \n            # Let's think recursively.

Instead, the total number of configurations where the minimal is >= f is the product over all nodes of (k - max(ceil(f / 2^t) - 1, 0) + 1), but we need to subtract those configurations where the minimal is > f.\n            \n            # So, the answer is: total_ways(f) - total_ways(f + 1)\n            \n            # Where total_ways(x) is the number of configurations where the minimal (c_s * 2^t) >= x.\n            \n            # Therefore, the problem reduces to computing total_ways(f) - total_ways(f + 1)\n            \n            # But how to compute total_ways(x)?\n            \n            # For each node of length l, t = n - l.\n            # The minimal allowed value for c_s is ceil(x / 2^t)\n            # Since c_s can be from 0 to k.\n            # So, the number of valid choices for this node is max(0, k - max(ceil(x / 2^t) - 1, 0) + 1)\n            # Wait, the valid c_s are those where c_s >= ceil(x / 2^t)\n            # Because c_s * 2^t >= x => c_s >= ceil(x / 2^t)\n            # So, the number of choices is max(0, k - ceil(x / 2^t) + 1)\n            \n            # But if ceil(x / 2^t) > k, then there are 0 choices.\n            \n            # Therefore, for each node, compute the number of valid choices, then multiply across all nodes.\n            \n            # The number of nodes at level l is 2^l.\n            # So, for each level l, the contribution is (valid_choices)^{2^l}\n            \n            # So, total_ways(x) is the product over all levels l=1..n of (valid_choices_l)^{number_of_nodes_at_l}\n            \n            # Therefore, the answer is total_ways(f) - total_ways(f+1)\n            \n            # Now, compute this for the given n, k, f.\n            \n            # First, compute for x = f and x = f + 1.\n            \n            def compute_total(x):\n                res = 1\n                for l in range(1, n+1):\n                    t = n - l\n                    pow2t = power[t]\n                    min_c = (x + pow2t - 1) // pow2t  # ceil(x / pow2t)\n                    if min_c > k:\n                        return 0\n                    cnt = k - min_c + 1\n                    if cnt < 0:\n                        return 0\n                    nodes = power[l]\n                    res = res * pow(cnt, nodes, MOD) % MOD\n                return res\n            \n            total_f = compute_total(f)\n            total_f_plus_1 = compute_total(f + 1)\n            answer = (total_f - total_f_plus_1) % MOD\n            print(answer)\n            \nmain()",
