The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. The key here is that the tree structure is given. Since the districts are connected as a tree, removing some nodes will split the tree into parts. But the president wants all remaining contestants to be connected, so after removing k districts, the remaining n - k districts must form a connected subtree.\n\nThe goal is to maximize the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts. Since 2^i grows exponentially with i, higher-numbered districts contribute way more. So ideally, we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nSo the strategy would be to select the districts to keep, which are as high as possible, but connected. But how?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that the optimal set of districts to keep is a subtree that includes the largest possible numbers. Because each higher number contributes more than all the lower ones combined. For example, 2^5 is 32, which is bigger than 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^4 = 31.\n\nTherefore, the best approach is to keep the largest possible districts, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree. So the problem reduces to choosing a subtree with (n - k) nodes, which includes the highest possible numbers, and then removing the rest.\n\nBut how do we find such a subtree?\n\nAn idea is to start from the highest-numbered node and greedily include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, making sure that they are connected. But since the tree is arbitrary, maybe we need to find a way to select the nodes.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as selecting the nodes to keep. The maximum sum is achieved by keeping the largest possible nodes. However, they have to form a connected subtree.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to choose a connected subtree of size (n - k), which includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to find such a subtree?\n\nAnother approach: since the sum is maximized when we keep the largest possible numbers, we can think of the problem as trying to keep the largest (n -k) nodes, but ensuring they form a connected subtree. If they are connected, then that's the optimal. Otherwise, we need to remove some lower-numbered nodes and include higher ones.\n\nWait, but the largest (n -k) nodes may not form a connected subtree. So we need to find the minimal number of nodes to remove from those to make them connected. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can perform a priority-based selection. Let's think in terms of a priority queue. We can start with the highest-numbered node. Then, we need to add nodes in a way that connects the subtree, but always preferring higher-numbered nodes.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe using a BFS or DFS approach where we prioritize adding higher-numbered nodes first.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a tree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So, perhaps we can perform a greedy approach where we start with the highest-numbered node and then add the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree.\n\nBut how to efficiently do that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as selecting which nodes to remove. The nodes to remove are those with the smallest numbers, but ensuring that the remaining nodes form a connected tree.\n\nBut again, how to ensure connectivity?\n\nAnother idea: the optimal solution must include the node with the highest number (n). Because if you exclude it, you could instead include it and exclude some lower-numbered nodes, which would give a better sum. So the optimal set must include the highest-numbered node. Then, recursively, the next highest nodes that are connected to it.\n\nSo, perhaps we can perform a process where we start with the highest node, then add the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree.\n\nThis sounds like a BFS or DFS approach where we prioritize higher-numbered nodes.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. The optimal set must contain the highest-numbered node (n). Because otherwise, including it would give a higher sum. So we need to include it.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining nodes, we want to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, but connected to the existing subtree.\n\nSo, perhaps we can perform a priority-based traversal. Starting from node n, we collect all adjacent nodes, and select the ones with the highest numbers, and so on.\n\nBut how to manage this process? It seems similar to Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees, but instead of edges, we are selecting nodes in a way that maintains connectivity and maximizes the sum.\n\nWait,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected subtree and maximize the total number of fans. The key insight is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more fans, so we should prioritize keeping them while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given structure is a tree, meaning there's exactly one path between any two nodes.\n2. **Maximize Fans**: Since the number of fans for district `i` is `2^i`, we should aim to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: After selecting high-numbered districts, we must ensure they form a connected subtree. This can be achieved using a greedy approach starting from the highest-numbered node and expanding to include the highest possible adjacent nodes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    tree = defaultdict(list)\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        tree[a].append(b)\n        tree[b].append(a)\n    \n    # We need to keep (n - k) districts\n    # Start with the highest node\n    # Use a priority queue to select the next highest nodes connected to the current subtree\n    # We'll use a max heap, but Python's heapq is min-heap, so we store negative values\n    \n    keep = set()\n    visited = set()\n    heap = []\n    \n    # Start with node n\n    start = n\n    visited.add(start)\n    keep.add(start)\n    \n    # Push all neighbors of start into the heap\n    for neighbor in tree[start]:\n        heapq.heappush(heap, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n    \n    # We need to collect (n - k) nodes\n    while len(keep) < (n - k):\n        if not heap:\n            break  # This should not happen as per problem constraints\n        neg_node, node = heapq.heappop(heap)\n        if node in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add(node)\n        keep.add(node)\n        # Push all neighbors of node into the heap\n        for neighbor in tree[node]:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                heapq.heappush(heap, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n    \n    # The districts to remove are those not in keep\n    remove = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i not in keep:\n            remove.append(i)\n    \n    # Sort the remove list and output\n    remove.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, remove)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a tree structure using an adjacency list.\n2. **Greedy Selection**: Starting from the highest-numbered node `n`, we use a max-heap (simulated with a min-heap by storing negative values) to always expand to the highest-numbered adjacent nodes that haven't been visited yet.\n3. **Maintaining Connectivity**: By using a priority queue, we ensure that we always add the highest possible nodes that maintain connectivity with the existing subtree.\n4. **Result Construction**: After collecting the required number of nodes to keep, the remaining nodes are identified and sorted to produce the required output.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the sum of fans while maintaining the connectivity constraint efficiently.",
