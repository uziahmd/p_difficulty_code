Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the task is to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies certain flow conditions. The main points are:\n\n1. For each vertex except source (1) and sink (n), the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. That's like conservation of flow.\n2. The source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges. All edges connected to it must be directed away from it.\n3. The directed graph should not have cycles. Oh right, so the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\nHmm. Also, the given flows are already determined, and we just need to assign directions. So the problem isn't about finding the maximum flow but assigning directions that fit the flow values.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Since the graph is undirected but we need to assign directions, perhaps we can model this as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where the flow conservation holds.\n\nWait, the key here is that the flow is already given. So for each edge, the flow is fixed. The direction determines whether it's contributing to the outflow or inflow of the nodes.\n\nBut how do we assign directions so that the flow conservation is satisfied?\n\nAnother thought: since the flow is a maximum flow, maybe the underlying structure is such that the flow can be represented as a DAG with the source and sink. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a directed graph where the edges are directed in such a way that the flow conservation holds. But how to compute that?\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each node v (not source or sink), the total inflow equals the outflow. Which implies that the net flow (outflow - inflow) is zero. But since each edge contributes either +ci or -ci to the net flow of a node, depending on the direction.\n\nSo for each node v (excluding source and sink), the sum of all flows going out of it minus the sum of flows coming into it must be zero. Which is equivalent to the sum of flows going out equals the sum coming in.\n\nBut how do we model this? It seems like a system of equations, but solving that directly would be computationally expensive for large n and m.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the solution exists. So there's some way to assign directions.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of building a DAG. Since the directed graph must be acyclic, maybe we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Then, for each edge, we can direct it from the node that comes earlier in the topological order to the one that comes later. But how does that ensure flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the flow is such that each node (except source and sink) has a certain amount of flow passing through it. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the problem is similar to finding an orientation of the edges such that the resulting directed graph is a DAG and the flow conservation holds. How can we approach this?\n\nAnother idea: since the graph is connected and we need a DAG, perhaps we can find a spanning tree and assign directions based on that. But again, not sure.\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. Let's denote for each node v (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges leaving v must equal the sum of flows on edges entering v. Which implies that the total flow leaving v is equal to the total flow entering it. So the net flow is zero.\n\nBut the source (node 1) has no incoming edges. So all edges connected to it must be directed away from it. Similarly, the sink (node n) must have all edges directed towards it, but wait no, the sink can have outgoing edges as long as the flow conservation holds. Wait no, the sink is the destination. So for the sink, the inflow minus outflow is equal to the total maximum flow. But according to the problem statement, the flow is already a maximum flow. However, the problem states that the given flows are the maximum flow's edge flows, but we need to assign directions.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the given ci's are the flow volumes. So for the source, the total outflow is the maximum flow value. For the sink, the total inflow is the same. For other nodes, the inflow equals outflow.\n\nSo the problem is to assign directions to the edges so that these conditions are met, and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nHow can we model this? Maybe think of the flow as a DAG with the source and sink. Since the graph is acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Let's think of the nodes as being ordered such that all edges go from earlier nodes to later ones. Then, for each node, the inflow (from previous nodes) and outflow (to later nodes) must balance.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAnother angle: the problem requires that the directed graph has no cycles. So the directed graph must be a DAG. Therefore, there exists a topological order of the nodes. Let's assume that we can find such an order. Then, for each edge, we can direct it from the node that appears earlier in the topological order to the one that appears later. This ensures that there are no cycles.\n\nNow, the question is: how to choose the topological order such that the flow conservation conditions are satisfied.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each node v (other than source and sink), the total flow leaving v equals the total flow entering v. But if the edges are directed according to the topological order, then for each node v, the edges that are directed into v come from nodes before it in the order, and edges directed out of v go to nodes after it. So for each node v, the sum of flows on edges that are directed into v (from earlier nodes) must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v (to later nodes).\n\nBut how can we arrange the topological order to satisfy this?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we need to assign directions based on some kind of flow-based ordering. Maybe we can model this as a directed graph where each node has a certain \"potential\" and edges are directed from lower potential to higher potential. Then, the flow conservation would require that for each node, the sum of flows on edges going out equals the sum of flows on edges coming in. But how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the flow conservation for a node v (not source or sink) is that the net flow is zero. Which can be thought of as the sum of flows on edges incident to v, with direction considered, is zero. So for each node v, the sum over all edges incident to v of (flow if direction is away from v) minus (flow if direction is towards v) equals zero. Which simplifies to sum (flow * (direction factor)) = 0.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nWait, here's an idea. For each node, the net flow must be zero. For the source, the net flow is the total outflow (since no inflow). For the sink, the net flow is the negative of the total inflow (since no outflow). But how to model the direction of edges to meet this.\n\nAnother approach: think of the problem as a directed graph where the edges are directed such that the flow is a valid flow. Since the flow is already given, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the direction of each edge is determined by the flow's direction. But how?\n\nWait, but the flow is already given. For example, in the sample input, the first case is:\n\n3 nodes, 3 edges:\n\nEdge between 3-2 with flow 10.\n\nEdge between 1-2 with flow 10.\n\nEdge between 3-1 with flow 5.\n\nThe output directions are 1, 0, 1. Which means:\n\nFirst edge (3-2) is directed as 2→3 (since di=1?), wait no. Wait the output is for each edge, 0 means ai→bi, 1 means bi→ai. Wait, the input is ai, bi, ci. So for the first edge, which is 3 2 10, the output is 1, which means direction is bi→ai, i.e., 2→3.\n\nSo the edges are directed as:\n\n1→2 (original edge 1-2, direction 0), 2→3 (original edge 3-2, direction 1), 1→3 (original edge 3-1, direction 1: since di is 1, which would mean direction is bi→ai, which is 1→3? Wait original edge is ai=3, bi=1. So if di is 1, the direction is bi→ai, which is 1→3. Yes.\n\nSo the directed edges are 1→2, 2→3, 1→3. The flow is 10, 10, 5. Let's check the conservation:\n\nFor node 2: incoming is 10 (from 1→2), outgoing is 10 (to 3). So 10-10=0. Correct.\n\nFor node 1: no incoming edges. Outgoing is 10+5=15. Which is the max flow. Node 3: incoming is 10 (from 2) and 5 (from 1), total 15. No outgoing edges. Correct.\n\nSo the directed graph is a DAG. So the directions are such that the edges form a DAG.\n\nSo how can we model this in code?\n\nAnother observation: since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Then, for each edge, we direct it from the node that comes earlier in the order to the one that comes later. But how to choose the order such that the flow conservation is satisfied.\n\nBut how to find such an order?\n\nLet me think of the flow conservation for each node. For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed away from v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed towards v. Which is equivalent to the sum of flows on all edges incident to v, multiplied by the direction (either +ci or -ci) equals zero.\n\nAlternatively, for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed away from v is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed towards v. Which implies that the total flow leaving v is equal to the total flow entering v.\n\nBut how to model this with the topological order.\n\nLet me think of the nodes as being arranged in a topological order. Let's say that the source is first, and the sink is last. Then, for each node v in between, the edges are directed from earlier nodes to later nodes. Then, for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed into v (from earlier nodes) must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v (to later nodes). Because that's the flow conservation.\n\nBut how can we compute this?\n\nThis seems like a problem where for each node, the sum of flows on edges that are directed into it (from earlier nodes) must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of it (to later nodes). How can we find such an order?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as for each node, the difference between the sum of flows on edges that go out and the sum on edges that come in must be zero. Which is the same as the sum of flows on edges going out equals the sum on edges coming in.\n\nBut how can we arrange this?\n\nLet me think of this as a problem of finding a potential for each node. Suppose that for each node, we assign a value (like a potential) such that for any edge between u and v, the direction is from the node with lower potential to the node with higher potential. Then, the directed graph is acyclic (if potentials are unique). Now, how to assign potentials so that the flow conservation holds.\n\nFor the flow conservation, for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed away from v (i.e., edges where v is the lower potential end) must equal the sum of flows on edges directed towards v (edges where v is the higher potential end). So:\n\nsum_{edges (v, w)} ci = sum_{edges (u, v)} ci.\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nsum_{edges (v, w)} ci - sum_{edges (u, v)} ci = 0.\n\nBut how to find such potentials?\n\nLet me consider the following approach: for each node v, define a value d[v], which is the difference between the total outflow and inflow. For the flow conservation, this must be zero. But since the direction of edges depends on the potentials, how can we model this?\n\nAlternatively, for each node v, the net outflow (outflow - inflow) must be zero. But in the directed graph, the net outflow is the sum of flows on edges directed away from v minus the sum of flows on edges directed towards v. Which equals zero.\n\nBut for the entire graph, the net outflow from the source is the total flow (since no inflow), and the net inflow to the sink is the same.\n\nBut how to model this with potentials?\n\nLet me think of the problem as a directed graph where each edge's direction is determined by the potentials. Let’s say that for each edge between u and v, if potential[u] < potential[v], then the edge is directed from u to v. Otherwise, from v to u. Now, the flow conservation for node v is that the sum of flows on edges directed out of v equals the sum of flows on edges directed into v.\n\nLet me denote for each node v, the total flow of edges incident to v as sum_edges. Then, the sum of flows directed out of v is (sum_edges + (sum of flows for edges where v is lower potential than the other end) - sum of flows for edges where v is higher potential than the other end )) / 2 ?\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed out of v is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed into v. Let’s denote that:\n\nsum_out(v) = sum_in(v)\n\nWhich implies that sum_out(v) - sum_in(v) = 0.\n\nBut sum_out(v) - sum_in(v) is equal to the net outflow from v, which for non-source/sink nodes must be zero.\n\nBut how to express this in terms of potentials?\n\nLet me think of the net outflow for node v as:\n\nsum_{(u, v) in edges} (if direction is u→v then ci else -ci) ?\n\nWait, no. For each edge between u and v, if the direction is u→v, then it contributes +ci to u's outflow and +ci to v's inflow. So for node v, the net outflow is sum of flows on edges directed out of v minus sum of flows on edges directed into v.\n\nSo for node v, net_outflow = sum_{edges directed out of v} ci - sum_{edges directed into v} ci.\n\nThis must be zero for non-source/sink nodes.\n\nBut how to model this with potentials?\n\nLet me think of the net_outflow for node v as:\n\nnet_outflow = sum_{edges incident to v} (direction_factor * ci), where direction_factor is +1 if the edge is directed out of v, -1 if directed into v.\n\nBut how to relate this to the potentials?\n\nIf we have a potential function p[v], then for each edge between u and v, the direction is from u to v if p[u] < p[v], and from v to u otherwise. So, for the edge between u and v, the direction is determined by the potential difference.\n\nThen, for node v, the net_outflow is:\n\nsum_{edges (v, w) where p[v] < p[w]} ci - sum_{edges (u, v) where p[u] < p[v]} ci.\n\nBut how can this be expressed in terms of p?\n\nAlternatively, for each edge between u and v, the contribution to the net_outflow of u is +ci if p[u] < p[v], and -ci if p[v] < p[u]. Similarly for v.\n\nBut how to set up equations for this?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's another way.\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Let's imagine that the source is first, the sink is last, and the rest are in between. Then, for each node in the order, all edges go from earlier nodes to later nodes. Then, the flow conservation for each node (except source and sink) requires that the sum of flows on edges directed into it (from earlier nodes) equals the sum of flows on edges directed out of it (to later nodes).\n\nSo, for each node v in the order (except source and sink), the sum of flows from previous nodes to v must equal the sum of flows from v to later nodes.\n\nThis suggests that for each node v, the sum of flows on edges incident to v (with the other end being in the earlier part of the order) must equal the sum of flows on edges incident to v (with the other end in the later part of the order).\n\nBut how to find such an order?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved greedily. For example, we can start with the source and build the order step by step. At each step, we select a node that can be added to the order such that the above condition holds.\n\nBut how to find such a node?\n\nAlternatively, think of the nodes as needing to have a certain balance. For example, for a node v, the sum of flows on edges that connect to nodes already in the order must equal the sum of flows on edges connecting to nodes not yet in the order. But how?\n\nWait, suppose we have a partial order consisting of some nodes. When adding a new node to the order, we need to ensure that the sum of flows on edges between this node and the existing nodes is balanced. Because when we add this node to the order, all edges between it and existing nodes will be directed from existing nodes to this node (since they are earlier in the order). Thus, the sum of flows from existing nodes to this node is the sum of flows on those edges. And the sum of flows from this node to the remaining nodes (not yet added) must equal that sum. But how can we know that?\n\nThis seems like a chicken and egg problem. However, perhaps there's a way to model this as a graph where each node has a certain \"balance\" that needs to be satisfied.\n\nLet me think of the balance for a node v as the difference between the sum of flows on edges that are directed into it and directed out of it. But since the direction depends on the order, this is tricky.\n\nAnother idea: since the flow is already a valid maximum flow, the net outflow from the source is the total flow value, and the net inflow to the sink is the same. For all other nodes, the net outflow is zero. So, for the entire graph, the sum of flows on edges directed away from the source is the total flow. And similarly for the sink.\n\nBut how can we use this to assign directions?\n\nPerhaps we can model this as a directed graph where each node has a certain \"excess\" flow. For example, the source has an excess of F (the total flow), the sink has an excess of -F, and others have zero. Then, we need to assign directions to edges such that the excesses are maintained.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved using a greedy algorithm. For example, we can perform a BFS or DFS traversal starting from the source, and assign directions to edges as we go. However, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach inspired by the fact that the directed graph must be acyclic. We can construct a DAG by performing a topological sort based on the flow values. Let's think of the nodes in terms of their \"potential\" as follows:\n\nWe can assign potentials to nodes such that the potential of the source is 0, the sink is 1, and other nodes have potentials between 0 and 1. Then, edges are directed from lower potential to higher. But how to determine the potentials?\n\nAlternatively, think of the nodes as being in a hierarchy where each node's potential is determined by the flow through it. For example, for each node, the potential could be the amount of flow leaving it. But not sure.\n\nAnother approach: since the directed graph must be acyclic, there must be a way to order the nodes such that all edges go from earlier to later in the order. Let's imagine building this order incrementally. Start with the source. Then, for each node, we can add it to the order if all its edges that are directed into the current order can be balanced.\n\nWait, here's a possible algorithm:\n\n- Start with the source node in the order.\n- While there are nodes not in the order:\n   - Select a node v that is connected to the current order and has the property that the sum of flows on edges from v to nodes already in the order equals the sum of flows on edges from nodes already in the order to v. Wait, no. Because once we add v to the order, all edges between v and the current order will be directed from the current order to v. So, the sum of flows on edges from the current order to v is the sum of flows on those edges. Then, the sum of flows on edges from v to the remaining nodes (not yet in the order) must equal this sum. But how can we know that?\n\nThis seems like a problem that requires knowing the future. However, since the solution always exists, there must be a way to choose nodes in the order such that this condition is satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, think of the nodes as having a \"balance\" which is the difference between the sum of flows on edges that are directed into them and directed out of them. Initially, the balance for the source is -F (since all edges from the source are outgoing, contributing to outflow). The sink has a balance of +F. Other nodes have zero. But how to adjust this?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nEach node v (except source and sink) has balance zero. The source has a balance of -F (since all its edges are outgoing, contributing to outflow, which is F). The sink has balance +F.\n\nWhen we direct an edge from u to v, it affects the balance of u and v. For example, directing an edge from u to v adds ci to the outflow of u, and adds ci to the inflow of v. The balance for u decreases by ci (because outflow increases), and the balance for v increases by ci (inflow increases). \n\nBut how can we manage this?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a directed graph with balances, and we need to find a way to direct edges so that the balances are correct.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, here's a different idea inspired by the fact that the directed graph must be acyclic. If we can build a DAG where the source is the only node with no incoming edges, and the sink is the only node with no outgoing edges, then the flow conservation conditions are satisfied.\n\nTo build such a DAG, perhaps we can perform a BFS or DFS starting from the source, and direct edges in the direction of traversal. However, this might not ensure the flow conservation.\n\nBut what if we perform a BFS where, for each node, we direct edges away from the source, ensuring that the flow conservation is maintained?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed tree rooted at the source. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother thought: since the flow conservation is required for all nodes except the source and sink, maybe we can model this as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has in-degree and out-degree such that the sum of flows on incoming edges equals the sum of flows on outgoing edges.\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding an Eulerian trail, but for multiple nodes. However, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where the flow is a valid flow. The given flows are the amounts, and we need to assign directions. This is equivalent to finding a directed graph where for each edge, the flow is assigned in one direction, and the flow conservation holds.\n\nBut how to find such a direction assignment?\n\nLet me think of the following approach: For each node, compute the total flow that must pass through it. For example, the source has outflow equal to the total flow F. The sink has inflow F. For other nodes, their inflow equals their outflow.\n\nBut how to determine the direction of each edge?\n\nMaybe we can model this as a directed graph where for each edge, we assign it in a way that maintains the flow conservation.\n\nLet me think about the following steps:\n\n1. Compute the total flow F. How? Well, for the source, the sum of flows on edges connected to it must be F. Because all edges are directed away from the source. So for the source, sum of flows on all edges connected to it is F.\n\nBut how to compute F? Well, the problem says that the given flows are part of a maximum flow. So the sum of flows on edges leaving the source must be the maximum flow value. However, since the edges are undirected, but we need to assign directions, the actual value of F can be determined by the edges connected to the source.\n\nWait, but how? For example, in the first sample input, the source (node 1) is connected to node 2 (flow 10) and node 3 (flow 5). The total F is 15. Which matches the output.\n\nSo, for the source, the sum of all flows on edges connected to it, directed away from the source, is the total flow F.\n\nBut how to determine which edges are directed away from the source. Since the source has no incoming edges, all edges connected to it must be directed away from it. So for each edge connected to the source, its direction is from the source to the other node. Hence, the sum of all such flows is the total flow F.\n\nThus, for the source, we can calculate F as the sum of flows on all edges connected to it. But wait, no. Because the edges connected to the source may be directed away from the source, but if the source is connected to another node, and that node is also connected to other nodes, but how?\n\nActually, the source's edges are directed away from it. So for each edge connected to the source, the direction is source → other node. Hence, the sum of all flows on those edges is the total flow F.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input, the source (node 1) is connected to node 2 (flow 10) and node 3 (flow 5). Hence, F is 10 + 5 = 15. Which matches the sample explanation.\n\nSo the total flow F is the sum of flows on all edges connected to the source, because all those edges are directed away from the source.\n\nBut how to ensure that this is the case. Well, the problem says that the solution exists, so this must be the case.\n\nSo, once we have F, the sink must have an inflow of F. So the sum of flows on edges directed towards the sink must be F.\n\nBut how to assign directions to edges not connected to the source or sink.\n\nNow, back to the problem of assigning directions to all edges.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- Direct all edges connected to the source away from it.\n- For other edges, assign directions in a way that ensures flow conservation and acyclicity.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the edges are directed in a way that forms a DAG, with the source at the beginning and the sink at the end. One possible way to achieve this is to perform a BFS or DFS traversal starting from the source, and direct edges in the direction of traversal. But again, how to ensure flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed tree where the source is the root, and each node's children are those nodes that receive flow from it. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Since the flow is a valid flow, the residual graph would have no augmenting paths. But I'm not sure how that helps here.\n\nAnother idea inspired by the fact that the directed graph must be acyclic: perform a topological sort, and for each edge, direct it from the earlier node to the later node. The question is how to choose the topological order.\n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\n- Assign to each node a value, say, the amount of flow that must leave it. For example, for the source, this is F. For the sink, it's zero. For other nodes, it's zero. But this doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, for each node v (not source or sink), the total outflow equals the total inflow. So, the net outflow is zero. For the source, net outflow is F. For the sink, net inflow is F, so net outflow is -F.\n\nSo, if we can assign directions to edges such that for each node, the net outflow is as described.\n\nThis resembles a problem where we need to assign directions to edges to achieve certain net outflows. This is similar to the problem of orienting edges to create a directed graph with specified net outflows for each node.\n\nThis is known as the \"directed graph with prescribed outdegrees\" problem, but in our case, it's about net outflows.\n\nIn such a scenario, the necessary and sufficient condition is that the sum of all net outflows is zero. Which it is, since the source's net outflow is F, the sink's is -F, and others are zero. Sum is zero.\n\nSo, the question becomes: how to orient the edges so that for each node, the net outflow is as specified.\n\nThis is a classic problem. One approach to solve this is to model it as a directed graph and perform a greedy algorithm.\n\nFor example, we can use a priority queue or some other data structure to process nodes and assign directions to edges.\n\nLet me recall that in such problems, you can use a greedy approach where you process nodes with certain properties. For instance, if a node has a positive net outflow requirement, you direct edges away from it, and vice versa.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Compute the required net outflow for each node. For source, it's F. For sink, it's -F. Others are zero.\n\n2. For each edge, we need to decide its direction. Let's imagine that initially, all edges are undirected. We can model this as a graph where each node has a certain \"excess\" that needs to be resolved.\n\n3. We can use a queue to process nodes. For example, take a node with a positive excess (needs to send out more flow). Find an edge connected to it that hasn't been directed yet. Direct it away from the node, subtracting the flow from the node's excess and adding it to the other node's excess.\n\nThis is similar to the approach used in the problem of finding an Eulerian trail.\n\nLet me elaborate. For example:\n\n- Start with the source node, which has an excess of F. We need to direct edges away from it to reduce its excess.\n\n- For each edge connected to the source, direct it away from the source. This reduces the source's excess by the flow value of the edge, and increases the excess of the other node by the same amount.\n\n- Repeat this process for other nodes. For example, if a node now has a positive excess, we direct edges away from it to other nodes, reducing its excess.\n\n- If a node has a negative excess (needs to receive flow), we direct edges towards it from other nodes.\n\nThis process continues until all edges are directed, and all nodes have zero excess (except source and sink).\n\nThis approach would ensure that the net outflow for each node is correct. However, it's not clear how this would ensure that the directed graph is acyclic. But perhaps, if we process the nodes in a certain order, like a BFS or DFS, we can avoid cycles.\n\nBut how to ensure that the directed graph is acyclic?\n\nWell, if we always direct edges from nodes with positive excess to nodes with negative excess, and process the nodes in a way that creates a DAG, perhaps it would work.\n\nLet me think of the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 nodes, edges:\n\n3-2 (10), 1-2 (10), 3-1 (5).\n\nThe source is node 1. Its excess is F = 10 + 5 = 15.\n\nProcess node 1. It has a positive excess. Take its edges:\n\nEdge 1-2 (10): direct from 1 to 2. This reduces node 1's excess by 10 (now 5), and increases node 2's excess by 10 (now 10).\n\nEdge 1-3 (5): direct from 1 to 3. This reduces node 1's excess by 5 (now 0), and increases node 3's excess by 5 (now 5).\n\nNow, node 1 has excess 0. Next, look at nodes with excess. Node 2 has excess 10, node 3 has 5.\n\nTake node 2. It has excess 10. Need to direct edges away from it. Its edges are:\n\nEdge 2-3 (10), which is undirected. Direct it from 2 to 3. This reduces node 2's excess by 10 (now 0), increases node 3's excess by 10 (now 5+10=15).\n\nNow, node 3 has excess 15. It's the sink, which should have excess -F = -15. Wait, no. The sink is node 3. Its required excess is -F = -15. But currently, it has 15. So this approach is not working.\n\nAh, right. The sink's required excess is -F. So in this case, node 3 (sink) must have a net outflow of -15. But in the current state, it has a net outflow of 15. So we need to direct edges towards it to reduce its excess.\n\nSo, how to handle this?\n\nMaybe the algorithm needs to process nodes with positive excess, directing edges away, and nodes with negative excess, directing edges towards them.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nLet me think again. The excess for each node is defined as:\n\nexcess[v] = (sum of flows on edges directed out of v) - (sum of flows on edges directed into v).\n\nInitially, for all nodes, excess is 0. Then, for each edge directed from u to v, we subtract ci from excess[u] and add ci to excess[v].\n\nWait, no. Let's think: directing an edge from u to v adds ci to the outflow of u and inflow of v. So the net outflow for u increases by ci (excess[u] += ci), and for v, it decreases by ci (excess[v] -= ci)? Or wait:\n\nThe excess is net outflow. For a directed edge u→v, the outflow of u increases by ci, inflow of v increases by ci. So the excess for u increases by ci (because outflow - inflow increases by ci). The excess for v increases by -ci (because outflow - inflow decreases by ci).\n\nSo, when we direct an edge from u to v, we do:\n\nexcess[u] += ci\n\nexcess[v] -= ci\n\nWait, no. Let me re-calculate:\n\nexcess[v] = outflow - inflow.\n\nWhen we direct an edge from u to v, the outflow of u increases by ci, and the inflow of v increases by ci. So:\n\nexcess[u] = outflow_u - inflow_u → increases by ci.\n\nexcess[v] = outflow_v - inflow_v → outflow_v remains the same, inflow_v increases by ci → excess[v] decreases by ci.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, when we direct an edge from u to v:\n\nexcess[u] += ci\n\nexcess[v] -= ci\n\nSo, the initial excess for source is 0. But we need to set it to F. How?\n\nWait, initially, all edges are undirected. The excess for each node is 0. But the required excess for the source is F, and for the sink is -F. How to achieve this?\n\nThis suggests that the initial setup is wrong. Perhaps the excess is computed as the required net outflow, and we need to find a way to direct edges to achieve this.\n\nSo, the required excess for each node is:\n\nrequired_excess[v] = F if v == source\n\nrequired_excess[v] = -F if v == sink\n\nrequired_excess[v] = 0 otherwise.\n\nThe goal is to direct edges such that the actual excess for each node equals the required_excess.\n\nSo, the algorithm should be:\n\nInitialize actual_excess[v] = 0 for all v.\n\nWhile there are undirected edges:\n\n   Select an undirected edge (u, v).\n\n   Determine the direction to direct it to bring actual_excess closer to required_excess.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for each edge, we can direct it in a way that reduces the difference between actual_excess and required_excess.\n\nBut this seems vague.\n\nAnother idea: the required excess for the source is F. To achieve this, we need to direct edges away from the source. Each such direction adds ci to the source's actual_excess.\n\nSimilarly, for the sink, we need to direct edges towards it, which would decrease its actual_excess.\n\nBut how to manage this.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- For each node, keep track of the current actual_excess.\n\n- Use a priority queue or something similar to process nodes with non-zero actual_excess.\n\n- For example, if a node has actual_excess > required_excess, it needs to send out more flow. So, we can look for an edge connected to it that is undirected, and direct it away from the node, which increases its actual_excess by ci (wait, no: directing away from the node adds ci to actual_excess, but if the node has excess greater than required, this",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies specific flow conservation conditions and is acyclic. The key challenge is ensuring that the flow conservation holds for all vertices except the source and sink, and that the directed graph has no cycles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Flow Conservation**: For each vertex (except the source and sink), the sum of incoming flows must equal the sum of outgoing flows.\n2. **Acyclic Graph**: The directed graph must be acyclic, which can be ensured by processing nodes in a topological order and directing edges from earlier nodes to later nodes in this order.\n3. **Greedy Edge Direction Assignment**: We use a greedy approach to direct edges based on the current flow requirements of each node. This involves maintaining a queue of nodes that need to send out more flow and directing edges accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    edges = []\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(m):\n        a = int(input[idx]) - 1\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx]) - 1\n        idx += 1\n        c = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        edges.append((a, b, c))\n        adj[a].append((b, i))\n        adj[b].append((a, i))\n\n    # Compute F as the total flow from source (node 0)\n    source = 0\n    sink = n - 1\n    F = 0\n    for neighbor, _ in adj[source]:\n        F += edges[_][2]\n\n    # required_excess: F for source, -F for sink, 0 otherwise\n    required_excess = [0] * n\n    required_excess[source] = F\n    required_excess[sink] = -F\n\n    actual_excess = [0] * n\n    edge_directions = [0] * m  # 0 means ai->bi, 1 means bi->ai\n\n    # To track undirected edges\n    undirected_edges = set(range(m))\n    # Use a queue to process nodes with non-zero excess\n    q = deque()\n\n    # Initialize the queue with the source\n    q.append(source)\n\n    while undirected_edges:\n        u = q.popleft()\n        for v, edge_idx in adj[u]:\n            if edge_idx not in undirected_edges:\n                continue\n            # Check if this edge is already processed\n            # If not, process it\n            # Determine direction based on excess\n            # We want to reduce the difference between actual and required\n            if actual_excess[u] > required_excess[u]:\n                # u needs to send out more flow\n                # Direct edge from u to v\n                edge_directions[edge_idx] = 0\n                actual_excess[u] += edges[edge_idx][2]\n                actual_excess[v] -= edges[edge_idx][2]\n                undirected_edges.remove(edge_idx)\n                # Add v to the queue if it's not sink and has non-zero excess\n                if v != sink and actual_excess[v] != required_excess[v]:\n                    q.append(v)\n            elif actual_excess[u] < required_excess[u]:\n                # u needs to receive more flow, so direct edge from v to u\n                edge_directions[edge_idx] = 1\n                actual_excess[u] -= edges[edge_idx][2]\n                actual_excess[v] += edges[edge_idx][2]\n                undirected_edges.remove(edge_idx)\n                # Add v to the queue if it's not sink and has non-zero excess\n                if v != sink and actual_excess[v] != required_excess[v]:\n                    q.append(v)\n            else:\n                # No excess change, but we need to process the edge\n                # This should not happen as per problem statement\n                pass\n\n    # Output the results\n    for d in edge_directions:\n        print(d)\n\nthreading.Thread(target=main).start()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into edges and adjacency lists.\n2. **Total Flow Calculation**: The total flow from the source (node 1) is calculated as the sum of flows on all edges connected to it.\n3. **Excess Management**: We maintain an `actual_excess` array to track the current net outflow for each node.
