He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. So the steps are: first, parse the input, convert the given number c (which is in base a) into a decimal integer, then convert that decimal integer into base b, which might be Roman numerals.\n\nFirst, let's think about the input. The first line has a and b. But b can be 'R' instead of a number. Then the second line is the number c in base a. So for example, if a is 10 and b is 2, then c is a decimal number, which we convert to decimal (which it already is), then convert to binary.\n\nBut how do I handle the conversion from base a to decimal? Well, the input c is a string representing digits in base a. For example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F. But wait, the problem says that when converting to Roman, the number is less than or equal to 3000 in decimal. Also, for other cases, the number won't exceed 1e15.\n\nSo the first step is to convert the input string c (base a) to a decimal integer. Then, depending on whether b is R or not, convert that decimal integer to either base b (as a string) or to Roman numerals.\n\nLet me break down the steps:\n\n1. Read a and b. If b is 'R', then we need to convert the decimal value to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert to base b as a string.\n\n2. Convert c (base a) to decimal. How to do that?\n\nFor converting c from base a to decimal:\n\nEach digit in c is a character. For example, if a is 12, then digits can be 0-9, A (for 10), B (for 11). So when parsing, each character needs to be converted to its corresponding value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. But the input c may have leading zeros, but that's okay because when converting to decimal, leading zeros don't affect the value.\n\nSo the function to convert c to decimal would be:\n\nInitialize a variable value = 0.\n\nFor each character in c:\n\ndigit_value = int(char) if it's a digit, else ord(char.upper()) - ord('A') + 10.\n\nWait, but for example, in base 16, the digits go up to F (15). So for a base a, the digits must be 0 to a-1. But the problem says that the input c is valid, so we don't need to check that.\n\nSo for each character in the string c, we need to compute its value, then multiply the current value by a and add the digit's value. For example:\n\nc = \"A\" in base 12 would be 10 in decimal.\n\nSo the code for converting c to decimal would be something like:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\nBut wait, what if the base is 1? Well, the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25, except for b being R. So no problem here.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, then we need to convert it to base b or to Roman numerals.\n\nNow, for converting decimal to base b (when b is not R):\n\nWe need to handle the case where the decimal number is zero. However, the problem says that if Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. But in other cases, the number can be zero? Wait, the input says that c may be zero, but when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So for example, if the output is not Roman, then the input could be zero.\n\nBut the output says that we must omit leading zeros. So for example, if the converted number is zero, then the output is 0.\n\nSo for converting decimal to base b (non-R):\n\nWe need to handle zero. Let's think about how to convert a decimal number to base b.\n\nIf the number is zero, output is '0'.\n\nElse, we repeatedly divide by b and collect the remainders. Then reverse the collected digits.\n\nBut the digits may be larger than 9. For example, if base is 16, then 10 is 'A', 11 is 'B', etc.\n\nSo the function would be:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nWait, but what if the input is zero? For example, if the original c was zero. Let's see the problem statement: \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\" So when the output is Roman, the number is non-zero. But for other outputs, it can be zero. So when converting to base b (non-R), the input could be zero.\n\nSo the code for decimal_to_base must handle zero.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, for example, the first input is:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nWhich is converting 1 (base 10) to base 2, which is 1. Output is '1'.\n\nAnother sample input is '2 2\\n1111001' which is converting 1111001 in base 2 to decimal, which is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + ... etc. Let's see:\n\n1111001 in binary is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Then converting to base 2 again would be 1111001. Which is the sample output.\n\nSo the code for converting to base b seems correct.\n\nNow, the other part is converting decimal to Roman numerals.\n\nHow to convert a decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nThe standard approach is to use a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from highest to lowest. For each value, subtract as many times as possible from the number and append the corresponding symbols.\n\nFor example:\n\nvalues = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each pair, while the number is >= value, append the symbol and subtract the value.\n\nSo for example, 4 would be IV.\n\nSo the code for decimal_to_roman would be:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input when converting to Roman is guaranteed to be <= 3000 and not zero. So we don't have to handle 0 or numbers beyond 3000.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe steps for each test case are:\n\nRead a and b. Then read c.\n\nConvert c from base a to decimal (num).\n\nIf b is 'R', then convert num to Roman numerals.\n\nElse, convert num to base b, as a string, using the decimal_to_base function.\n\nBut wait, what about leading zeros? For example, if the input c is '000' in base a, then the decimal is 0. When converting to base b, the output should be '0'.\n\nBut the problem says that for the output, we must omit leading zeros. So for example, if the converted number is zero, output '0'. Otherwise, leading zeros are omitted.\n\nBut in the decimal_to_base function, when the number is zero, returns '0'. For other numbers, leading zeros are not present. For example, if the number is 5 and base is 10, returns '5'.\n\nSo that's handled.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead the input. Wait, the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is two lines per test case. Wait, perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b. The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a.\n\nSo each test case is two lines. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, the way the sample input is presented is as a list of strings, each being a separate test case. But for the code, the input is read from stdin. So perhaps the code must process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b...\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c...\n\nSo, for each test case, there are two lines. But how many test cases are there? The sample input shows multiple test cases, but the problem description isn't clear. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, the input is a list of five test cases, each with two lines. The sample output is a list of five outputs. So the code should process multiple test cases, each with two lines.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is given as per the first line and next line. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the problem's input and output examples:\n\nIn the sample input, the user provided a list of inputs, each being a separate test case. For example, the first input line is '10 2\\n1', which is two lines. But perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. So the code must read all lines from stdin, processing each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, in Python, the standard input can be read as a list of lines. So for example, the code can read all lines, then process them in pairs.\n\nBut perhaps the input is given as multiple test cases, each with two lines. So for example, the first line is a and b, the second line is c. Then another line for a and b, then another line for c, etc.\n\nSo the code needs to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b...\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c...\n\nSo perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of strings, each representing a separate test case. For example, the first test case is:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nWhich outputs '1'.\n\nThe second test case is:\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\nWhich outputs 'V'.\n\nSo the code must read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is unclear. But looking at the problem's note, the sample input shows that the code must process multiple test cases, each with two lines.\n\nBut how to read them? Because in programming competition problems, sometimes each test case is given in a separate input, but sometimes the input is a single test case. However, looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, and the next line contains c. So perhaps the code must process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nTherefore, the code needs to read all lines from stdin, split into pairs of lines, each pair being a test case.\n\nBut how to read them in Python? Well, perhaps read all lines from stdin, then process them in pairs. For example, for lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines(), then for i in range(0, len(lines), 2), process lines[i] and lines[i+1].\n\nBut perhaps the input is given as multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input section says that the first line contains a and b, and the next line contains c. So perhaps there is only one test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases. But the original problem statement's input description is ambiguous.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the input section, it says:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b...\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c...\n\nSo this implies that there is only one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. This is conflicting. But looking at the sample input and output, the sample input shows multiple test cases, and the sample output shows the corresponding outputs. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to determine how many test cases there are? Well, perhaps the input is given as multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. So the code must read until EOF, processing each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all lines, and process them in pairs. For example, for each test case, read two lines: the first line is a and b, the second line is c.\n\nSo in Python, the code can read all lines, then loop over them in pairs.\n\nNow, considering that, the code structure would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n    a_line = lines[i]\n    c_line = lines[i+1]\n    # process a_line and c_line\n\nBut what if the number of lines is odd? Well, the problem says that the input is correct, so it's guaranteed that there are even lines.\n\nNow, for each test case, process a_line and c_line.\n\nParsing a_line:\n\na_line is a string like '10 2' or '16 R' etc. Split into parts. So split by whitespace.\n\nSo, a and b can be parsed as:\n\nparts = a_line.split()\na = int(parts[0])\nb = parts[1]\n\nThen, c_line is the string representing the number in base a.\n\nOnce we have a, b, and c_line, we need to convert c_line to decimal, then convert to base b or Roman.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nConvert c_line (base a) to decimal:\n\nImplement the to_decimal function.\n\nThen, if b is 'R', convert to Roman numerals. Else, convert to base b.\n\nNow, implement the functions.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the to_decimal function.\n\nBut what if the input c_line is empty? According to the problem statement, it's a non-negative integer, and the length doesn't exceed 10^3. So the code can process it.\n\nNow, code for to_decimal:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\nBut need to make sure that the digits are valid for the base. However, the problem says that the input is valid, so no need to check.\n\nNow, for the decimal to base function:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nBut what about leading zeros? For example, if the number is zero, returns '0'. For other numbers, leading zeros are not present.\n\nNow, the decimal_to_roman function as discussed earlier.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead each test case, process.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        a_line = lines[i]\n        c_line = lines[i+1]\n        # parse a and b\n        a_part, b_part = a_line.split()\n        a = int(a_part)\n        b = b_part\n        # convert c_line from base a to decimal\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c_line, a)\n        # process based on b\n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but what about leading zeros in the output? For example, if the converted number is zero, the code returns '0', which is correct. For other numbers, the code does not have leading zeros. For example, if the decimal value is 5 and base is 10, returns '5'.\n\nBut in the sample input, the third case is:\n\n5 R\\n4\n\nWhich is converting 4 (base 5) to decimal. 4 in base 5 is 4 in decimal. Then converting to Roman is IV. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is '2 2\\n1111001', which is converting 1111001 in base 2 to decimal. Let's see:\n\nThe binary number is 1111001. Let's compute its value:\n\nFrom left to right:\n\n1*(2^6) + 1*(2^5) + 1*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) + 0*(2^2) + 0*(2^1) + 1*(2^0) = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Then converting to base 2 again gives 1111001, which is the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is '12 13\\nA' which is converting A (base 12) to decimal. A is 10 in decimal. Then converting to base 13: 10 in base 13 is 'A', which is the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, testing the code for the sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\nTest case 1:\n\na=10, b=2, c=1. decimal_value is 1. converted to base 2 is 1. Output is '1'.\n\nTest case 2:\n\na=16, b=R, c=5. decimal value is 5. Roman is 'V'.\n\nTest case 3:\n\na=5, b=R, c=4. decimal value is 4. Roman is 'IV'.\n\nTest case 4:\n\na=2, b=2, c=1111001. decimal is 121. converted to base 2 is 1111001.\n\nTest case 5:\n\na=12, b=13, c=A. decimal is 10. converted to base 13 is 'A'.\n\nAll sample outputs match.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase where decimal is zero. For example, input is a=10, b=10, c=0. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: a=2, c=0, then converting to base 10 gives 0.\n\nAnother case: converting to Roman. For example, 3000 is MMM.\n\nAnother case: converting to base higher than 10. For example, decimal 10 in base 16 is 'A'.\n\nAnother case: when the input is zero and converting to base 2, output is '0'.\n\nWhat about leading zeros in c_line? For example, c_line is '001' in base 10. It's converted to 1, which is correct.\n\nNow, code seems to handle these cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling uppercase and lowercase letters in c_line. The code converts to uppercase, so it's okay.\n\n- The case where the decimal value is zero and converting to base b. The code returns '0'.\n\n- What if the input c is empty? According to the problem statement, it's a non-negative integer, and the length doesn't exceed 10^3. So it's not empty.\n\nAnother thing: the problem says that when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So the code doesn't have to handle zero in that case.\n\nNow, code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base to another base or to Roman numerals. The solution involves converting the input number from its original base to a decimal (base 10) integer and then converting this decimal integer to the target base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number is given in a specific base. We first convert this number to a decimal integer.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base or Roman Numerals**:\n   - If the target base is Roman numerals, convert the decimal integer to Roman numerals using a predefined list of value-symbol pairs.\n   - If the target base is another numeral system, convert the decimal integer to the specified base, handling digits greater than 9 by using letters (A-Z).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        a_line = lines[i]\n        c_line = lines[i+1]\n        a_part, b_part = a_line.split()\n        a = int(a_part)\n        b = b_part\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c_line, a)\n        if b == 'R':\n            print(decimal_to_roman(decimal_value))\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as multiple lines, each pair of lines representing a test case. The first line contains the original base and target base (or 'R' for Roman numerals), and the second line contains the number in the original base.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The `to_decimal` function converts the input number from its original base to a decimal integer.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base or Roman Numerals**:\n   - **Decimal to Base**: The `decimal_to_base` function converts a decimal number to the specified base, using letters for digits greater than 9.\n   - **Decimal to Roman Numerals**: The `decimal_to_roman` function converts a decimal number to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs, ensuring correct formatting according to Roman numeral rules.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion between different numeral systems and ensures correct formatting for both standard bases and Roman numerals.",
