A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So I need to find the maximum number of toasts per friend possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend?), wait no: each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt per toast. Oh right. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs these things. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Because each friend has one toast, so per toast, total is n * nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so total slices per toast is n slices. And salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck the problem statement. \n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend requires these. So if there are t toasts, then each friend makes t toasts. So total drink required is t * n * nl. Because each of the n friends has t toasts, each needing nl ml. So total drink is t * n * nl. Similarly, for lime slices: each toast per friend needs a slice, so total slices needed is t * n. And salt is t * n * np.\n\nSo the resources available:\n\nTotal drink available is k * l ml.\n\nTotal lime slices available is c * d.\n\nTotal salt available is p grams.\n\nSo the maximum possible t is determined by how much each resource can contribute. For each resource, compute how many toasts are possible, then take the minimum of those.\n\nSo for drink: total_drink = k*l. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So maximum possible toasts from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, since t has to be integer. Similarly for the other resources.\n\nFor lime slices: total_slices = c*d. Each toast requires n slices. So max toasts from lime is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor salt: total_salt = p. Each toast requires n * np grams. So max toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nSample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. Let's compute:\n\nDrink: 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml? Wait, n is 3 friends, nl is 3. So per toast, total drink is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222, so floor is 2. Which matches the sample's note where they said 20/3=6 toasts. Wait wait, no. Wait in the note, they said that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait the note says: \"the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\" Wait, that seems conflicting with my previous calculation. Let me check again.\n\nAh! Oh right! Wait, the note says that for the first sample, the drink is 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires each friend to have nl=3 ml. So per toast, each of the 3 friends needs 3 ml. So per toast, total drink is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. Then 20 / 9 is 2.222, which would be 2 toasts. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait this suggests that perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for one toast, each friend requires nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. But in the note, the sample input has n=3, nl=3. So per toast, 3 * 3 = 9 ml. But the note says that 20 ml is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. That suggests that per toast, the total drink is ",
