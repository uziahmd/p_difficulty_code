A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to find the maximum number of toasts per friend possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nSo, first, I need to calculate how much of each resource is available, then determine how many toasts can be made considering all constraints.\n\nLet me think about each resource:\n\n1. Drink: Total drink is k * l ml. Each toast requires n * nl ml (because each of the n friends needs nl ml). So the total number of toasts possible from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). Wait, no. Wait, for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. So total toasts possible from drink is total_drink // (n * nl). But wait, total_drink is k*l. So yes.\n\nWait, for example, in the first sample input: 3 friends, 4 bottles of 5ml each. Total drink is 20ml. Each toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml? Wait, the sample says that for the first input, the drink allows 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait, that's because 3 friends each need 3 ml per toast. So per toast, total is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. 20 / 9 is 2.222, so floor is 2. But the sample says that the drink allows 6 toasts. Oh wait, maybe I got the calculation wrong. Let me check the note again.\n\nIn the first sample, the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait, why? Because each toast requires each friend to have nl ml. So per toast, each friend uses nl ml. So total per toast is n * nl. So for the first sample, n=3, nl=3. So per toast, 3*3=9 ml. Total drink is 20. 20 / 9 is 2.222... so 2 toasts. But the note says that the drink allows 6 toasts. Wait, this is conflicting. Wait, what's the note saying?\n\nAh, the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait, why divided by 3? Oh, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl. So total number of toasts possible is (total_drink) // (n * nl). But in the first sample, total_drink is 4 * 5 = 20. n is 3, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 * 3 = 9. 20 // 9 is 2. But the note says that it's 20 / 3 = 6. That suggests that perhaps I have a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait, why 20 divided by 3? Because maybe each toast requires per friend nl ml. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml, so for one toast, total is n * nl. But the total drink is 20. So the maximum number of toasts is total_drink divided by (n * nl) per toast. But in the first sample, that would be 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222, so 2. But the note says that it's 20 / 3 = 6. So there's a contradiction here. Which means I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So, for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, all n friends are having one toast. So the total drink per toast is n * nl. So for example, if there are",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a certain amount of salt per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of drink available from the bottles, the total number of lime slices available from the limes, and the total amount of salt available.\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**: For each resource, calculate how many toasts can be made given the constraints:\n   - **Drink**: The total drink divided by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Lime Slices**: The total number of lime slices divided by the number of slices needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Salt**: The total salt divided by the amount of salt needed per toast for all friends.\n3. **Determine the Limiting Factor**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is determined by the minimum value among the constraints calculated from the drink, lime slices, and salt.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntoast_lime = total_lime_slices // n\ntoast_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink is calculated as the product of the number of bottles and the volume per bottle.\n2. **Total Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is calculated as the product of the number of limes and the number of slices per lime.\n3. **Toast Constraints**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: Divides the total drink by the amount required per toast for all friends.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: Divides the total lime slices by the number of slices needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: Divides the total salt by the amount required per toast for all friends.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The result is the minimum value of the three constraints, as this determines the limiting factor in how many toasts can be made.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum number of toasts each friend can make by considering each resource constraint and taking the minimum of these constraints.",
