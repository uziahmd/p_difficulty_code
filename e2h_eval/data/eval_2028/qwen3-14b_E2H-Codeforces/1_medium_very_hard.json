The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is the edge, then next is two cells away, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), where i is the ring number. Wait, for the i-th ring, right?\n\nSo for each ring from 1 to k, I need to calculate the perimeter of that rectangle and sum them all. But wait, how does the perimeter calculation work here?\n\nWait, the perimeter of a rectangle with width W and height H is 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes (W) and (H), but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. Alternatively, for a rectangle, the number of cells in the border is 2*(width + height) - 4. Because each side has length, but the four corners are counted twice. So for example, a rectangle of 3x3: the perimeter cells are 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 = 8, which matches the first example input where output is 8.\n\nYes, so for each ring i, the rectangle is (w_i) by (h_i), where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1). Then the perimeter for that ring is 2*(w_i + h_i - 2). Or maybe 2*(w_i + h_i) - 4? Let me check. For a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the number of cells in the border is 2*m + 2*(n-2) ? Or perhaps 2*(m + n) - 4. Let's think for m=3, n=3. 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8, which is correct. So yes, that formula works.\n\nSo for each ring i (from 1 to k), we calculate 2*(w_i + h_i) - 4, where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1). Then sum all these values.\n\nBut wait, there's a possibility that for some i, the rectangle becomes invalid. Like, if the width or height becomes less than 1. But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's possible. The problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Wait, let me check the input constraints again. The input says that k is between 1 and floor( (min(n, m) + 1)/4 ), but here n and m are probably w and h. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput constraints: 3 ≤ w, h ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ k ≤ floor( (min(n, m) + 1)/4 ), but maybe there's a typo here. Because the original problem says min(n, m) but n and m are not defined. Probably, it's a typo and should be min(w, h). Because the problem says that the i-th ring is on a rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) × (h - 4(i-1)). So for that rectangle to exist, we need that both dimensions are at least 1. So for the k-th ring, the dimensions are:\n\nw - 4*(k-1) ≥ 1, and same for h. So the maximum possible k is such that 4(k-1) ≤ (w -1) and 4(k-1) ≤ (h-1). So the maximum k is floor( (min(w, h) -1)/4 ) + 1? Or maybe the problem's input constraints already ensure that k is valid. So in our code, we don't have to worry about invalid cases because the input is guaranteed to be valid.\n\nSo the approach is straightforward: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle for that ring and sum them all.\n\nLet me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. So for i=1, w_i = 3, h_i=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3) -4 = 8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input:7 9 1. So the first ring is 7x9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16 -4 = 32-4=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example:7 9 2. First ring is 7x9: 28. Second ring is (7 -4*(2-1)) = 7-4=3, and 9-4=5. So 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12? Wait 2*(3+5) is 16, minus 4 is 12. So total is 28+12=40. Which matches the third example's output.\n\nYes. So the formula is correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop from i=1 to k:\n\nfor each i, compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\nsum += 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\nreturn the sum.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut wait, let me check for i=1, the first ring. For example, in the first example, 3x3, 2*(3+3) -4= 8. Correct.\n\nYes. So this code should work.\n\nNow, let's check for other possible cases. Let's say, when k is 2, and the dimensions are such that after subtracting 4*(i-1) for i=2, the dimensions are still valid.\n\nAnother example: suppose w=7, h=7, k=2. Then first ring is 7x7: perimeter 2*(7+7) -4 = 24. Second ring is 7-4=3, 7-4=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3)-4= 8. Total is 24+8=32.\n\nYes. So code would return that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the Python code. Read input as three integers. Then loop.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a single line with three integers. So for example, in the sample input, the first case is '3 3 1'.\n\nSo in code, read the input line, split into three integers.\n\nIn Python:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen initialize total to 0.\n\nThen loop for i in 1..k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\ntotal += perimeter\n\nThen print(total).\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the code. Let me test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:7 9 1 → 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16 -4= 28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3:7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5) -4 → 28 + 12 = 40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: let's take k=2, w=7, h=7. As discussed earlier, total is 24 + 8=32.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: what if k is 0? But according to input constraints, k is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nSo the code should work. So the Python code is straightforward.\n",
