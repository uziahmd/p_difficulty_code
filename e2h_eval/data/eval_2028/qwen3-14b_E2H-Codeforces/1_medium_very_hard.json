The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), where i is the ring number. Wait, but for each ring, the formula for the perimeter?\n\nWait, the problem says that the i-th ring consists of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how does that translate into the number of cells? Because for a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) is 2*(W + H - 2). Because the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(width + height) minus 4 (since the corners are counted twice). Wait, no. Let me think again. For example, a rectangle that's 3x3. The perimeter cells would be the outermost layer. How many cells? Well, the total cells in the perimeter would be 3*4 - 4 = 8 (since each side has 3 cells, but subtracting the 4 corners which are counted twice). Alternatively, 2*(w + h) - 4. For 3x3, that's 2*(3+3) -4 = 8, which matches the first example. The first example input is 3 3 1, output is 8. So that's correct.\n\nSo for each ring i (from 1 to k), we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, what if the rectangle becomes too small? For example, if the ring is such that the dimensions become less than 1? But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's valid. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(n, m) + 1)/4 ), but maybe that's ensuring that each ring is possible. So for each i from 1 to k, the dimensions for the rectangle are:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nBut for each i, current_w and current_h must be at least 1. Because the problem says that the input is valid. So we don't have to check for that.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle for that ring, and sum them all.\n\nSo the formula for each ring i is 2*(current_w + current_h - 2). Because 2*(w + h) - 4 equals 2*(w + h - 2). So for each ring, the perimeter is 2*(current_w + current_h - 2).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Initialize total = 0\n- For each i in 1..k:\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n   add perimeter to total\n- Return total\n\nWait, let's test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. So i=1:\n\ncurrent_w = 3 - 0 = 3, current_h = 3. perimeter is 2*(3 + 3 -2) = 2*(4) = 8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input: 7 9 1. So i=1:\n\ncurrent_w =7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7 + 9 - 2) = 2*(14) = 28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. So two rings.\n\nFirst ring: 7,9 → 2*(7+9-2) = 28. Second ring: i=2. current_w =7 -4*(1) = 3, current_h=9 -4*(1) =5. So perimeter is 2*(3 +5 -2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28 + 12 = 40. Which matches the third example.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the code needs to read w, h, k, then loop from 1 to k, compute for each i the current_w and current_h, compute the perimeter, sum all.\n\nSo the code would be straightforward.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases. For example, when k is 0? But according to input constraints, k is at least 1. So no. What if the dimensions are exactly 4*(k-1) + 1? Like for example, if w and h are 5, and k is 2. Then for i=1: 5,5. perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. For i=2: 5 -4*(1) = 1, h same. perimeter is 2*(1 + 1 -2) = 0? Wait, but 1+1-2 is 0, multiplied by 2 is 0. So adding zero. But that's correct? Because if the rectangle is 1x1, then the perimeter is zero. Because there's no border. So in that case, the ring would contribute nothing. But according to the problem statement, the input is valid. So perhaps the input ensures that for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are >= 1. But for example, if w=5, h=5, k=2. Then the second ring would be 1x1. So the perimeter is 0. So the code would add 16 + 0 = 16.\n\nBut according to the input constraints, k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let's see for min(w,h) =5. (5+1)/4 is 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the input would not allow that. So the code can safely process the cases.\n\nSo the code can proceed as described.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nRead the input line as three integers. Then loop for each i from 1 to k, compute current_w and current_h, compute perimeter, sum.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nRead input line, split into w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me check for another example. Suppose w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which is correct. If k=1, then output is 16.\n\nAnother example: w=5, h=5, k=2. But according to input constraints, k is allowed? Let's see. min(w, h) is 5. (5+1)/4 is 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the input would not have that. So the code doesn't need to handle that case.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nLet me test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 7 9 2. First ring 7,9 → 28. Second ring: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. 2*(3+5-2)= 2*6=12. Total 40. Correct.\n\nYes. So the code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input line. Split into w, h, k.\n\nBut the input is given as a single line, like '3 3 1' etc. So in Python:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute total as above.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n\nThat's the code.\n\nWait, but what if the current_w or current_h is less than 1? But according to the problem statement, the input is valid. So the code can proceed.\n\nYes. So that's the solution.\n",
