Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each covers a distance up to d from their position.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to model this problem. The key idea is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the middle of that gap would require the largest d to cover.\n\nBut wait, also need to consider the ends. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would be a candidate for d. Similarly for the end of the street, l. Because if the last lantern is before l, then the distance from there to l is another candidate.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because if they are not sorted, the gaps between consecutive ones can't be determined properly.\n2. Check the distance between the start of the street (0) and the first lantern. That's one candidate for max gap.\n3. Check the distance between the last lantern and the end of the street (l). Another candidate.\n4. Then check all the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap is (current - previous). The maximum of these gaps divided by 2 would be the required d for that gap. Because the worst case is the middle of the gap, which is half the gap away from each lantern.\n5. The overall answer is the maximum among all these candidates.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose two consecutive lanterns are at positions a and b, with a < b. The gap between them is (b - a). The maximum distance from any point in this interval to the nearest lantern would be (b - a)/2. Because the midpoint between a and b is (a + b)/2. The distance from this midpoint to either lantern is (b - a)/2. So yes, that's the critical point for that gap.\n\nBut for the ends, like the first lantern is at position a1. The area from 0 to a1 is covered by the first lantern's light. The maximum distance here is a1 - 0. But wait, no. The lantern's light covers up to d distance. So if the first lantern is at a1, then the leftmost point it can cover is a1 - d. To cover 0, we need a1 - d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a1. Similarly, the rightmost point covered by the first lantern is a1 + d. But for the next lantern, which is at a2, the leftmost point it covers is a2 -d. So the gap between a1 and a2 is (a2 - a1), and the maximum required d for that gap is (a2 - a1)/2. But for the first lantern, the distance from 0 to a1 is a1. So the required d must be at least that. Similarly for the last lantern and l.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial gap between 0 and the first lantern. That's initial_gap = a[0] - 0. The required d for this is initial_gap.\n- Compute the final gap between the last lantern and l. That's final_gap = l - a[-1]. Required d is final_gap.\n- Then for each consecutive pair in the sorted list, compute the gap between them. The required d for that gap is (gap)/2.\n- The maximum among all these values is the minimal required d.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the algorithm steps are:\n\nSort the array. Then check the initial and final gaps, and the middle gaps.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All lanterns are at 0. Then the initial gap is 0, but the final gap is l - 0 = l. So the answer is l. Because the lanterns can't cover beyond 0, so the entire street needs to be covered by the lanterns. But since they are at 0, their coverage extends to d. So d must be l, so that the light reaches from 0 to l.\n\nAnother case: n=1. Then the lantern is at a position a. The initial gap is a, the final gap is l -a. The maximum of these two is the required d.\n\nFor example, if l=15 and the lantern is at 0, then the initial gap is 0, the final is 15. So d is 15. But if the lantern is at 7.5, then initial and final gaps are 7.5 and 7.5, so d is 7.5.\n\nAnother case: multiple lanterns. For example, the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 7 15, and the lantern positions are [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. After sorting, it's [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. Then:\n\nInitial gap is 0 (since first lantern is at 0). Final gap is 15 -15 = 0. Then the consecutive gaps are 3-0=3, 5-3=2, 7-5=2, 9-7=2, 14-9=5, 15-14=1. The maximum of (3/2, 2/2, etc.) is 5/2=2.5. So the maximum between initial (0), final (0), and 2.5 is 2.5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput is 2 5, lanterns at 2 and 5. Sorted as [2,5]. Initial gap is 2-0=2. Final gap is 5-5=0. The gap between 2 and 5 is 3, so 3/2=1.5. The maximum between 2, 0, and 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort them.\n\nCompute initial_gap = a[0] - 0.\n\nCompute final_gap = l - a[-1].\n\nmax_d = max(initial_gap, final_gap)\n\nThen for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\ngap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ncurrent_d = gap / 2\n\nif current_d > max_d:\n\n   max_d = current_d\n\nThen output max_d.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple lanterns at the same position? For example, two lanterns at position 3. Then the gap between them is zero. So the current_d is zero. So it doesn't affect the max_d.\n\nSo that's handled correctly.\n\nNow, what about when n=0? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo code steps in Python:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Sort them. Then compute initial and final gaps. Then iterate through consecutive elements.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nBut note that in Python, for reading input, the input may have multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line is n and l, then the next line is the list of a_i. But in the example input, there are two test cases. Wait, the example input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWhich probably represents two separate test cases. So the code should read from stdin, but how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. But perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Or is that just part of the example?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as first line with n and l, then next line with the a_i. So for each test case, the code reads two lines. However, the example shows two test cases. But perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? But the original problem says that the input is as per the first line. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l... The next line contains n integers ai...\n\nSo the code should read one test case. However, the example shows two test cases. But perhaps that's part of the example, but in reality, the code should read one test case. Wait, perhaps the example is showing two different test cases. For example, the first input line is for the first test case, and the second is for the second. But in the actual programming competition problem, the code is supposed to process one test case. Or maybe the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\", and the input is given as per the problem. So perhaps the code needs to read one test case. However, in the sample input, there are two test cases. But perhaps that's just for the example, and in reality, the code should read one test case.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, the first input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nWhich gives output 2.5.\n\nThen the second input is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nWhich gives output 2.0.\n\nSo the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But how? How does the input look?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. But perhaps in the actual programming competition problem, the code is supposed to read a single test case. However, in the example, there are two test cases. But perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ... The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. So why does the example show two test cases? Maybe it's because the user provided two examples. So in the actual code, the code should read one test case. However, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the user provided two examples, but the code is supposed to handle one test case. So the code should read from stdin, which for the programming competition problem would be one test case.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input line is for the first test case, and the second is for the second. But how is that possible? Well, perhaps the problem is that the user provided two examples. But for the code, the code should read from stdin, which for the programming competition would be one test case.\n\nBut perhaps the code needs to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement does not mention that. So perhaps the example is showing two different test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case. Therefore, the code should read two lines: first line is n and l, second line is the list of a_i.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0' and the second is '2 5\\n2 5'. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is given with two test cases, but the code is supposed to read one. So perhaps the code is supposed to read one test case.\n\nBut then, how to explain the sample input? Well, perhaps the sample input is given as two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to read one test case. So perhaps the code is written to read one test case, and the sample input shows two test cases, but in practice, the code is run once per test case.\n\nTherefore, the code should read one test case. So, the code will read two lines: the first line is n and l, the second line is the list of a_i.\n\nBut in Python, how to read the input? For example, in the code, perhaps the input is read via input().split().\n\nBut for the code, the code will read from stdin. So for the code, the code should read two lines: first line is n and l, second line is the list of a_i.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead n and l from input.\n\nThen read the next line, split into list of integers.\n\nThen process as per the steps.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen sort a.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first test case has 7 lanterns. The input line is '15 5 3 7 9 14 0' which is 7 numbers. So that's correct.\n\nOnce the list is sorted, proceed.\n\nNow, compute initial_gap = a[0] - 0.0 ?\n\nWait, but the initial_gap is a[0], since 0 is the start of the street. So for example, if the first lantern is at 0, initial_gap is 0. So the required d for that is 0.\n\nBut the code needs to compute the maximum between initial_gap, final_gap, and the middle gaps.\n\nBut in code:\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\ninitial_gap = sorted_a[0] - 0.0\n\nfinal_gap = l - sorted_a[-1]\n\nmax_d = max(initial_gap, final_gap)\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = sorted_a[i] - sorted_a[i-1]\n\n    current_d = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current_d > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current_d\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but in the first test case, the initial_gap is 0, final_gap is 0, and the maximum of the middle gaps is 5/2=2.5, which is correct.\n\nBut in the second test case, sorted_a is [2,5]. initial_gap is 2.0, final_gap is 0. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So max is 2.0. Correct.\n\nBut what about when the initial_gap is larger than the other values? Like if the first lantern is at 3, and l is 5. Then initial_gap is 3, final_gap is 5 - 3 = 2. So the max is 3. So the answer is 3.0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the street is length 0? But according to the input constraints, l is at least 1.\n\nWait, the input constraints say l is 1 ≤ l ≤ 1e9. So no problem.\n\nBut what if n=1 and l=1. So the lantern is at 0. Then initial_gap is 0, final_gap is 1 - 0 = 1. So the answer is 1.0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=5, a=[3]. Then initial_gap is 3, final_gap is 5-3=2. So the maximum is 3. So d is 3. Which covers from 0 to 3 + 3 = 6, but the street is up to 5, so it's okay.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling the output formatting. The problem says that the answer must be printed with enough decimal digits, such that the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 1e-9.\n\nIn Python, using the format string with 10 decimal digits should suffice, as in the sample outputs. For example, the first sample outputs 2.5000000000, which is 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo the code should print the value with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut in Python, when using floating points, sometimes there can be precision issues. However, since the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-9, using floating points (double precision) should be sufficient.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the maximum is an integer? For example, in the second sample, the answer is 2.0, which is printed as 2.0000000000.\n\nSo in code, the code can print the maximum_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut in Python, when you use the format string, for example, if the value is an integer, it will add the trailing zeros.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nBut in Python, when you do this, for example, if the value is 2.5, it will print 2.5000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut need to import sys.\n\nBut also, in the case where n=0? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\nSort a.\n\nCompute initial_gap and final_gap.\n\nThen compute the max_d as the maximum between initial_gap, final_gap, and the maximum (gap between consecutive lanterns)/2.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    max_d = 0.0\n    # initial gap\n    initial_gap = a[0]\n    # final gap\n    final_gap = l - a[-1]\n    max_d = max(initial_gap, final_gap)\n    # check consecutive gaps\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current_d = gap / 2.0\n        if current_d > max_d:\n            max_d = current_d\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but initial_gap is a[0] - 0.0? Because the first lantern is at a[0], and the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0] - 0. So yes. But in the code, initial_gap is set to a[0], which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if a[0] is 0? Then initial_gap is 0. So that's correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 7 15, and a is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. After sorting, [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. initial_gap is 0.0, final_gap is 15-15=0. So max_d starts as 0. Then checking the consecutive gaps:\n\n3-0=3 → 1.5 → current_d is 1.5. Since 1.5>0, max_d becomes 1.5.\n\nThen 5-3=2 → 1.0. Not bigger than 1.5.\n\nThen 7-5=2 → 1.0. No change.\n\nThen 9-7=2 → 1.0.\n\nThen 14-9=5 → 2.5. Now, 2.5>1.5 → max_d is 2.5.\n\nThen 15-14=1 → 0.5. No change.\n\nSo the max_d is 2.5. Which is printed as 2.5000000000.\n\nSample 2: input 2 5, a is [2,5]. sorted as [2,5]. initial_gap is 2.0. final_gap is 5-5=0. So max_d is 2.0. Then check the gap between 5-2=3 → 1.5. Which is less than 2.0. So the answer is 2.0 → printed as 2.0000000000.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=5, a=[3]. Then initial_gap is 3, final_gap is 5-3=2. max_d is 3.0. So output is 3.0000000000.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=5, a=[0,5]. initial_gap is 0, final_gap is 0. The gap between them is 5, so 5/2=2.5. So answer is 2.5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. initial and final gaps are 0. The gaps between 0 and 5 is 5/2=2.5, between 5 and 10 is 5/2=2.5. So max is 2.5.\n\nBut if the street is 10, and the lanterns are at 0, 5, 10. Then the maximum d is 2.5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then the initial and final gaps are 0. The gap between them is 10 → 5. So answer is 5.0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nSo this should be the correct approach.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius $ d $ that lanterns must have to ensure the entire street of length $ l $ is illuminated. The approach involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the ends of the street to find the maximum required radius.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Initial and Final Gaps**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are potential candidates for the radius $ d $.\n3. **Check Consecutive Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The critical point for coverage in this gap is the midpoint, which requires a radius of half the gap length.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The required radius $ d $ is the maximum value among the initial gap, final gap, and the maximum of half the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    max_d = 0.0\n    # Initial gap from 0 to the first lantern\n    initial_gap = a[0]\n    # Final gap from the last lantern to l\n    final_gap = l - a[-1]\n    max_d = max(initial_gap, final_gap)\n    # Check gaps between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current_d = gap / 2.0\n        if current_d > max_d:\n            max_d = current_d\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of lanterns $ n $ and the length of the street $ l $, followed by the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions helps in efficiently calculating the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Initial and Final Gaps**: The initial gap is the distance from the start of the street to the first lantern, and the final gap is the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n4. **Consecutive Gaps**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the maximum radius required to cover the gap between them is half the distance between them, as the midpoint of the gap is the farthest point from both lanterns.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to ensure the required accuracy.\n\nThis approach ensures that all parts of the street are covered with the minimum possible radius, efficiently handling edge cases such as lanterns at the ends of the street or multiple lanterns at the same position.",
