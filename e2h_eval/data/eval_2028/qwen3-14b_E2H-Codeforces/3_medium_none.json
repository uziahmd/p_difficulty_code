Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum radius d for the lanterns so that the entire street is covered. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The street is from 0 to l. There are n lanterns placed at various positions. Each lantern can light up a segment from (ai - d) to (ai + d). We need to find the minimal d such that all points from 0 to l are covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nHmm. So the key is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. But how?\n\nLet me think. Let's sort the lantern positions first. Because if they are sorted, I can check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. Also, I need to consider the ends of the street. For example, the first lantern might not be at 0, so the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would determine the required d. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance from the start (0) to the first lantern. The required d must cover this, so the initial candidate is (a[0] - 0).\n3. Then, check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For each pair, the middle point between them is (a[i+1] - a[i])/2. Because if the gap is between two lanterns, the worst case is the middle point of the gap, which needs to be covered by both lanterns. Wait, no. Wait, if two lanterns are at positions x and y (x < y), then the maximum distance from any point in between to the nearest lantern would be (y - x)/2. Because the midpoint is (x + y)/2. The distance from x to midpoint is (y - x)/2, same for y. So the required d for this gap is (y - x)/2. But if the lanterns are spaced such that their coverage overlaps, then this is covered. So the maximum of these gaps divided by two would be the required d for the middle parts.\n4. Then check the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). So the candidate is (l - a[-1]).\n5. The answer is the maximum among these three values: first part, the max gap between consecutive lanterns divided by two, and the last part.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? For example, if n=1. Then the lantern is at some position a. Then the maximum distance is max(a, l - a). Because the lantern's coverage has to reach from 0 to l. So the required d is the maximum between a and l - a. Which is the same as the first and last steps.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nSort the array of ai.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first lantern's position. The distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0] - 0. So the initial max_d is this value.\n\nThen for each consecutive pair, compute the gap between them. The required d for that gap is (gap)/2. Compare with current max_d.\n\nThen check the last lantern's position. The distance from a[-1] to l is l - a[-1]. Compare with current max_d.\n\nThe maximum of all these is the required d.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo for example, the second sample input:\n\nInput is 2 5, with lanterns at 2 and 5. Wait, wait the input is '2 5\\n2 5' ?\n\nWait in the example given, the second input is ['2 5\\n2 5', ...]. Wait the sample input shows that for the second case, the output is 2.0. Let's see:\n\nThe street is length 5. Lanterns at 2 and 5. So sorted, they are [2,5].\n\nFirst check the distance from 0 to first lantern: 2 - 0 = 2. Then between 2 and 5, the gap is 3. The required d for that is 3/2 = 1.5. Then the distance from last lantern to end is 5 -5 = 0. So the maximum is 2. So the answer is 2. Which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nAnother example: the first sample input is 7 15, with lanterns at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. When sorted, they are [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. Then:\n\nFirst check 0 - 0 = 0. Then between 0 and 3, the gap is 3. So required d is 1.5. Between 3 and 5, gap is 2, required 1.0. Between 5 and 7, gap 2, required 1.0. Between 7 and 9, gap 2, required 1.0. Between 9 and 14, gap 5, required 2.5. Between 14 and 15, gap 1, required 0.5. Then the last part is 15-15=0. So the maximum is 2.5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort the list of a's.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as a[0] - 0.\n\nThen for i from 0 to n-2:\n\ncurrent_gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\ncurrent_required = current_gap / 2\n\nif current_required > max_d, update max_d.\n\nThen compute the last part: l - a[-1], compare with max_d.\n\nThe answer is max_d.\n\nBut wait, what if the lanterns are not covering the entire street? Like, if there's a gap between two lanterns that is larger than 2d, but the code checks for that. But according to the algorithm, the maximum of those gaps divided by two would be the required d.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, handling edge cases:\n\nCase 1: n=1. Then the lantern is at a[0]. The required d is max(a[0], l - a[0]).\n\nCase 2: All lanterns are at 0. Then the first part is 0, but the last part is l - 0 = l. So the required d is l.\n\nBut wait, if all lanterns are at 0, then the first lantern is at 0. The first part is 0 - 0 = 0. The gaps between consecutive lanterns are 0. So the max is between 0 and l - 0 = l. So the answer is l.\n\nWhich is correct because the lanterns can't cover beyond 0 + d. So to reach l, d must be l.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are at 0 and l. Then the first part is 0, the gap between them is l - 0, so required is (l)/2. The last part is 0. So the answer is l/2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nThe steps:\n\nRead n and l from input. Then read the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first element: a[0] - 0. So max_d is a[0].\n\nThen for each consecutive pair, compute the gap, divide by 2, compare with max_d.\n\nThen check l - a[-1], compare with max_d.\n\nBut wait, for the first step, the initial max_d is a[0] - 0? Or is it the maximum between the previous max_d and a[0]?\n\nWait, the first part is the distance from 0 to the first lantern. So the required d must be at least that. Because if the first lantern is at a[0], then the left end (0) is covered if d >= a[0]. Because the lantern's coverage starts at a[0] - d. So to cover 0, we need a[0] - d <= 0 => d >= a[0]. Similarly, the right end is covered if d >= l - a[-1].\n\nSo the initial max_d is a[0], then compare with the gaps, then compare with l - a[-1].\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, for example, if the first lantern is at 0, then the first part is 0, which is fine. So the code should work.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead list of a_i.\n\nSort a.\n\nCompute max_d = a[0]\n\nfor i in 0 to n-2:\n\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n    required = gap / 2.0\n\n    if required > max_d:\n\n        max_d = required\n\nthen check the end: end_part = l - a[-1]\n\nif end_part > max_d:\n\n    max_d = end_part\n\nreturn max_d.\n\nBut wait, what if n is zero? Well, according to the problem statement, n is at least 1. Because input constraints say 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut wait, in the input, the second line is n integers. So in code:\n\nRead n and l from first line.\n\nThen read the next line as list of integers.\n\nSort the list.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut what if the list is empty? No, n is at least 1.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 7 15, and the list is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. After sorting: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nmax_d starts as 0 (a[0] is 0).\n\nThen between 0 and 3: gap is 3, required 1.5. So max_d is 1.5.\n\nBetween 3 and 5: gap 2, required 1.0. No change.\n\nBetween 5 and 7: gap 2, required 1.0. No change.\n\nBetween 7 and 9: same, 1.0.\n\nBetween 9 and 14: gap is 5 → 2.5. Now max_d is 2.5.\n\nBetween 14 and 15: gap 1 → 0.5. No change.\n\nThen check end_part: l is 15, a[-1] is 15 → 15-15=0. So max_d remains 2.5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, l=5. a is [2,5]. sorted as [2,5].\n\nmax_d starts as 2 (a[0] is 2). Then check the gap between 2 and 5: 3 → 1.5. So max_d remains 2. Then end_part is 5 -5 =0. So answer is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=5, a=[3]. Then max_d is 3 (distance from 0 to 3). Then end_part is 5-3=2. So the max is 3. So answer is 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=5, a=[0]. Then the max_d is 0. end_part is 5-0=5. So answer is 5.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0,10]. Then the first part is 0, the gap between 0 and 10 is 10 → required 5. end_part is 0. So answer is 5. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input. But note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait the sample input shows two test cases. Wait the first input line is ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5'] — but that's probably a mistake in the way the sample is presented. Wait the original problem says:\n\nIn the input, the first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers. So each test case is two lines. The sample input shows two test cases, perhaps. But the user's code needs to read from stdin, which for programming competition problems usually has multiple test cases. Wait no, the problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait looking back:\n\nThe problem says, \"the first line contains two integers n, l...\" So the input is for a single test case. However, the sample shows two inputs, which probably represents two separate test cases. But in the problem's actual input, the user is supposed to read one test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe first line is ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting. But in reality, the problem's input is for one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases, but the output shows two outputs. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Wait, but the problem says that the input is for one test case. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nOriginal problem statement says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l... The next line contains n integers...\n\nSo the input is for one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. So maybe the sample input is given as two separate test cases, but the code should process one test case. So the code should read from stdin, which for programming competition problems is usually one test case. However, perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input. For example, perhaps the sample input is two test cases, and the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample input:\n\nThe first input line is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nSecond input line:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input is written as two separate test cases. But in the problem's original description, the input is for a single test case. Therefore, perhaps the sample input is written as two test cases, but the code should handle one test case. But that's conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as two lines, but perhaps the actual input is two test cases. But the problem says that the input is for one test case. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l... etc.\n\nSo the code should process one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. But perhaps that's a formatting error. For example, in the problem's sample input, perhaps the first test case is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nand the second test case is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nBut the problem's sample output shows two outputs. Therefore, the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nWait, but the problem's input format says that the first line contains n and l, then the next line contains the a_i. So, for multiple test cases, the code would need to read them all. But the problem's sample input shows two test cases, but the problem's description says that the code should process one. So this is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's input and output:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 1e9) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\nOutput:\n\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street.\n\nSo the input is for one test case. The sample shows two test cases, but perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting. However, the sample input and output are given as:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nSample Output:\n\n2.5000000000\n\n2.0000000000\n\nSo that suggests that the code should read multiple test cases. But how many?\n\nBut in the problem statement's input description, it's unclear. However, looking at the problem's original source (probably Codeforces), the problem is likely to have multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l, implying that it's one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases, which implies that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut this is a contradiction. However, looking at the original problem statement from Codeforces, perhaps the problem is from a contest where the input is multiple test cases. However, without knowing, perhaps the user provided the sample input as two test cases, and the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the first line is the first test case, then the second line is the second test case. But the problem's input format says that the first line is for one test case. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input's formatting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is given as two separate test cases, and the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. How to know?\n\nLooking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input shows two test cases, and the output shows two outputs. Therefore, the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the code should read until EOF. For example, in programming competitions, sometimes the code needs to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input may vary.\n\nBut the original problem statement's input may have multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the code should read one test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases. So there's a contradiction.\n\nBut the user's code needs to read from standard input and print to standard output. The problem's sample shows two test cases. Therefore, the code should read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first line is '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', which is the first test case. Then the second line is '2 5\\n2 5' — which is the second test case. So the code must read two test cases. But how does the code know how many test cases there are? Because in programming competition problems, sometimes the number of test cases is given in the first line. Otherwise, the code can read until EOF.\n\nBut the problem's input description doesn't mention that. So this is ambiguous.\n\nBut looking at the sample input, the first line is the first test case's n and l, the second line is the a_i for that test case. Then the third line is the next test case's n and l, and the fourth line is the a_i. So the code must read all test cases until EOF.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nIn Python, reading from stdin can be done via input() or sys.stdin. So perhaps the code should read lines until there are no more lines.\n\nBut for the problem's purposes, perhaps the code is supposed to handle one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases, and the sample output shows two outputs. Therefore, the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original input description may be wrong. However, given that the sample input and output have two test cases, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them?\n\nWell, in Python, perhaps the code can read all lines at once, split into tokens, and process them accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps the code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample shows two. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is written as:\n\nInput\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWhich seems to be two separate test cases. The output is two lines. So the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l, then the next line contains the a_i. So for each test case, two lines are provided. So the code must read multiple test cases until EOF.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all test cases.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nWell, in Python, the code can read all input lines as a list, then process them in pairs.\n\nBut for example, the input can be read as:\n\nimport sys\n\ndata = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n\nThen, the data is a list of integers. The first two integers are n and l for the first test case. Then the next n integers are the a_i. Then the next two integers are n and l for the next test case, etc.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nFor example, the sample input would be parsed as:\n\ndata = [7, 15, 15, 5, 3, 7, 9, 14, 0, 2, 5, 2, 5]\n\nThen, the first test case is n=7, l=15, then a_i is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. Then the next test case is n=2, l=5, a_i [2,5].\n\nSo the code can process this as follows:\n\nRead all data into a list. Then, process the data sequentially.\n\nInitialize a pointer at 0. While there are elements left:\n\nRead n and l from data[pointer], data[pointer+1], then pointer +=2.\n\nRead next n elements as the a_i list. pointer +=n.\n\nProcess the test case.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n\n    ptr = 0\n\n    while ptr < len(data):\n\n        n = data[ptr]\n\n        l = data[ptr + 1]\n\n        ptr +=2\n\n        a = data[ptr:ptr +n]\n\n        ptr +=n\n\n        # process this test case\n\n        # compute d and print\n\nBut then, for each test case, process as per the algorithm.\n\nBut the problem's sample input shows that the first test case has n=7, l=15, and the a list is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0], which when sorted becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nSo the code should process each test case.\n\nBut how to handle the output? For each test case, print the result with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo the code would generate for each test case the required d, then print it with 10 decimal digits.\n\nThus, the code structure would be:\n\nRead all data into a list.\n\nProcess each test case in turn.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle multiple test cases. But the problem's original input description may have been for a single test case, but the sample shows multiple. So the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut in the problem's original statement, perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. But given the sample input and output, the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut how can we know?\n\nWell, looking at the problem's original source. For example, the problem is likely from Codeforces. Let me check the original problem.\n\nUpon checking, the problem is \"Vanya and Lanterns\" from Codeforces Round #296 (Div. 2), problem C. According to the problem statement, the input consists of multiple test cases. Wait, no. Looking at the original problem's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 1e9). The next line contains n integers ai. So the input is for one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. That suggests that the sample input is written as two test cases, but the problem expects the code to process one test case. But that's conflicting.\n\nBut in programming competitions, the sample input may have multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process one. However, that's unlikely. It's more likely that the sample input is written with multiple test cases, but the problem expects the code to process one. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as two test cases, but the code is supposed to read one test case. But then, the sample output would have two outputs, which is not possible.\n\nThis is confusing. However, the user provided the sample input and output as follows:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should process multiple test cases. So the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code should read multiple test cases. So, the code will read all the data, process each test case as per the algorithm, and output the required d for each.\n\nSo, in Python, the code will read all the input as a list of integers, then process each test case.\n\nNow, implementing this.\n\nBut for the code, the user may have to read from stdin. So the code will be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n\n    ptr = 0\n\n    while ptr < len(data):\n\n        n = data[ptr]\n\n        l = data[ptr + 1]\n\n        ptr += 2\n\n        a = data[ptr:ptr + n]\n\n        ptr += n\n\n        # process a, n, l\n\n        a.sort()\n\n        max_d = a[0]\n\n        for i in range(n - 1):\n\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n            current = gap / 2.0\n\n            if current > max_d:\n\n                max_d = current\n\n        end_part = l - a[-1]\n\n        if end_part > max_d:\n\n            max_d = end_part\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the first lantern is not at zero? For example, if the first lantern is at position 3, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern is 3, which is the required d. Because the lantern's coverage must reach zero. So the code computes max_d as a[0], which is 3. Correct.\n\nBut what if the first lantern is at position 0? Then a[0] is zero, and the first part is zero. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about the case where the first lantern is at position 0, and the next is at 5. Then the first part is zero, the gap between 0 and 5 is 5 → required 2.5. Then the end_part depends on l.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, in the code above, the initial max_d is set to a[0], which is the distance from 0 to the first lantern. But that's correct. Because the first lantern's position is a[0], and the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0] - 0 = a[0]. So the required d must be at least this value.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the case where a[0] is zero, then the first part is zero. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample input for first test case:\n\nn=7, l=15, a = [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. After sorting, [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nmax_d starts as 0. Then the gaps between consecutive elements:\n\n3-0=3 → 1.5 → max_d is 1.5.\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0.\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0.\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5 → max_d now 2.5.\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5. No change.\n\nThen end_part is 15 -15=0 → max_d is 2.5.\n\nSo output is 2.5000000000.\n\nSecond test case: n=2, l=5, a=[2,5]. sorted as [2,5].\n\nmax_d starts as 2. Then gap between 2 and 5 is 3 → 1.5. No change. end_part is 5-5=0. So max_d is 2.0. Output is 2.0000000000.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=5, a=[3]. sorted [3]. max_d is 3. end_part is 5-3=2. So max_d is 3.0. Output is 3.0000000000.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=0. But according to input constraints, l is ≥1. So no.\n\nBut the code handles l=0? Well, according to the problem statement, l is ≥1.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle floating point numbers correctly. For example, when the required d is 2.5, the code prints it with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut in Python, when you format with .10f, it will show 10 decimal digits. For example, 2.5 becomes 2.5000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut what about the case where the street is length 0? According to the problem statement, l is at least 1. So no need to handle.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nBut the code needs to be written as a Python script that reads from stdin and writes to stdout. So the code will be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n\n    ptr = 0\n\n    while ptr < len(data):\n\n        n = data[ptr]\n\n        l = data[ptr + 1]\n\n        ptr += 2\n\n        a = data[ptr:ptr + n]\n\n        ptr += n\n\n        a.sort()\n\n        max_d = a[0]\n\n        for i in range(n-1):\n\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n            current = gap / 2.0\n\n            if current > max_d:\n\n                max_d = current\n\n        end_part = l - a[-1]\n\n        if end_part > max_d:\n\n            max_d = end_part\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nBut wait, what if n is zero? But according to the problem statement, n ≥ 1.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input.\n\nBut the sample input is given as two test cases. Let's see:\n\nSample input:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nWhen read as data, the data list is:\n\n[7, 15, 15, 5, 3, 7, 9, 14, 0, 2, 5, 2, 5]\n\nProcessing first test case:\n\nn=7, l=15.\n\na = [15,5,3,7,9,14,0] → sorted [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. max_d is 0, then process gaps.\n\nThen the code proceeds as before.\n\nSo the code should output the correct results.\n\nThus, this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns such that the entire street is illuminated. The solution involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and ensuring that both ends of the street are covered.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read all input data at once and parse it into a list of integers for easier processing.\n2. **Sorting**: Sort the positions of the lanterns to facilitate gap analysis between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Gap Analysis**: Calculate the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. The minimum radius required to cover this gap is half of the gap's length.\n4. **End Coverage Check**: Ensure that the start (0) and end (l) of the street are within the coverage of the nearest lanterns.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The required radius is determined by the maximum value among the initial segment from the start of the street to the first lantern, the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by two, and the segment from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n    ptr = 0\n    while ptr < len(data):\n        n = data[ptr]\n        l = data[ptr + 1]\n        ptr += 2\n        a = data[ptr:ptr + n]\n        ptr += n\n        a.sort()\n        max_d = a[0]\n        for i in range(n - 1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            current = gap / 2.0\n            if current > max_d:\n                max_d = current\n        end_part = l - a[-1]\n        if end_part > max_d:\n            max_d = end_part\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single block of text and split into a list of integers for efficient processing.\n2. **Sorting Lantern Positions**: Sorting the lantern positions allows us to easily compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Initial Coverage Check**: The distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern is checked to ensure coverage.\n4. **Gap Calculation**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the gap between them is calculated. The required radius to cover this gap is half the gap's length.\n5. **End Coverage Check**: The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (l) is checked to ensure coverage.\n6. **Output**: The maximum value from the initial check, gap calculations, and end check is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum radius required to illuminate the entire street, considering both the gaps between lanterns and the edges of the street.",
