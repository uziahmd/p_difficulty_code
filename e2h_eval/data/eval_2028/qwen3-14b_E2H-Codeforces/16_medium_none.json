Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum number of steps to move from a home block to a university block, moving through adjacent blocks. The adjacency is determined by sharing a nonzero boundary segment, which means that two blocks are adjacent if they are separated by exactly one road. \n\nFirst, let me understand the problem better. Each road divides the plane into regions. The blocks are these regions. The movement between blocks is allowed only if they share a common border of non-zero length. So, moving from one block to another requires crossing a road. But how do I model this?\n\nThe key idea here is that each block can be represented as a node in a graph, and edges exist between nodes if their corresponding blocks are adjacent. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home block to the university block. However, with n roads, the number of blocks could be very large (exponentially so, since each new road can potentially double the number of regions). So building the entire graph isn't feasible.\n\nBut there's another approach. Since each step involves crossing a road, maybe we can model the problem using the roads and determine which blocks are adjacent based on the roads. However, how do I represent the blocks?\n\nAlternatively, think about the parity of the regions. For example, each road divides the plane into two parts. If you imagine that each block is determined by the sign of the equations of the roads. Wait, but that's not exactly right. Because each road is a line, and the position of a point relative to the line determines which side it's on. So, for a given point (home or university), the position relative to each road can be determined. \n\nBut how does that relate to the blocks? Each block is determined by the set of signs of the equations for all roads. For example, if there are two roads, then each block is defined by being on one side of each road. But if two points are on the same side of all roads, they are in the same block. Wait, no. Because the roads can intersect, creating regions. So, the sign of each road's equation for a point determines which side of that road the point is on. So, two points are in the same block if and only if they have the same sign for all roads. \n\nBut wait, that's not necessarily true. Suppose there are two roads. If the point is on the same side of both roads, then it's in the same region. But if two points are in different regions but have the same sign for all roads, that's impossible. Because each road splits the plane into two. So, the combination of signs for each road determines the region. Therefore, the region (block) can be uniquely identified by the sign vector of the point with respect to each road. \n\nSo, for the home and university positions, we can compute their sign vectors. Then, the problem becomes: find the minimal number of steps (crossing roads) needed to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector, where each step changes exactly one sign (since crossing a road flips the sign of that road's equation). But wait, that might not be accurate. Because when you cross a road, you change the sign of exactly one road. However, the adjacency between blocks is determined by sharing a common boundary. Which would mean that two blocks are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because crossing that road would take you from one region to another. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if two regions differ in exactly one road's sign, then they are separated by that road, hence adjacent. If they differ in more than one road's sign, then there's no direct adjacency. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of sign changes needed to transform the home's sign vector into the university's sign vector, where each step flips exactly one sign (i.e., each step corresponds to crossing a road).\n\nBut how does that work? Let's think of each block as a node in a graph, where each node is represented by a binary vector (for each road, whether the point is on the positive or negative side). Two nodes are connected if their vectors differ in exactly one bit. Then, the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal number of bit flips needed to go from the home's vector to the university's vector, with each step flipping one bit. \n\nBut that's exactly the Hamming distance between the two vectors. Because the minimal number of steps is the Hamming distance. However, that's only if the two vectors differ in k bits, then the minimal steps is k. Because each step can flip one bit. \n\nBut wait, that seems too simple. Let me test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Roads are 2: 0x +1y +0 =0 (i.e., y=0) and 1x +0y +0 =0 (x=0). \n\nFor the home point (1,1):\n\nCheck each road:\n\nFirst road: 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1>0 → sign is positive.\n\nSecond road: 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1>0 → positive. So the home's sign vector is [1, 1].\n\nUniversity point (-1,-1):\n\nFirst road: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → sign is negative.\n\nSecond road: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1 <0 → negative. So the sign vector is [-1, -1]. \n\nThe Hamming distance between [1,1] and [-1,-1] is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2. \n\nAnother sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, x + y -3 =0. \n\nLet's check the sign vectors.\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nRoad 1: x=0 → 1>0 → +1.\n\nRoad 2: y=0 → 1>0 → +1.\n\nRoad 3: x + y -3 = 1 +1 -3 = -1 <0 → -1. So home's vector is [1, 1, -1].\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nRoad 1: x=0 → -1 <0 → -1.\n\nRoad 2: y=0 → -1 <0 → -1.\n\nRoad 3: (-1) + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → -1. So the university's vector is [-1, -1, -1]. \n\nThe Hamming distance between the two vectors is 2 (the first two elements differ). So the answer is 2, which matches the sample. \n\nSo this approach seems to work for the samples. So the problem reduces to computing the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and university points. \n\nBut why is that correct? Because each step allows you to cross a road, which flips the sign of exactly one road. So, each step changes exactly one element in the sign vector. Therefore, the minimal steps needed is the number of positions where the sign vectors differ. \n\nBut wait, what if there are overlapping roads? For example, suppose two roads are parallel. But the problem states that no two roads are the same. However, they can be parallel. But even so, the sign vector approach still holds. Because each road is considered independently. \n\nSo, the solution is to compute for each road, the sign of the home point and the sign of the university point. For each road, if the signs are different, that contributes 1 to the Hamming distance. The total is the minimal steps required.\n\nBut why is this correct? Because each differing sign indicates that the home and university are on opposite sides of that road. To get from home to university, you need to cross that road. But how does that relate to the minimal steps?\n\nWait, suppose that the home and university differ in k roads. Then, you need to cross each of those roads once. But how can you cross them? Because crossing a road changes your sign for that road. So, the minimal steps would be exactly the number of differing roads. Because each step crosses one road. \n\nBut why can't there be a scenario where you have to cross a road multiple times? For example, if the home and university differ in two roads, but you need to cross one road twice. But that's not possible. Because crossing a road once changes the sign. If you cross it again, you change it back. So, if you have to go from a sign vector to another, you can't have a shorter path than the Hamming distance. Because each step can only flip one bit. So the minimal steps is exactly the Hamming distance. \n\nTherefore, the solution is to compute for each road, whether the home and university are on opposite sides. The count of such roads is the answer. \n\nWait, but how do we check if the home and university are on opposite sides of a road?\n\nFor a road ax + by + c =0, the sign of ax + by + c for the home point and the university point. If they have different signs, then the two points are on opposite sides of the road. So for each road, compute the value of ax + by + c for home and for university. If their product is negative, then they are on opposite sides. \n\nBut the problem says that neither home nor university lies on any road. So the value for home and university for each road is non-zero. So, for each road, compute (a*x1 + b*y1 + c) * (a*x2 + b*y2 + c). If this product is negative, then the two points are on opposite sides of that road. \n\nThe answer is the number of roads where this product is negative. \n\nWait, but that's a very simple solution. Let me check the sample input again.\n\nSample 1: two roads. \n\nHome (1,1): for first road (0,1,0) → 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1. For university (-1,-1) → 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. Product is 1 * -1 = -1 <0. So this road contributes 1. For second road (1,0,0): home gives 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. University gives 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1. Product is -1. So again contributes 1. Total is 2. Correct. \n\nSample 2: three roads. \n\nHome (1,1) and university (-1,-1). \n\nFirst road (1,0,0) → home: 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. University: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1. product negative → count 1.\n\nSecond road (0,1,0): same as above. product negative → count 1.\n\nThird road (1,1,-3). For home: 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1. For university: 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -2-3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0. So no contribution. So total is 2. Which is correct. \n\nSo the answer is indeed the count of roads where home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nThis seems to be the case. Therefore, the problem reduces to simply counting how many roads have the home and university points on opposite sides. \n\nBut why is that the case? Because each such road represents a step that needs to be crossed. Because the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university. \n\nBut how does that relate to the blocks? Let me think. The home and university are in two different blocks. The minimal steps required to move between them is the number of roads that separate them. Because each time you cross a road, you move into a new block. But how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses exactly those roads?\n\nWell, the problem is equivalent to considering the graph where each node is a block, and edges exist between blocks that are separated by exactly one road. Then, the minimal steps between home and university is the minimal number of roads that separate them. \n\nBut how can that be? Because the minimal path would be to cross each separating road once. So, if the home and university are separated by k roads, then the minimal steps is k. \n\nBut how to confirm that? Let's think of a scenario where two points are separated by two roads. For example, imagine two perpendicular roads. The home is in one quadrant, the university in the opposite quadrant. They are separated by two roads. So, the minimal steps is 2. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example: suppose there are three roads, and the home and university are separated by two roads. Then, the minimal steps is 2. \n\nSo, the conclusion is that the answer is the number of roads that separate the home and university. \n\nThis approach is very efficient. For each road, we compute the sign of the home and university. If they differ, increment the count. \n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead home (x1, y1), university (x2, y2), n, then n lines of a, b, c.\n\nFor each road, compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c, val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. \n\nIf val1 * val2 < 0 → count +=1.\n\nFinally, output count.\n\nBut wait, why is this correct? Because each road that separates the home and university must be crossed once. And the minimal steps is exactly the number of such roads. \n\nYes. Because each step allows crossing one road. So, if there are k roads separating them, then you need at least k steps. And there exists a path that crosses each of these roads once, so the minimal steps is exactly k. \n\nThis seems to be the case. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, let's test for some edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: No roads. Then, home and university are in the same block. So answer is 0.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, n can be 1. But the input says n can be 1. So for example, if n is 0? Wait, no, the third line of input is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). Wait, no. Looking back at the input description:\n\nThird line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). So n is at least 1. So the case where there are no roads is not possible. \n\nBut the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So, if there are no roads, then they are in the same block. But according to the input constraints, n is ≥1. So the code doesn't have to handle that case.\n\nAnother Edge Case: home and university are on the same side of all roads. Then answer is 0. \n\nAnother Edge Case: home and university are separated by exactly one road. Answer is 1.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows.\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nInitialize count = 0.\n\nFor each a, b, c:\n\ncompute val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\nval2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\nif val1 * val2 < 0 → count +=1\n\nAt the end, print count.\n\nWait, but why is this the case? Because each road that separates the home and university is a step that must be crossed. But why is there a path that crosses each of these roads once? Because the roads are arranged such that you can cross them in any order. \n\nBut perhaps there's a scenario where two roads are not crossing each other, but the home and university are on opposite sides of both. For example, two parallel roads. Suppose home is on one side of both, and university is on the other side of both. Then, the count is 2. But how to cross between them? Well, you can cross one road, then cross the other. But since the roads are parallel, crossing one road would take you into a region between the two roads. Then crossing the second road would take you to the other side. So the minimal steps is 2, which is correct. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nSo the Python code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the input lines. For each of the two points, compute the values for each road, check the product. \n\nNow, code:\n\nRead x1, y1 from first line.\n\nRead x2, y2 from second line.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines of a, b, c.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each road:\n\n    a, b, c = ... \n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes. That's the code. \n\nLet me check the sample input again.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput lines:\n\nFirst input is:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nProcessing:\n\nFor first road (0,1,0):\n\nval1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1.\n\nval2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road (1,0,0):\n\nval1 = 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1.\n\nval2 = 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 → product -1 → count +=1. total 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0 → road 1\n\n0 1 0 → road 2\n\n1 1 -3 → road3\n\nFor road1: val1 = 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 = 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nroad2: same as road1. count becomes 2.\n\nroad3: val1 = 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1. val2 = 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0. no increment. total is 2. Correct.\n\nThus, the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, what about if a road is such that home is on one side, and the university is on the same side? Then, no increment. \n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the problem is solved with this approach. \n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nNeed to read from stdin. The input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the example input:\n\nThe first example input is given as a list of strings. But the actual input is read from stdin. The first line is the home coordinates, then the second line is university, then n, then n lines of a, b, c. \n\nBut in the sample input given, the first example is:\n\nInput:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nBut that's probably a way to represent two separate test cases. However, in the actual problem, the input is read as per the following:\n\nThe first line is x1 y1.\n\nSecond line is x2 y2.\n\nThird line is n.\n\nThen n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo, the code should read from standard input. So, in Python, read all lines, split into parts.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps read via input() or sys.stdin.\n\nBut for multiple test cases? Wait, the problem says that the input is as per the given format. So the code needs to process a single test case. \n\nWait, the example shows two different inputs and outputs. But that's probably for two separate test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin. So the code should read one test case per run. \n\nSo the code will read:\n\nRead first line: x1, y1.\n\nRead second line: x2, y2.\n\nRead third line: n.\n\nThen read n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes. That's the code. \n\nBut wait, what about the data types? For example, the values can be up to 1e6 * 1e6 * 3? Well, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily big. So no problem.\n\nBut the code is correct. \n\nSo this is the solution.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves crossing a road, and the movement is allowed only if the blocks share a common boundary segment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The city is divided into regions (blocks) by infinite line roads. Each block is defined by the sign of the equation of each road relative to a point. The key insight is that two points (home and university) are in different blocks if they lie on opposite sides of a road.\n2. **Sign Check**: For each road, check if the home and university points lie on opposite sides. This can be determined by evaluating the sign of the linear equation for both points. If their signs differ, the points are on opposite sides of that road.\n3. **Counting Steps**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and university points.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university points are read first, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n2. **Evaluating Road Equations**: For each road, compute the value of the linear equation at both the home and university points.\n3. **Checking Opposite Sides**: If the product of the values from the home and university points for a road is negative, it indicates that the points lie on opposite sides of that road. This road must be crossed to move between the blocks, so we increment the count.\n4. **Output Result**: The count of such roads gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
