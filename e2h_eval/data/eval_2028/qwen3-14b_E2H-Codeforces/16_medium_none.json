Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Crazy Town problem. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving across a common border between blocks. \n\nSo, the main idea here is that each block is a region divided by the roads (lines). Moving between blocks requires that they share a common boundary segment, not just a point. So, the key is to model this as a graph where each node represents a block, and edges exist between blocks that share a common boundary. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home block to the university block.\n\nBut how do I represent the blocks? Since there are potentially an infinite number of blocks, but the number of roads is up to 300, maybe there's a smarter way. Wait, but for each road, the blocks are separated by it. However, considering that each line divides the plane into two parts. But with multiple lines, the regions can be complex. \n\nBut here's a thought: For any given point (like home or university), the position relative to each road can be determined. Each road splits the plane into two half-planes. So, the block that contains a point can be uniquely determined by the signs of the evaluations of all roads at that point. For example, for each road equation a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0, the point (x,y) will be on one side or the other. So, the sign of a_i x + b_i y + c_i determines which side of the road the point is on. \n\nNow, two blocks are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because if two blocks differ in exactly one road, then their common boundary is that road. Because changing the sign of one road implies that the two regions are separated by that road. However, if they differ in more than one road's sign, then they might not share a common boundary. \n\nWait, but how can two regions share a boundary? For example, if two regions differ in exactly one road's sign, then they are adjacent across that road. If they differ in two roads' signs, maybe they are separated by two roads, but perhaps not adjacent. \n\nTherefore, the adjacency between blocks can be determined by whether their sign vectors differ in exactly one position. \n\nBut how do I model this? Well, the problem is that the number of possible sign vectors could be 2^n, which is way too big for n=300. That's impossible. So, how can we model this?\n\nBut wait, the home and university points are fixed. So, perhaps we don't need to model all possible blocks, but only the ones that are reachable from the home block through adjacent steps. But even that seems challenging. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a BFS traversal where each state is the sign vector of the current block. But with n=300, the state space is 2^300, which is impossible. \n\nHmm, so that approach is not feasible. There must be another way. \n\nLet me think again. The key is that moving from one block to another requires crossing a single road. So, the minimal steps between two blocks is the minimal number of roads that you need to cross to get from the home to the university. \n\nWait, but how does that relate to the sign differences? Let me think. Suppose that the home is in a block S, and the university is in block T. Let's consider the sign vectors of S and T. Each sign vector is a sequence of +1 or -1 for each road. The minimal number of steps between S and T would be the minimal number of roads that differ between the two sign vectors, but with some constraints. \n\nWait, no. Because each step allows you to change exactly one sign. Because when you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road. So, if the home's sign vector is H and the university's is U, then the minimal number of steps is the Hamming distance between H and U. Because each step flips exactly one bit. But wait, that's only if the Hamming distance is the minimal number of steps. But is that correct?\n\nWait, suppose that H and U differ in k roads. Then, each step can flip one road's sign. So, the minimal steps would be k. But is that always possible? Because flipping each differing road once would take k steps. However, the problem is that when you flip a road's sign, you have to cross that road. But maybe there's a dependency between the roads. For example, if two roads are parallel, then flipping one's sign doesn't affect the other. But if roads intersect, then flipping one road's sign may require crossing it, but that's allowed. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the movement is allowed if the blocks share a common border. Which would happen when their sign vectors differ in exactly one road. Therefore, the minimal steps between the home and the university would be the number of roads where the sign differs between the two points. Because each such differing road can be crossed once, and each crossing changes the sign of that road. \n\nWait, but that's only true if the home and university's sign vectors differ in exactly k roads, and each step can flip one of them. So, the minimal steps would be k. \n\nBut how to compute k? Let me think. For each road, evaluate the sign of home point and the sign of the university point. If they are different, then that road is part of the path. So, the total number of differing roads is the minimal steps. \n\nWait, but why is that the case? Let me take an example. \n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are two roads: 0x+1y+0=0 (i.e., y=0) and 1x+0y+0=0 (x=0). \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nFor first road (y=0): 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1 >0 → sign +.\n\nFor second road (x=0): 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1>0 → sign +.\n\nSo home's sign vector is (+, +).\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nFor first road: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → sign -.\n\nFor second road: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → sign -.\n\nSo the university's sign vector is (-, -). \n\nThe differing roads are both roads. So the Hamming distance is 2. The sample output is 2. Which matches. \n\nIn the second example, the input is:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nx=0: 1>0 → +\n\ny=0: 1>0 → +\n\nx+y-3 = 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → -.\n\nSign vector: (+, +, -).\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nx=0: -1 <0 → -.\n\ny=0: -1 <0 → -.\n\nx+y-3 = -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → -.\n\nSo the sign vector is (-, -, -). \n\nComparing with home's vector, the first two roads differ. So Hamming distance is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2. \n\nSo this seems to hold. \n\nSo the answer is the number of roads where the sign of the home and university points differ. \n\nWait, that's a very simple solution. How can that be? Because the problem says that you can move between blocks if they share a common border. So each step corresponds to crossing a road. So the minimal steps required is the number of roads that separate the home and university. \n\nBut how to verify this? Let's think of another example. Suppose that home and university differ in three roads. Then, according to this logic, the answer is 3. But is there a path that requires only 3 steps?\n\nYes. Because each step can cross a road. For example, each time you cross a road, you flip its sign. So, if you have to flip three roads, then you need three steps. \n\nBut why can't there be a shorter path? Because each step can only flip one road's sign. So, if the Hamming distance is k, then you need at least k steps. And since each step can flip one, you can reach the target in k steps. \n\nTherefore, the answer is the number of roads where the sign of the home and university points differ. \n\nSo the problem reduces to: for each road, compute the sign of the home point and the sign of the university point. If they are different, increment the count. The answer is this count. \n\nWait, but why is that? How does this account for the actual regions? Because the home and university are in different regions, and each differing road represents a boundary that needs to be crossed. \n\nBut how can that be? Let's think of a scenario where two points are on opposite sides of a single road. Then, the answer is 1. Which makes sense. If they are on the same side of a road, then that road is not a barrier between them. \n\nBut what if there are multiple roads that separate them. For example, imagine that the home and university are separated by two roads. Then, the minimal steps would be 2. Which would be crossing each road once. \n\nBut why can't there be a situation where the Hamming distance is k, but the minimal steps is less than k? \n\nFor example, suppose that there are two roads. Suppose that the home is in a region where both signs are positive. The university is in a region where both signs are negative. Then, the Hamming distance is 2. But can you cross one road, then cross another? Well, yes. But the minimal steps is 2. \n\nSo, the answer is indeed the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the two points. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of roads where the sign of the home and the university differ. \n\nThis is a very simple solution. But why is this the case? Because the regions are defined by the arrangement of the roads, and the minimal steps between two regions is the number of roads that separate them. \n\nBut how can we be sure that this is always the case? Let's think of a scenario where two points are separated by two roads, but there's a path that crosses one road twice. But that's not possible because crossing a road once changes the sign, and crossing it again would change it back. But that would not help in getting to the target. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps is indeed the Hamming distance. \n\nThus, the approach is: \n\nFor each road, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). Check if their signs are different. If they are, increment the count. \n\nBut wait, the sign of the home and the university for that road. \n\nBut since the home and university are not on any road, their values are non-zero. So, for each road, we can compute the sign for home and for university. \n\nIf the signs are different, then that road is a separator between the two points. So, the count of such roads is the answer. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1), university (x2, y2), n roads. For each road, compute s1 = a_i *x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i, s2 = a_i *x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i. If s1 * s2 < 0, then increment the count. \n\nThe answer is this count. \n\nBut wait, let's test this against the sample inputs. \n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are 0x +1y +0=0 and 1x +0y +0=0. \n\nFor first road: s1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1. s2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 <0 → count +=1. \n\nSecond road: s1 = 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. s2 = 1*(-1) +0*(-1)+0 = -1. product is -1 <0 → count +=1. Total is 2. Which matches the sample. \n\nSecond sample input: home (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: \n\nRoad 1: 1x +0y +0 =0 → x=0. \n\ns1 = 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. s2 = 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 → count +=1. \n\nRoad 2: 0x +1y +0=0 → y=0. Same as above. product is -1 → count +=1. \n\nRoad 3: 1x +1y -3 =0. \n\ns1 = 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1. \n\ns2 = 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -2-3 = -5. \n\nproduct is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0 → no increment. \n\nTotal count is 2. Which matches the sample. \n\nSo this approach works for the samples. \n\nAnother test case: suppose that home and university are separated by 0 roads. Then, the answer is 0. Which is correct. \n\nAnother case: suppose that home and university are separated by one road. Then answer is 1. \n\nBut why is that correct? Because the two points are on opposite sides of that road. So, the minimal steps is 1. \n\nBut what if there are two roads that are parallel, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both. Then, the answer would be 2. But in reality, the two roads are parallel. So, the home and university are in regions that are separated by two roads. But how can you cross them? Well, each step requires crossing a road. So, you need to cross both roads. \n\nSo, the answer is indeed 2. \n\nThus, this approach seems to work. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. \n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nFor each road:\n\nCompute val1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i.\n\nCompute val2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i.\n\nIf val1 * val2 < 0 → increment count.\n\nFinally, output count.\n\nWait, but why is this the case? Because each road that has different signs for the two points is a separator between them. So, the minimal steps is the number of such roads. \n\nBut why can't there be a case where two points are separated by two roads, but there's a path that crosses one road once and another road once, but the minimal steps is 2. Which is exactly the count. \n\nSo this approach is correct. \n\nSo this problem is actually a trick question. It's not about BFS or anything complicated, but just checking for each road whether the two points are on opposite sides. \n\nThat's really surprising, but the sample inputs confirm it. \n\nSo the code is easy to implement. \n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases. \n\nWhat if n is zero? According to the input constraints, n is at least 1. No, wait, the third line says n is between 1 and 300. Wait, no. The input says:\n\nThird line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). So n can't be zero. So no problem. \n\nAnother case: when a road is such that val1 and val2 are same sign. So, it's not counted. \n\nAnother case: when val1 is positive and val2 is positive. So, same sign. \n\nBut what if val1 is positive and val2 is zero? Well, the problem says that the university is not on any road. So val2 can't be zero. Similarly for val1. \n\nSo, the code can safely compute val1 and val2, and check if their product is negative. \n\nSo, in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input.\n\nRead x2, y2 from input.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines of a, b, c.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each a, b, c in roads:\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but why is that correct? Because each road that separates the two points contributes to the count. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. \n\nLet me check the sample input again. \n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput is:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nSo for each road:\n\nFirst road: 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1. 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. 1*-1 = -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1. 1*-1 +0*-1 +0 = -1. 1*-1 = -1 <0 → count +=1. Total 2. \n\nWhich matches the sample output. \n\nSecond sample input:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0 → x=0\n\n0 1 0 → y=0\n\n1 1 -3 → x + y -3 =0\n\nFor the first two roads, same as before. \n\nThird road:\n\nval1 = 1*1 + 1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1.\n\nval2 = 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 = -5. \n\nproduct is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0 → no count. So total 2. \n\nWhich matches the sample. \n\nSo the code works. \n\nSo this is the solution. \n\nNow, implement this in Python. \n\nRead the input. \n\nBut note that the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, the user provided the input as a list of strings. But in the problem statement, the input is read from stdin. \n\nWait, the original problem says that the input is given via standard input. So the code should read from stdin. \n\nBut in the example, the input is given as a list of strings. For example, the first example input is:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nBut that's probably for testing purposes. \n\nBut in the actual code, the code needs to read from stdin. \n\nSo, the code should read the first line as x1, y1. Second line as x2, y2. Third line as n. Then n lines of a, b, c. \n\nSo, in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the first two lines. \n\nBut how to handle multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input, the first example has two test cases. But the problem says that the input is given as per the problem description. \n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains two integers x1, y1.\n\nSecond line contains two integers x2, y2.\n\nThird line contains n.\n\nThen n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i. \n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases. However, the problem says that the code should process one test case. Because the input is given as per the problem statement. \n\nWait, the sample input shows two examples, but the actual code should read one test case. For example, the first input is:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nSample Output 1: 2\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nSample Output 2: 2\n\nBut the user provided the input as a list of strings, perhaps for testing. But in the actual code, the code should read from stdin. \n\nSo, the code needs to read from stdin. So, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nBut wait, that's the code. \n\nBut let's check if that's correct. \n\nYes. \n\nBut why? Because the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So val1 and val2 are non-zero. So their product can't be zero. \n\nThus, the code is correct. \n\nSo this is the solution. \n\nBut why did the problem seem so complex? Because the initial problem description makes you think of BFS over regions, but the actual solution is much simpler. \n\nSo, the code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving across a common boundary between two adjacent blocks.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road divides the plane into two half-planes. If two points (home and university) lie on opposite sides of a road, that road acts as a boundary between their respective blocks. The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equivalent to the number of roads that separate these two points.\n\nTo determine if a road separates the two points, we evaluate the sign of the linear equation of the road at both points.
