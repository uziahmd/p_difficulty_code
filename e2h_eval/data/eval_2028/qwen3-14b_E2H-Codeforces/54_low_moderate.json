Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding three vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And then output those three vertices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the angles in a regular polygon work. Let me think. In a regular n-gon, each interior angle is (n-2)*180/n degrees. But wait, that's the angle of the polygon itself. However, the problem here is about angles formed by three vertices, where the vertex is the middle one. \n\nWait, for example, in a triangle (n=3), the only possible angle you can form is the internal angle of 60 degrees. For a square (n=4), when you pick three vertices, like adjacent ones, the angle is 90 degrees. But if you take vertices that are not adjacent, like in a square, selecting vertices 1, 2, 4 would form a right angle? Or maybe not. Wait, maybe I should think about the central angles and how the angles formed by three vertices relate to the number of sides between them.\n\nLet me think about how to calculate the angle at v2. Suppose we have a regular polygon with n sides. Let's consider three points v1, v2, v3, where v2 is the vertex of the angle. The angle at v2 depends on how many steps away v1 and v3 are from v2 along the perimeter. \n\nFor example, in a regular polygon, if you take two adjacent vertices to v2, then the angle is the internal angle of the polygon. But if you take vertices further apart, the angle changes. \n\nWait, here's an idea: For a regular polygon, the measure of the angle formed at v2 by two other vertices depends on the number of edges between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3. But since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle is determined by how many steps apart the points are. \n\nLet me think of the regular polygon inscribed in a circle. All the vertices lie on a circle. So, the angle at v2 would be related to the arcs between the points. \n\nIn a circle, the central angle corresponding to an arc between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. For example, in a square, it's 90 degrees. \n\nNow, if we have three points v1, v2, v3 on the circle, with v2 as the vertex. The angle at v2 is an inscribed angle. Wait, but the angle formed by two chords meeting at v2. The measure of that angle depends on the arcs opposite to it. \n\nLet me recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends. But in this case, the angle at v2 is formed by two chords: v2v1 and v2v3. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 would determine the angle. Wait, no. Wait, if you have a triangle inscribed in a circle, the angle at a vertex is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it. \n\nBut in our case, the angle at v2 is formed by two points v1 and v3. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 would be the arc that's opposite to the angle. Let me think again. Suppose that between v1 and v3, there are k steps (edges) along the perimeter. Then the arc length is k*(360/n) degrees. The angle at v2 would be half of that arc? Or is it something else?\n\nWait, no. Because if you have a regular polygon, and you take three points where v2 is the middle point. Let me take an example. For a square (n=4). Let's take v1 as 1, v2 as 2, v3 as 3. The angle at 2 is 90 degrees. The arc between v1 and v3 is 2 steps (from 1 to 3), which is 2*90 = 180 degrees. The angle at v2 is 90 degrees, which is half of 180. That matches. \n\nAnother example: in a square, if we take v1 as 1, v2 as 2, and v3 as 4. The angle at 2 would be... Well, the arc between 1 and 4 that doesn't include v2 is 3 steps (from 1 to 4 clockwise?), but wait the arc that's opposite to the angle. Wait, perhaps the angle is half the measure of the arc that is opposite to it. \n\nIn this case, the angle at v2 is formed by the points v1 and v3. The arc between v1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at the middle vertex is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently calculating the closest possible angle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Angles in Regular Polygons**: In a regular n-gon inscribed in a circle, each central angle between adjacent vertices is $ \\frac{360}{n} $ degrees. The angle formed at a vertex by two other vertices depends on the number of steps between these vertices along the perimeter.\n2. **Angle Calculation**: For a given vertex $ v2 $, the angle formed by vertices $ v1 $ and $ v3 $ can be determined by the number of steps $ k $ between $ v1 $ and $ v3 $ around the polygon. The angle at $ v2 $ is calculated as $ \\frac{(k-1) \\times 180}{n} $.\n3. **Finding Closest Angle**: We iterate through possible values of $ k $ to find the angle closest to `a`. The optimal value of $ k $ is derived from the formula $ k = \\text{round} \\left( \\frac{a \\times n}{180} \\right) $, ensuring we check both the closest integer values for precision.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # The angle at vertex v2 is determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3\n    # The formula for the angle is (k-1) * 180 / n, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3\n    # We want to find k such that this angle is as close as possible to a\n    \n    # Since the minimal angle is when k=2 (adjacent vertices), which gives 180/n degrees\n    # The maximal angle is when k = n-1, giving (n-2)*180/n degrees\n    \n    # The optimal k is around (a * n) / 180\n    k = round((a * n) / 180)\n    # But we need to clamp k between 2 and n-1\n    k = max(2, min(n - 1, k))\n    \n    # Now, we need to choose v1, v2, v3 such that there are k steps between v1 and v3\n    # Let's pick v2 as 1, then v1 as 2, and v3 as (2 + k) mod n, but need to adjust for 1-based indexing\n    # For example, if k=2, then v1 is 2, v3 is 3 (since 2 steps from 2 would be 3)\n    # So for v2 = 1, v1 is 2, v3 is 1 + k\n    # But need to ensure that v3 is within the range [1, n]\n    \n    # Choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, v3 as 1 + k\n    # However, since the polygon is circular, if 1 + k exceeds n, wrap around\n    # But since k ranges from 2 to n-1, 1 + k can be up to n, so it's safe\n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = 1 + k\n    if v3 > n:\n        v3 = v3 - n\n    \n    # But wait, for k steps between v1 and v3, if v1 is 2 and v3 is 1 + k, then the number of steps between them is k - 1?\n    # No, because the steps between v1 and v3 should be k steps.

The formula for this angle is $ \\frac{m \\times 180}{n} $.\n- **Optimal Steps**: We calculate the optimal number of steps $ m $ by rounding the value $ \\frac{a \\times n}{180} $, ensuring it lies within valid bounds.\n- **Vertex Selection**: By selecting $ v2 $ as the first vertex, $ v1 $ as the next vertex, and $ v3 $ based on the calculated steps $ m $, we ensure the angle is as close as possible to the given angle $ a $.
