Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two main things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left. All elements on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all other elements must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check that all elements not on either diagonal are the same. Let's call this 'o_char'.\n3. Ensure that d_char is not equal to o_char.\n\nBut how to check these?\n\nFirst, let's think about how to iterate through the diagonals.\n\nFor the main diagonal, the positions are (i, i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nFor the anti-diagonal, the positions are (i, n-1 -i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nBut since n is odd, the two diagonals intersect at the center cell. So that cell is part of both diagonals. But when checking, we need to make sure that all elements in both diagonals are the same. So for example, if the main diagonal has all 'x's and the anti-diagonal has all 'x's, then that's okay.\n\nBut for the non-diagonal elements, they must all be the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo, first, collect all the characters from both diagonals. Then check that all of them are the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check they are same and different.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think. For each cell (i,j) in the grid, check if it is on either diagonal. If yes, check if it's equal to the diagonal character. If not, check if it's equal to the other character.\n\nBut how to find the diagonal characters?\n\nLet me think. Let's first get the set of characters from the diagonals. Since all of them must be the same, the set should have exactly one element. Similarly for the non-diagonal elements.\n\nBut perhaps the first step is to check that all elements on the diagonals are the same. Let's take the first element of the main diagonal (0,0) as the reference. Then check that all elements on both diagonals are equal to this reference.\n\nWait, but what if the anti-diagonal has a different character than the main diagonal? For example, if the main diagonal is all 'x's and the anti-diagonal is all 'y's. Then the condition fails. So the first step is to check that all elements on both diagonals are the same.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n- Collect all the elements on both diagonals. Check that all of them are the same. Let's say that value is d_char.\n\nThen, collect all the elements not on the diagonals. Check that all of them are the same and different from d_char.\n\nBut how to collect those elements?\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\nif i == j or i + j == n - 1 → part of diagonals.\n\nElse → part of non-diagonals.\n\nSo, for each cell, check whether it is part of the diagonals or not.\n\nSo, the plan:\n\nRead the grid.\n\nCheck that all elements on the diagonals are same.\n\nCheck that all non-diagonal elements are same and different from the diagonal's.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about code structure.\n\nFirst, read n, then read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen:\n\n- For the diagonals:\n\nInitialize d_char as the first element (0,0). Then for each cell in the diagonals, check if it's equal to d_char. If any is not, then return NO.\n\nBut wait, what if the first element is part of both diagonals? Well, for example, in a 3x3 grid, the center cell (1,1) is part of both. But the first element (0,0) is part of main diagonal. The anti-diagonal starts at (0,2), then (1,1), then (2,0). So, for the first cell (0,0), it's part of the main diagonal. So the first element is part of the",
