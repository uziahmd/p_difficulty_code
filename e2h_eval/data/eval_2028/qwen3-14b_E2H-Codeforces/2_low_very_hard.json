Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1), and the anti-diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). But since n is odd, these two diagonals intersect at the center cell. So, all cells on both diagonals must be the same. So, first, I need to check that all elements on the two diagonals are the same. Also, the non-diagonal elements must all be the same, but different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all elements on the two diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check that all elements not on the diagonals are the same, and that they are different from 'd_char'.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nFirst, collect all the diagonal elements. For each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell in the grid, check if it's on either of these diagonals.\n\nSo for all cells, we can iterate through each cell and check if it's on a diagonal. Then collect the characters of the diagonals and check they are all the same. Then collect the non-diagonal characters and check they are all the same and different from the diagonal's.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the two diagonals must have the same letters. So all elements on both diagonals must be same. So for example, if the main diagonal has 'x' and the anti-diagonal has 'x' as well, then that's okay. But if the main diagonal has 'x' and the anti has 'y', then it's invalid.\n\nSo first step: collect all the characters on the diagonals. Then check that all of them are the same. Then check that all non-diagonal characters are same and different from that.\n\nSo let's proceed.\n\nFirst, for each cell in the grid:\n\nFor each row i, column j:\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1: it's part of the diagonal.\n\nElse: part of non-diagonal.\n\nSo, collect all diagonal characters into a set. If the size of that set is not 1, then return NO.\n\nSimilarly, collect all non-diagonal characters into another set. If the size is not 1, return NO.\n\nThen, check that the two sets are different. If they are same, then also return NO.\n\nBut wait, the non-diagonal characters must be same as each other, but different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo:\n\nLet me code this:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string of length n.\n\nThen:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in 0 to n-1:\n\n    for j in 0 to n-1:\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen, check if len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1.\n\nIf not, then output NO.\n\nElse, check that diagonal_chars and non_diagonal_chars are different. If they are different, then YES else NO.\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, when n is 1? But the problem says n is at least 3. So for n=3, there are 9 cells. The diagonals have 3 + 3 -1 (since the center is counted twice) = 5 cells. So non-diagonal is 4 cells. So for n >=3, non_diagonal is not empty. So the code should be okay.\n\nBut let's think about the example given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nThe diagonals are positions where i=j or i+j",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The criteria are that all elements on both diagonals of the grid must be the same, and all other elements (those not on the diagonals) must be the same but different from the diagonal elements.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Diagonal and Non-Diagonal Elements Collection**: Iterate through each cell in the grid to separate the elements into those on the diagonals and those that are not.\n3. **Validation**:\n   - Check if all elements on the diagonals are the same.\n   - Check if all non-diagonal elements are the same.\n   - Ensure that the diagonal elements and non-diagonal elements are different.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1:\n    if diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of strings representing the grid.\n2. **Separating Elements**: Using nested loops, each element of the grid is checked to determine if it lies on either of the two diagonals (main diagonal where row index equals column index, and anti-diagonal where the sum of row and column indices equals `n-1`). These elements are collected into `diagonal_chars`, while others are collected into `non_diagonal_chars`.\n3. **Validation Checks**: \n   - If both sets (`diagonal_chars` and `non_diagonal_chars`) contain exactly one unique character each, we then check if these characters are different. If they are, the grid forms an \"X\", otherwise it does not.\n   - If either set contains more than one unique character, the grid does not form an \"X\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check the required conditions with a time complexity of O(n^2), which is optimal for the given constraints.",
