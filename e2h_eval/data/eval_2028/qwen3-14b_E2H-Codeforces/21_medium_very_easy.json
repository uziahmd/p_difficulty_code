The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nRight. So the approach would be to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, count how many keys are even and how many are odd. Then, the maximum possible pairs would be the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, yes. Because each even chest can be paired with an odd key, and each odd chest can be paired with an even key. But since each key can be used once, and each chest once, we need to take the minimum of the counts in each category.\n\nSo, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests. Let's say even_chest = count of a_i even, odd_chest = count of a_i odd.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys. even_key = count of b_j even, odd_key = count of b_j odd.\n3. The answer is min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nThat makes sense. Because for each even chest, we can use an odd key, but there's only so many odd keys. Similarly for the other way around.\n\nLet me check the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\nChests: 9, 14, 6, 2, 11. Let's see their parities:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chest is 3 (14,6,2), odd_chest is 2 (9,11).\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Even keys: 8,4,20 (3), odd keys: 7 (1). \nSo min(3,1) is 1 (even_chest and odd_key). Then min(2,3) is 2 (odd_chest and even_key). Total 1+2=3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example: chests are all even (2,4,6,8,10) so even_chest=5, odd_chest=0. Keys: 5 (odd). So min(5,1) is 1. And min(0, 0) is 0. Total 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are all even (20,30,40,50). So even_chest is 1, odd_key is 0. So min(1,0)=0. And odd_chest is 0, even_key is 4. min(0,4)=0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo this logic works. So the code needs to compute these counts.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python?\n\nThe steps are:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a_i. Count even and odd.\n\nRead the list of b_j. Count even and odd.\n\nCompute the answer as min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nSo the code would be straightforward.\n\nBut wait, how to count even and odd? For each number in a list, check if it's even or odd. For example, for a_i, even_chest is sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0). Similarly for others.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, handling large inputs. Since n and m can be up to 1e5, but in Python, this is manageable. Because even for 1e5 elements, the list comprehensions are efficient.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nThen read the third line as a list of integers.\n\nThen compute even_chest, odd_chest, even_key, odd_key.\n\nThen compute the answer as described.\n\nSo let's code this.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\n\neven_chest: 3 (14,6,2)\n\nodd_chest: 2 (9, 11)\n\nkeys: [8,4,7,20]\n\neven_key: 3 (8,4,20), odd_key:1 (7)\n\nso answer is min(3,1) + min(2,3) = 1+2=3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother sample: n=5, m=1. a is [2,4,6,8,10], even_chest=5, odd_chest=0. keys: [5], even_key=0, odd_key=1. So min(5,1) + min(0,0) = 1 + 0 =1.\n\nThird sample: n=1, m=4. a is [10], even_chest=1, odd_chest=0. keys are [20,30,40,50], even_key=4, odd_key=0. So min(1,0) + min(0,4) = 0 + 0=0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input. Let's see, in Python, the input can be read via input().split().\n\nBut for multiple test cases? Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the problem statement. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n and m.\n\nSecond line has n integers.\n\nThird line has m integers.\n\nSo for each test case, the code reads three lines. But in the sample input given, there are three examples, but the code is supposed to process a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the user provided some examples, but the actual code should read from stdin. Oh, the problem says that the code should read input from standard input. So the code is supposed to handle a single test case.\n\nWait, the sample input shows three different test cases. But that's probably part of the example. But the actual code is supposed to read one test case. Because in programming competitions, each test case is processed once. So the code should read n and m, then the a array, then the b array.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the next line as a list of integers.\n\nRead the next line as a list of integers.\n\nThen compute counts.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_chest = n - even_chest\n\neven_key = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_key = m - even_key\n\nresult = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nTesting this with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\neven_chest is 3, odd_chest 2.\n\neven_key is 3 (8,4,20), odd_key is 1 (7). So min(3,1) is 1, min(2,3) is 2. Total 3. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n5 1\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n\n5\n\neven_chest is 5, odd_chest 0.\n\neven_key is 0, odd_key is 1. So min(5,1) is 1, min(0,0) is 0. Total 1.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n1 4\n\n10\n\n20 30 40 50\n\neven_chest is 1, odd_chest 0.\n\neven_key is 4, odd_key 0. So min(1,0) is 0, min(0,4) is 0. Total 0.\n\nYes. So the code works.\n\nEdge cases: what if there are zero even chests or keys?\n\nLike, if all chests are odd, and all keys are even. Then min(odd_chest, even_key) is the answer.\n\nAnother edge case: when there are more keys than needed. For example, even_chest is 2, odd_key is 5. So min(2,5) is 2. Then the rest of the keys can't help.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases correctly. And it's O(n + m) time, which is acceptable for n and m up to 1e5.\n\nSo the Python code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. A chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number. This translates to pairing even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count the number of even and odd numbers in both the list of chests and the list of keys.\n2. **Optimal Pairing**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the sum of two minimum values:\n   - The minimum of the number of even chests and the number of odd keys.\n   - The minimum of the number of odd chests and the number of even keys.\n\nThis approach ensures that we optimally pair each chest with a key such that their sum is odd, leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_chest = n - even_chest\n\neven_key = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_key = m - even_key\n\nresult = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of chests `n`, the number of keys `m`, the list of chest numbers `a`, and the list of key numbers `b`.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Values**: We count how many of the chest numbers are even and how many are odd. Similarly, we count the even and odd keys.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Openable Chests**: The result is calculated by taking the minimum of even chests and odd keys, plus the minimum of odd chests and even keys. This ensures we use the keys optimally to open the maximum number of chests.\n\nThis solution efficiently processes the input in linear time relative to the number of chests and keys, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000 elements.",
