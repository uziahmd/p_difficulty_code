He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for lengths 1 to n-1), but mixed up. My job is to assign each of these strings as either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S) such that there's at least one possible string s that fits this assignment.\n\nThe output is a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The key is that there must be at least one valid s that matches the assignments.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some string s. But since the input is mixed, I need to find a way to determine which ones are prefixes and which are suffixes.\n\nLet me think. For the correct string s, the prefixes are all the strings s[0...k] for k from 1 to n-1. Similarly, the suffixes are s[n-k ... n-1] for k from 1 to n-1.\n\nBut since the input contains exactly two strings of each length (from 1 to n-1), and they are all prefixes and suffixes of some s, the problem is to find for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nBut how do I determine which ones are which?\n\nAn important observation here is that the longest prefix (length n-1) must be the string s without its last character. Similarly, the longest suffix (length n-1) is the string s without the first character. Also, the longest prefix and the longest suffix must have some relation. For example, the longest prefix (of length n-1) must be a prefix of the full string s, and the longest suffix (of length n-1) must be a suffix of s.\n\nWait, but for the correct s, there's exactly one prefix of each length. So, for example, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. These two must be present in the input. But since the input has two entries of each length, one of them is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Wait, no. For each length l from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings. One is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. Because for each l, there's exactly one prefix of length l and exactly one suffix of length l. So the input for each l has two strings: the prefix and the suffix of that length.\n\nSo for example, for the input strings, for each length l, there are two strings. One is the prefix, one is the suffix.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: for each length l (from 1 to n-1), choose one of the two strings of that length to be a prefix, and the other to be a suffix. Then, check if there exists a string s that has all the chosen prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut how can we find that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the actual string s. Once we have s, we can check which of the input strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.\n\nBut how do we find s? Well, the correct s must have the following properties:\n\n- All the prefixes of s (for lengths 1 to n-1) are in the input.\n- All the suffixes of s (for lengths 1 to n-1) are in the input.\n\nBut since the input contains exactly all the prefixes and suffixes, the problem is that the input is a mix of those. So, for example, the correct s's prefixes and suffixes are exactly the input strings.\n\nBut how can we reconstruct s from the input?\n\nLet me think about the case when we have the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1). Let's say that the longest prefix is P, and the longest suffix is S. Then, the full string s would be P + last character (which is the last character of S). But wait, because the longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. So the full string s is the longest prefix plus the last character of the longest suffix. But the last character of the longest suffix is s[n-1], so the full string is s = (longest prefix) + s[n-1]. However, the longest suffix is s[1..n-1], which is the same as the longest prefix's suffix of length n-2 plus s[n-1].\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input consists of all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, mixed in arbitrary order. Our task is to assign each input string as either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S) such that there exists at least one valid string `s` that matches these assignments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest prefix and suffix (of length `n-1`) can be used to reconstruct the original string `s`. By combining the longest prefix with the last character of the longest suffix, we can form the original string `s`.\n2. **Check Validity**: Once we have a candidate string `s`, we verify if all the given strings are indeed its prefixes or suffixes.\n3. **Generate Output**: Using the candidate string `s`, we check each input string to determine if it is a prefix or a suffix of `s` and generate the corresponding output string of 'P' and 'S'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # For each length l from 1 to n-1, collect the two strings\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    length_map = defaultdict(list)\n    for s in strings:\n        length_map[len(s)].append(s)\n    \n    # Try all combinations of choosing one string as prefix and the other as suffix for each length\n    # However, this approach is too slow for n=100.
