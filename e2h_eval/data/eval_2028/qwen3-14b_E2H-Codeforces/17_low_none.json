He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, one prefix and one suffix, but we don't know which is which). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one possible string s that matches the assignments.\n\nThe output should be a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, with exactly n-1 P's and S's each. And if there are multiple possibilities, any valid one is acceptable.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the key idea is that the correct string s must have all the given prefixes and suffixes. But since the input strings are mixed, we need to find a way to assign them as prefixes or suffixes such that there's a consistent s.\n\nBut how do I find such an assignment?\n\nLet me think about the possible approach. For each possible candidate string s, check if all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. However, since the original problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid (i.e., there exists at least one s), but we need to find any possible assignment.\n\nBut generating all possible s candidates might not be feasible. However, considering that n is up to 100, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, but how can we find s? Well, the correct s must have the following properties:\n\n- All the prefixes of s (of lengths 1 to n-1) must be present in the input list.\n- Similarly, all the suffixes of s (of lengths 1 to n-1) must be present in the input list.\n\nBut since the input contains exactly all these prefixes and suffixes (but mixed), the correct s must be such that for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two strings in the input: one is the prefix of s of length l, and the other is the suffix of s of length l.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a string s such that for each l in 1..n-1, the input contains exactly the prefix and suffix of s of length l. Then, once we find such an s, we can check which of the input strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.\n\nBut how do we find s?\n\nWell, the string s must be such that the longest prefix (of length n-1) is present in the input. Similarly, the longest suffix (of length n-1) is also present. Also, the full string s is not given, but the input only has the prefixes and suffixes of lengths up to n-1.\n\nBut how can we find s?\n\nAnother thought: For the correct s, the prefix of length n-1 is a string in the input. Similarly, the suffix of length n-1 is also in the input. Let's call these the (n-1)-length prefix and suffix. Let's take all possible pairs of strings from the input of length n-1. For each such pair, we can try to construct s by combining them. For example, if the (n-1)-prefix is p and the (n-1)-suffix is s, then the full string s would be p + last character of s's suffix, but wait, that's not necessarily correct. Wait, the prefix of length n-1 is the first n-1 characters of s, and the suffix of length n-1 is the last n-1 characters. So the full string s must be such that the prefix of length n-1 is p, and the suffix of length n-1 is s. Therefore, the first n-1 characters of s are p, and the last n-1 characters of s are s. Therefore, the entire string s must be p[0...n-2] concatenated with the last character of s's suffix. But also, the first n-1 characters of s is p, and the last n-1 is s. Therefore, the first n-2 characters of p must be the same as the first n-2 characters of s's suffix. Because the first n-2 characters of the suffix (which is of length n-1) is the same as the first n-2 characters of the entire string s. Wait, let's think:\n\ns is of length n. Let's say the prefix of length n-1 is p (so s starts with p), and the suffix of length n-1 is s (so s ends with s). Therefore, the first n-1 characters are p, and the last n-1 are s. Therefore, the first",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying a valid string `s` that matches all given prefixes and suffixes and then assigning each input string as either a prefix or a suffix accordingly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Candidate Strings**: The correct string `s` must have its longest proper prefix (of length `n-1`) and longest proper suffix (of length `n-1`) present in the input. We generate potential candidates for `s` by combining these prefixes and suffixes.\n2. **Validate Candidates**: For each candidate string `s`, check if all given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n3. **Determine Assignments**: Once a valid string `s` is found, determine which input strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Group strings by their lengths\n    length_map = defaultdict(list)\n    for s in strings:\n        length_map[len(s)].append(s)\n    \n    # Try all possible combinations for the longest prefix and suffix (length n-1)\n    candidates = []\n    for p in length_map[n-1]:\n        for s in length_map[n-1]:\n            # Construct possible s_candidate\n            # The prefix of length n-1 is p, and the suffix of length n-1 is s\n            # So the full s_candidate must be p + [last char of s]\n            # But also, the first n-1 chars of s_candidate is p, and the last n-1 is s\n            # Therefore, the overlap between p and s must be such that p[0:n-2] == s[1:n-1]\n            if p[:n-2] == s[1:]:\n                s_candidate = p + s[-1]\n                candidates.append(s_candidate)\n    \n    # Now check each candidate against all the input strings\n    for candidate in candidates:\n        # Check if all input strings are either prefix or suffix of candidate\n        valid = True\n        for s in strings:\n            is_prefix = candidate.startswith(s)\n            is_suffix = candidate.endswith(s)\n            if not is_prefix and not is_suffix:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if valid:\n            # Now assign P and S for each input string\n            result = []\n            for s in strings:\n                if candidate.startswith(s):\n                    result.append('P')\n                else:\n                    result.append('S')\n            print(''.join(result))\n            return\n    \n    # If no candidate found (should not happen according to problem statement)\n    # But just in case, handle it with a fallback (though problem says input is valid)\n    # For example, pick any possible assignment that fits\n    # However, since the problem says input is valid, the code above should find one\n    # This part is just a fallback\n    # For example, take the first string of length 1 as prefix and others accordingly\n    # But this is not needed as per the problem's guarantee\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into lines. The first line gives the length `n` of the unknown string `s`, followed by the list of prefixes and suffixes.\n2. **Grouping by Length**: The input strings are grouped by their lengths to facilitate checking the longest prefixes and suffixes.\n3. **Generating Candidates**: Potential candidates for `s` are generated by combining the longest proper prefixes and suffixes. This is based on the observation that the first `n-1` characters of `s` (a prefix) and the last `n-1` characters (a suffix) must overlap correctly.\n4. **Validation**: Each candidate string is validated against all input strings to ensure they are either prefixes or suffixes.\n5. **Assignment**: Once a valid candidate is found, the corresponding 'P' and 'S' assignments are determined based on whether each input string is a prefix or suffix of the candidate string.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine a valid configuration for the given problem constraints.",
