The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about Xenia moving around a ringroad with houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the circular arrangement. But how do we model her movement efficiently?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that for each task, she must be at the correct house. But since the tasks are processed in order, we need to track her current position and compute the time needed to get to the next task's house.\n\nWait, but the tasks are given as a list a_1 to a_m. However, the note says that she can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So for example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, she doesn't need to move between them. But for each task, she must be at the correct house, and the order of tasks is fixed.\n\nSo the approach would be to process each task in order, keeping track of her current position, and adding the time required to move from her current position to the next task's house.\n\nBut since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving clockwise, the time between two houses depends on their positions. For example, moving from house x to house y (clockwise) takes (y - x) mod n steps if y >= x? Wait no. Wait, if you're moving clockwise, then the number of steps between x and y is (y - x) if y >= x, but (n - x + y) if y < x. Or more generally, (y - x + n) % n. Because if you're at x and need to go to y, the minimal steps clockwise is (y - x) if y >=x, else (n - x + y).\n\nWait, but since the movement is only allowed clockwise, the time between x and y is (y - x) if y >=x, else (y -x + n). So for example, if n=4, moving from 3 to 2: since moving clockwise, you have to go 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps. Which is (2-3 +4) = 3 steps.\n\nSo the formula for the time between current position (current) and next position (next) is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). But that's equivalent to (next - current) % n if the mod is positive. Wait, no. Because if next is less than current, then (next - current) is negative. So (next - current) mod n would be (next - current + n) mod n. Which would give the correct steps.\n\nBut perhaps the formula is (next - current + n) % n. Let me check:\n\nCase 1: current=1, next=3, n=4. Then (3-1) = 2. Correct. (3-1 +4) mod 4 is 6 mod4=2. Correct.\n\nCase 2: current=3, next=2, n=4. (2-3 +4) =3 mod4=3. Which is correct. So yes, the formula (next - current +n) %n gives the correct steps.\n\nSo for each task, we need to compute the steps from the previous position to the current task's house, and accumulate that.\n\nBut the tasks are given in order. So for example, the first task is a_1, then a_2, etc. But she must complete all tasks in order. So the initial position is 1. Then for each task i (from 1 to m), we compute the steps from previous position to a_i, add that to the total, and then set previous position to a_i.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that she can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, the time between them is zero. So for example, if the first task is at 3, and the second is also at 3, then the time added is zero.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each task in a_1 to a_m:\n\n    compute steps from current_position to task's house (a_i)\n\n    add steps to total_time\n\n    set current_position to a_i\n\nSo that's the plan. Now, how to implement this?\n\nBut how do we handle the steps calculation? For each a_i, compute (a_i - current_position +n) %",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circular manner. The movement is restricted to clockwise direction only, and each task must be completed in sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house 1, which is Xenia's initial position.\n2. **Iterate through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current house to the house where the next task is located.\n3. **Circular Movement Calculation**: Since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving clockwise from house `current` to house `next` can be calculated using the formula `(next - current + n) % n`. This formula handles both cases where the next house is ahead or behind the current house in a clockwise direction.\n4. **Accumulate Time**: Sum up the time taken for each move between consecutive tasks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    for ai in a:\n        diff = (ai - current + n) % n\n        total_time += diff\n        current = ai\n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints of large input sizes.\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1 and initialize the total time to zero.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task location specified in the list, compute the time required to move from the current position to the task location using the circular movement formula.\n- **Update Position**: After calculating the time for each move, update the current position to the task location to prepare for the next move.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by considering the circular nature of the ringroad and moving only in the clockwise direction. The complexity of this solution is O(m), which is optimal given the constraints.",
