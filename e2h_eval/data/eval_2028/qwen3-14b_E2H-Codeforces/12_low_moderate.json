The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about Xenia moving around a ringroad with houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the circular arrangement. But how?\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 houses and 3 tasks. The tasks are at 3, 2, 3. The output is 6. The path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Starting at 1, first task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise, that's 2 steps (1→2→3). Time taken is 2.\n- Then, the second task is at 2. But since she's currently at 3, moving clockwise to 2 would require going all the way around. From 3 to 4 to 1 to 2. That's 3 steps. So total time now is 2+3=5.\n- Third task is at 3 again. She's at 2, so moving clockwise to 3 is 1 step. Total time 5+1=6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the total time is the sum of the distances between consecutive tasks, considering the direction (clockwise) and the circular nature.\n\nBut how do we compute the distance between two consecutive tasks?\n\nLet's think: For each consecutive pair of tasks (prev, current), the distance is (current - prev) mod n if moving clockwise. Wait, no. Because if current is greater than prev, then moving clockwise would be current - prev steps. But if current is less than prev, then moving clockwise would require (n - prev + current) steps. For example, if prev is 3 and current is 2 in a 4-house setup, the distance is 3 steps (3→4→1→2).\n\nSo the formula for the distance between prev and current is (current - prev) if current >= prev, else (current - prev + n). Or more simply, (current - prev + n) % n. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nIf current is greater than prev: (current - prev) is positive. Adding n and mod n would give same result. But if current is less than prev, then (current - prev) is negative. Adding n would make it positive. For example, current=2, prev=3, n=4. (2-3) = -1. Adding 4 gives 3, which is correct. So yes, the formula is (current - prev) if current >= prev, else (current - prev + n). Alternatively, (current - prev + n) % n. Wait, but (current - prev) can be negative. Let's see:\n\nFor example, current=2, prev=3: (2-3) = -1. Adding n (4) gives 3. Mod n (4) would be 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: current=3, prev=3. The distance is 0. So (3-3 +4) mod 4 is 0. Correct.\n\nSo the formula for the distance between prev and current is (current - prev) if current >= prev, else (current - prev + n). Which can be written as (current - prev + n) % n. But wait, if current is greater than prev, then (current - prev) is positive, adding n and mod n would still be (current - prev). So yes, this formula works.\n\nBut wait, let's take current=3, prev=1, n=4. The distance is 2 steps (1→2→3). (3-1 +4) mod 4 is 2 +4=6 mod4 is 2. Correct. So yes, the formula (current - prev + n) % n gives the correct distance.\n\nWait, but when current is less than prev, like current=2 and prev=3, (2-3 +4) =3, mod4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to calculate this distance and sum them all.\n\nBut wait, the initial position is 1. So the first task is a_1. So the first movement is from 1 to a_1. Then from a_1 to a_2, etc.\n\nSo the total time is the sum of the",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a circular ringroad. The key challenge is efficiently calculating the time taken to move between consecutive tasks, considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia moves clockwise around a circular road with `n` houses. Moving from house `prev` to house `current` takes `(current - prev + n) % n` units of time if moving clockwise.\n2. **Initial Position**: Xenia starts at house 1. The first task's position determines the initial movement.\n3. **Summing Distances**: For each consecutive task, calculate the time required to move from the current house to the next task's house using the formula mentioned above and accumulate these times.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + m]))\n    \n    total_time = 0\n    current = 1  # Starting position\n    for ai in a:\n        # Calculate the distance from current to ai\n        distance = (ai - current + n) % n\n        total_time += distance\n        current = ai\n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1. For each task in the list, we compute the distance from the current house to the target house using the formula `(ai - current + n) % n`, which handles both clockwise and wrap-around movements efficiently.\n- **Accumulating Time**: Each calculated distance is added to the total time, and the current position is updated to the target house for the next iteration.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road, resulting in an optimal solution with linear complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
