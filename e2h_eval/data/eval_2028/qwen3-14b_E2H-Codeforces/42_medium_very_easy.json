Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about copying files and tracking two progress bars. The first shows the percentage of the current file copied, and the second shows the overall percentage across all files. Both are floored to integers. After each byte copied, these values update. We need to find all integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that appear simultaneously on both progress bars at some moment.\n\nHmm. The task is to find all such numbers. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's understand when the progress bars update. For each byte copied, there's a current file i and a byte x in that file. The first progress bar is floor(100 * x / a_i). The total progress is floor(100 * (sum of previous files' sizes + x) / total_sum).\n\nThe key is to simulate all possible moments when a byte is copied and check for each of these moments what the two percentages are, then collect all the numbers that are present in both.\n\nBut since the number of files can be up to 100, and each file up to 1000 bytes, the total number of bytes is up to 100 * 1000 = 100,000. So for each byte, we can compute the two percentages and track which numbers are present in both.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the progress bars update after each byte. So for each byte copied, there's a moment where the two percentages are calculated. Also, the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0% for both. But according to the note, the initial state is included. Wait, the problem says: \"В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают 0 процентов.\" So that's a moment when both are 0. So that's included.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Compute the total_sum of all a_i.\n\n- For each file i, and for each byte x in 1..a_i (since after each byte, the progress is updated), compute the current percentage (for the file) and the total percentage.\n\nBut also, we need to consider the initial state (0,0). However, when the first byte is copied, the first progress bar is 100*1/a_i floored. But the initial state is before any bytes are copied. So the initial moment is before any bytes are copied. Then, after each byte, including the first, the progress bars are updated.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize a set for the answer.\n\nInitially, both bars are 0. So 0 is added to the answer set.\n\nThen, for each file i from 1 to n:\n\n   For each byte x in 1 to a_i:\n\n      compute current_percent = floor(100 * x / a_i)\n\n      compute total_bytes_so_far = sum of a_1 to a_{i-1} + x\n\n      total_percent = floor(100 * total_bytes_so_far / total_sum)\n\n      if current_percent == total_percent, add it to the set.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the two progress bars are updated after each byte. So for each byte x in the current file, after copying that byte, the two percentages are computed.\n\nBut also, when the entire file is copied, the next file starts. So for example, after the last byte of a file is copied, the next file starts. So for each byte, including the last one of each file, we need to process.\n\nBut the way the problem is structured, the code would need to simulate each byte being copied, and for each such event, check if the two percentages are equal.\n\nBut considering that for each file, the sum of previous files is fixed. So for the i-th file, the sum of the first i-1 files is fixed as prev_sum. Then, for x from 1 to a_i, the total_bytes_so_far is prev_sum + x.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nCalculate the total_sum = sum(a).\n\nInitialize a set 'result' to store the valid percentages.\n\nAdd 0 to the result, since initially both are zero.\n\nThen, for each file i in 0..n-1:\n\n   prev_sum = sum of a[0] to a[i-1]\n\n   current_file_size = a[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\n       current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n       total_bytes = prev_sum + x\n\n       total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           add to result.\n\nSo, this would cover all the moments when a byte is copied. But wait, the initial 0 is already added, but what about when the entire transfer is done? For example, when all bytes are copied, the total progress is 100% (since total_bytes is total_sum, so 100 * total_sum / total_sum is 100, floored to 100). However, the problem says that the progress bars are updated after each byte. So the last byte's processing would include the 100% for the total progress. But the problem says that after the last byte is copied, the progress bars are updated. So in that case, the code would capture 100% if the current percent is also 100%.\n\nBut in the example given in the first test case, the output includes 100. So that's handled.\n\nNow, the question is: How to implement this?\n\nIn Python, the steps would be:\n\nRead n, then the list a.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nInitialize a set called 'result' with 0.\n\nThen for each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   prev_sum = sum of a[0] to a[i-1], which can be precomputed with a prefix sum array.\n\n   current_file_size = a[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\n       current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n       total_bytes = prev_sum + x\n\n       total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           add to the result set.\n\nOnce all bytes are processed, output the sorted list of elements in the result set.\n\nBut wait, what about the case when the total_sum is zero? Well, the problem states that each a_i is at least 1. So total_sum is at least 1, so no division by zero.\n\nBut let's check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=1, a=[6]. total_sum=6.\n\nFor each x from 1 to 6:\n\ncurrent_percent is (100x)/6 floored.\n\ntotal_percent is (100*(x))/6 floored. So they are same. So all the percentages generated here will be same. So the result set includes 0, and all the percentages generated during the process. But the sample output for first case is 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Let's see:\n\nFor x=1: 100*1/6 is 16.666..., floored to 16. Total is same. So 16 is added.\n\nx=2: 200/6=33.333... floored to 33.\n\nx=3: 300/6=50.\n\nx=4: 400/6=66.666... floored to 66.\n\nx=5: 500/6=83.333... floored to 83.\n\nx=6: 600/6=100. So 100 is added.\n\nSo the set includes 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the first sample output.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nAnother sample: the second input is 2 files of 100 and 500. total_sum is 600.\n\nThe output is 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Let's think why.\n\nAt the beginning, both are 0. Then, during the first file (size 100):\n\nfor x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_percent is (100x)/100 = x% (floored, but since x is integer, it's exactly x).\n\ntotal_percent is (100*(x)) / 600 = x/6. So for example, when x=1, total is 0.166... floored to 0. So current is 1, total is 0. Not equal. So nothing added. Only when current equals total.\n\nSo for x=1 to 100, current is x, total is floor(100x/600) = floor(x/6). So when does x equal floor(x/6)? For x=0, yes, but that's already handled. For x=0, but during processing, x starts from 1. So during first file, perhaps there's no match except maybe at the end?\n\nWhen x=100: current is 100%, total is (100*100)/600 = 16.666... floored to 16. So 100 != 16. So nothing added here.\n\nThen, when the second file starts. The prev_sum is 100. For x from 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent_percent is (100x)/500 = 0.2x, floored.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far is 100 + x. total_percent is 100*(100 +x)/600 = (100 + x)/6.\n\nSo for example, when x= 500, total_bytes is 600. total_percent is 100. current_percent is 100*500/500 = 100. So 100 is added. But the sample output includes 100. Also, during the processing of the second file, there may be some points where current and total percentages are same.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the numbers 95-99 are present. Let's see for example when x is 570 (but that's in the second file, which is 500 bytes. So x can't be more than 500. Let me think.\n\nLet me take the case when the second file is being copied. Let me calculate for x in 1..500:\n\ncurrent_percent is floor( (100 * x) / 500 ) = floor( x / 5 )\n\ntotal_percent is floor( 100*(100 + x) / 600 ) = floor( (100 + x) * 100 / 600 ) = floor( (100 + x) / 6 )\n\nWe need to find x where x/5 (floored) equals (100 +x)/6 (floored).\n\nLet me think for x in 500:\n\ncurrent_percent is 500/5 = 100. total is (100+500)/6 = 600/6 = 100. So 100 is added.\n\nWhat about x= 570? No, because x can't be more than 500. Let me think of x= 570 - but no. Let's think of x where (100 +x)/6 is say 95.\n\nSo (100 +x)/6 >= 95 and <96.\n\nMultiply by 6: 100 +x >= 570 and < 576.\n\nSo x >= 470 and < 476. Since x is integer, x ranges 470 to 475.\n\nFor these x values, the total_percent is 95.\n\nWhat's current_percent for x in 470-475?\n\ncurrent_percent is floor( x /5 ). Let's compute:\n\nx=470: 470/5 = 94. So floor is 94. Not equal to 95. So no.\n\nx=475: 475/5 = 95. So current is 95. total is 95. So yes. So when x=475, which is in the second file (since 475 <= 500), then both percentages are 95. So 95 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for other values. For example, when total_percent is 96:\n\n(100 +x)/6 is between 96 and 97. So 100 +x >= 96*6 = 576, and < 97*6=582. So x >= 576 - 100 = 476, and x < 582-100=482. So x ranges 476 to 481.\n\ncurrent_percent for x is floor(x/5). Let's take x=476: 476/5 is 95.2 → 95. Not equal to 96. For x=480: 480/5=96. So when x=480, current is 96. total is (100+480)/6 = 580/6 = 96.666..., floored to 96. So yes. So 96 is added.\n\nSimilarly for 97: (100 +x)/6 is between 97 and 98 → 100 +x >= 97*6=582 → x >= 482, and < 98*6=588 → x < 488. So x from 482 to 487. For current_percent: x/5. For x=485, 485/5=97. So current is 97. total is (100+485)/6 = 585/6=97.5 → floored to 97. So yes. So 97 is added. Similarly for 98, 99, etc.\n\nSo during the processing of the second file, there are several x values that result in the same percentage for both bars. Hence, the sample output includes 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. And 0.\n\nSo the approach of checking each byte's progress is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to:\n\n- Read n and the list a.\n\n- Compute total_sum.\n\n- Initialize a set with 0.\n\n- For each file, compute the previous sum (prefix sum), then iterate through each x in 1 to a[i].\n\nBut how to compute the previous sum for each file?\n\nWe can precompute a prefix sum array. For example, prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0] + a[1], etc. Then, for the i-th file (0-based?), the previous sum is prefix_sums[i].\n\nWait, for example, if the files are [a_0, a_1, a_2], then for the first file (i=0), the previous sum is 0. For the second file (i=1), previous sum is a_0. For the third, previous sum is a_0 + a_1. So the prefix_sums array can be built as follows:\n\nprefix_sums[0] = 0\n\nprefix_sums[1] = a[0]\n\nprefix_sums[2] = a[0] + a[1]\n\n...\n\nprefix_sums[i] = sum of first i files.\n\nSo for the i-th file in the list (0-based), the previous sum is prefix_sums[i], and the current file is a[i].\n\nSo the code can compute the prefix_sums array first.\n\nNow, in Python:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\n\nprefix_sums = [0]*(n+1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nThen, for each file i (from 0 to n-1), the previous sum is prefix_sums[i], and the current file is a[i].\n\nThen, for each x in 1 to a[i], compute:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\ntotal_bytes = prefix_sums[i] + x\n\ntotal_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\nif current_percent == total_percent, add to the set.\n\nOnce all these are processed, collect all elements in the set, sort them, and print each on separate lines.\n\nBut wait, what about the case when the total_sum is 0? But according to the problem statement, each a_i is at least 1. So total_sum is at least n (since n ≥1). So no division by zero.\n\nNow, testing the first sample input:\n\nSample input 1:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nprefix_sums is [0, 6]\n\nfor i=0, previous sum is 0. a[i] is 6. x runs from 1 to 6.\n\nEach x gives current_percent and total_percent same. So the set includes 0 and all the percentages generated during the x steps. Which are 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. So the output is those numbers plus 0, sorted.\n\nWhich matches the first sample.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nSecond sample input is:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\ntotal_sum = 600.\n\nprefix_sums is [0, 100, 600].\n\nFor the first file (i=0), previous sum is 0. For x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_percent is (100x)/100 = x. total_percent is (100*(x))//600 = x//6.\n\nSo for x in 1-100, check if x == x//6. Which only happens when x//6 is equal to x. Which is possible only when x=0. But x starts from 1. So no matches here except maybe when x is 0. But that's already handled. So during first file, no new numbers are added except 0.\n\nThen, for the second file (i=1), previous sum is 100. a[i] is 500. x from 1 to 500.\n\ncurrent_percent is (100x)//500 = x//5.\n\ntotal_percent is (100*(100 +x )) // 600 = (100 +x)*100 // 600 = (100 +x) * 100 / 600 = (100 +x)/6, floored.\n\nSo for x in 1 to 500, check if x//5 == (100 +x)//6.\n\nWe need to find all x where this holds.\n\nAs discussed earlier, for x=475, 475//5=95. (100 +475)=575. 575//6 is 95 (since 575/6 is 95.833...). So yes. So 95 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for x=480, 480//5=96. 100+480=580. 580//6 is 96.666..., floored to 96. So yes. So 96 is added.\n\nAnd so on. So during this processing, the numbers 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 are added. Also, 0 is already in the set. So the output is 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, the steps are:\n\nRead n, then read a list.\n\nCompute total_sum.\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nInitialize a set.\n\nAdd 0.\n\nLoop over each file, for each x in 1 to a[i], compute current and total percent, check equality.\n\nNow, in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead n:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen compute prefix_sums.\n\nBut for the code, the code must read from stdin. Also, the input could have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the sample input shows multiple test cases, but the problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, no. Wait, looking at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nIn the first line, n is given. Then the second line has the a_i.\n\nSo the code is supposed to read a single test case.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input shows multiple examples, but in reality, the code is supposed to handle one input. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nOutput:\n\n0\n\n16\n\n33\n\n50\n\n66\n\n83\n\n100\n\nBut the sample input given in the problem is actually multiple test cases. But in the problem statement, the user says that the input is given as per the problem's input format. So the code should read one n, then one line of a_i.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nIn the first line, n is given. In the second line, the a_i.\n\nSo the code must read n, then the a_i. So the sample input given in the problem is for multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to handle one test case.\n\nBut in the problem's example, the sample input is given as a list of inputs and outputs. However, the code is supposed to process one input, not multiple. So the code is written for one test case.\n\nSo, the code should read from stdin, process one test case, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nRead the next line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute total_sum.\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nInitialize a set.\n\nThen process each byte.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing that.\n\nBut in Python, for the prefix_sums, we can compute it as follows.\n\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nThen, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nprev_sum = prefix_sums[i]\n\ncurrent_file_size = a[i]\n\nfor x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\ntotal_bytes = prev_sum + x\n\ntotal_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\nif current_percent == total_percent:\n\n    add to the set.\n\nOnce all done, collect the set, sort, and print each on separate lines.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\n\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nresult = set()\n\nresult.add(0)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prev_sum = prefix_sums[i]\n\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n\n        current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n        total_bytes = prev_sum + x\n\n        total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n            result.add(current_percent)\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\n\nfor num in sorted_result:\n\n    print(num)\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, when the code runs, for x=6, the current_percent is (100*6)/6 = 100. total_bytes is 6, total_sum is 6. So total_percent is (100 * 6)/6 = 100. So 100 is added. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about the end of the transfer? For example, when all bytes are copied, the total_percent is 100. But the code adds that when x is the last byte of the last file. So that's handled.\n\nBut in the first sample, the output includes 100. Which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when all files are 1 byte. For example, n=2, a=[1,1]. total_sum is 2. The initial 0 is added. Then, for first file:\n\nx=1: current_percent is 100*1//1=100. total_bytes is 1. total_percent is 100*1//2 = 50. Not equal. So nothing added. For the second file, prev_sum is 1. x=1:\n\ncurrent_percent is 100*1//1 = 100. total_bytes is 2. total_percent is 100*2//2 = 100. So 100 is added. So the result set is {0, 100}.\n\nSo the output is 0 and 100.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, a = [1, 1]. Output would be 0 and 100.\n\nAnother case: n=2, a=[2, 2]. total_sum is 4.\n\nFor the first file (size 2):\n\nx=1: current is 50. total is 25. Not same. x=2: current is 100. total is 50. Not same.\n\nSecond file: prev_sum is 2. x from 1 to 2:\n\nfor x=1: current is 50. total is (2+1)/4 * 100 = 75. So 75. Not same. For x=2: current is 100. total is (2+2)/4 *100= 100. So 100 is added. So the result set is {0, 100}.\n\nBut during the second file, when x=1, total is 75. current is 50. Not same.\n\nBut what about during the first file, when x=0 (initial state). But that's already handled.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when the same value is added multiple times? The set takes care of duplicates.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code seems correct. Let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nInput:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nOutput:\n\n0\n\n16\n\n33\n\n50\n\n66\n\n83\n\n100\n\nWhich the code would generate.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\nWhich would generate 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nThird input:\n\n4\n\n1000 2 2 998\n\nThe output is 0, 50, 99, 100.\n\nLet me think about that.\n\nTotal_sum is 1000 + 2 + 2 + 998 = 2002.\n\nLet me think about when the percentages are same.\n\nAt the initial moment, 0 is added.\n\nThen, during the processing of the first file (size 1000). For x in 1..1000:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100x)/1000 = x/10.\n\ntotal_percent = (100 * x) / 2002. So when is x/10 equal to floor( (100x)/2002 ) ?\n\nNot sure. But perhaps during the first file, there's no match except maybe at the end.\n\nBut when x=1000, current is 100%. total is (100*1000)/2002 = 100000/2002 ≈ 49.95... floored to 49. So not equal.\n\nSo during first file, no matches except maybe for some x.\n\nBut during the second file (size 2). prev_sum is 1000.\n\nx can be 1 or 2.\n\nFor x=1: current is (100 * 1)/2 = 50. total is (1000 +1) * 100 / 2002 = 1001 * 100 / 2002 = 100100 / 2002 = approx 50. So 100100 divided by 2002 is 50.0... ?\n\nLet me compute 2002 * 50 = 100100. So yes. So 100100 / 2002 is exactly 50. So total_percent is 50. current_percent is 50. So 50 is added. So that's why 50 is in the output.\n\nSo during the second file, x=1, both percentages are 50. So 50 is added.\n\nThen, x=2: current is 100 * 2 / 2 = 100. total is (1000 + 2) * 100 / 2002 = 1002 * 100 / 2002 = 100200 / 2002 = approx 50.049... floored to 50. So current is 100, total is 50. Not equal.\n\nSo 50 is added once.\n\nThen during the third file (size 2). prev_sum is 1000 + 2 = 1002. x can be 1 or 2.\n\nFor x=1: current is 50. total is (1002 +1) * 100 / 2002 = 1003 * 100 / 2002 = 100300 / 2002 ≈ 50.1... floored to 50. So 50 == 50. So added again. But since it's a set, it's already present.\n\nFor x=2: current is 100. total is (1002 +2)*100 / 2002 = 1004 * 100 / 2002 = 100400 / 2002 = 50.149... floored to 50. So current is 100, not equal. So nothing added.\n\nThen, during the fourth file (size 998). prev_sum is 1002 + 2 = 1004. So total_bytes is 1004 + x, where x is from 1 to 998.\n\nAt x=998, total_bytes is 1004 + 998 = 2002. So total_percent is 100. current_percent is (100 * 998)/998 = 100. So 100 is added.\n\nAdditionally, during this file, perhaps there's another point where the percentages are same. For example, when x= 998 * 2002 / (100 * something). Not sure, but according to the sample output, 99 is present.\n\nSo during the fourth file, maybe for some x, current and total percentages are 99.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think for the fourth file. The current file is 998 bytes. prev_sum is 1004.\n\ntotal_sum is 2002.\n\nSo for x in 1..998:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 * x) // 998.\n\ntotal_percent = (100 * (1004 + x)) // 2002.\n\nWe need to find x where these are equal.\n\nLet me think for total_percent = 99:\n\n(100*(1004 + x)) / 2002 >= 99 and < 100.\n\nMultiply by 2002:\n\n100*(1004 +x) >= 99 * 2002 → 100*(1004 +x) ≥ 198198 → 1004 +x ≥ 198198 / 100 → 1981.98 → 1004 +x ≥ 1982 → x ≥ 1982 - 1004 = 978.\n\nAlso, 100*(1004 +x) < 100 * 2002 → 1004 +x < 2002 → x < 2002 - 1004 = 998. Since x is up to 998, x can be 978, 979, ..., 997.\n\nSo for x in 978 to 997 (inclusive), total_percent is 99.\n\nNow, for these x, what is current_percent?\n\ncurrent_percent is (100 * x) // 998.\n\nLet me take x=978:\n\n(100 * 978) / 998 = 97800 / 998 ≈ 98. So let me compute 998 * 98 = 97804. 97800 is less than that. So 97800 / 998 is 98. So floor is 98. Which is not 99. So not equal.\n\nWait, but what about x= 998 * 99 / 100 ?\n\nLet me compute for current_percent = 99. So (100x)/998 ≥ 99 → x ≥ (99 * 998)/100 = 988.02 → x ≥ 989.\n\nSo for x ≥ 989, current_percent is 99.\n\nSo for x between 989 and 998, current_percent is 99.\n\nSo for x in 989 to 997 (since x can't be 998 in this case?), but for x in 989 to 997, current_percent is 99. And for those x, the total_percent is 99 (as per earlier calculation). So for x in 989 to 997, both percentages are 99. So 99 is added to the set.\n\nHence, the sample output includes 99.\n\nThus, the code would capture that.\n\nSo the code works for that case.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code is written as follows.\n\nBut what about when the same value is generated multiple times? The set handles that.\n\nNow, in Python, the code is:\n\nRead n, a, compute prefix_sums, etc.\n\nNow, the code should be written as:\n\nRead from stdin. So:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nBut sometimes, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but the split() function handles that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code is supposed to read from stdin. So the code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\n\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nresult = {0}\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prev_sum = prefix_sums[i]\n\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n\n        current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n        total_bytes = prev_sum + x\n\n        total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n            result.add(current_percent)\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\n\nfor num in sorted_result:\n\n    print(num)\n\nYes, that's the code.\n\nTesting this code against the samples.\n\nFor the first sample input, the code returns the correct output.\n\nFor the second sample input, the code would generate 0, 95, 96, 97, 98",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the integer values between 0 and 100 (inclusive) that appear simultaneously on two progress bars during the copying of files from one server to another. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second shows the overall percentage of all files copied. Both percentages are floored to the nearest integer and updated after each byte is copied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Compute prefix sums to efficiently determine the cumulative size of files up to each point.\n3. **Progress Bar Simulation**: For each byte copied in each file, compute the current progress percentage for the file and the overall progress percentage for all files.\n4. **Check for Matching Percentages**: Track all values where both progress bars show the same percentage using a set to avoid duplicates.\n5. **Output the Results**: Print the sorted list of all valid percentages found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix_sums[i + 1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nresult = {0}\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    prev_sum = prefix_sums[i]\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n        current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n        total_bytes = prev_sum + x\n        total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n            result.add(current_percent)\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files and their sizes. These are read and stored in a list.\n2. **Prefix Sums**: A prefix sum array is constructed to quickly determine the cumulative size of files up to each point, which helps in calculating the overall progress percentage efficiently.\n3. **Simulating Byte Copying**: For each byte copied in each file, we compute both the current file's progress percentage and the overall progress percentage. These values are compared to check if they match.\n4. **Tracking Matches**: A set is used to collect all unique percentages where both progress bars match. This ensures no duplicates and efficient lookups.\n5. **Output**: The results are sorted and printed in ascending order, as required by the problem statement.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently simulate the progress bars and check for matching percentages while keeping the complexity manageable given the constraints.",
