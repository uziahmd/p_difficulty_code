For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine whether a given triad of notes forms a major chord, minor chord, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor definitions.\n\nFirst, let me understand the definitions again. \n\nA major triad has X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones, and Y to Z is 3. So total from X to Z is 7. But since the notes are cyclic, I need to calculate the distances properly.\n\nSimilarly, a minor triad requires X to Y is 3 semitones, Y to Z is 4. So total X to Z is 7 as well. Wait, but the order of the notes matters here. The problem says that the triad is unordered, but we can arrange them in some order to check the conditions.\n\nSo for the three notes, I need to check all permutations of them and see if any permutation satisfies either the major or minor condition.\n\nBut how do I compute the distance between two notes?\n\nFirst, I need to map each note to its position in the sequence. Let's list the notes in order:\n\nThe order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, the problem says that after H comes C again. So the order is cyclic. So the list is:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the order is as given. So each note has an index from 0 to 11. Then, the distance between two notes X and Y is calculated as (Y_index - X_index) mod 12, but multiplied by 0.5? Or wait, the problem says that between consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, which is 0.5 tone. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone, which is 0.5 tone. Wait, no, maybe the problem uses semitone as the unit. Let me recheck.\n\nThe problem says: \"the distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone.\" Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Because normally, a semitone is 1/2 of a tone. So maybe the problem is using \"semitone\" as the unit. For example, between C and C# is one semitone. Between C and D is two semitones. So the distance between two notes is the number of semitones between them. But the problem says that between consecutive notes there is exactly one semitone, which is 0.5 tone. Wait, that's confusing. Oh, perhaps the problem is using \"semitone\" as the unit. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let's check that. The notes in order are C, C#, D, D#, E. So from C to E is 4 semitones (C to C# is 1, C# to D is 2, D to D# is 3, D# to E is 4). So yes, that's 4 semitones. So the distance between two notes is the number of steps between them in the list, considering the cyclic nature. So for example, the distance from E to C would be (C's index - E's index + 12) mod 12? Wait, no. Because the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So if you have two notes, the distance is calculated as the number of semitones when moving upwards from the lower note to the higher. But if the notes are in reverse, then the distance would be (12 - (higher - lower))? Or perhaps the problem defines the distance as the minimal number of semitones between them? No, no. The problem says that the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Let's see. For example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Then between E and C, it's 8? Because the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So if you have E and C, then the lower note is E? No, because C is lower than E. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the upper. So for example, between C and E, the distance is 4 semitones. Between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Because if you go from E up to C, you have to loop around. So for example, E to F is 1, F to F# is 2, etc., up to H (which is B?), then C. So from E to C would be (C's index - E's index) mod 12? Wait, no. Let me think. Let me take the example given: C to E is 4 semitones. Let me check the indexes. Let's assign indexes:\n\nC is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, D# is 3, E is 4, F is 5, F# is 6, G is 7, G# is 8, A is 9, B is 10, H is 11.\n\nSo the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12? But that would give for C to E: 4-0=4, which is correct. For E to C, (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. Which matches the example. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) if Y is higher than X, else (Y_index - X_index + 12). So the formula is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. Wait, but mod 12 gives a value between 0 and 11. However, when you take the distance between X and Y, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So for example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) if Y is higher than X, else (Y_index - X_index + 12). Which can be written as (Y_index - X_index) % 12, but only if we take the positive modulo. Wait, for example, (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But wait, if Y is higher than X, then the mod gives the correct value. If Y is lower, then the mod gives the correct distance. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So for example, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Which is indeed (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. So that's correct.\n\nSo, for any two notes, the distance between them is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But in the problem's definition, the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones when moving from X to Y in the upward direction. So that's how we compute it.\n\nNow, the problem says that for a major triad, when ordered as X, Y, Z, the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3. So the total from X to Z is 7. Similarly for minor, X-Y is 3, Y-Z is 4. \n\nBut since the triad is unordered, we need to check all permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo, for the three notes, I need to generate all possible permutations (since order matters for checking the conditions) and check for each permutation if it meets the major or minor criteria.\n\nBut how many permutations are there? For three elements, there are 3! = 6 permutations. For each permutation (X, Y, Z), check:\n\nFor major: distance(X,Y) == 4 and distance(Y,Z) == 3?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3. But since the distance is computed as (Y_index - X_index) mod 12, but that's the distance from X to Y. So for example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then distance is 4. So that's correct. So for the permutation (X,Y,Z), the first step is to check if distance from X to Y is 4, and distance from Y to Z is 3.\n\nSimilarly for minor: check if distance X to Y is 3, and Y to Z is 4.\n\nBut since the triad is unordered, we need to check all possible orderings. For example, for the three notes, any permutation could be the X, Y, Z. So for each of the 6 permutations, check if it satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies the major condition, then the answer is major. Similarly for minor. If none, then strange.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Read the three notes.\n\n2. For each permutation of the three notes:\n\n   a. Check if the first two notes have a distance of 4, and the next two have a distance of 3. If so, it's a major chord.\n\n   b. Check if the first two have distance 3, and next two have distance 4. If so, it's a minor chord.\n\n3. If any permutation satisfies major, output 'major'. Similarly for minor. If neither, output 'strange'.\n\nBut since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, there's no case where both major and minor are possible.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFirst, create a mapping from note names to their indices. Let's create a list of the notes in order, then for each note, get its index.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the list is correct. So for example, 'B' is index 10, 'H' is index 11.\n\nSo, for a note, say, 'C', its index is 0. For 'H', it's 11.\n\nNow, for a given note, we can get its index via a dictionary.\n\nSo, create a dictionary note_to_index, where note_to_index['C'] = 0, etc.\n\nOnce that's done, for each permutation of the three notes, we can compute the distances.\n\nNow, generating all permutations of the three notes. In Python, itertools.permutations can be used. For example, permutations(notes, 3) gives all possible orderings.\n\nBut since the input is three distinct notes? Well, the problem says that the input is three notes. It's possible that they are the same? But according to the problem statement, a chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. But the problem says that the input is three notes. However, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, but perhaps the code must handle cases where two or more notes are same. However, the problem says that the input is three notes, but I think that the input can have duplicates. But according to the problem's sample input, the examples have distinct notes. However, the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So perhaps the code can assume that the three notes are distinct? Not sure. But regardless, the code should process them as per the problem's rules.\n\nBut for the code, the code will process any three notes, even if they are same. But in that case, the distances would be zero. But since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, perhaps the code can proceed regardless.\n\nNow, for each permutation of the three notes, check:\n\ndistance between first and second is 4, and between second and third is 3. If any permutation satisfies this, then it's a major.\n\nSimilarly, check for minor.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nRead the three notes as a list. For example, input is something like ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nThen, generate all permutations of these three notes. For each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nCheck if distance(x, y) is 4 and distance(y, z) is 3. If yes, then it's a major.\n\nCheck if distance(x, y) is 3 and distance(y, z) is 4. If yes, then it's a minor.\n\nOnce any of these is found, return the corresponding result.\n\nIf none of the permutations satisfy either condition, return 'strange'.\n\nSo, the code needs to generate all permutations and check.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFirst, create the note_to_index dictionary.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nThen, for a given note, get its index.\n\nNow, the function to compute the distance between two notes:\n\ndef distance(a, b):\n\n    a_idx = note_to_index[a]\n\n    b_idx = note_to_index[b]\n\n    return (b_idx - a_idx) % 12\n\nWait, but the problem says that the distance is from the lower to upper. However, the way the distance is calculated here is (b_idx - a_idx) mod 12. Which gives the number of semitones from a to b. For example, if a is C (0) and b is E (4), then distance is 4. Which is correct. If a is E (4) and b is C (0), then (0-4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct, as per the example.\n\nSo the distance function is correct.\n\nNow, for each permutation, check the conditions.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    d1 = distance(x, y)\n\n    d2 = distance(y, z)\n\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n\n        print(\"major\")\n\n        exit()\n\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        print(\"minor\")\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is three space-separated notes. So for example, the first sample input is ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']? Wait, no. Wait the sample input is given as:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nWait, but the input is a list of three strings, each being three notes. Wait, no. The problem says that the input is the only line contains 3 space-separated notes. So the input is a single line with three notes. For example, the first example input is \"C E G\" which is three notes. The sample input given in the problem seems to be a list of three test cases. But the actual input for the program is one line with three notes.\n\nSo the code should read the input as a single line, split into three notes.\n\nSo for example, the first example input is:\n\nC E G\n\nWhich would be split into ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead the input line as a list of three notes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ndef distance(a, b):\n\n    a_idx = note_to_index[a]\n\n    b_idx = note_to_index[b]\n\n    return (b_idx - a_idx) % 12\n\ndef main():\n\n    input_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    notes = input_line.split()\n\n    # Check all permutations\n\n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n\n        x, y, z = perm\n\n        d1 = distance(x, y)\n\n        d2 = distance(y, z)\n\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 ==3:\n\n            print(\"major\")\n\n            return\n\n        if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n            print(\"minor\")\n\n            return\n\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nWait, but what about the case where there are multiple permutations that satisfy the condition? For example, if two permutations satisfy major. But the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so the code can return as soon as it finds any permutation that satisfies the condition.\n\nBut the code checks permutations in order. For example, if there are multiple permutations that satisfy major, the code will print 'major' once the first such permutation is found.\n\nBut since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, there's no case where both major and minor are possible. So the code can safely return once any condition is met.\n\nTesting this code against the sample input:\n\nSample Input: C E G\n\nPermutations include (C, E, G). Let's check:\n\ndistance(C, E) is 4 (correct). distance(E, G) is (G is index 7, E is 4. 7-4=3. So yes. So returns major.\n\nAnother sample input: C# B F. Let's see.\n\nThe notes are C#, B, F.\n\nLooking for permutations. One possible permutation is B, C#, F.\n\ndistance(B, C#): B is index 10. C# is 1. (1 - 10) mod 12 is ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. So 3 semitones. Then distance between C# and F: F is index 5. (5 - 1) =4. So yes. So this permutation would trigger the minor condition. So code returns minor.\n\nThird example: A B H.\n\nNotes are A (index 9), B (10), H (11).\n\nCheck permutations. Let's take all permutations:\n\nFor example, A, B, H:\n\ndistance(A, B) is 1 (10-9=1). distance B to H is 1 (11-10=1). Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: B, H, A. distance B to H is 1. H to A is (9 - 11) mod 12 = ( -2 ) mod 12 = 10. Not helpful.\n\nAnother permutation: H, A, B. distance H to A is (9 - 11) mod 12 = ( -2 ) mod 12 = 10. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: A, H, B. distance A to H is (11 -9) = 2. Then H to B is 10 - 11 mod 12? Wait, B is index 10. H is 11. So distance from H to B is (10 - 11) mod 12 = (-1) mod 12 = 11. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H. distance B to A is (9 -10) mod 12 = 11. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: H, B, A. distance H to B is 10 -11 = -1 mod 12 = 11. Then B to A is 9-10 = -1 mod 12 = 11. Not helpful.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output is strange. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to work for the sample.\n\nNow, what about other edge cases?\n\nCase where the same note is repeated? For example, input C C C. Then, all distances are zero. So no condition is met. Output is strange.\n\nAnother case: C, E, G. Which is major.\n\nAnother case: C, E, G#. Let's see. For example, permutation C, E, G#. Distance between C and E is 4. E to G# is (8 -4) =4. So that's 4. So not 3. So not major. Any permutation? Let's see. What if the permutation is C, G#, E. Then distance from C to G# is 8-0 =8 mod 12 is 8. Not 4. So no. So this would not be a major or minor.\n\nAnother case: C#, E, G. Let's check. For example, C# to E is (4 - 1) = 3. Then E to G is 7-4=3. So 3 and 3. Not 3 and 4. So not minor. So no.\n\nWhat about a minor chord? Let's take B, C#, F. As in the sample. Let's check.\n\nPermutation B, C#, F. distance B to C# is (1 - 10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. Then C# to F is 5-1=4. So yes, minor.\n\nAnother permutation: C#, B, F. Let's see. distance from C# to B is (10 -1) mod 12 = 9. Which is not 3. So no.\n\nBut another permutation: B, F, C#. Let's check. distance B to F is 5 -10 = -5 mod 12 =7. Not 3. So no.\n\nSo the code would find the correct permutation.\n\nAnother test case: C, E, G#.\n\nLet me check if any permutation would satisfy major or minor.\n\nFor major, need 4 and 3. Let's see:\n\nCheck C, E, G#. Distance between C and E is 4. Between E and G# is (8 -4) =4. So no. So not major.\n\nCheck E, G#, C. Distance E to G# is 4. G# to C is (0 -8) mod 12 = 4. So 4 and 4. No.\n\nCheck C, G#, E. Distance C to G# is 8 semitones. Then G# to E is (4 -8) mod 12 = ( -4 ) mod 12 = 8. No.\n\nNo. For minor, need 3 and 4. Let's see:\n\nCheck C, E, G#. Distance C to E is 4. Not 3. So no.\n\nCheck C, G#, E. Distance C to G# is 8. Not 3. No.\n\nCheck E, C, G#. Distance E to C is 8. Not 3. No.\n\nCheck E, G#, C. Distance E to G# is 4. Not 3. No.\n\nCheck G#, C, E. Distance G# to C is (0 -8) mod 12 = 4. Then C to E is 4. So 4 and 4. No.\n\nCheck G#, E, C. Distance G# to E is (4 -8) mod 12 = 8. No.\n\nSo no. So output is strange.\n\nAnother test case: C, D#, G. Let's see.\n\nCheck for major: C to D# is 3 semitones (D# is index 3. 3-0=3). Then D# to G is 7-3=4. So 3 and 4. Which is minor. So the code would check permutations. For example, permutation (C, D#, G) would have d1=3, d2=4. So minor.\n\nSo the code would output minor.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about a case where the same note is part of the chord? Like C, C, E. But the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. But according to the code, for permutations like (C, C, E), the distance between first two is 0. So no. So output strange.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin. The input is a single line with three notes separated by spaces.\n\nNow, code:\n\nWe need to import sys and itertools.permutations.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ndef distance(a, b):\n    a_idx = note_to_index[a]\n    b_idx = note_to_index[b]\n    return (b_idx - a_idx) % 12\n\ndef main():\n    input_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        d1 = distance(x, y)\n        d2 = distance(y, z)\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the input is given as a list of three test cases, but according to the problem statement, the input is a single line with three notes. The sample input shows that the input is given as a list of three examples, but that's probably part of the problem's example, not the actual input format.\n\nFor example, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo the code reads one line, splits into three notes.\n\nIn the sample input, the first example input is 'C E G', which would be the input line. The sample output is 'major'.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nAnother test case: input is 'C# B F' → the code should output 'minor'.\n\nAnother test case: input 'A B H' → output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, what about the note 'H'? For example, input 'H C E' → check if it's major.\n\nH is index 11. C is 0. E is 4.\n\nPermutation H, C, E:\n\ndistance(H, C) is (0 - 11) mod 12 = 1. Because (0-11) is -11 mod 12 is 1. Then distance C to E is 4. So 1 and 4 → not matching. But if the permutation is C, E, H. distance C to E is 4, E to H is (11 -4) =7 mod 12 → 7. Not 3. So no. Another permutation: C, H, E. distance C to H is (11 - 0) = 11 mod 12 → 11. Not 4. Another permutation: E, H, C. distance E to H is 7, H to C is 1. Not 4 and 3. Another permutation: H, E, C. distance H to E is (4 - 11) mod 12 = ( -7 ) mod 12 = 5. Then E to C is 8. No. So no. So output strange.\n\nAnother example: 'C E G' → major.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code is written. Now, check for possible errors.\n\nWait, what if the input has notes with different capitalization? Like 'c' instead of 'C'? But the problem says that the input is in the given notation, which is uppercase. So the code can assume that the input is correct.\n\nAnother possible error: the note_to_index dictionary. Are the notes in the correct order?\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nYes, according to the problem statement.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they fit the definitions of major or minor chords based on specific semitone distances.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Chords**: A major chord consists of three notes where the distance between the first and second note is 4 semitones, and between the second and third note is 3 semitones. A minor chord has distances of 3 semitones between the first and second note, and 4 semitones between the second and third note.\n2. **Note Mapping**: Convert each note to its corresponding index in a predefined list of musical notes. This helps in calculating the semitone distances between any two notes.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two notes using their indices. The distance is determined by taking the modulo 12 difference of their indices to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes and check each permutation against the major and minor chord conditions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ndef distance(a, b):\n    a_idx = note_to_index[a]\n    b_idx = note_to_index[b]\n    return (b_idx - a_idx) % 12\n\ndef main():\n    input_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        d1 = distance(x, y)\n        d2 = distance(y, z)\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line containing three space-separated notes.\n2. **Permutations Check**: All permutations of the three notes are generated to check every possible order.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated using their indices in the predefined list of notes.\n4. **Major/Minor Check**: Each permutation is checked against the conditions for major and minor chords. If any permutation meets the criteria, the corresponding result is printed immediately.\n5. **Output**: If none of the permutations meet the criteria for either a major or minor chord, \"strange\" is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the input notes against the defined criteria, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
