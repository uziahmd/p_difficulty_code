For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor definitions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the note order and how to calculate distances between them. The notes are in a cyclic order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, the problem says that after H comes C again. So the order is cyclic with 12 notes. Each consecutive pair is one semitone apart. So the distance between two notes is the number of steps you take moving forward (clockwise) from the first to the second. For example, C to E is 4 semitones because C to C# is 1, then D (2), D# (3), E (4). But if you go the other way, like E to C, that's 8 semitones? Because moving forward from E to C would be 8 steps (E to F is 1, F to F# 2, G 3, G# 4, A 5, B 6, H 7, C 8). So the distance is always calculated as the minimal steps when moving forward? Or is it the actual steps when you arrange the notes in order?\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured along the musical scale, from the lower to the upper. So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Between E and C, it's 8 semitones. So the distance depends on which note is considered lower. So when checking for major or minor triads, the order of the notes matters. \n\nSo for a major triad, there must be an ordering X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones, and Y to Z is 3 semitones. Similarly for minor, the distances are 3 and 4.\n\nBut since the triad is unordered, I need to check all possible permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies either the major or minor condition.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Convert each note into a numerical value representing its position in the sequence. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, ..., H is 11. Then, for any two notes, the distance from X to Y (when X is lower than Y) is (Y - X) mod 12? Wait, no. Wait, the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones when moving forward from X to Y. So if X is before Y in the list, then the distance is Y - X. But if X is after Y, then the distance is (12 - (X - Y))? Wait, no. Let me think. For example, if X is C (0) and Y is H (11), then the distance from X to Y is 11 semitones. But if X is H (11) and Y is C (0), then the distance from X to Y is 1 semitone (since moving forward from H, the next note is C). So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12? Wait, no. Because if Y is larger than X, then Y - X is the distance. If Y is smaller than X, then (Y + 12 - X) is the distance. So the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) if Y > X, else (Y - X + 12). But since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper, so when you have two notes, the distance is the number of semitones you need to move forward from the lower note to reach the upper note. So for example, the distance between C and E is 4, but the distance between E and C is 8, because you have to go from E to F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C. That's 8 steps. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12 if Y is higher than X, but if X is higher than Y, then (Y - X + 12). But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, for two notes X and Y, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) if Y >= X, else (Y - X + 12). But since the notes are in a cycle, perhaps we can compute the distance as (Y - X) % 12. Wait, no. Because if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), (Y - X) is 4, which is correct. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), (Y - X) is -4, mod 12 is 8, which is correct. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. Wait, but that gives the distance from X to Y when moving forward. So for example, if X is E and Y is C, then (Y - X) mod 12 is (0-4) mod 12 = 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But in the problem statement, the distance between X and Y is measured from the lower to upper. So for example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). Which is the same as (Y - X) mod 12. So that's the way to compute the distance between two notes.\n\nSo, the first step is to map each note to its index. Let me create a list of the notes in order. Let's see:\n\nThe order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, the problem says that the notes are listed as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the list is:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but what about B and H? Oh, the problem says that after H comes C again. So H is the 12th note. So the indexes are 0 to 11.\n\nSo, for example, the index of C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, D# is 3, E is 4, F is 5, F# is 6, G is 7, G# is 8, A is 9, B is 10, H is 11.\n\nSo, given a note, we can find its index. So, for example, 'B' is 10, 'H' is 11. So, the first thing is to create a dictionary that maps each note to its index. Let's make that.\n\nOnce I have the indices, then for any two notes, I can compute the distance between them as (y - x) % 12. Wait, but for the problem's definition, the distance between X and Y is measured from X to Y. So for example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then the distance is 4 semitones. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then the distance is (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. Which is correct.\n\nNow, for the triad. Let's say the three notes are A, B, C. We need to check all permutations of these three notes. For each permutation (X, Y, Z), check if the distance between X and Y is 4 and between Y and Z is 3. If any permutation satisfies that, then it's a major chord. Similarly, check if any permutation has distance between X and Y is 3 and between Y and Z is 4. If so, it's a minor chord. Otherwise, strange.\n\nBut how to generate all permutations of the three notes? Well, since the triad is unordered, there are 3! = 6 possible permutations. For each of them, check the conditions.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, for a major triad, the three notes must have two intervals: 4 and 3. So, for any ordering, the sum of the two intervals is 7. But the total distance between X and Z would be 4+3=7. However, since the notes are in a circle, the distance between X and Z could also be (X to Z) mod 12. But perhaps that's not important here.\n\nSo, for each permutation of the three notes, check if the first interval is 4 and the second is 3. If any permutation meets this, then it's a major. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n- Read the three notes. Let's call them note1, note2, note3.\n\n- Convert each note to their index in the list. Let's say they are x, y, z.\n\n- Generate all permutations of these three notes. For each permutation (a, b, c), check:\n\n   distance between a and b is 4, and between b and c is 3. If yes, then it's a major.\n\n   Also check for minor: distance between a and b is 3, and between b and c is 4.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies major, then output 'major'. If any permutation satisfies minor, output 'minor'. Else, 'strange'.\n\nBut how to generate all permutations of the three notes. For three elements, there are 6 permutations. So, for example, for the three notes [x, y, z], the permutations are:\n\n(x, y, z), (x, z, y), (y, x, z), (y, z, x), (z, x, y), (z, y, x).\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, for each possible ordering of the three notes, check if the first two intervals meet the required conditions.\n\nSo, for each of the permutations, check for major and minor conditions.\n\nBut how to generate permutations in Python? Well, using itertools.permutations.\n\nYes, so I can import itertools.permutations and generate all possible orderings.\n\nSo, the code outline would be:\n\n- Create a list of the notes, e.g., notes = list(input().split())\n\n- For each note, convert to its index. So, for example, create a dictionary mapping note names to indexes.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nThen, for the three input notes, get their indexes as a list, say, [a, b, c].\n\nThen, generate all permutations of [a, b, c]. For each permutation (x, y, z):\n\n   d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n   d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n   if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3: then it's a major.\n\n   if d1 == 3 and d2 ==4: then it's a minor.\n\nSo, for each permutation, check these two conditions.\n\nIf any permutation meets the major condition, then return 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo, the code would loop through all permutations and check for these conditions.\n\nNow, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So there's no case where both major and minor are possible. So once any permutation meets major, we can immediately return 'major', and similarly for minor.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead the input line as a list of three notes. For example, input is something like ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nThen, for each permutation of these three notes:\n\nCheck for major and minor.\n\nOnce any permutation meets the major condition, output 'major' and exit. Similarly for minor.\n\nIf none found, output 'strange'.\n\nNow, let's test some examples.\n\nFirst example: Input is C E G.\n\nThe permutations are:\n\nC E G: check d1 between C and E is (4-0) mod 12 = 4. Then between E and G: (7-4)=3. So 4 and 3. So major. So returns major.\n\nAnother example: C# B F. Let's see. The notes are C#, B, F. Let's convert them to indexes.\n\nC# is index 1. B is index 10. F is index 5.\n\nLooking for permutations. One possible permutation is B, C#, F. Let's check:\n\ndistance between B (10) and C# (1): (1 - 10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. Then between C# (1) and F (5): (5-1) mod 12 = 4. So 3 and 4. So minor. Hence, output minor.\n\nThird example: A B H. Let's check.\n\nA is index 9, B is 10, H is 11.\n\nCheck all permutations. Let's see:\n\nTake A, B, H. d1 between A and B is 10-9=1. d2 between B and H is 11-10=1. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: A, H, B. d1 between A (9) and H (11) is 2. d2 between H (11) and B (10) is (10 -11) mod 12 = ( -1 ) mod 12 = 11. Not 3 and 4.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H. d1 between B (10) and A (9) is (9-10) mod 12 = 11. No.\n\nAnother permutation: B, H, A. d1 between B and H is 11-10 = 1. d2 between H and A is (9 - 11) mod 12 = (-2) mod 12 = 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation: H, A, B. d1 between H (11) and A (9): (9-11) mod 12 is ( -2 ) mod 12 = 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation: H, B, A. d1 between H (11) and B (10) is (10-11) mod 12 = 11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. Hence output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nFirst, create the note_to_index mapping.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nThen, read the input. The input is a single line with three space-separated notes. For example, the input could be 'C E G' or 'C# B F', etc.\n\nIn Python, the input is read via input().split().\n\nThen, get the three notes as a list, say, notes = input().split()\n\nThen, convert them to indexes: a, b, c = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nThen, generate all permutations of these three indexes.\n\nUsing itertools.permutations.\n\nFor example, from itertools import permutations.\n\nfor perm in permutations([a, b, c]):\n\n   x, y, z = perm\n\n   d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n   d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n   if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n       print('major')\n\n       exit()\n\n   elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n       print('minor')\n\n       exit()\n\nAfter checking all permutations, if none found, print 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So there's no case where both major and minor are possible. So once any permutation meets major, we can return 'major' immediately, and same for minor.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n# Convert to indexes\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where the same note is repeated? Well, according to the problem statement, the input is three notes, but it's possible that they are same? But according to the problem statement, the chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. Wait, but the problem says that the input is three notes. But the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. However, the problem says that the input is three notes, but perhaps they are not distinct. However, the problem says that the answer will be unambiguous. So even if the three notes are same, but that would not satisfy any of the conditions, so output strange.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a valid chord. But the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous, so we don't need to handle cases where the same note is repeated. But the code can handle that.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input:\n\nSample input is:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nWait, the input is a list of three examples. But the actual input is a single line with three notes. For example, the first example input is 'C E G' which outputs 'major'.\n\nSo the code would process each line as a separate input. But in the sample input given, the user provided three examples. However, the problem says that the input is a single line of three notes. So perhaps the sample input is a list of three test cases, but the actual code should process one line of input.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes.\n\nSo, the code reads one line, splits into three notes.\n\nThe sample input shows that for example, the input could be 'C E G' which outputs 'major'.\n\nThe code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, testing the code for the sample input.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput: C E G → indices are 0, 4, 7.\n\npermutations include (0,4,7). d1 is 4-0 =4 mod12 is 4. d2 is 7-4=3 → 3. So condition for major is met. So output 'major'.\n\nSecond example: C# B F → notes are C#, B, F. Their indexes are 1, 10, 5.\n\nOne of the permutations is (10, 1, 5). Let's check:\n\nd1 = 1 -10 mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. Then d2 is 5 -1 =4 mod 12 →4. So 3 and 4 → minor. So code outputs 'minor'.\n\nThird example: A B H → indexes are 9, 10, 11. All permutations checked, none meet the conditions. So output 'strange'.\n\nThus, the code works for the sample.\n\nNow, what about other cases?\n\nAnother example: Let's take a minor chord. For example, C# B F. As above, the code finds the permutation (B, C#, F) which is (10, 1, 5). So d1 is (1-10) mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. d2 is 5-1=4. So yes, minor.\n\nAnother test case: What about a major chord where the order is not the first permutation. Like, if the input is E G C. The correct order would be E, G, C. Let's check:\n\nE is 4, G is 7, C is 0. So permutation (4,7,0). d1 is 7-4=3. d2 is 0-7 mod 12 → (0-7) = -7 mod 12 = 5. So no. But another permutation: E, C, G? Let's see. Wait, the correct major chord is C E G. So for the input E G C, the code should check all permutations. Let's see:\n\nOne of the permutations is C, E, G. Which is (0,4,7). So d1 is 4, d2 is 3. So code would find it.\n\nSo the code would find it regardless of the input order.\n\nAnother test case: minor chord. Let's say B C# F. The code should find the permutation B, C#, F. Which is (10, 1, 5). d1 is 1-10 mod 12 → 3. d2 is 5-1=4. So yes.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat if the three notes are C, E, G. Which is major. So code returns major.\n\nAnother edge case: What if the three notes are C, E#, G. Wait, but the note names are as per the list. So E# is not in the list. The notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So E# is not a valid note. So the input is guaranteed to have valid notes. So code doesn't need to handle invalid notes.\n\nAnother edge case: H, C, E. Let's see. H is 11, C is 0, E is 4. Let's check permutations. One permutation is H, C, E. d1 between H and C is (0-11) mod 12 = 1. d2 between C and E is 4. So 1 and 4. Not matching. Another permutation: C, H, E. d1 between C (0) and H (11) is 11. d2 between H (11) and E (4) is (4 - 11) mod 12 = ( -7 ) mod 12 = 5. No. Another permutation: C, E, H. d1 is 4, d2 between E (4) and H (11) is 7. So 4 and 7. Not 3. Another permutation: E, H, C. d1 between E (4) and H (11) is 7. d2 between H and C is 1. No. Another permutation: H, E, C. d1 between H (11) and E (4) is (4-11) mod 12 = ( -7 ) mod 12 = 5. d2 between E and C is (0-4) mod 12 = 8. No. Another permutation: E, C, H. d1 between E (4) and C (0) is (0-4) mod 12 = 8. d2 between C and H is 11. No. So none of the permutations meet the conditions. So output 'strange'.\n\nAnother test case: Let's see a minor chord. Let's say C, D#, F#. Let's check.\n\nC is 0, D# is 3, F# is 6. Let's see if any permutation meets minor conditions.\n\nLet me think: For minor, need 3 and 4. Let's try permutation C, D#, F#. d1 between C and D# is 3 (3-0=3). d2 between D# and F# is 6-3=3. Not 4. So no. Another permutation: D#, C, F#. d1 between D# (3) and C (0) is (0-3) mod 12 = 9. No. Another permutation: D#, F#, C. d1 between D# (3) and F# (6) is 3. d2 between F# (6) and C (0) is (0-6) mod 12 = 6. No. Another permutation: C, F#, D#. d1 between C and F# is 6. No. Another permutation: F#, C, D#. d1 between F# (6) and C (0) is (0-6) mod 12 = 6. No. Another permutation: F#, D#, C. d1 between F# (6) and D# (3) is (3-6) mod 12 = 9. No. So no. So this is strange. But maybe there's a permutation I missed. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps another example. Let's think of a minor chord. For example, B, C#, F. Which is the sample input. So in that case, the code works.\n\nAnother example: Let's take a minor chord. Let's say D, F, A. Let's check.\n\nD is index 2, F is 5, A is 9. Let's see if any permutation satisfies 3 and 4.\n\nLet's check permutation D, F, A. d1 between D and F is 5-2=3. d2 between F and A is 9-5=4. So yes! So this is a minor chord. So the code would output 'minor'.\n\nYes. So for the input D F A, the code would output 'minor'.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother example: Let's take a major chord. Let's say D, F#, A. D is 2, F# is 6, A is 9. Check permutation D, F#, A. d1 between D and F# is 6-2=4. d2 between F# and A is 9-6=3. So major. So code outputs 'major'.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nWe need to import permutations from itertools.\n\nBut what about the case where the same note is present multiple times? For example, input is C C C. Then, all permutations will have x, y, z as same. So d1 is 0, d2 is 0. So no match. Output 'strange'.\n\nThus, the code handles that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but in Python, exit() may not be the best way. Because in some environments, exit() may not work. But in programming competition, it's acceptable. Alternatively, we can use sys.exit(). However, in the code, the code is written as:\n\nOnce a condition is found, print and exit. So for example, in the code, after printing 'major', the code exits. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in Python, the exit() function is in sys. So perhaps the code should import sys and use sys.exit(). However, in practice, the code may work with exit() as it's a built-in function in some contexts. But to be safe, perhaps it's better to use sys.exit().\n\nBut in the code as written, the code may raise an error. For example, in the code, when using exit(), which is in the sys module. However, in Python, exit() is actually part of the sys module, but in some environments, it's available as a built-in. However, for code submission, perhaps it's better to use sys.exit().\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor triad based on the distances between the notes in the musical scale.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note to its corresponding index in a predefined list of musical notes. This helps in calculating the distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes in the permutation.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Use modular arithmetic to determine the distances between notes in the circular musical scale. The distance between two notes is calculated as `(target - source) % 12`.\n4. **Check Conditions**: For each permutation, check if it meets the criteria for a major triad (distance of 4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) or a minor triad (distance of 3 semitones followed by 4 semitones). If any permutation meets these criteria, print the corresponding result and exit immediately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        sys.exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The notes are mapped to indices from 0 to 11, representing their positions in the cyclic musical scale.\n2. **Permutations**: By generating all permutations of the three input notes, we ensure that every possible ordering is checked for both major and minor triad conditions.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Using modular arithmetic ensures that distances wrap around correctly in the circular scale, providing accurate measurements even when moving from higher to lower notes.\n4. **Immediate Exit**: As soon as a valid major or minor triad is found, the program exits to avoid unnecessary checks, ensuring efficiency.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the input notes against the defined criteria for major and minor triads, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
