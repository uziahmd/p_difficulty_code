The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to calculate the probability that after building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 1/2 probability), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. So first, what conditions must the tower placements satisfy for such a configuration to be possible?\n\nLet me think about the constraints. For each town i (from 1 to n), exactly one tower's signal covers it. Also, towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower. \n\nLet's think about how the towers can be arranged. Suppose there are some towers built. How can their signal ranges be set?\n\nFor example, if there's a tower at position i, its signal power p must be such that it covers some towns. But also, the coverage must not reach town 0 or n+1. So for a tower at position i, the maximum possible p is min(i, n+1 - i). Because if p is larger than that, then the tower would cover town 0 or n+1. Wait, but the problem says that we have to choose p such that those two towns are not covered. So for each tower, when choosing p, it must be that p <= i (so that i - p >= 0?), wait no. Let me think again. \n\nThe signal from a tower at i with power p reaches cities c where |c - i| < p. So for town 0 to not be covered by any tower, for every tower at position i, we must have that i - 0 >= p. Because |0 - i| = i. So for town 0 not to be covered, i must be >= p. Similarly for town n+1: |(n+1) - i| = (n+1 - i) must be >= p. Therefore, for any tower at position i, the maximum possible p is min(i, n+1 - i). But since the signal power can be chosen, perhaps the way to arrange the towers is such that they form intervals that cover exactly the towns between them, without overlapping.\n\nWait, but the problem allows any p as long as the coverage meets the conditions. So maybe the key is that the towers must be placed in such a way that they can be arranged into a partition of the towns 1..n, where each tower's coverage area is exactly the towns between two consecutive towers (or the ends). \n\nWait, here's an idea: For the coverage to be exactly one per town, and for 0 and n+1 not to be covered, the towers must be arranged such that each tower covers a range of towns, and these ranges don't overlap. Moreover, the ranges must cover all towns from 1 to n. \n\nBut how can this be achieved? Let's think about the structure. Let's imagine that the towers are placed in positions such that between any two consecutive towers, there's a certain distance. For example, if there's a tower at position i and the next tower at j, then the towns between i and j must be covered by exactly one of these towers. However, this seems complex. Maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as a tiling problem. Each tower must be responsible for covering a segment of towns, and the way the towers are placed must allow such a segmentation. \n\nWait, considering that each tower's signal can cover a certain range. For example, if a tower is placed at position i, and its signal power is p, then it covers towns from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1. Wait, no. The condition is |c - i| < p. So c can be from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1), inclusive. So the length of coverage is 2p - 1. \n\nBut for the coverage to not reach town 0 or n+1, the p must be chosen such that i - p + 1 >= 1? No, because town 0 is at position 0. For a tower at position i, the maximum p is such that i - p >= 0? No, because |0 - i| = i. For town 0 to not be covered, the p must be <= i. Because if p is larger than i, then 0 would be within the range. Similarly for town n+1, the p must be <= n+1 -i. \n\nSo, when choosing p for a tower, it can be up to min(i, n+1 -i). But how does this affect the coverage?\n\nBut the problem says that we can choose any p as long as the coverage meets the conditions. So the key is that the tower placements must allow for a way to assign p's so that:\n\n-",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after randomly building radio towers in towns from 1 to n (each with a 50% chance), there exists a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, and each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: For a tower at position i, the maximum signal power it can have without affecting towns 0 or n+1 is min(i, n+1-i). This ensures that the signal does not reach beyond the boundaries.\n2. **Valid Tower Configurations**: The valid configurations of towers must allow for non-overlapping coverage of all towns from 1 to n. This implies that the towers must be placed in such a way that they can be partitioned into segments where each segment is covered by exactly one tower.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: We use dynamic programming to count the number of valid configurations. Let `dp[i]` represent the number of valid ways to place towers up to position i. The recurrence relation considers whether a tower is placed at position i or not, ensuring that the configuration remains valid.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # dp[i] = number of valid configurations for the first i towns\n    dp = [0] * (n + 2)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Case 1: no tower at position i\n        dp[i] = dp[i - 1]\n        # Case 2: tower at position i, then the previous tower must be at i-2 or earlier\n        if i >= 2:\n            dp[i] += dp[i - 2]\n        dp[i] %= MOD\n    \n    # The total valid configurations is dp[n]\n    # Total possible configurations is 2^n\n    # So the answer is dp[n] / 2^n mod MOD\n    numerator = dp[n]\n    denominator = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    \n    # Compute modular inverse of denominator\n    inv_denominator = pow(denominator, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    \n    result = (numerator * inv_denominator) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The `dp` array is used to track the number of valid configurations up to each position. `dp[0]` is initialized to 1 as the base case (no towns to cover).\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: For each position `i`, we consider two cases:\n   - No tower at position `i`, so the number of configurations is the same as `dp[i-1]`.\n   - A tower at position `i`, which requires that the previous tower (if any) is at least two positions away to avoid overlapping coverage. This is handled by adding `dp[i-2]` to the count.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be in the form of a fraction modulo 998244353, we compute the modular inverse of the denominator using Fermat's Little Theorem, which allows us to efficiently compute division under modulo.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count valid configurations and compute the required probability using modular arithmetic, adhering to the constraints and providing an optimal solution.",
