Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let's think about the approach here.\n\nThe problem is about pairing left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The goal is to maximize the number of such pairs. Each boot can be in at most one pair. The challenge is to find the maximum possible pairs and output them.\n\nLet me break down the problem. So, each left boot (from string l) and right boot (from string r) can be paired if their colors are compatible. The compatibility rules are:\n- Both are specific letters and same.\n- One is a question mark (which can match any color).\n- Both are question marks.\n\nSo, how to model this? Well, the main idea is to pair as many as possible. But how?\n\nFirst, I think we can approach this by first trying to pair specific colors. For example, for each color c (a-z), count how many left boots have color c, and how many right boots have color c. Then, the number of pairs for that color would be the minimum of these two counts. However, since the question marks can be used as wildcards, we need to handle those as well.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Let me think: The question marks can be used to fill in gaps where specific colors don't match. However, the order in which we pair them might matter. For example, if we have a left boot with a specific color and a right boot with a question mark, we can pair them. Similarly, if both are question marks, they can be paired.\n\nSo, maybe the approach is:\n\n1. First, pair all the specific color matches. For example, for each color c, pair left boots with color c with right boots with color c. This would be straightforward.\n\nBut how to track which ones are already paired? Because once a boot is paired, it can't be used again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a greedy approach. Let me think of the steps:\n\nStep 1: Pair all left boots with specific colors with right boots of the same color. For each color, take the minimum of the count of left and right boots of that color. But how to track which indices are used?\n\nWait, but the actual positions matter. For example, if a left boot is 'a' and a right boot is 'a', we can pair them. But if we have multiple such pairs, we need to choose which ones to pair.\n\nBut for the purpose of maximum pairing, perhaps it's best to pair as many as possible of the same color first, then handle the question marks.\n\nAnother idea: We can create a mapping for each color (excluding '?') of left and right boots. For each color, we can pair as many as possible between left and right. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (those not paired yet), we can use the question marks. But how?\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible plan:\n\n- For each color c in a-z, collect all left boots with color c and right boots with color c. Pair them. For example, for each such pair, we can pair them. Once paired, these boots are no longer available for other pairings.\n\n- Then, for the remaining left boots (those not paired yet) and remaining right boots, we can pair them using the question marks. For example, any left boot with '?' can be paired with any right boot (even with '?') and vice versa. But how to maximize this?\n\nBut how to manage the pairing of question marks optimally. Let's think: after pairing all the specific colors, the remaining left boots are those that are either '?' or have a color that couldn't be matched (because the corresponding right boots were already paired with their own color).\n\nSimilarly for the right boots.\n\nSo, after that, we have:\n\nLeft boots: some with specific colors (but no matching right boots left) and some with '?'.\n\nRight boots: same.\n\nNow, the remaining question marks can be used to pair with any remaining boots. But how?\n\nFor example, suppose there are m left boots with '?', and p right boots with '?'. Then, the maximum number of pairs between them is min(m, p). But also, there may be other left boots with specific colors that can be paired with right boots with '?', and vice versa.\n\nWait, but after the first step, the left boots with specific colors that are not paired have no matching right boots of the same color. So, for example, if there's a left boot with color 'a' that hasn't been paired, then all right boots with 'a' have already been paired. Therefore, the only way to pair this left boot is with a right boot that is a '?', or a right boot with a different color (but that's not allowed unless the right boot is a '?'). Wait, no. Because if the left boot is 'a', then the right boot must be 'a' or '?'. But if the",
    "response": "To solve the \"Colored Boots\" problem efficiently, we follow a greedy strategy that prioritizes pairing boots of the same specific color first, and then uses question marks (`?`) as wildcards to match remaining boots.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy Overview:\n\n1. **Pair Specific Colors First**:\n   - For each character from `'a'` to `'z'`, collect all indices in the left and right boot arrays where the color is that character.\n   - Pair these indices one-to-one (i.e., for each character `c`, pair up to `min(count_left[c], count_right[c])` pairs).\n\n2. **Use Question Marks Next**:\n   - After pairing specific colors, collect all unpaired left and right boots.\n   - Use `?` as a wildcard to match with any remaining boot (specific or wildcard).\n   - For this, we can use a two-pointer approach:\n     - Match unpaired left `?` with unpaired right boots (any type).\n     - Then match unpaired right `?` with remaining left boots.\n\n3. **Output the Pairs**:\n   - Track the indices of paired boots to avoid reuse.\n   - Output the total number of pairs followed by their indices.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Details:\n\n- We maintain separate lists for unpaired left and right boots.\n- We use dictionaries to track indices of each color for both left and right boots.\n- We use queues or lists to manage the unpaired boots for efficient matching.\n\n---\n\n### Code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport collections\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split('\\n')\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = data[1]\n    r = data[2]\n\n    # Maps color to list of indices (0-based)\n    left_color_map = collections.defaultdict(list)\n    right_color_map = collections.defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n        right_color_map[r[i]].append(i)\n\n    # Track used indices\n    used_left = [False] * n\n    used_right = [False] * n\n\n    # List to store the pairs\n    pairs = []\n\n    # First, pair same specific colors\n    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n        left_list = left_color_map.get(c, [])\n        right_list = right_color_map.get(c, [])\n\n        min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n        for i in range(min_len):\n            left_idx = left_list[i]\n            right_idx = right_list[i]\n            if not used_left[left_idx] and not used_right[right_idx]:\n                used_left[left_idx] = True\n                used_right[right_idx] = True\n                pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))  # 1-based index\n\n    # Collect unpaired left and right boots\n    unpaired_left = []\n    unpaired_right = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_left[i]:\n            unpaired_left.append(i)\n        if not used_right[i]:\n            unpaired_right.append(i)\n\n    # Now, pair ? with any unpaired boot\n    # First, match left '?' with any unpaired right\n    left_q = [i for i in unpaired_left if l[i] == '?']\n    right_any = [i for i in unpaired_right if r[i] != '?']\n\n    for i in range(min(len(left_q), len(right_any))):\n        left_idx = left_q[i]\n        right_idx = right_any[i]\n        if not used_left[left_idx] and not used_right[right_idx]:\n            used_left[left_idx] = True\n            used_right[right_idx] = True\n            pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n\n    # Now match right '?' with any remaining left\n    right_q = [i for i in unpaired_right if r[i] == '?']\n    left_any = [i for i in unpaired_left if not used_left[i]]\n\n    for i in range(min(len(right_q), len(left_any))):\n        left_idx = left_any[i]\n        right_idx = right_q[i]\n        if not used_left[left_idx] and not used_right[right_idx]:\n            used_left[left_idx] = True\n            used_right[right_idx] = True\n            pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n\n    print(len(pairs))\n    for p in pairs:\n        print(f\"{p[0]} {p[1]}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Time Complexity:\n\n- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time because:\n  - We iterate over the strings once to build color maps.\n  - All pairings are done in linear passes through the lists.\n  - No nested loops are used.\n\nThis ensures the solution is efficient even for the upper limit of `n = 150000`.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases Handled:\n\n- All boots are `?` → All can be paired.\n- Some specific color matches and some `?` → Correctly prioritizes specific matches first.\n- No possible matches → Outputs zero pairs.\n- Multiple valid pairings → Returns any one of them (as required).",
