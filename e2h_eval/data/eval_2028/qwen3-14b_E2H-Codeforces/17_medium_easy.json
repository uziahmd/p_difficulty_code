He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, but we don't know which is prefix or suffix). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one possible string s that is consistent with this assignment.\n\nThe output should be a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The key is that there must be at least one possible s that matches the assignments.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the main idea: For each possible candidate string s (of length n), check if all the given strings are its prefixes or suffixes. But since n can be up to 100, generating all possible candidates might not be feasible directly. However, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, i.e., there exists at least one string s that matches. So maybe we can find the correct s by looking for the string that has all the given strings as prefixes or suffixes. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the correct s must have all the given strings as either prefixes or suffixes. So for example, the longest prefix (length n-1) must be a prefix of s, and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be a suffix of s. But since there are two strings of each length, perhaps the correct s can be determined by combining the longest prefix and suffix.\n\nWait, let's think about the case where we have two strings of length n-1. One of them must be a prefix of s, and the other a suffix. So for example, if the two strings of length n-1 are A and B, then s must start with A and end with B, or vice versa. But how can we find which one is which?\n\nBut for the correct s, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix is s[1..n-1]. So for example, if the correct s is \"ababa\" (as in the first example), then the prefix of length 4 is \"abab\", and the suffix of length 4 is \"baba\". So the input would have these two strings, and the correct assignment would be one as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. Find the possible candidates for the full string s. How?\n\nWell, for the correct s, the longest prefix (length n-1) must be present in the input, and the longest suffix (length n-1) must also be present. So perhaps we can take all possible pairs of the two strings of length n-1, and for each pair, check if combining them can form a possible s.\n\nFor example, take the two strings of length n-1, say A and B. Then, if A is the prefix, then the full string s would be A + (last character of B). Wait, no. Because the suffix of length n-1 is B, which is s[1..n-1]. So if the prefix is A (length n-1), then s is A + x, where x is the last character. But the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n] = B. So the suffix is the original string s without the first character. Therefore, the suffix is s[1:].\n\nSo if the prefix of length n-1 is A, then s is A + c, where c is some character. Then the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:] = A[1:] + c. So this must be equal to one of the strings of length n-1. So for example, if the two strings of length n-1 are A and B, then for the case where A is the prefix, then B must be equal to A[1:] + c. But since c is the last character of s, which is the last character of the suffix of length n-1, which is B. So B's last character is c. Therefore, B must be A[1:] + B[-1]. Which implies that A[1:] + B[-1] equals B. So that would imply that B is A[1:] concatenated with B[-1], which would mean that B is equal to A[1:] + (B's last character). Which is always true, but how does that help us?\n\nWait, perhaps the way to find s is that the correct s is formed by taking a prefix of length n-1 (say, P) and a suffix of length n-1 (say, S). Then, since the prefix is P and the suffix is S, the full string s must be P + [last character of S], but also S must be s[1:]. So s[1:] = S. So the first character of s is P[0], then the rest is P[1:] + last_char. But S is s[1:] = P[1:] + last_char. Therefore, S must be equal to P[1:] + last_char. But since S is of length n-1, and P is of length n-1, then P[1:] is of length n-2. Adding one character gives length n-1, which matches S. Therefore, the last character of S is the last character of s. But S's last character is the same as the last character of s, which is the same as the last character of the suffix of length n-1.\n\nSo, for the two strings of length n-1, say X and Y, we can check if Y equals X[1:] + (last character of Y). Wait, but that's always true. Because X[1:] is length n-2, adding the last character of Y (which is a single character) makes it length n-1. But how do we know what that last character is? Well, the last character of Y is the last character of the suffix of length n-1, which is the same as the last character of s. But if X is the prefix of length n-1, then s is X + (last_char). But the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:] = X[1:] + last_char. Therefore, this must be equal to Y. So Y must be equal to X[1:] + last_char. But since Y is a string of length n-1, and X[1:] is length n-2, the last_char is the last character of Y. Therefore, Y must be equal to X[1:] + Y[-1]. Which is always true. So this condition is automatically satisfied. Therefore, for any pair of X and Y (the two strings of length n-1), we can create a candidate s as X + Y[-1], and check if the suffix of length n-1 is Y. Which would be the case if Y equals X[1:] + Y[-1]. Which is indeed true because X[1:] + Y[-1] is X[1:] concatenated with Y's last character. But Y is a string of length n-1. How can we check if this is the case?\n\nWait, for example, if X is 'abab' (length 4, n=5), and Y is 'baba' (length 4). Then X[1:] is 'bab', and Y[-1] is 'a'. So X[1:] + Y[-1] is 'baba', which is Y. So this works. Therefore, the candidate s is X + Y[-1] = 'abab' + 'a' = 'ababa' which is correct.\n\nSo for any pair of the two strings of length n-1, we can generate a candidate s. Then, for each candidate s, check whether all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. Once we find such an s, we can then assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string accordingly.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find all possible candidates for s. These candidates are generated by taking each pair of the two strings of length n-1, and forming s as (prefix_candidate + last_char_of_suffix_candidate). For example, for the two strings of length n-1, say A and B, we can try s = A + B[-1], and also s = B + A[-1]. Because for each pair, there are two possibilities: one is that A is the prefix and B is the suffix, and vice versa.\n\nWait, but the two strings of length n-1 are the only ones of that length. So for each candidate, we can generate two possibilities: one where the first string is the prefix and the second is the suffix, and the other way around. However, perhaps there are multiple possibilities, but we can check each candidate s and see if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nOnce we find such an s, we can then assign 'P' and 'S' for each input string based on whether it is a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nBut how do we find which input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s?\n\nOnce we have s, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s (i.e., s starts with the string) or a suffix (s ends with the string). But since the input includes all prefixes and suffixes, each input string must be either a prefix or a suffix of s. However, since the input has exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1, and for each length, one is a prefix and one is a suffix (except when they are the same string, but the problem says that the input is valid, so that's possible? Well, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there exists at least one s that works.)\n\nSo once we find a valid s, then for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix or a suffix of s. However, since there are exactly two strings for each length, and for each length, one must be a prefix and one a suffix. So for each input string, it's either a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n- Generate all possible candidate s strings based on the two strings of length n-1.\n\n- For each candidate s:\n\n   - Check if all the given input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\n   - If yes, then proceed to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string.\n\nOnce we find such an s, we can process the input strings.\n\nBut how do we generate the candidate s strings?\n\nLet me think. For example, in the first sample input, the two strings of length 4 (since n=5) are 'abab' and 'baba'.\n\nWe can generate two candidates:\n\nCandidate 1: Take 'abab' as the prefix of length 4, then the suffix of length 4 must be 'baba'. So the full string s is 'abab' + last character of 'baba' which is 'a', giving 'ababa'.\n\nCandidate 2: Take 'baba' as the prefix of length 4, then the suffix of length 4 must be 'abab'. So the full string s is 'baba' + last character of 'abab' which is 'b', giving 'babab'.\n\nNow, check for each of these candidates whether all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nIn the first case, s is 'ababa'. Let's check the input strings:\n\nThe input strings are:\n\nba\n\na\n\nabab\n\na\n\naba\n\nbaba\n\nab\n\naba\n\nSo for each of these, check if they are a prefix or suffix of 'ababa'.\n\nFor example:\n\n- 'ba' is a prefix? No. 'ababa' starts with 'a'. Is it a suffix? The suffix of length 2 is 'ba', yes. So 'ba' is a suffix.\n\n- 'a' is a prefix (yes) and a suffix (yes). So it can be either.\n\nBut according to the input, for each length, there are exactly two strings. So for each length, one is prefix and one is suffix. So for example, for length 1, there are two 'a's. So in the sample input, for length 1, there are two 'a's. So in the correct assignment, one of them is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\nBut when checking for the candidate s, we need to ensure that for each input string, it is a prefix or suffix of s. So for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nOnce we find a candidate s that satisfies this, then we can proceed to assign 'P' or 'S' for each input string.\n\nSo for the first candidate s = 'ababa', all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. Let's check:\n\nThe input strings are:\n\n'ba' (length 2) → is it a prefix? 'ababa' starts with 'a', so no. Suffix of length 2 is 'ba', yes. So 'S'.\n\n'a' (length 1) → prefix (yes) or suffix (yes). But in the input, there are two 'a's. So both must be assigned as P or S. However, for the correct answer, one of them is P and the other is S.\n\nBut how do we decide which one? Well, the problem allows any valid assignment. So for the code, once we have the candidate s, we can iterate over all input strings, and for each, check if it's a prefix (if yes, assign P) else assign S. However, there could be cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, the string 'a' in the sample input is both a prefix and a suffix of 'ababa'. In such cases, we can assign either P or S, as long as the counts are correct.\n\nBut the problem requires that the number of P's and S's are equal (since there are n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes, total 2n-2). So for each input string, we need to assign P or S, ensuring that exactly n-1 are P and n-1 are S.\n\nBut how do we handle cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix? For example, the string 'a' in the sample input is both. So when assigning, we can choose either P or S, but need to make sure that overall the counts are correct.\n\nBut perhaps for the code, once we have a valid s, we can check for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix. If it is a prefix, assign P. If it is a suffix, assign S. However, if it is both, we can assign either. However, there's a problem: suppose a string is both a prefix and a suffix. How do we decide which to assign? Because if we assign P, then another string that is also both may need to be assigned S, but that depends on the counts.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is valid, so there exists at least one assignment. Therefore, perhaps for the code, we can process the input strings, and for each, check if it is a prefix (assign P) or else assign S. But if it is both, we can assign P first, and then adjust later if needed. However, this may not work in all cases.\n\nBut perhaps for the code, when we have a valid s, the following approach will work: For each input string, check if it's a prefix of s. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S. Because for the correct s, each input string must be either a prefix or a suffix. Therefore, for each input string, exactly one of the two conditions holds (or both). So for the code, we can just check if it is a prefix. If yes, assign P, else assign S.\n\nBut what if a string is both a prefix and a suffix? Then the code would assign P. But maybe that's okay. For example, in the sample input, the two 'a's. For the first 'a', it is a prefix (so assign P), and the second 'a' is a suffix (so assign S). That would give the correct counts.\n\nBut how to ensure that in the code? Because if the code assigns P to all strings that are prefixes (including those that are also suffixes), and S to others, then for the case where a string is both, it's assigned P, but there may be another string that is also both, and needs to be assigned S. However, the problem says that the input is valid, so there must be a way to assign P and S such that exactly n-1 are P and n-1 are S.\n\nBut how to ensure that the code's assignment meets this?\n\nWell, the code may have to choose between P and S for those strings that are both. However, the problem allows any valid assignment. So perhaps the code can proceed as follows: for each input string, check if it's a prefix of s. If yes, assign P. Otherwise, assign S. Then, check if the number of P's is exactly n-1. If not, then for those strings that are both prefix and suffix, flip their assignments as needed.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, since the input is guaranteed to be valid, and for the correct s, all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes. So for each input string, it's either a prefix or a suffix. But for some strings, they can be both. However, the code can just assign P if it's a prefix, else S, and the counts would be correct.\n\nWait, but for example, take the case where the input has two strings that are both prefixes and suffixes. For example, the string is 'aaa', and the input has two 'a's (for length 1). Then, for each of the two 'a's, they are both prefixes and suffixes. Assigning P to both would result in two P's, but the correct count is one P and one S. So the code's approach would fail here.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is valid, which implies that there exists at least one assignment. However, the code's approach would generate an invalid assignment (two P's and zero S's for those two strings). So how to handle this?\n\nThis suggests that the code's approach of assigning P if it's a prefix and S otherwise is not sufficient. Therefore, we need a better way to assign P and S.\n\nAlternative idea: For the candidate s, collect all the prefixes of s (for lengths 1 to n-1) and all the suffixes of s (for lengths 1 to n-1). Then, for each input string, check if it is in the prefixes or the suffixes. Then, for each input string, we need to assign it to be either P or S, but ensuring that for each length, exactly one is P and one is S.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nFor example, for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two input strings. For the correct s, exactly one of them is a prefix of length l, and the other is a suffix of length l. Therefore, for each length l, we can check which of the two input strings is the prefix (and assign P) and which is the suffix (assign S).\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce the candidate s is found, for each length l (from 1 to n-1):\n\n   Collect all the input strings of length l (there are two of them).\n\n   Check which of them is the prefix of s of length l (there is exactly one such string, since the input is valid).\n\n   Assign P to that string, and S to the other.\n\nBut how to find which of the two strings is the prefix?\n\nBecause for the candidate s, the prefix of length l is s[0...l-1]. Similarly, the suffix of length l is s[n-l ... n-1].\n\nSo for each l, we can generate the prefix and suffix of length l. Then, for the two input strings of length l, one must be the prefix and the other the suffix.\n\nSo for each l, the two input strings must include the prefix and the suffix. Therefore, for each l, check which of the two input strings is equal to the prefix of s of length l. Assign that as P, the other as S.\n\nThis approach ensures that for each l, exactly one P and one S are assigned, and the counts are correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nOnce the candidate s is found:\n\n   For each of the 2n-2 input strings, group them by their length.\n\n   For each length l (from 1 to n-1):\n\n      get the two input strings of length l.\n\n      compute the prefix of s of length l (pre_l) and the suffix of s of length l (suf_l).\n\n      among the two input strings, one must be pre_l and the other must be suf_l.\n\n      assign 'P' to the one that equals pre_l, and 'S' to the other.\n\nSo for the code, once we find a valid s, we can proceed as follows:\n\nGroup the input strings by their length. For example, a dictionary where the key is the length, and the value is a list of the two strings of that length.\n\nThen, for each length l in 1..n-1:\n\n   pre_l = s[:l]\n\n   suf_l = s[-l:]\n\n   for the two strings in the group of l:\n\n      check which one is equal to pre_l. Assign 'P' to that one.\n\n      the other is assigned 'S'.\n\nThis way, for each l, exactly one P and one S is assigned.\n\nBut how to handle when the two input strings for a given l are both pre_l and suf_l? Well, that can only happen if pre_l == suf_l, which would mean that the string s is made up of the same characters. For example, s = 'aaaaa' (n=5). Then, for l=2, the prefix is 'aa' and the suffix is 'aa', so the two input strings for l=2 would be 'aa' and 'aa'. Then, the code would assign one as P and the other as S, but how to choose which one? Well, since the problem allows any valid assignment, it doesn't matter. For example, assign the first occurrence as P and the second as S.\n\nBut how to find which of the two input strings is the prefix?\n\nSo for each l, the two input strings must be pre_l and suf_l. So in the code, for each l, we can check which of the two input strings equals pre_l. Since the input is valid, exactly one of them will be pre_l. Because the input is guaranteed to be valid for some s, and we have chosen s as a candidate that is valid.\n\nWait, but for the candidate s, the input strings may not be exactly the prefixes and suffixes. Because the candidate s may not be the correct one. But once we find a candidate s that is valid (i.e., all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s), then for each l, the two input strings must be pre_l and suf_l. Because the input is guaranteed to be valid for some s, and our candidate s is valid, so for each l, the two input strings are exactly the pre_l and suf_l for that l.\n\nTherefore, for each l, the two input strings are pre_l and suf_l. So for each l, exactly one of them is pre_l, and the other is suf_l.\n\nSo for the code, once we have a valid s, for each l, we can check which of the two input strings of length l is the prefix of s of length l. Assign that as P, the other as S.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce a valid s is found, group the input strings by length. For each l in 1..n-1:\n\n   pre_l = s[:l]\n\n   for the two strings in the group for l:\n\n      if string == pre_l: assign P\n\n      else: assign S\n\nBut how to group the input strings by their length? Because the input strings are given in arbitrary order. So during processing, the code can create a dictionary that maps each length to a list of the input strings of that length.\n\nBut for the code, the order of the input strings matters. Because the output must correspond to the input order. So for example, the first input string is processed as per the first position in the output string.\n\nSo the code needs to process the input strings in the order they are given, and for each, determine whether it is a prefix or suffix of s. However, using the grouping method, the code can determine for each input string which assignment to make.\n\nBut the grouping approach requires that for each input string, we can find which l it belongs to, and then check if it is the pre_l or suf_l for that l.\n\nSo here's the plan for the code:\n\nOnce a valid s is found:\n\n   Create a dictionary, for each length l, store the two input strings of that length. For example, for each l, a list of two strings.\n\n   Then, for each input string in the original input order, do the following:\n\n      get its length l.\n\n      get the two strings of that l.\n\n      check which of them is the prefix of s of length l.\n\n      if the current input string is that prefix, assign 'P'; else, assign 'S'.\n\nBut how to check which of the two strings is the prefix? For example, for a given l, the two strings are in the list. For the current input string, we can check if it's equal to pre_l. If yes, then assign P. Else, assign S.\n\nBut how to do that for each input string?\n\nLet me think. Suppose for each input string, we can find its length l. Then, for that l, we can check if the input string equals the prefix of s of length l. If yes, then assign P. Else, assign S.\n\nBut how to do that for all input strings?\n\nYes. Because for each input string, it is either the prefix or the suffix of s for its length l. So for example, for a given input string of length l, if it's the prefix, then it equals s[:l], else it equals s[-l:].\n\nSo for the code, for each input string, check if it equals s[:l]. If yes, assign P; else assign S.\n\nThis approach avoids grouping the input strings by length, and instead processes each input string individually.\n\nBut this approach may have a problem when the input string is both the prefix and suffix of s for its length. For example, when s is 'aaaaa', and the input string is 'aaa' (for l=3). Then, the prefix is 'aaa' and the suffix is also 'aaa'. So the input string is both. But since the input has exactly two strings for each l, and the input is valid, the other string for this l must also be 'aaa'. So for the code, when checking, the input string will match the prefix, and thus be assigned 'P'. However, the other input string of the same length will also match the prefix, and thus be assigned 'P' as well. But that would lead to two 'P's for the same l, which is invalid.\n\nBut this can't happen, because the input is valid. Because for the input to be valid, there must exist at least one s. For that s, for each l, the two input strings must be exactly the prefix and suffix of s for that l. But if the prefix and suffix are the same (e.g., 'aaa' for l=3), then the two input strings for that l must be the same. So for example, in the input, for l=3, there are two 'aaa's. Then, for the code, when checking each input string, they will both match the prefix (since they are the same as the prefix). Thus, both would be assigned 'P', leading to two P's for that l. Which would be invalid.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid, but in such a case, the code would have to assign one P and one S. How?\n\nAh, but the code's approach of checking if the input string is the prefix would assign both to P. Which is wrong.\n\nBut this is a contradiction. How can that be?\n\nLet me think. For the input to be valid, there must be a string s such that for each l, the two input strings are the prefix and suffix of s. If the two input strings for l are the same, then that implies that the prefix and suffix of s for l are the same. Which is possible. For example, s is 'aaaaa', and for l=3, the prefix is 'aaa' and the suffix is 'aaa'. So the two input strings for l=3 are both 'aaa'.\n\nIn this case, the code's approach would assign P to both, which would result in two P's for l=3. Which is invalid, since each l must have exactly one P and one S.\n\nBut this is impossible. How can the input be valid in such a case?\n\nBecause the input is supposed to have exactly two strings for each l. But if the two strings are the same, then for that l, both are the prefix and the suffix. Which is allowed, but how can the code assign P and S?\n\nThe problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, but for this case, the code's approach would not work. However, the problem says that the input is valid, which means that there exists at least one s that is consistent with the input. For example, in this case, s is 'aaaaa', and for each l, the two input strings are the same. So for each l, one of them is the prefix and the other is the suffix. But how can that be? Because the prefix and suffix are the same. So for the code, how to assign P and S?\n\nIn this case, the code can assign one as P and the other as S. But how to determine which one?\n\nBut the code's approach of checking if the input string is the prefix would assign both as P, which is incorrect.\n\nSo the problem is that the code's approach of checking if the input string is the prefix of s is not sufficient when the input string is the same as the prefix and suffix.\n\nSo how to handle this case?\n\nThe solution is to check for each input string of length l whether it is the prefix or the suffix of s. However, since the two input strings are the same, and both are the prefix and suffix, we can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that in code?\n\nThe code needs to, for each l, check which of the two input strings is the prefix. But if both are equal to the prefix (because the prefix and suffix are the same), then the code must choose one to be P and the other to be S.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nThe code can check for each input string of length l: if it is the prefix, then assign P. If not, assign S. But in this case, both are the prefix, so both would be assigned P, which is invalid.\n\nSo the code needs to find, for each l, which of the two input strings is the prefix and which is the suffix. But how?\n\nWell, for the candidate s, the prefix of length l is pre_l, and the suffix is suf_l. For the input strings of length l, they must be exactly pre_l and suf_l. So for the case where pre_l == suf_l, the two input strings for that l must be equal to pre_l (and hence to suf_l). So for that l, the two input strings are the same. So for that l, the code can assign one as P and the other as S. But how to choose which one?\n\nThe code can assign the first occurrence as P and the second as S, regardless of their actual values. But how to track which is which?\n\nSo, for the code, during the grouping phase, for each l, we can store the two input strings. Then, for each l, we can check if the two strings are the same. If they are, then assign P to the first one and S to the second. Otherwise, assign P to the one that matches the prefix.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each l in 1..n-1:\n\n   get the two input strings of length l, say str1 and str2.\n\n   if str1 == str2:\n\n      assign P to the first occurrence (str1) and S to the second (str2)\n\n   else:\n\n      check which one is the prefix of s for length l. Assign P to that one, and S to the other.\n\nBut how to know which input string is the first occurrence? Because the input strings are given in arbitrary order, and for each l, the two strings may appear in any order in the input.\n\nSo the code needs to group the input strings by their length, and for each l, store the two input strings. Then, for each l, process the two strings, and for the output, when the input string is one of them, assign accordingly.\n\nBut how to map back to the original input order?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, during the code's processing, once we have the candidate s, we can process all the input strings in order, and for each, determine whether it is the prefix or suffix of s for its length.\n\nBut how to handle the case when the input string is the same as both prefix and suffix?\n\nFor example, for a given input string of length l, which is equal to pre_l and suf_l (because they are the same), we need to assign P or S, but ensure that for the two strings of that l, one is P and one is S.\n\nBut how to track this?\n\nPerhaps, for each l, the code can keep a count of how many P's have been assigned so far. But that's complicated.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nOnce the candidate s is found, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, assign P. Else, assign S. However, for each l, if both input strings are prefixes (i.e., they are the same as the prefix), then we have to assign one P and one S. But how to detect that?\n\nThis seems tricky. However, perhaps in practice, the code can proceed with the initial approach, and if for some l, both input strings are assigned P, then the code can flip one of them to S. But how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, the code can generate a list of all the input strings, and for each, check if it's a prefix. Then, for each l, check if there are two P's. If so, change one of them to S.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps manageable.\n\nBut considering that the problem is easy, and the sample inputs show that when there are two same strings for a certain l, the code can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that in code?\n\nMaybe the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce the candidate s is found, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. For each l, if there are two input strings of that l and both are prefixes (i.e., equal to pre_l), then we can assign one as P and the other as S. But how to track which ones are which?\n\nBut how can we know that? Well, for each l, the two input strings must be the same (since pre_l = suf_l). So for the code, during the processing of the input strings, when we encounter the first occurrence of that string for l, assign P, and the next occurrence assign S.\n\nBut how to track that?\n\nThis requires that for each l, the code keeps track of how many times it has seen the string so far. For example, for a given l, the first occurrence of the string is assigned P, the second is assigned S.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThe code can create a dictionary, for each l, that tracks the count of how many times the string has been processed for that l. For example, for each l, when processing an input string of that l:\n\n   if the string is the same as pre_l (which is same as suf_l):\n\n      if this is the first occurrence of this string for l, assign P.\n\n      else assign S.\n\nBut how to track this?\n\nThis seems possible, but requires additional bookkeeping.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of this problem, since the input is guaranteed to be valid, and the code has already found a candidate s, the code can proceed with the following steps:\n\nFor each input string in order:\n\n   l = len(string)\n\n   if string == s[:l]:\n\n       if the number of P's assigned so far for this l is 0:\n\n           assign P\n\n       else:\n\n           assign S\n\n   else:\n\n       assign S\n\nBut how to track the number of P's assigned for each l?\n\nThe code can have a dictionary, say, count_p, which for each l, stores how many P's have been assigned so far for that l.\n\nSo for each input string:\n\n   l = len(string)\n\n   if string == s[:l]:\n\n       if count_p[l] < 1:\n\n           assign P, increment count_p[l]\n\n       else:\n\n           assign S\n\n   else:\n\n       assign S\n\nBut this would work for cases where the two input strings for l are the same as the prefix (so both are assigned P and S). For example, if the first input string for l is the prefix, assign P. The second input string for l is also the prefix, but since count_p[l] is now 1, assign S.\n\nThis would ensure that for each l, exactly one P and one S are assigned.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the first input string is the prefix, and the second is the suffix? For example, for l=2, the first input string is the prefix, the second is the suffix. Then, the first would be assigned P, the second would be assigned S. Which is correct.\n\nIn the case where the first is the suffix and the second is the prefix, the first",

The solution involves generating potential candidate strings based on the given input and then validating these candidates against the input strings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Candidate Strings**: The candidate string `s` can be derived from the two longest improper prefixes and suffixes (of length `n-1`). For each pair of these strings, we generate two potential candidate strings by appending the last character of one string to the other.\n2. **Validate Candidates**: For each candidate string, check if all given input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of the candidate string.\n3. **Determine Assignments**: Once a valid candidate string is found, assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string based on whether it is a prefix or suffix of the candidate string.
