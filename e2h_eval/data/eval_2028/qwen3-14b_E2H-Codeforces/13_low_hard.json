For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine whether a given triad of notes forms a major chord, minor chord, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor definitions.\n\nFirst, let me understand the definitions again. \n\nA major triad has X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones, and Y to Z is 3. So total from X to Z is 7. But since the notes are cyclic, I need to calculate the distances properly.\n\nSimilarly, a minor triad requires X to Y is 3 semitones, Y to Z is 4. So total X to Z is 7 as well. Wait, but the order of the notes matters here. The problem says that the triad is unordered, but we can arrange them in some order to check the conditions.\n\nSo for the three notes, I need to check all permutations of them and see if any permutation satisfies either the major or minor condition.\n\nBut how do I compute the distance between two notes?\n\nFirst, I need to map each note to its position in the sequence. Let's list the notes in order:\n\nThe order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, the problem says that after H comes C again. So the list is cyclic. So the order is:\n\nLet me write them as a list. Let's think about the order:\n\nThe problem says: the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then after H comes C again. So the list is ordered as such. So each note can be assigned an index from 0 to 11. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc., up to H which is 11.\n\nSo, the distance between two notes X and Y is calculated as (Y's index - X's index) mod 12. Wait, but the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. Wait, the problem says that the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let's check that. Let's see:\n\nC is index 0. E is index 4. So the difference is 4 - 0 = 4. So that's correct. But if the notes are E and C, then the distance is 8 semitones? Because the problem says that between E and C is 8. Because the distance is measured from lower to upper. So when you have two notes, the distance is computed as (target - source) mod 12, but if the target is lower than the source, then it's (target + 12 - source). Wait, no. Let me think. For example, if X is E (index 4) and Y is C (index 0), then the distance from X to Y would be (0 -4 + 12) mod 12? Or maybe the distance is calculated as (Y's index - X's index) if positive, else (Y's index - X's index + 12). But according to the problem statement, the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones when moving from X upwards to Y. So for example, between C and E, moving up, it's 4 semitones. Between E and C, moving up, you have to go E -> F -> ... -> C, which is 8 semitones. So the distance is (Y - X) mod 12? No, because if Y is lower than X, then (Y - X) would be negative. So perhaps the distance is (Y - X + 12) % 12? Wait, but for example, X is C (0), Y is E (4): 4-0=4. Correct. If X is E (4), Y is C (0): 0 -4 = -4, but adding 12 gives 8. Which matches the example. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but since the problem defines the distance as the number of semitones moving upwards from X to Y, which is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y - X + 12). Which is equivalent to (Y - X) % 12, but since the problem says that the distance is always taken from the lower to upper, so for any two distinct notes, the distance is (Y - X) if Y > X, else (Y - X + 12). Wait, but in the problem statement, the",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they fit the definitions of major or minor chords.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note to its corresponding index in a predefined list of musical notes. This helps in calculating distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two notes using their indices. The distance is computed as the number of semitones from the lower note to the upper note, considering the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: For each permutation of the three notes, check if they form a major or minor chord based on the defined distances:\n   - A major chord requires a distance of 4 semitones between the first and second note, and 3 semitones between the second and third note.\n   - A minor chord requires a distance of 3 semitones between the first and second note, and 4 semitones between the second and third note.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_index(note):\n    notes = [\"C\", \"C#\", \"D\", \"D#\", \"E\", \"F\", \"F#\", \"G\", \"G#\", \"A\", \"B\", \"H\"]\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef distance(a, b):\n    # Calculate the distance from a to b in semitones\n    a_idx = note_to_index(a)\n    b_idx = note_to_index(b)\n    return (b_idx - a_idx) % 12\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    d1 = distance(x, y)\n    d2 = distance(y, z)\n    return d1 == 4 and d2 == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    d1 = distance(x, y)\n    d2 = distance(y, z)\n    return d1 == 3 and d2 == 4\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        if is_major(x, y, z):\n            return \"major\"\n        if is_minor(x, y, z):\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    result = classify_chord(notes)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_to_index` function converts each note to its corresponding index in the list of musical notes, which simplifies distance calculations.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The `distance` function computes the number of semitones between two notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Chord Classification**: The `classify_chord` function checks all permutations of the three input notes. It uses helper functions `is_major` and `is_minor` to determine if any permutation fits the criteria for a major or minor chord. If none match, it returns \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible orderings of the notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.",
