For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor definitions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of major and minor triads. \n\nFor a major triad: there must be an ordering X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones, and Y to Z is 3 semitones. So total from X to Z would be 7. But since the notes are cyclic, I need to calculate distances properly.\n\nFor a minor triad: the distances should be 3 and then 4 semitones. So same structure but reversed.\n\nSo the approach is: for the three given notes, generate all possible permutations (since the order matters for checking the distances), and for each permutation, check if it meets the major or minor conditions.\n\nBut how do I calculate the distance between two notes?\n\nThe notes are in a cyclic order. Let me first create a list of the notes in order, so that I can find their positions. For example, the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then, each note has an index from 0 to 11. The distance between two notes is (target - start) mod 12, but since the problem says that the distance is measured from lower to upper, maybe we need to consider the direction. Wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of semitones from X to Y along the scale. So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Because C to C# is 1, C# to D is another, etc. Let me count:\n\nC to C is 0, C to C# is 1, C to D is 2, D is 3, D# is 4, E is 5? Wait, wait. Wait the problem says that between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone. So the list of notes is ordered in sequence, each adjacent pair is one semitone apart. So the distance between C and E would be 4 semitones. Let me count:\n\nC to C# is 1, C# to D is 2, D to D# is 3, D# to E is 4. Oh right, so the distance from C to E is 4 semitones. So the way to calculate the distance between two notes is (target_index - start_index) mod 12? But wait, if the target is after the start, then the distance is target - start. If it's before, then it's (target + 12 - start) ?\n\nWait, no. Because the distance is measured as the number of semitones from the lower note to the upper note. So for example, if you have X and Y, and X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y's index minus X's index. But if Y is lower than X, then the distance is (Y's index + 12 - X's index)? No, wait. Because the notes are arranged in a circle. For example, the distance from E to C would be 8 semitones. Because E to F is 1, F to F# 2, F# to G 3, G to G# 4, G# to A 5, A to B 6, B to H 7, H to C 8. So yes, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12? No, because when Y is before X, the distance is (Y + 12 - X). But how do I compute that?\n\nAlternatively, the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) if y_index > x_index, else (y_index + 12 - x_index). But that's equivalent to (y_index - x_index) % 12? Wait, no. Because for example, if x is E (index 4?), and y is C (index 0). Then (0 - 4) is -4, mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance from X to Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12? But wait, in the case where Y is higher than X, like X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then (4-0) mod 12 is 4. Which is correct. So yes, the distance from X to Y is (y_index - x_index) mod ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they fit the criteria for either a major or minor triad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Representation**: Represent each note as an index in a predefined list of notes. This helps in calculating the distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two notes using their indices. The distance from note X to note Y is computed as `(y_index - x_index) % 12`, which accounts for the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: For each permutation of the three notes, check if the distances between the first and second note, and the second and third note, match the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n4. **Classification**: Based on the distances found, classify the triad as major, minor, or strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_index(note):\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    # Check if X to Y is 4 semitones and Y to Z is 3\n    dist_xy = (note_to_index(y) - note_to_index(x)) % 12\n    dist_yz = (note_to_index(z) - note_to_index(y)) % 12\n    return dist_xy == 4 and dist_yz == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    # Check if X to Y is 3 semitones and Y to Z is 4\n    dist_xy = (note_to_index(y) - note_to_index(x)) % 12\n    dist_yz = (note_to_index(z) - note_to_index(y)) % 12\n    return dist_xy == 3 and dist_yz == 4\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        if is_major(x, y, z):\n            return \"major\"\n        if is_minor(x, y, z):\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\n# Read input and process\nimport sys\n\ninput_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nnotes = input_line.split()\n\nresult = classify_chord(notes)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Index Conversion**: The `note_to_index` function converts a note name to its corresponding index in the predefined list of notes, facilitating distance calculations.\n2. **Distance Checks**: The functions `is_major` and `is_minor` check if the distances between the notes in a given permutation meet the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n3. **Permutations Check**: The `classify_chord` function generates all permutations of the input notes and checks each permutation against the criteria for major and minor triads.\n4. **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, processed, and the result is printed based on the classification of the chord.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible orderings of the notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.",
