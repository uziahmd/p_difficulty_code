Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The existing cards have numbers that don't exceed x in absolute value, and he can use any numbers from -x to x, but each card is a single integer. \n\nSo the approach here is to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. The goal is to make the total sum zero, so we need to add some cards whose total sum is -S. But each of these added cards can contribute between -x and x. We need to find the minimal number of cards required to reach exactly -S.\n\nWait, right. So for example, if the current sum is S, then the required sum from the new cards is -S. Let's call this target T = -S. \n\nThe question now is: what's the minimal number of cards needed to get a sum of T, where each card contributes between -x and x. \n\nLet me think about how to compute this. For example, if T is zero, then no cards are needed. Otherwise, each card can contribute at most x (if positive) or -x (if negative). So, the minimal number of cards would be determined by the maximum possible contribution per card. \n\nLet me think: for the target T, the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but only if T is not zero. Wait, but maybe there's a way to adjust with some combination. For example, suppose T is 5 and x is 2. Then each card can contribute up to 2. So 5 divided by 2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards. Because 2+2+1=5. But since each card can be any value between -x and x, but the sum must be exactly T. So the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |T| divided by x. But wait, let me check:\n\nIf T is 5, x is 2. The maximum per card is 2. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(5/2) = 3. Because 2*2=4, which is less than 5. So you need three cards. For example, 2 + 2 + 1 = 5. But since each card can be any value between -x and x, including 1. So yes. So the minimal number is ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, what if T is 3 and x is 2? Then 3/2 is 1.5, so ceil is 2. Which would be 2+1=3. But with two cards. So that's correct. \n\nBut what if T is 0? Then zero cards are needed. So the answer is zero. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the given cards. Let's call it S.\n\n2. Compute T = -S. If T is zero, return 0.\n\n3. Otherwise, compute the minimal number of cards needed to reach sum T, with each card contributing between -x and x. \n\nBut how to compute that? Well, the minimal number is ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, let me think again. Suppose T is 5, x is 2. So |T| is 5. Divided by x is 5/2 = 2.5. Ceil is 3. Which is correct. Similarly, if T is 4, x is 2: 4/2=2. So two cards. Which is correct. \n\nBut wait, what if T is 1 and x is 2? Then you can do it with one card. So 1/2 is 0.5, ceil is 1. Which is correct. \n\nYes, so the formula is: if T is zero, 0. Else, ceil( |T| / x ). \n\nWait, but why can't there be a case where you can do it with fewer cards? For example, if T is 3 and x is 3. Then |T| is 3, divided by x is 1. So 1 card. Which is correct. Because you can just take 3. \n\nAnother example: T is 4, x is 3. Then |T| is 4. Divided by 3 is 1.333..., ceil is 2. So two cards. How? 3 + 1 = 4. So two cards. Which is correct. \n\nSo the formula seems to hold. \n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute the sum S of the given cards. Then compute T = -S. If T is zero, return 0. Otherwise, compute ceil( |T| / x ). \n\nWait",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards equals zero. The cards can have values ranging from -x to x, where x is a given maximum absolute value.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum required to balance the current sum to zero is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards Needed**: If the target sum is non-zero, the minimum number of cards required is determined by dividing the absolute value of the target sum by the maximum absolute value (x) and taking the ceiling of this division. This is because each card can contribute at most x towards balancing the sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        n, x = map(int, line.split())\n        numbers = list(map(int, input[len(input)-1].split()))\n        total = sum(numbers)\n        target = -total\n        if target == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            print(math.ceil(abs(target) / x))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input and split into lines for processing.\n- **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed to determine the target sum needed to balance it to zero.\n- **Target Check**: If the target sum is zero, immediately return 0 as no additional cards are needed.\n- **Ceiling Division**: For non-zero targets, the minimum number of cards required is calculated using ceiling division of the absolute target sum by the maximum allowed value (x). This ensures we account for the maximum possible contribution per card efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of cards required using basic arithmetic operations, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
