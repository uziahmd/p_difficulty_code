    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest one.\n\nHmm. Let me think about the problem. Let's denote x = a +k and y = b +k. Then, since k is non-negative, x and y are at least a and b respectively. But since k is the same for both, the difference between x and y is (b - a). Wait, because (b +k) - (a +k) = b -a. So, the difference between the two numbers is fixed as (b - a). Let me assume that a and b are such that a < b. Wait, but maybe I should first consider the case where a and b are swapped. Because if a is larger than b, then the difference would be negative. But in any case, the absolute difference between x and y is |a - b|.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose a is 6 and b is 10. Then, when k is 2, x is 8, y is 12. Their difference is 4. Which is (10-6)=4. So yes, the difference between x and y is fixed as (b - a) if a < b. So, in general, the difference between x and y is d = |a - b|. Let me call this d.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding two numbers x and y such that their difference is d, and their LCM is minimized. Then, find the smallest k that gives this.\n\nBut how do I find such x and y?\n\nLet me recall that LCM(x, y) = x * y / GCD(x, y). Since x and y have a fixed difference d, perhaps I can find some way to express them in terms of their GCD.\n\nLet me think: Let's suppose that x and y are such that x = m * g, y = n * g, where GCD(m, n) = 1. Then, their LCM is m*n*g. Also, since x and y differ by d, we have |m -n| *g = d. Wait, because x - y = (m -n)*g = d (assuming x > y). But since d is fixed, perhaps we can find possible pairs (m, n) such that (m -n) divides d.\n\nAlternatively, since x and y differ by d, let's say that x = y + d. Or y = x +d, depending on which is larger. Let me assume that a <= b. Then, since k is non-negative, adding k to both a and b would make x and y such that y = x + (b -a). So, if I let x be a +k, then y = x + d, where d is (b -a). So, the problem becomes finding x such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized. Then, the minimal LCM will be achieved for some x, and then k is x -a (since x = a +k).\n\nBut how do I find x?\n\nThe LCM of x and x +d is equal to x*(x +d)/gcd(x, x+d). But since gcd(x, x +d) = gcd(x, d). Let me denote g = gcd(x, d). Then, LCM(x, x +d) = x*(x +d)/g.\n\nBut since d is fixed, perhaps we can find x such that x and x +d share as large a GCD as possible. Because dividing by a larger GCD would make the LCM smaller.\n\nSo, the idea is to find x such that gcd(x, d) is as large as possible. But how?\n\nAlternatively, since x and x +d have a gcd equal to gcd(x, d), let me denote that g. So, let me write x = g * m, and d = g * n. Then, since x and d have a gcd of g, m and n must be coprime. Also, since d = g * n, then n must divide d/g. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me think again. Let me suppose that g = gcd(x, d). Then, x = g * m, and d = g * n, where m and n are coprime. Then, since x +d = g*m + g*n = g*(m +n). Therefore, the LCM of x and x +d is LCM(gm, g(m +n)) = g * LCM(m, m +n). Since m and m +n have a GCD of gcd(m, m +n) = gcd(m, n) = 1 (since m and n are coprime). Therefore, LCM(m, m +n) is m*(m +n). Therefore, the overall LCM is g * m * (m +n) = g*m*(m +n).\n\nBut since d = g * n, then n = d/g. Therefore, substituting, we get that the LCM is g * m * (m + d/g). But since x = g*m, and x can be any number such that x is a multiple of g, and m and n = d/g are coprime.\n\nBut what is m here? Well, since x = g*m, and n = d/g, which is an integer. Also, since m and n are coprime, m must be such that it is coprime with n = d/g.\n\nBut how does this help us find the minimal LCM?\n\nThe LCM is g * m * (m + (d/g)). Let me denote t = m. Then, the expression becomes g * t * (t + (d/g)).\n\nBut since d is fixed, and g is a divisor of d, perhaps we can iterate over all possible divisors of d, and for each possible divisor g, find the minimal value of the expression.\n\nWait, but d is |a - b|. Let me compute d as the absolute difference between a and b. Let me first handle the case where a == b. In that case, d is zero. Then, x and y are both a +k, so their LCM is x. To minimize x, we take k=0. So the answer is 0. That's an easy case.\n\nOtherwise, when a != b, then d is positive. Let me assume that a < b, so d = b -a. Then, the problem is to find x such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized. Then, the minimal LCM is achieved when x is chosen such that the expression g * t * (t + (d/g)) is minimized, where g is a divisor of d, and t is a positive integer coprime with (d/g).\n\nWait, but how do I find the optimal g and t?\n\nAlternatively, since the LCM of x and x +d is x*(x +d)/g, where g is gcd(x, d). Let me think about how to minimize this expression. For a fixed d, perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when x is as small as possible, but that may not be the case. For example, in the sample input where a=6 and b=10, d=4. Then, x is 6 +k. For k=0, x=6, y=10. LCM(6,10) is 30. For k=2, x=8, y=12. LCM is 24. Which is better. So here, even though x is larger, the LCM is smaller.\n\nSo, how can I find the optimal x?\n\nAnother approach: since x and x +d have a difference of d, their LCM is minimized when they share as many factors as possible. For example, if x and x +d are multiples of some large number, then their LCM would be smaller.\n\nLet me think of x as being such that x and x +d share a common divisor. Let me say that their GCD is g. Then, since x and x +d have GCD g, then g divides d. Because x +d -x = d. So, the GCD of x and d must be g. So, for each possible divisor g of d, we can look for x such that x is a multiple of g, and x is congruent to -d mod something?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible divisor g of d, we can consider that the GCD of x and d is exactly g. Then, x = g * m, and d = g * n, where m and n are coprime. Then, x +d = g(m +n). The GCD of x and x +d is g * gcd(m, m +n) = g * gcd(m, n) = g * 1 = g, since m and n are coprime. So, the LCM is (x * (x +d )) / g = (g m * g (m +n )) / g = g m (m +n) = g m (m + (d/g)).\n\nSo, given that d is fixed, and for each possible divisor g of d, we can choose m such that m is coprime with (d/g) (since n = d/g). Then, the expression becomes g * m * (m + (d/g)).\n\nBut since m must be coprime with n = d/g, and m can be any positive integer, but we want to minimize the expression.\n\nFor each possible g (divisor of d), what is the minimal value of this expression?\n\nWell, for a fixed g, the term is g * m * (m + (d/g)), and m must be coprime with (d/g). Let's denote k = d/g. Then, the expression becomes g * m * (m + k), where m and k are coprime.\n\nBut since k is fixed for a given g, what's the minimal value of m*(m +k) given that m and k are coprime?\n\nWell, m must be a positive integer. Let's think about m. The minimal value of m*(m +k) occurs when m is as small as possible. However, m must be coprime with k.\n\nSo, for example, if k is 4 (as in the first sample), then the minimal m is 1, since 1 and 4 are coprime. Then the product is 1*5=5. Multiply by g (which was 4 in that case?), wait no. Let me recheck.\n\nIn the first sample, d is 4. Let's take g as 4. Then, k = d/g = 4/4 = 1. Then m must be coprime with 1. All m are coprime with 1. So the minimal m is 1. The expression is 4 * 1 * (1 + 1) = 8. But wait, in the sample, when k=2, x = 8, which is 6 + 2 = 8. Then, x =8, which is g*m =4*2? Wait, maybe I messed up the variables here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express this. Let me take the first sample where a=6 and b=10, so d=4. For this case, the optimal x is 8. Then, x=8. So, x is 8, which is equal to g * m. Also, d=4 = g * n. So, for example, if g is 4, then n is 1, and m is 2. Then, m and n are coprime (since 2 and 1 are coprime). The expression becomes 4 * 2 * (2 + 1) = 4 * 2 *3 = 24, which is the LCM of 8 and 12. Which matches the sample. But in this case, the minimal m for this g is 2? How does that fit with the earlier idea that m is as small as possible?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake here. For each g, the minimal m is 1 if possible, but that depends on whether m and k are coprime. So, for example, in the case where k = d/g is 1 (as in the above case where g=4), then m can be 1, which is coprime with 1. Then, the expression would be 4 * 1 * (1+1) = 8. But that would imply that x is 4*1 =4. Then, x +d is 4 +4 =8. The LCM of 4 and 8 is 8. Which is better than the 24 in the sample. But why isn't this the case?\n\nWait, but in this scenario, x is 4, and since x is a +k, which is 6 +k. So 6 +k =4 → k = -2. Which is invalid since k must be non-negative. Oh right! So, x has to be at least a (since k is non-negative). So, when considering possible values of x, we have to ensure that x >= a and x +d >= b. Wait, but since d = b -a, x +d = (a +k) + (b -a) = b +k. Which is >=b. So, x has to be >=a, but also, when choosing x, we need to have x = a +k ≥ a, which implies that k ≥0. So, for each candidate x, it must be ≥a.\n\nTherefore, when considering possible x values, we have to ensure that x ≥a. So, in the case where x is 4, which is less than a (6), that's invalid. Therefore, even though mathematically the LCM would be 8, it's not allowed because k would be negative.\n\nSo, this suggests that for each possible divisor g of d, we need to find the minimal m (coprime with k =d/g) such that x =g*m ≥a. And then calculate the corresponding LCM for that x and choose the minimal one across all possible g.\n\nBut how do I proceed?\n\nFirst, compute d = |a -b|. If d is zero, then return 0.\n\nElse, compute d. Then, generate all possible divisors of d. For each divisor g of d, we can compute k = d/g. Then, find the minimal m such that m is coprime with k, and x = g*m ≥a. Once we find that m, compute the LCM for that x, and track the minimal LCM and the corresponding k.\n\nBut how do I generate all the divisors of d?\n\nWell, for d up to 1e9, generating all the divisors can be done efficiently. But first, we need to factorize d into primes, then generate all possible combinations. However, factorizing a number up to 1e9 is feasible with trial division, especially since the maximum number of primes to check is up to sqrt(1e9) which is 3e4 or so.\n\nOnce we have all the divisors, for each divisor g, we can process it.\n\nBut perhaps there's another approach. For example, for each possible divisor g of d, the minimal m is the smallest integer ≥ ceil(a/(g)) such that m is coprime with k =d/g. Then, once we find that m, the corresponding x is g*m, and the corresponding k is x -a.\n\nBut how do I find the minimal m ≥ m_min (where m_min = ceil(a/g)) that is coprime with k?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal m is either m_min or m_min + 1, etc., but checking for coprimality. However, for large values of m_min, this could be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible divisor g of d, we can compute the minimal x ≥a such that x is a multiple of g, and x/g is coprime with k =d/g.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For a given g, the x must be a multiple of g, so x = g * m. Also, m must be coprime with k =d/g. Also, x must be ≥a → m ≥ ceil(a/g). So, the minimal m is the smallest integer ≥ ceil(a/g) that is coprime with k. Once found, the corresponding x is g*m, and the corresponding k is x -a.\n\nSo, for each divisor g of d, we can compute the minimal m for that g, and then compute the LCM for that x and track the minimal LCM.\n\nBut how do I find the minimal m for each g?\n\nLet me think of an example. Let's take the first sample where a=6, b=10, d=4. The divisors of d are 1, 2, 4.\n\nTake g=4. Then, k =d/g =1. So, m must be coprime with 1. Any m is coprime with 1. So, m_min is ceil(6/4) = 2. So, m=2. Then x=4*2=8. The corresponding k is 8-6=2. Which is the sample's answer.\n\nNow, take g=2. Then, k =d/g =4/2=2. m must be coprime with 2. So, m must be odd. The minimal m is ceil(6/2) =3. But 3 is odd. So m=3. Then x=2*3=6. The corresponding k is 6-6=0. Now, check LCM of 6 and 6+4=10. Which is 30. Which is higher than 24. So, this is worse than the previous case.\n\nAnother divisor is 1. Then, k =d/g =4. So m must be coprime with 4. The minimal m is ceil(6/1) =6. Check if 6 is coprime with 4. GCD(6,4) is 2. Not coprime. So, next m is 7. GCD(7,4)=1. So m=7. x=1*7=7. k=7-6=1. Then, LCM of 7 and 11 is 77, which is worse than 24.\n\nSo, among all divisors, the minimal LCM is achieved when g=4 and m=2, giving LCM 24.\n\nSo, the approach seems to work. The problem now is, for each divisor g of d, find the minimal m ≥ m_min (ceil(a/g)) that is coprime with k=d/g. Then compute the LCM for that x and track the minimal.\n\nBut how do I find this minimal m for each g?\n\nThe steps for each g:\n\nCompute k = d/g.\n\nCompute m_min = ceil(a/g). Because x must be >=a, so g*m >=a → m >= a/g. Since m is integer, m_min is ceil(a/g).\n\nThen, starting from m_min, check if m is coprime with k. If yes, take it. Else, increment m until you find one.\n\nBut for large values of m_min, this could take a long time. However, considering that d is up to 1e9, and the number of divisors is small (for example, even for 1e9, the number of divisors is 100 or so), this might be manageable.\n\nBut what's the worst case? For example, if k is even, and m_min is even, then the first candidate is m_min. If it's not coprime, then m_min +1. But if k is even, then m_min +1 may be even or odd. So, in the worst case, we might have to check a few numbers.\n\nBut how can we find the minimal m quickly?\n\nAnother idea: the minimal m is the first number ≥ m_min that is coprime with k. Since k can be up to d/g. For example, if g is 1, then k =d. Which can be up to 1e9. But for each m starting from m_min, we can check if gcd(m, k) is 1.\n\nBut for each g, this check is O(1) with the Euclidean algorithm, and for each g, the number of checks needed is small. For example, for m_min, if it's coprime with k, then done. Else, check m_min +1, etc. But since the numbers are consecutive, there's a high chance that one of them is coprime with k.\n\nBut in the worst case, for example, if k is a prime number, and m_min is k, then m_min is not coprime (since m_min =k, which shares a factor of k). Then, m_min +1 would be k+1, which is coprime with k (since consecutive integers are coprime). So, in that case, only two checks.\n\nThus, for each g, this seems manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = abs(a - b). If d is zero, return 0.\n\n2. Else, generate all divisors of d.\n\n3. For each divisor g of d:\n\n   a. Compute k_val = d / g.\n\n   b. Compute m_min = ceil(a / g). Since x = g * m must be >= a.\n\n   c. Find the minimal m >= m_min such that gcd(m, k_val) == 1.\n\n   d. Once found, compute x_candidate = g * m.\n\n   e. Compute the corresponding k_candidate = x_candidate - a.\n\n   f. Compute the LCM of x_candidate and x_candidate +d (which is (x_candidate +d) = (g*m +d) = g*m + g*k_val = g*(m +k_val)).\n\n      LCM(x_candidate, x_candidate +d) = (x_candidate * (x_candidate +d)) / gcd(x_candidate, x_candidate +d). But since x_candidate and x_candidate +d have a gcd of g (since x_candidate =g*m, and x_candidate +d =g*(m +k_val). Since k_val =d/g, and d =g*k_val. Also, since m and k_val are coprime (because m is chosen to be coprime with k_val), the GCD of x_candidate and x_candidate +d is g * gcd(m, m +k_val) = g * gcd(m, k_val) = g * 1 = g. Therefore, LCM is (g*m * g*(m +k_val)) / g = g * m * (m +k_val).\n\n   So, the LCM is g * m * (m + k_val).\n\n   So, for each candidate, we can compute this value and track the minimum.\n\n4. After considering all divisors, select the candidate with the minimal LCM. If multiple candidates have the same LCM, choose the one with the smallest k_candidate.\n\nBut wait, there's another possibility. What about the case where x_candidate is not the minimal possible? For example, perhaps there's a smaller k_candidate that is not generated by this method. How do we know that this approach covers all possibilities?\n\nBecause the approach considers all possible divisors g of d, which are the possible GCDs of x and d. Since the GCD of x and d must be a divisor of d. Thus, by considering all possible divisors, we cover all possible scenarios.\n\nBut is there a case where the optimal x is not generated by this approach? For example, if the optimal x has a GCD with d that is not a divisor of d? No, because the GCD of x and d must divide d. So, all possibilities are covered.\n\nTherefore, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the next steps are:\n\nImplementing the code.\n\nFirst, generate all divisors of d.\n\nHow to generate all divisors of d?\n\nWe can do this by factorizing d into its prime factors, then generating all possible products of the exponents.\n\nBut for numbers up to 1e9, trial division is feasible.\n\nOnce we have the list of divisors, we can process each of them.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute d = abs(a -b). If d is zero, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nGenerate all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g in the divisors:\n\n   compute k_val = d // g.\n\n   compute m_min = ceil(a / g). How to compute this? Well, in Python, m_min = (a + g -1) // g.\n\n   Now, find the minimal m >= m_min such that gcd(m, k_val) == 1.\n\n   Once found, compute x_candidate = g * m.\n\n   Then, compute the corresponding k_candidate = x_candidate -a.\n\n   Also, compute the LCM value for this candidate.\n\nOnce all candidates are considered, select the one with the minimal LCM. If multiple candidates have same LCM, choose the one with the smallest k_candidate.\n\nAdditionally, there's another case: when x_candidate is such that x_candidate +d is smaller than x_candidate. Wait, no, since d is positive, x_candidate +d is larger than x_candidate. So, the LCM is calculated correctly.\n\nBut wait, what about when a is larger than b? For example, a=10, b=6, then d=4. The same logic applies, because we take d as absolute difference. So, the code can proceed regardless of which is larger.\n\nBut in the code, when we compute x_candidate, we have to make sure that x_candidate is a +k, and that the other number is b +k. But since d is |a -b|, and the code is based on the difference, it should be okay.\n\nBut let's think about when a > b. For example, a=10, b=6. Then, d=4. The code proceeds as before. Then, x_candidate is a +k, but in this case, since a is larger than b, adding k to both would make x_candidate = a +k, and the other number is b +k = x_candidate - (a -b) = x_candidate -d. So, the same logic applies, because the difference is still d. So, the code is correct regardless of a and b.\n\nSo, the code proceeds.\n\nNow, the problem is generating all the divisors of d.\n\nLet me think about writing a function to generate all divisors of a number.\n\nFunction to generate all divisors of n:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) +1):\n\n        if n % i ==0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nBut for n=0? Well, in our case, d is non-zero.\n\nOnce the divisors are generated, we can process them.\n\nBut for each divisor, we need to consider both the divisor and its complement? For example, for 4, the divisors are 1, 2, 4. So, the code above would generate them correctly.\n\nNow, for each divisor, process as per the steps.\n\nOnce all candidates are generated, select the best one.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: input 6 10 → d=4.\n\nDivisors of 4 are 1, 2, 4.\n\nProcessing each:\n\nFor g=1:\n\nk_val =4/1=4.\n\nm_min = ceil(6/1) =6.\n\nFind m >=6 coprime with 4. 6 and 4 have GCD 2. Next m=7, GCD(7,4)=1. So m=7. x_candidate=1*7=7. k_candidate =7-6=1. LCM is 1 *7*(7 +4) = 7*11=77.\n\nFor g=2:\n\nk_val =4/2=2.\n\nm_min =ceil(6/2)=3. Check if 3 and 2 are coprime. Yes. So m=3. x_candidate=2*3=6. k_candidate=6-6=0. LCM is 2 *3*(3 +2) = 2*3*5=30.\n\nFor g=4:\n\nk_val =4/4=1. m_min=ceil(6/4)=2. Check m=2. GCD(2,1)=1. So yes. x_candidate=4*2=8. k_candidate=8-6=2. LCM=4 *2 * (2 +1) = 4*2*3=24.\n\nSo, the minimal LCM is 24, with k_candidate 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is 5 and 10. d=5. So divisors are 1,5.\n\nFor g=1:\n\nk_val=5. m_min =ceil(5/1)=5. Check if 5 and 5 are coprime? GCD(5,5) is 5. Not coprime. Next m=6. GCD(6,5)=1. So m=6. x_candidate=6. k_candidate=6-5=1. LCM is 1*6*(6+5) =6*11=66.\n\nFor g=5:\n\nk_val=5/5=1. m_min=ceil(5/5)=1. Check m=1. GCD(1,1)=1. So yes. x_candidate=5*1=5. k_candidate=5-5=0. LCM is 5 *1*(1+1)=5*2=10. Which is better. So the answer is 0, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is 21 and 31. d=10. Divisors of 10 are 1,2,5,10.\n\nLet's process each:\n\nFor g=1:\n\nk_val=10. m_min=ceil(21/1)=21. Check if 21 and 10 are coprime. GCD(21,10)=1. So m=21. x_candidate=21. k_candidate=0. LCM is 1*21*(21 +10) =21 *31=651.\n\nFor g=2:\n\nk_val=10/2=5. m_min=ceil(21/2) =11. Check if 11 and 5 are coprime. Yes. So m=11. x_candidate=2*11=22. k_candidate=22-21=1. LCM=2 *11*(11+5) = 2*11*16=352.\n\nFor g=5:\n\nk_val=10/5=2. m_min=ceil(21/5)=5. Check m=5. GCD(5,2)=1? Yes. So x_candidate=5*5=25. k_candidate=25-21=4. LCM=5 *5*(5+2) =5*5*7=175.\n\nFor g=10:\n\nk_val=10/10=1. m_min=ceil(21/10) =3. Check m=3. GCD(3,1)=1. So x_candidate=10*3=30. k_candidate=30-21=9. LCM=10*3*(3+1) =10*3*4=120. Which is better than 175. So this is better.\n\nBut wait, what about other divisors?\n\nSo the minimal LCM among these is 120. But according to the sample, the output is 9, which corresponds to this case.\n\nSo the answer is 9. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, the code needs to generate all divisors of d, process each as described, and select the best candidate.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the code.\n\nBut first, note that for each divisor, we can generate it once, but we need to process all of them.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple divisors leading to same LCM? For example, if two different divisors produce same LCM but different k_candidate, we need to choose the smallest k_candidate.\n\nSo, during processing, for each candidate, we track the minimal LCM, and for same LCM, the minimal k_candidate.\n\nNow, code steps in Python:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute d = abs(a -b). If d ==0, print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nGenerate all divisors of d.\n\nInitialize min_lcm = infinity, best_k = infinity.\n\nFor each g in divisors:\n\n   k_val = d // g\n\n   m_min = (a + g -1) // g\n\n   m = m_min\n\n   while True:\n\n       if gcd(m, k_val) == 1:\n\n           break\n\n       m +=1\n\n   x_candidate = g * m\n\n   current_k = x_candidate - a\n\n   # compute the LCM value for this candidate\n\n   lcm_value = g * m * (m + k_val)\n\n   # compare with current min_lcm and update accordingly.\n\n   if lcm_value < min_lcm or (lcm_value == min_lcm and current_k < best_k):\n\n       min_lcm = lcm_value\n\n       best_k = current_k\n\nOnce all divisors are processed, output best_k.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where there are multiple divisors leading to same LCM but different k? We need to choose the smallest k.\n\nBut in the code, during processing, for each candidate, we check if it's better than the current best.\n\nBut what about when the same LCM is found with a smaller k? For example, if two different g's generate same LCM but different k_candidate, we need to take the smaller one.\n\nBut the code as written would do that.\n\nBut what about when multiple m's are possible for the same g? For example, if there are multiple m's that are coprime with k_val, but the code picks the minimal m (the first one found). Which is correct, because that gives the minimal x_candidate for that g, leading to minimal k_candidate for that g.\n\nBut what if there's another m for the same g that gives the same LCM but smaller k_candidate? Well, since m is the minimal possible for that g, the k_candidate is minimal for that g. So, no need to check further.\n\nBut wait, for example, if m is minimal, but there exists a larger m for same g which gives same LCM but smaller k_candidate? Probably not. Because x_candidate increases as m increases, leading to higher k_candidate.\n\nSo, for a given g, the minimal m is the one that gives the minimal k_candidate for that g.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code can be written.\n\nBut what about the case when a is larger than b? Let's say a=10 and b=6, d=4. Then, the code proceeds as before, and for each g, m_min is computed as ceil(a/g). Which is correct, since x_candidate is a +k, and must be >=a.\n\nAnother edge case: when a=1 and b=1. Output 0.\n\nAnother edge case: a=1, b=2. d=1. Divisors of 1 are [1].\n\nProcessing g=1. k_val =1. m_min = ceil(1/1) =1. Check if m=1 is coprime with 1. Yes. x_candidate =1*1=1. current_k=1-1=0. LCM is 1 *1*(1 +1) = 2. Which is correct. The LCM of 1 and 2 is 2.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=4. d=2. Divisors are 1,2.\n\nFor g=1: k_val=2. m_min=ceil(2/1)=2. Check m=2. GCD(2,2)=2 !=1. Increment to 3. GCD(3,2)=1. x_candidate=3. current_k=3-2=1. LCM is 1 *3*(3+2)=15.\n\nFor g=2: k_val=1. m_min=ceil(2/2)=1. Check m=1. GCD(1,1)=1. x_candidate=2*1=2. current_k=0. LCM is 2 *1*(1+1)=4. Which is better. So answer is 0.\n\nWhich is correct: LCM(2,4) is 4.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut for generating the divisors, we need to generate all divisors of d. Let's code that.\n\nBut note that in the code, the divisors can be generated as follows.\n\nBut in Python, for a given d, generate all divisors.\n\nBut for the code, the code for generating the divisors is:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):\n\n        if n % i == 0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n\n    return list(divisors)\n\nBut for n=0? Well, in our code, d is non-zero.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut also, note that in the case where d is 0, we return 0.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef compute_gcd(a, b):\n\n    while b:\n\n        a, b = b, a % b\n\n    return a\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer $ k $ such that the least common multiple (LCM) of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is minimized. If there are multiple values of $ k $ that yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest $ k $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key insight is recognizing that the difference between $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is constant and equal to $ |a - b| $. Let's denote this difference as $ d $.\n2. **Divisors of Difference**: For each divisor $ g $ of $ d $, we can explore potential values of $ k $ by considering the structure of numbers that share common divisors with $ d $.\n3. **Finding Optimal $ k $**: For each divisor $ g $ of $ d $, we compute the minimum value of $ m $ such that $ m $ is coprime with $ d/g $ and $ g \\times m \\geq a $. This ensures that the resulting $ k $ is non-negative and minimizes the LCM.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n    return list(divisors)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    a = int(input[0])\n    b = int(input[1])\n    \n    d = abs(a - b)\n    if d == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = float('inf')\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        k_val = d // g\n        m_min = (a + g - 1) // g\n        m = m_min\n        while True:\n            if compute_gcd(m, k_val) == 1:\n                break\n            m += 1\n        x_candidate = g * m\n        current_k = x_candidate - a\n        lcm_value = g * m * (m + k_val)\n        \n        if lcm_value < min_lcm or (lcm_value == min_lcm and current_k < best_k):\n            min_lcm = lcm_value\n            best_k = current_k\n    \n    print(best_k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values $ a $ and $ b $ are read from standard input.\n2. **Difference Calculation**: Compute the absolute difference $ d $ between $ a $ and $ b $. If $ d $ is zero, the answer is immediately 0 since both values are the same.\n3. **Divisors Generation**: Generate all divisors of $ d $ using a function that checks up to the square root of $ d $ for efficiency.\n4. **Evaluating Each Divisor**: For each divisor $ g $ of $ d $, calculate the corresponding value $ k_val $ as $ d/g $. Determine the minimum $ m $ starting from $ \\text{ceil}(a/g) $ such that $ m $ is coprime with $ k_val $.\n5. **LCM Calculation**: For each valid $ m $, compute the candidate $ k $ and the corresponding LCM. Track the minimum LCM and the smallest $ k $ if there are ties.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all potential values of $ k $ by leveraging number theory properties and divisor analysis, leading to an optimal solution.",
