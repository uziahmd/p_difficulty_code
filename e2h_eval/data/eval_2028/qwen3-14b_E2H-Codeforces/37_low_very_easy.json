    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to permute the given array such that for every non-empty subset of indices (not including the full set or empty), the sum of elements in those positions in array a and array b are different. Wait, no, wait. Wait the problem says that for every non-empty subset S of the indices, the sum of elements in a and the sum of elements in b for those positions must be different? Or wait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: for every non-empty subset S of indices, the sum of elements on that positions in a and b are different. Wait, no. Wait, the wording is: \"the sums of elements on that positions in a and b are different\". Oh, I think that means that for each subset S, the sum of a's elements at those positions and the sum of b's elements at those positions are different. Wait, but that can't be right. Because if S is a subset of indices, then the sum in a would be sum(a_i for i in S), and the sum in b would be sum(b_i for i in S). And we need these two sums to be different for every non-empty subset S (with size between 1 and n-1).\n\nWait, but the problem says that the array b is a permutation of a. So the sum of all elements in a and b are the same. But for subsets S that are not the entire array, their sums can vary. However, the problem requires that for every subset S (non-empty, not the entire array), the sum of elements in a's positions S is different from the sum of elements in b's positions S. Wait, but how can that be possible?\n\nWait, for example, take n=2. Suppose the original array is [1,2]. Then the possible subsets S are {1}, {2}. For the original array a, the sum for S={1} is 1, and for S={2} is 2. Now, if we permute it as [2,1], then for S={1}, the sum is 2, and for S={2} it's 1. So for each subset, the sum in a and the sum in b are different. Which is why the sample input for n=2 outputs [2,1].\n\nBut how do we ensure that for all subsets S, the sum in a and the sum in b are different?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the array b is a permutation of a. So for any subset S, the sum of elements in a's positions S is sum_a_S, and in b's positions S is sum_b_S. We need sum_a_S != sum_b_S for all non-empty subsets S with size between 1 and n-1.\n\nBut how can we find such a permutation?\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. Since b is a permutation of a, then for any subset S, the sum of b's elements on S is equal to the sum of a's elements on some subset T (since permutation is just rearrangement). But how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to arrange the permutation such that for any subset S, the sum of the elements in the original array for S is different from the sum of the same subset in the permuted array. But since the permuted array is a rearrangement, the sum of any subset S in the permuted array is the same as the sum of some subset of the original array. But how can we ensure that for all S, the sum of S in a is not equal to the sum of S in b?\n\nWait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: for every non-empty subset S of indices, the sums of elements on that positions in a and b are different. Oh, wait, no. It says that the sums of elements on that positions in a and b are different. So for each subset S, sum_{i in S} a_i != sum_{i in S} b_i ?\n\nWait that's what it says. So for example, if the original array is [1,2], and the permuted array is [2,1], then for S = {1}, the sum in a is 1, sum in b is 2. They are different. For S = {2}, sum in a is 2, sum in b is 1. Different again. So that works.\n\nBut for larger n, how can we arrange that for all subsets S (non-empty, not the entire array) the sum of the subset in a and the sum in b are different?\n\nBut how can this be possible? Because for example, if n is 3, and the array is [1,2,3], then the sum of subset {1,2} in a is 3. If the permutation is [3",
    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to construct a permutation of the given array such that for every non-empty subset of indices (excluding the full set), the sum of the elements at those indices in the original and permuted arrays are different.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Permutation Constraint**: The array `b` must be a permutation of array `a`. This means the multiset of values remains the same, but their positions change.\n2. **Subset Sums**: For each non-empty subset of indices (excluding the full set), the sum of values in the original array at these indices should not equal the sum of values in the permuted array at these indices.\n3. **Efficient Strategy**: Since the number of elements is small (`n ≤ 22`), we can try all permutations of the array and check whether any of them satisfy the required condition.\n\n### Approach:\n\n- Generate all permutations of the input array.\n- For each permutation, verify the condition: for every non-empty subset of indices (excluding the full set), the sum of the original array at those indices should differ from the sum of the permuted array at those indices.\n- If a valid permutation is found, print it. Otherwise, print `-1`.\n\nThis brute-force approach is feasible due to the small constraint on `n`.\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:n+1]))\n    \n    # Generate all permutations of a\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(a):\n        valid = True\n        # Check all subsets of size from 1 to n-1\n        for k in range(1, n):\n            for subset in itertools.combinations(range(n), k):\n                sum_a = sum(a[i] for i in subset)\n                sum_b = sum(perm[i] for i in subset)\n                if sum_a == sum_b:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, perm)))\n            return\n    print(-1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Input Reading**: The input is read and parsed into the array `a`.\n- **Permutations Generation**: We generate all possible permutations of the array using `itertools.permutations`.\n- **Subset Sum Check**: For each permutation, we check all non-empty subsets of indices of sizes from 1 to `n-1`. For each subset, we compare the sum of the original array with the sum of the current permutation.\n- **Early Termination**: As soon as a valid permutation is found, it is printed and the program exits. If no valid permutation is found after checking all, `-1` is printed.\n\nThis solution ensures correctness by exhaustively checking all permutations and subset sums, leveraging the small constraint on `n` to remain efficient.",
