Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can reuse the burnt-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo the initial number of candles is a. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. The conversion rate is b: every b burnt candles can be made into a new one. And this new candle can be used again, burning for another hour, and so on.\n\nThe goal is to find the total number of hours possible.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down:\n\nInitially, he uses 4 candles. That's 4 hours. Then, those 4 burnt ones are converted into 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those, adding 2 hours. Now, those 2 are burnt. Convert them into 2/2 = 1 new. Use that, adding 1 hour. Now, that one is burnt. But 1 is less than b=2, so no more. Total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see. Initial 6 hours. Then 6 /3 = 2 new. Use them, +2 hours. Now, 2 burnt. Not enough for 3. So total 6+2=8? Wait but the sample output is 8. Yes. Oh right, but wait, maybe there's a way to collect more?\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about the process as a loop. Each time, after burning all available candles, collect the burnt ones, convert them into new ones, add to the available stock, and repeat until there's not enough to make a new one.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Start with a candles. Total hours is 0.\n\n- While there are candles to burn:\n\n   - Burn all available candles. Add the number to total hours.\n\n   - Collect the burnt ones (equal to the number burned), then convert them into new candles. The number of new candles is (number of burnt) // b.\n\n   - Set the available candles to the new number.\n\nBut wait, no. Because after burning, you have the burnt ones. Then, you can make new ones from them. But each time you make new ones, you can burn them again, which adds to the total.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize total_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nburnt_candles = 0\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nEach time, you can burn all the current candles. Then, collect the burnt ones, convert them into new ones. Then, the new ones become the current candles for the next iteration.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of it as:\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nwhile current_candles > 0:\n\n   total_hours += current_candles\n\n   burnt_candles = current_candles\n\n   current_candles = burnt_candles // b\n\nBut wait, that would be incorrect because in the first example:\n\nInitially current_candles =4. \n\ntotal_hours +=4 → 4. \n\nburnt_candles=4. current_candles becomes 4//2=2.\n\nNext loop: total_hours +=2 → 6. burnt_candles=2. current_candles becomes 2//2=1.\n\nNext loop: total_hours +=1 →7. burnt_candles=1. current_candles becomes 0 (since 1//2 is 0). So loop ends. So total is 7. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3.\n\nFirst iteration: current_candles=6 → total +=6 →6. burnt=6. current becomes 6//3=2.\n\nSecond iteration: total +=2 →8. burnt=2. current becomes 0. So loop ends. Total is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. Then:\n\nFirst iteration: total +=5. burnt=5. current becomes 1. \n\nSecond iteration: total +=1. burnt=1. current becomes 0. So total is 6.\n\nBut if a=5, b=5. So initial 5 hours. Then, 5 burnt → 1 new. Burn that → 1 hour. Now, 1 burnt, but can't make any more. So total 6.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: a=3, b=2. \n\nFirst iteration: total +=3. burnt=3. current becomes 1 (3//2=1). \n\nSecond iteration: total +=1 →4. burnt=1. current becomes 0. So total is 4. \n\nBut wait, after burning 3, you have",
