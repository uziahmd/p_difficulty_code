Note that by Cayley's formula, the number of trees on $$$n$$$ labeled vertices is $$$n^{n-2}$$$. Since we have $$$n-1$$$ edges, there are $$$2^{n-1}$$$ possible assignment of weights(weight can either be $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$).

The value of $$$d(1,4)$$$ is:   $$$-2$$$ for $$$2$$$ trees;  $$$-1$$$ for $$$8$$$ trees;  $$$0$$$ for $$$4$$$ trees;  $$$1$$$ for $$$2$$$ trees.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's try to understand what the problem is asking.\n\nThe problem is about counting the sum of d(1,n) for all \"good\" edge-weighted trees. A good tree has edges with weights 1 or -1, and for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to i is -1. And then, for each such tree, compute the sum of the weights along the path from 1 to n, and sum all those values over all good trees, modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let's break down the constraints for a good tree. Each vertex must have the product of its incident edges equal to -1. Since each edge connects two vertices, each edge contributes to the product of both of its endpoints. So, for example, if an edge between u and v has weight w, then it's part of the product for u and for v.\n\nBut how can this condition be satisfied for all vertices?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider the product of all edge weights incident to a vertex. For each vertex, that product must be -1. Let's think about the entire tree. Each edge is counted in exactly two vertices' products. So, if I take the product of all these vertex products (for all vertices), each edge's weight is multiplied twice. Therefore, the total product would be (-1)^n multiplied by the product of all edge weights squared. But since each edge's weight is either 1 or -1, their squares are 1. So the total product of all vertex products is (-1)^n.\n\nBut on the other hand, the product of all vertex products is the product of (-1) for each vertex, which is (-1)^n. So this is consistent. That suggests that there's no contradiction here. But how do we construct such trees?\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a way to model this condition. For each vertex, the product of its incident edges is -1. Let me think of the degrees. Suppose the tree is connected (it is a tree). Let me think about the parity of the degrees. Wait, but the product being -1 implies that the number of edges incident to a vertex with weight -1 must be odd. Because each edge contributes a factor of either 1 or -1. The product is -1, so the product of the signs is -1. Therefore, the number of edges with weight -1 adjacent to the vertex must be odd. Because multiplying an even number of -1s gives 1, and odd gives -1.\n\nSo for every vertex, the number of edges with weight -1 incident to it must be odd. Let me denote this as the parity condition. So each vertex has an odd degree in terms of the number of -1 edges.\n\nBut how can this be possible? Because each edge connects two vertices. So if I count the number of -1 edges adjacent to each vertex, the sum over all vertices of this count would be equal to twice the number of edges with weight -1. Because each such edge contributes to two vertices. Therefore, the sum of the counts (which are all odd) across all vertices must be even. But the sum of n odd numbers is n mod 2. Because each odd is 1 mod 2, so sum is n mod 2. So this sum must be even. Therefore, n must be even. Because sum is n mod 2, and the sum must be even (since it equals 2 * number of -1 edges). Therefore, n must be even. Otherwise, there are no good trees.\n\nWait! That's a crucial observation. Let me rephrase: For the sum of the counts (each vertex's count of -1 edges) to be even (as it's twice the number of -1 edges), the sum must be even. But each count is odd, so the sum is n * 1 mod 2. Which is n mod 2. Therefore, for this sum to be even, n must be even. Otherwise, it's impossible. Therefore, when n is odd, there are no good trees. Hence, the answer is zero in that case.\n\nLooking at the sample input where n=2, which is even, and the output is -1 mod MOD. For n=1, the output is 0, which matches the note. Also, for n=4, the sample output is non-zero. So this seems correct.\n\nSo first, if n is odd, the answer is 0. So we can immediately return 0 for n=1, 3, etc. So that's a base case.\n\nNow, for even n, we need to compute the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees.\n\nBut how?\n\nFirst, let's think about the structure of good trees. Each tree must satisfy that for each vertex, the number of -1 edges adjacent to it is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the sum of the distances $d(1, n)$ for all \"good\" edge-weighted trees with $n$ vertices. A tree is considered good if each vertex has an odd number of edges with weight -1 incident to it. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Parity Check**: For a tree to be good, the number of vertices $n$ must be even. If $n$ is odd, there are no good trees, and the result is 0.\n2. **Tree Structure**: Each edge in the tree can have a weight of either 1 or -1. The product of weights of edges incident to each vertex must be -1, which implies an odd count of -1 edges per vertex.\n\n### Approach:\n- **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be very large, we compute everything modulo $998244353$.\n- **Even Case**: When $n$ is even, the number of valid trees is non-zero. We derive the sum based on combinatorial properties and symmetry considerations.\n\n### Solution Code:\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # For even n >= 2\n    # The answer is (-1) * (n-1) * (n^{n-3}) * 2^{n-2} ) mod MOD\n    # Let's compute this\n    \n    # Compute pow(n, n-3, MOD)\n    exponent = n - 3\n    if exponent < 0:\n        # n=2: exponent is -1, which would be 1/n mod MOD\n        # But since n=2, 1/2 mod MOD is 499122177\n        # However, when n=2, the formula becomes:\n        # (-1) * (2-1) * 2^{2-2} = -1 * 1 * 1 = -1 mod MOD\n        # Which matches the first sample input.\n        # So need to handle n=2 specially\n        if n == 2:\n            print(MOD - 1)\n            return\n        else:\n            # For n >=4 even, but exponent is negative?\n            # Wait, for n >= 2, exponent is n-3.
