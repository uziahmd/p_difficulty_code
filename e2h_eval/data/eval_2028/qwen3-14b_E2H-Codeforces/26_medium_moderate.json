    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z such that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle has to be non-degenerate, which means the triangle inequality holds. So for any triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since the sides are ordered, maybe we can simplify that.\n\nWait, the problem says that x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z. Wait, the constraints on the sides are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Oh right. So x can be from A to B, y is from B to C (since B ≤ y ≤ C?), wait no. Wait the original condition is A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Wait, so x is between A and B, inclusive. Then y has to be at least B, but also up to C. Because B ≤ y ≤ C. And z has to be between C and D, inclusive. So the order of the sides is x ≤ y ≤ z? No, not exactly. Because x can be up to B, and y starts at B. So for example, x could be B, and y could be B, then z is at least C. So the ordering would be x ≤ y ≤ z. Because x is up to B, y starts at B and goes up to C, and z starts at C. So for the triangle, the three sides are x, y, z where x ≤ y ≤ z. So the triangle inequality requires that x + y > z. Because if x ≤ y ≤ z, then the other inequalities (x + z > y, y + z > x) are automatically satisfied since z is bigger than or equal to y and x. So the only condition we need to check is x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triples (x, y, z) where:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B,\n\nB ≤ y ≤ C,\n\nC ≤ z ≤ D,\n\nand x ≤ y ≤ z,\n\nand x + y > z.\n\nBut wait, since x ≤ B ≤ y, and y ≤ C ≤ z, then x ≤ y and y ≤ z. So x ≤ y ≤ z. So yes, the triangle condition is x + y > z.\n\nSo how do I compute this efficiently?\n\nThe brute force approach would be to iterate through all possible x, y, z and check if x + y > z. But given that the ranges can be up to 5e5, this is impossible. For example, if B is 5e5, and C is 5e5, then the number of possible x and y is O( (5e5)^2 ), which is 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's think of the variables:\n\nFor each x and y, we can find the valid z's that satisfy C ≤ z ≤ D and z < x + y. Also, since z must be ≥ y (because y ≤ C ≤ z). Wait, z is ≥ C, and y is ≤ C. So z is ≥ C ≥ y. So z is ≥ y. So the triangle condition is x + y > z. Since z ≥ y, and x ≤ B, y ≥ B.\n\nSo for each x and y, the possible z's are those in [C, D] that are less than x + y. But also, since z must be ≥ y. Wait, but z is between C and D. So for each x and y, the lower bound of z is max(C, y) (but since y ≤ C, because y is between B and C, and B ≤ C. So y can be up to C. So max(C, y) is C when y ≤ C. So z starts at C. So for each x and y, the valid z's are those in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)]. But only if x + y - 1 >= C. Otherwise, there are no valid z's for that x and y.\n\nSo for each x and y, the count of z is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y - 1 >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nSo the total number of triangles is the sum over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], of (number of z's for that x and y).\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing this sum efficiently.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute this sum efficiently. Let's think about the variables.\n\nFirst, x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. So for each x and y, compute the count of z's as described.\n\nBut even if we can compute this for each x and y, the total number of x and y pairs is (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1). Let's see: if A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, then (B - A + 1) is 5e5, and (C - B + 1) is 1. So total pairs is 5e5. Which is manageable. But if B is 5e5, and C is 5e5, then it's 5e5 * 1 = 5e5. But if B is 5e5 and C is 5e5, then y is fixed as 5e5. So for each x in A to B, we compute the count of z's.\n\nBut if B and C are large, say 5e5, then the number of pairs is (5e5) * (5e5) = 2.5e11, which is way too big. So this approach would not work for the worst case.\n\nThus, we need a way to compute this sum without iterating all x and y pairs.\n\nSo, how can we find the sum over x and y of max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1), given that x ranges from A to B and y ranges from B to C?\n\nLet me denote S = the sum over x in [X_low, X_high] and y in [Y_low, Y_high] of max(0, min(K, x + y - 1) - L + 1), where K is D, L is C. Wait, perhaps I can rephrase the problem.\n\nLet me define for each x and y, the value of (x + y) must be > z. Since z is at least C, the minimal value of z is C. So for each x and y, the maximum z that satisfies is min(D, x + y - 1). So the number of valid z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(D, x + y - 1) >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nSo the expression simplifies to:\n\nif x + y - 1 < C → 0\n\nelse if x + y - 1 >= D → D - C + 1\n\nelse → (x + y - 1) - C + 1 = x + y - C.\n\nSo the count is:\n\nmax(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) = max(0, (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)).\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nif x + y > C → then:\n\nif x + y -1 >= D → D - C + 1\n\nelse → x + y - C.\n\nElse → 0.\n\nSo the sum over x and y is:\n\nsum_{x,y} [ if x + y > C then (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) else 0 ]\n\nSo the problem is to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nNow, how can we compute this sum?\n\nLet me think of the variables x and y. Let me note that x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. So x can be from A to B, and y can be from B to C. Let me denote X_low = A, X_high = B. Y_low = B, Y_high = C.\n\nLet me consider that for each x and y, the summand is:\n\nif (x + y) > C → then:\n\nif (x + y -1) >= D → D - C + 1\n\nelse → x + y - C.\n\nSo let's split the problem into two parts:\n\nCase 1: x + y -1 >= D → which implies x + y >= D + 1. In this case, the contribution is D - C + 1.\n\nCase 2: C <= x + y <= D → contribution is x + y - C.\n\nCase 3: x + y < C → contribution 0.\n\nSo the total sum is:\n\nsum_{x,y} [ (if x + y > C then ... ) ]\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nsum_{x,y} [ (if x + y >= D+1 then (D - C + 1) else if x + y > C then (x + y - C) else 0) ]\n\nSo the total sum is:\n\nsum_{x,y} [ (x + y - C) * [x + y > C and x + y <= D] ] + (D - C + 1) * [x + y >= D + 1]\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute the number of (x, y) pairs where x + y > C and x + y <= D, multiplied by (x + y - C) summed over those pairs, plus the number of (x, y) pairs where x + y >= D+1 multiplied by (D - C + 1).\n\nSo, how can we compute these two terms?\n\nLet me first compute the number of pairs (x, y) where x is in [X_low, X_high], y in [Y_low, Y_high], and x + y > C. Then, for those pairs, subtract the ones where x + y > D, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to find for each possible sum s = x + y, the number of pairs (x, y) that have sum s, and then compute the contribution for each s.\n\nBut given that x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C, the sum s can range from (A + B) to (B + C). Let's note that.\n\nSo the minimum possible sum is A + B (since x is at least A, and y is at least B). The maximum possible sum is B + C (since x is at most B and y is at most C).\n\nSo the possible values of s are in [s_min, s_max], where s_min = A + B, s_max = B + C.\n\nBut C can be up to 5e5, and B up to 5e5, so s_max can be up to 1e6.\n\nBut for each s in this range, we can compute the number of pairs (x, y) that sum to s. Then, for each s, compute its contribution to the total sum.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the number of (x, y) pairs for a given s.\n\nSo for x in [A, B], y in [B, C], and x + y = s. How many pairs (x, y) satisfy this?\n\nLet me fix x. Then y = s - x. For this to be valid, y must be in [B, C], and x must be in [A, B].\n\nSo for each x in [A, B], check if y = s - x is in [B, C]. So the number of valid pairs is the number of x in [A, B] such that B ≤ s - x ≤ C → rearranged:\n\ns - C ≤ x ≤ s - B.\n\nBut x also has to be in [A, B].\n\nSo the x's that satisfy both conditions are in the intersection of [A, B] and [s - C, s - B].\n\nSo the count for a given s is the number of integers x in [max(A, s - C), min(B, s - B)] ].\n\nBut how do I compute this for all s?\n\nAlternatively, for each s, the number of pairs is the number of x in [A, B] such that y = s - x is in [B, C].\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\ny ∈ [B, C] → B ≤ s - x ≤ C → rearranged:\n\ns - C ≤ x ≤ s - B.\n\nSo x must be in [s - C, s - B], and also in [A, B].\n\nSo the valid x's are in the interval [x_low, x_high], where x_low = max(A, s - C), x_high = min(B, s - B). And the count is max(0, x_high - x_low + 1).\n\nSo for each s, the count of pairs (x, y) with sum s is the number of x in that interval.\n\nSo once we can compute this count for each s, we can process all s in [s_min, s_max].\n\nNow, considering that s ranges from A + B to B + C, which can be up to 1e6, and for each s, we can compute the count quickly, this seems feasible.\n\nOnce we have for each s the count of pairs (x, y) that sum to s, we can compute the contributions for the two cases.\n\nLet me think about the two cases again:\n\nFor each s, if s <= C → contribution is zero.\n\nIf s > C and s <= D → contribution is (s - C) * count(s).\n\nIf s > D → contribution is (D - C + 1) * count(s).\n\nSo the total sum is:\n\nsum_{s = s_min}^{s_max} [ (if s > C and s <= D: (s - C)*count(s)) + (if s > D: (D - C + 1)*count(s)) ) ]\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute s_min = A + B, s_max = B + C.\n\n2. For each s in [s_min, s_max], compute count(s) as the number of (x, y) pairs that sum to s.\n\n3. For each s, compute its contribution based on whether s is in the ranges.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about how to compute count(s) for all s in [s_min, s_max].\n\nBut for each s, the count is the number of x in [A, B] such that x is between max(A, s - C) and min(B, s - B), inclusive.\n\nLet me denote for each s, the lower and upper bounds for x:\n\nlow_x = max(A, s - C)\n\nhigh_x = min(B, s - B)\n\nif low_x > high_x → count is zero.\n\nElse count is high_x - low_x + 1.\n\nSo for each s, compute this.\n\nBut how to compute this for all s efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the possible ranges of s.\n\nFor example, for s to have valid x and y, the following must be true:\n\ny = s - x must be between B and C. So:\n\nB ≤ s - x ≤ C → s - C ≤ x ≤ s - B.\n\nAlso, x must be between A and B.\n\nSo for each s, the valid x's are in the intersection of [A, B] and [s - C, s - B].\n\nNow, the range of s is from A + B to B + C.\n\nLet me think about the possible values of s - C and s - B.\n\nFor s = A + B:\n\ns - C = A + B - C.\n\ns - B = A + B - B = A.\n\nSo low_x = max(A, A + B - C) → depends on whether A + B - C is less than A.\n\nSince B <= C, A + B - C can be as low as A + B - C. But since B <= C, A + B - C can be negative. But since x must be >= A, then low_x is A.\n\nSimilarly, high_x is min(B, A) → since A <= B, it's A. So for s = A + B, the x is A, and y = s - x = B. Which is valid.\n\nSo for each s, the count is computed as above.\n\nBut looping through all possible s from s_min to s_max may be feasible. Let's see:\n\ns_min can be as small as 1 + 1 = 2 (if A=B=1), and s_max can be up to 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6. So the maximum number of s is 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nSo for each s in s_min to s_max, compute count(s) as described, then accumulate the contribution.\n\nThis would take O(1e6) time, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute for each s in [s_min, s_max], compute count(s).\n\n- For each s, determine which part of the contribution it belongs to.\n\nLet me code this in steps.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute s_min = A + B\n\ns_max = B + C\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor s in s_min ... s_max:\n\n    compute low_x = max(A, s - C)\n\n    high_x = min(B, s - B)\n\n    if low_x > high_x:\n\n        continue\n\n    cnt = high_x - low_x + 1\n\n    if s <= C:\n\n        # contribution is 0\n\n        continue\n\n    elif s <= D:\n\n        # contribution is (s - C) * cnt\n\n        total += (s - C) * cnt\n\n    else:\n\n        # contribution is (D - C + 1) * cnt\n\n        total += (D - C + 1) * cnt\n\nreturn total\n\nWait, but what about when s is larger than D?\n\nYes, in that case, the contribution is (D - C + 1) * cnt.\n\nBut what if D is smaller than C? Well, since in the input, C <= D, so D >= C. So D - C + 1 is at least 1.\n\nBut in the code, for s > D, the contribution is (D - C + 1) * cnt.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nLet me test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 1 2 3 4 → Output 4.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\ns_min = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\ns_max = 2 + 3 = 5.\n\ns ranges from 3 to 5.\n\nFor each s:\n\ns=3:\n\nlow_x = max(1, 3 - 3) = max(1, 0) = 1.\n\nhigh_x = min(2, 3 - 2) = min(2, 1) = 1.\n\ncnt = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.\n\ns=3. C is 3. So s is not > C. So no contribution.\n\ns=4:\n\nlow_x = max(1, 4 - 3) = max(1, 1) =1.\n\nhigh_x = min(2, 4 - 2) = min(2, 2) = 2.\n\ncnt = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2.\n\ns=4 > C (3), and 4 <= D (4). So contribution is (4-3) * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2.\n\ns=5:\n\nlow_x = max(1, 5 - 3) = max(1, 2) = 2.\n\nhigh_x = min(2, 5 - 2) = min(2, 3) → 2.\n\ncnt = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1.\n\ns=5 is <= D (4?) No. Wait D is 4. So s=5 is larger than D. So contribution is (4 - 3 + 1) * 1 = 2 * 1 = 2.\n\nSo total is 2 + 2 = 4. Which matches the sample output. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: second input is '1 2 2 5' → output 3.\n\nLet me compute.\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\ns_min = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\ns_max = 2 + 2 =4.\n\ns ranges from 3 to 4.\n\ns=3:\n\nlow_x = max(1, 3 - 2) → max(1, 1) =1.\n\nhigh_x = min(2, 3 - 2) → min(2, 1) =1. cnt=1.\n\ns=3. C is 2. s> C (3>2). So check if s <= D (5). Yes.\n\ncontribution is (3 - 2) * 1 = 1*1=1.\n\ns=4:\n\nlow_x = max(1, 4 - 2) → max(1, 2) =2.\n\nhigh_x = min(2, 4 - 2) → min(2, 2) =2. cnt=1.\n\ns=4>2, and <=5. contribution (4-2)*1 = 2.\n\nTotal is 1 + 2 =3. Which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nThird sample: 500000 500000 500000 500000. Output 1.\n\ns_min = 500000 + 500000 = 1e6.\n\ns_max = 500000 + 500000 = 1e6.\n\nSo s is 1e6.\n\nC is 5e5. s=1e6 is larger than C. D is 5e5. So s=1e6 > D (5e5). So contribution is (D - C +1) * cnt.\n\nD - C +1 is 5e5 -5e5 +1 =1.\n\nNow compute cnt for s=1e6.\n\nlow_x = max(5e5, 1e6 - 5e5) = max(5e5, 5e5) → 5e5.\n\nhigh_x = min(5e5, 1e6 - 5e5) → min(5e5, 5e5) → 5e5.\n\ncnt is 1. So total is 1 * 1 =1. Correct.\n\nSo the approach works for the samples.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut considering that s can be up to 2 * 5e5 = 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nBut for s in the loop from s_min to s_max, which can be up to 1e6 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead A, B, C, D from input. But the input is multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the input is given as the first line containing four integers. Wait, the sample input shows that the user provided multiple lines, but perhaps the actual problem is that the code needs to read multiple test cases. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is given as the first line contains four integers. However, in the sample input, there are three lines, each being a separate test case. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines of input, each line being a test case.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement's Input section:\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C, D. So the input is one line per test case. But in the sample input, there are three lines, which suggests that the code should read multiple test cases, each on their own line.\n\nWait, the sample input shows:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nWhich is three test cases. So the code should read multiple lines of input, each line being a test case, and output the corresponding answer for each.\n\nBut the original problem statement says that the input is four integers. However, the sample input shows multiple lines. So perhaps the code needs to read all lines from stdin, each line being a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"the first line contains four integers\", but perhaps that's a mistake. Looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is given as the first line contains four integers. But the sample input shows three lines, which suggests that perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the user provided multiple examples, but the actual problem expects a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple lines. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C and D (1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D ≤ 5e5) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the number of ... \n\nSo the input is one line. However, the sample input shows three lines. Which probably indicates that the code should read multiple test cases. But perhaps the sample input is formatted as multiple test cases for illustration, but the actual code should process one line per test case. Or perhaps the code is supposed to read all lines from input, each being a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read input from standard input. So for example, in programming competition problems, sometimes the code is expected to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's sample input shows three lines, each being a test case. So the code should process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the original problem statement's input says that the first line contains four integers. So perhaps the sample input is written as three test cases, each on their own line. So the code should read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate test case.\n\nTherefore, the code needs to read all lines from input, process each line as a separate test case, and output the answer for each.\n\nSo, in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split each into four integers, and process them.\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the code is supposed to read one line of input. However, the sample input shows three lines. So perhaps the problem is that the user is providing multiple test cases. But the problem statement says that the input is four integers. This is conflicting.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nSo the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each on their own line.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is the first line containing four integers. Which is confusing. However, given the sample input and output, the code must read multiple lines of input, each line being a test case.\n\nTherefore, the code will read all lines from stdin, for each line, process the four integers, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nSo, in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n    # compute the answer and print\n\nNow, the code for the computation:\n\nImplement the steps discussed earlier.\n\nSo, code:\n\ndef count_triangles(A, B, C, D):\n\n    s_min = A + B\n\n    s_max = B + C\n\n    total = 0\n\n    for s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n\n        # compute low_x and high_x\n\n        low_x = max(A, s - C)\n\n        high_x = min(B, s - B)\n\n        if low_x > high_x:\n\n            continue\n\n        cnt = high_x - low_x + 1\n\n        if s <= C:\n\n            continue\n\n        elif s <= D:\n\n            total += (s - C) * cnt\n\n        else:\n\n            total += (D - C + 1) * cnt\n\n    return total\n\nBut wait, what if s_max is larger than D? For example, when B + C is larger than D. But the code handles that.\n\nNow, testing this function with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4 → returns 4. Which is correct.\n\nSample 2: A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5 → returns 3. Correct.\n\nSample 3: A=5e5, B=5e5, C=5e5, D=5e5 → returns 1. Correct.\n\nBut what about when s_max is larger than D?\n\nAnother test case: suppose A=1, B=2, C=3, D=3. Then s ranges from 3 to 5.\n\ns=3: contributes nothing.\n\ns=4: s is 4 > C=3, and s <= D=3? No. So 4 > D. So contribution is (D - C + 1) * cnt. D - C +1 is 3-3 +1 = 1. For s=4, low_x is max(1, 4-3)=1, high_x is min(2, 4-2)=2. cnt=2. So contribution is 1 * 2 = 2.\n\ns=5: same as before. low_x is max(1, 5-3)=2, high_x min(2, 5-2=3) → 2. cnt=1. contribution is 1 * 1 =1. Total is 2 + 1 =3.\n\nBut what is the actual count?\n\nFor x in [1,2], y in [2,3], z in [3,3].\n\nThe valid triangles are those with x + y > z. Since z is 3.\n\nSo for each (x, y) pair:\n\nx can be 1 or 2, y can be 2 or 3.\n\nCheck x + y > 3.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n(1,2): 1+2 =3 → not >3 → invalid.\n\n(1,3): 4>3 → valid. z is 3. So count 1.\n\n(2,2): 4>3 → valid. count 1.\n\n(2,3): 5>3 → valid. count 1.\n\nTotal of 3. Which matches the calculation. So the code returns 3.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, considering that for large values of B and C, the loop from s_min to s_max could be up to 1e6 iterations. For each iteration, the code does O(1) operations. Which is acceptable for Python even for 1e6 iterations.\n\nBut let's check for the worst case. Suppose A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, D=5e5. Then s_min is 1 + 5e5 = 500001, s_max is 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6. So the loop runs 1e6 - 500001 + 1 = 500000 iterations. Which is manageable.\n\nAnother case: A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, D=1e6. Then s ranges from 500001 to 1e6. Which is 500000 iterations. Again manageable.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nBut in Python, for very large ranges, looping with for s in range(...) can be slow. However, for 1e6 iterations, it's acceptable.\n\nBut let's think about the maximum possible s_max - s_min + 1. It's (B + C) - (A + B) + 1 = C - A + 1. Since A can be as small as 1, and C up to 5e5, this is up to 5e5 + 1. Which is acceptable.\n\nThus, the code is efficient enough.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut need to read multiple lines from input, each as a test case.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n        s_min = A + B\n\n        s_max = B + C\n\n        total = 0\n\n        for s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n\n            low_x = max(A, s - C)\n\n            high_x = min(B, s - B)\n\n            if low_x > high_x:\n\n                continue\n\n            cnt = high_x - low_x + 1\n\n            if s <= C:\n\n                continue\n\n            elif s <= D:\n\n                total += (s - C) * cnt\n\n            else:\n\n                total += (D - C + 1) * cnt\n\n        print(total)\n\nBut wait, the code may have some issues with very large ranges. However, given the constraints, it's manageable.\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 1 2 3 4 → output 4.\n\nSample Input 2: 1 2 2 5 → output 3.\n\nSample Input 3: 500000 500000 500000 500000 → output 1.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=3. As discussed earlier, returns 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: A=2, B=2, C=2, D=2. Then x can be 2, y can be 2, z can be 2. Check x + y > z → 2 + 2 > 2 → yes. So count 1. The code:\n\ns_min = 2 + 2 =4, s_max = 2 + 2 =4. s=4.\n\nlow_x = max(2, 4 - 2) → max(2, 2) =2.\n\nhigh_x = min(2, 4 - 2) → min(2, 2) =2. cnt=1.\n\ns=4. C is 2. s > C. D is 2. So s=4 > D. So contribution is (2-2 +1) * 1 = 1 * 1 =1. Correct.\n\nAnother case where D is larger than s_max. For example, A=1, B=2, C=3, D=100. Then for each s in 3 to 5:\n\ns=3 → no contribution.\n\ns=4: contribution (4-3)*cnt. What is cnt?\n\nFor s=4, low_x is max(1, 4-3) =1, high_x is min(2, 4-2=2). cnt=2. So contribution is 1 * 2 = 2.\n\ns=5: low_x is max(1, 5-3=2), high_x is min(2, 5-2=3) → 2. cnt=1. contribution (5-3)*1 = 2. Total is 2 + 2 =4.\n\nWhich corresponds to the first sample, but with D=100. So the answer is 4, same as first sample. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, implement this.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. The triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Given the constraints, we need an efficient approach to avoid brute force computation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: The sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ must satisfy $A \\leq x \\leq B$, $B \\leq y \\leq C$, and $C \\leq z \\leq D$. For a valid triangle, the key condition is $x + y > z$ since $x \\leq y \\leq z$.\n2. **Range of Sums**: For each possible sum $s = x + y$, we determine the valid range of $z$ values that satisfy $x + y > z$ and $C \\leq z \\leq D$.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of iterating over all possible $x$, $y$, and $z$, we calculate the valid sums $s$ and count how many pairs $(x, y)$ yield each sum. This allows us to efficiently compute the number of valid $z$ values for each sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        s_min = A + B\n        s_max = B + C\n        total = 0\n        for s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n            low_x = max(A, s - C)\n            high_x = min(B, s - B)\n            if low_x > high_x:\n                continue\n            cnt = high_x - low_x + 1\n            if s <= C:\n                continue\n            elif s <= D:\n                total += (s - C) * cnt\n            else:\n                total += (D - C + 1) * cnt\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple lines from standard input, each line representing a test case with four integers $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\n2. **Sum Range Calculation**: For each test case, we compute the minimum and maximum possible sums $s = x + y$ where $x$ ranges from $A$ to $B$ and $y$ ranges from $B$ to $C$.\n3. **Valid Pairs Calculation**: For each possible sum $s$, we determine the valid range of $x$ values that can form pairs with $y$ such that $x + y = s$. This is done by calculating the intersection of ranges for $x$.\n4. **Contribution Calculation**: For each valid sum $s$, we compute how many valid $z$ values exist such that $C \\leq z \\leq D$ and $x + y > z$. This is split into two cases based on whether $s$ is within the range of $C$ to $D$ or exceeds $D$.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the valid ranges and leverages mathematical properties to avoid brute force iteration, ensuring the solution is optimal even for large input sizes.",
