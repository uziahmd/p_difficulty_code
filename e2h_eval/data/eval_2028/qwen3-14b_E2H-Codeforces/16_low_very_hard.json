Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum number of steps to move from a home block to a university block, moving through adjacent blocks. The adjacency here is defined by sharing a common border of non-zero length. So, the problem is essentially about finding the shortest path between two regions divided by lines.\n\nFirst, I need to model the blocks and their adjacencies. But how can I represent each block? Since there are infinite regions, it's impossible to list them all. However, the key insight here is that the movement between blocks is determined by crossing roads. Each road divides the plane into two halves. The blocks can be represented by their position relative to each road.\n\nWait, but how do I determine if two blocks are adjacent? For two blocks to be adjacent, they must share a common boundary, which means that there's at least one road that separates them. But maybe the adjacency is determined by being on opposite sides of a single road. Because when you cross a road, you move into an adjacent block.\n\nBut how to model this as a graph? Each node represents a block. But since the number of blocks is infinite, we can't model them directly. However, the problem requires us to find the minimal steps between two specific blocks. So perhaps we can model the problem using BFS, but represent each state as the set of signs (relative to each road) that define the current block.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Each block can be uniquely identified by the sign of its position relative to each road. For example, for each road i, the block is either on the positive side or the negative side of the road. So, for n roads, each block can be represented by a binary string of length n, where each bit indicates whether the point is on the positive or negative side of the road. However, since the roads can be in any orientation, the actual value depends on the equation of the road.\n\nBut for two blocks to be adjacent, they must differ in exactly one road's sign. Because crossing a road would flip the sign of exactly that road. So, if two regions differ in exactly one road's sign, then they are adjacent. Wait, but that's not necessarily true. Because two regions could be separated by multiple roads. However, according to the problem's movement rules, you can move between two blocks if they share a common border. Which would imply that there exists at least one road that is their common boundary. So, if two regions are separated by exactly one road (i.e., they differ in exactly one road's sign), then they are adjacent. But if they differ in more than one road's sign, then they are not adjacent. Because to move between them, you would have to cross multiple roads, which would require passing through intermediate regions.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to a graph where each node is a binary vector (the signs for each road), and edges exist between nodes that differ in exactly one bit. Then, the problem becomes finding the shortest path between the starting node (the home's sign vector) and the target node (the university's sign vector).\n\nBut how do I compute the sign vectors for the home and university?\n\nFor each road, evaluate the home's coordinates (x1, y1) into the equation ai * x + bi * y + ci. Since the home is not on any road, the result will be non-zero. The sign of this value determines which side of the road the home is on. Similarly for the university.\n\nSo, for the home, we can create a vector s where s[i] = sign( a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i ). Similarly for the university's vector t.\n\nOnce we have these two vectors, the problem is to find the minimal number of steps to go from s to t, where each step flips exactly one bit (since each step corresponds to crossing a road, changing the sign of that road's equation).\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right. Because flipping a single bit would correspond to moving across that road. However, the problem says that two blocks are adjacent if their common border has non-zero length. Which would be the case if they differ by exactly one road. So, the minimal steps between s and t is the Hamming distance between s and t. Because each differing bit requires a step. Wait, no. Because if the Hamming distance is k, then the minimal steps would be k. Because each step can flip one bit. So, the answer would be the Hamming distance between the two vectors.\n\nBut wait, that seems too easy. Let me check the sample input.\n\nLooking at the first sample input:\n\nSample 1:\nHome is (1,1)\nUniversity is (-1,-1)\nn=2 roads: \nRoad 1: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0\nRoad 2: 1x + 0y +0 =0 → x=",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. The movement is allowed between adjacent blocks that share a non-zero length boundary.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each road divides the plane into two regions. The home and university are located in different regions (blocks). We need to find the shortest path between these two blocks by moving through adjacent blocks.\n2. **Sign Representation**: Each block can be represented by a vector of signs relative to each road. For each road, the sign of the value computed from the home (or university) coordinates determines which side of the road the point lies on.\n3. **Hamming Distance**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equivalent to the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and university. This is because each step corresponds to crossing a road, flipping the sign for that road.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n            idx += 1\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Compute sign vector for home\n    home_signs = []\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        home_signs.append(1 if val > 0 else -1)\n    \n    # Compute sign vector for university\n    uni_signs = []\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        uni_signs.append(1 if val > 0 else -1)\n    \n    # Calculate Hamming distance\n    distance = 0\n    for h, u in zip(home_signs, uni_signs):\n        if h != u:\n            distance += 1\n    print(distance)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to extract the coordinates of the home, university, and the road equations.\n2. **Sign Vectors Calculation**: For each road, we calculate the sign of the value obtained by substituting the home and university coordinates into the road equation. This gives us two vectors representing the positions of the home and university relative to all roads.\n3. **Hamming Distance Calculation**: The Hamming distance between the two sign vectors is computed. This distance represents the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, as each differing sign indicates crossing a road.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the shortest path by leveraging the properties of sign vectors and Hamming distance, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
