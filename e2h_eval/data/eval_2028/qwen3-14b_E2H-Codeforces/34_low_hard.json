And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time over all possible weeks. Each week is defined as k consecutive days. For each of these weeks, we calculate the sum of the sleep times and then find the average of all those sums. The output needs to be precise with at least six decimal digits.\n\nSo the input gives n and k, followed by a list of n integers. The output is the average of all the possible consecutive k-day periods.\n\nLet me think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to compute the sum for each window of size k and then take the average of those sums. However, if n is up to 2e5, then a naive approach that checks each window by adding up k elements each time would be O(n*k), which would be 4e10 operations in the worst case. That's way too slow. So we need a more efficient way.\n\nAh right, sliding window technique. Let's think about that. The sum for the first window is a1 + a2 + ... + ak. Then for the next window, we subtract a1 and add a_{k+1}. So each step takes O(1) time. So overall, the total time would be O(n) for computing all the window sums.\n\nOnce we have all the window sums, we need to compute their average. So the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the first window.\n2. Iterate through the remaining windows, updating the sum by subtracting the element leaving the window and adding the new element entering.\n3. Keep track of the total sum of all window sums.\n4. Divide by the number of windows (which is n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the key is to compute the sum of all the window sums efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For example, the first sample input:\n\nn=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]. The windows are [3,4] sum 7, and [4,7] sum 11. The average is (7+11)/2 = 9. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: when n=1 and k=1, there's only one window, so the average is the single element.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute the initial window sum.\n- Then for each subsequent window, adjust the sum.\n- Accumulate all these sums into a total.\n- Divide by the number of windows (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python?\n\nFirst, read n and k. Then read the list of a's.\n\nThen compute the initial sum of the first k elements. Then for each i from k to n-1, subtract a[i -k] and add a[i], then add to the total.\n\nWait, but how to handle the initial sum. Let's think:\n\nFor example, the first window is from index 0 to k-1. Then the next window is 1 to k, etc.\n\nSo the initial sum is sum(a[0:k]).\n\nThen, for each position i in 0 to (n -k -1), the next window is sum = previous_sum - a[i] + a[i +k].\n\nWait, but the number of windows is (n -k +1). So for example, if n=3 and k=2, there are 2 windows. So the initial sum is for the first window, then we process (n -k) more steps. Because the number of steps after the first window is (n -k) steps. So for each of those steps, we compute the next sum.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nCompute total_sum = 0\n\ncurrent_sum = sum of first k elements.\n\ntotal_sum += current_sum\n\nthen for i in range(1, (n -k +1)):\n\ncurrent_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i +k -1]\n\ntotal_sum += current_sum\n\nWait, perhaps the loop runs for (n -k) times. Because the first window is already counted, and then each next window is generated by moving one step. So the number of windows is (n -k +1), so the loop runs (n -k) times.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think of the initial sum as the first window, then for each of the next (n -k) windows, compute the sum by sliding.\n\nSo for example, for the first window, index 0 to k-1. Then the next window is 1 to k, then 2 to k+1, etc.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\ntotal = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, n -k +1):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1]",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of `k` days from a list of `n` days. The solution must be efficient to handle large input sizes up to 200,000 elements.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: This technique allows us to efficiently compute the sum of each consecutive subarray of length `k` in linear time. By maintaining a running sum and adjusting it as we slide the window across the array, we avoid recalculating the sum from scratch for each window.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Start by computing the sum of the first window of `k` elements. Then, for each subsequent window, adjust the sum by subtracting the element that is left behind and adding the new element that enters the window.\n3. **Average Calculation**: After computing the sum of all valid windows, divide the total sum by the number of windows (which is `n - k + 1`) to get the average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    line1 = input[idx].split()\n    n = int(line1[0])\n    k = int(line1[1])\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        a = []\n    else:\n        a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    \n    if n == 0 or k == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n    \n    total = 0\n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    total += current_sum\n    num_weeks = n - k + 1\n    for i in range(1, num_weeks):\n        current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n        total += current_sum\n    \n    average = total / num_weeks\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go and split into lines for processing. This ensures efficient handling of large input sizes.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first `k` elements is computed to initialize the sliding window.\n3. **Sliding Window Adjustment**: For each subsequent window, the sum is adjusted by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window. This adjustment ensures each window sum is calculated in constant time.\n4. **Total Sum and Average**: The total sum of all window sums is accumulated and then divided by the number of windows to compute the average. The result is formatted to ensure at least six decimal places for precision.\n\nThis approach ensures an efficient O(n) time complexity, making it suitable for large input sizes up to the given constraints.",
