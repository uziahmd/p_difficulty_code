    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate based on certain parameters. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe plate is divided into w rows and h columns. We need to add k rings of gilding. The first ring is along the edge. The second is two cells away from the edge, etc. Each ring is one cell wide. The i-th ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, so for each ring, we take the perimeter of that inner rectangle. But how do we compute the perimeter?\n\nWait, the perimeter of a rectangle with width W and height H is 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H, but subtracting 4 because the corners are counted twice. Wait, no. Let me think again. For a rectangle that's m rows high and n columns wide, the number of cells in the perimeter would be 2*m + 2*(n-2) ? Or maybe 2*(m + n) - 4? Because for example, if you have a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the perimeter is the outermost cells. So for each of the four sides: top row (n cells), bottom row (n cells), left column (m-2 cells, since top and bottom are already counted), right column (m-2 cells). So total is 2n + 2(m-2) = 2n + 2m -4 = 2*(m + n) -4. Yes. So for each ring, the perimeter is 2*(width + height) -4. But wait, the width and height here are the dimensions of the inner rectangle for that ring.\n\nBut for the i-th ring, the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1))? Wait, the problem says the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for example, the first ring (i=1) is the border of the original rectangle. Then for the second ring (i=2), it's the border of a rectangle that's 4 less in each dimension (since 4*(i-1) = 4*1 =4). Wait, but why 4? Because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side. Like, the first ring is the outermost layer. The next ring is two cells inward. So for each ring, the width and height decrease by 2*2 =4? Because each side is reduced by 2 cells (left and right, top and bottom). So for example, if the original width is w, then after one ring, the next ring would be (w - 4) in width, because each side is reduced by 2 cells. So for the i-th ring, the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)).\n\nBut for each ring, we need to compute the perimeter of that rectangle. However, there's a catch. For example, if the rectangle becomes too small, like if the width or height is less than 1, then that ring can't exist. But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's valid. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 = 1, so floor is 1. So for k=1, it's allowed. So when we compute each ring, the dimensions for that ring's rectangle must be at least 1x1. But since the input ensures that k is valid, we don't have to worry about that.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle for that ring, and sum all those perimeters.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the perimeter for each ring? Let me take the first example:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1. So the first ring is the perimeter of 3x3. The perimeter is 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8. Which matches the sample output of 8. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: input 7 9 2. Let's see. For the first ring, the rectangle is 7x9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16 -4 = 32-4=28. Then for the second ring, the dimensions are 7-4*(2-1) = ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate based on the given dimensions and the number of gilded rings. Each ring is placed such that it forms a border around an inner rectangle, with each subsequent ring being progressively inward.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells corresponds to the perimeter of the rectangle at that level. The perimeter of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` is calculated as `2 * (w + h) - 4`. This formula accounts for the four sides of the rectangle while avoiding double-counting the corners.\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, calculate the dimensions of the inner rectangle and then compute its perimeter. Sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n3. **Adjusting Dimensions for Each Ring**: For the i-th ring, the dimensions of the inner rectangle are adjusted by reducing both width and height by `4 * (i - 1)` to account for the previous rings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Reading**: The input values for width (`w`), height (`h`), and number of rings (`k`) are read and parsed.\n- **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, adjust the dimensions of the rectangle by subtracting `4 * (i - 1)` from both width and height.\n- **Perimeter Calculation**: Compute the perimeter for each adjusted rectangle using the formula `2 * (width + height) - 4`.\n- **Summing Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells, which is then printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and adjusting the dimensions accordingly, ensuring accuracy and adherence to the problem constraints.",
