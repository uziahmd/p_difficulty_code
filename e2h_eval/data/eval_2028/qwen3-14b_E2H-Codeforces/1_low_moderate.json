The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says that the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. But the formal definition says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Oh right, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom), so for each ring, the dimensions reduce by 4 each time. Like, for the first ring, the rectangle is w × h, then for the next, it's (w-4) × (h-4), etc.\n\nSo, for each ring, the number of cells is the perimeter of that rectangle. Wait, but how? Let me think. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the number of cells in the border (the perimeter) would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(width + height) minus 4 (since the corners are counted twice). Wait, for example, a 3x3 rectangle: the perimeter cells are 3*4 - 4 = 8? Or wait, 3x3 has 3*4 - 4 = 8 cells? Let me count. The outer ring would be all the cells on the edges. For 3x3, the outer ring is the first layer. The total cells in the perimeter would be (3*4) - 4 = 8. Which matches the first example input where the output is 8. So yes, the formula for the perimeter is 2*(w + h) - 4. Because for a rectangle of width w and height h, the perimeter in cells is 2*(w + h) - 4. Because each side contributes w or h, but subtracting 4 because the four corners are counted twice.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle with dimensions (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)), but only if those dimensions are valid. Wait, but the problem says that k is given such that it's possible. So for each i from 1 to k, the dimensions must be at least 3x3? Or maybe not. Wait, the problem says that the input k is constrained such that it's floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me think. For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be up to 1. Which makes sense because for a 3x3 plate, you can have one ring. For a 7x7 plate, min is 7. (7+1)/4 is 2, so floor is 2. So k can be up to 2. For each ring, the dimensions are reduced by 4*(i-1). So for i=1, it's w and h. For i=2, it's w-4 and h-4. So for 7x7, the second ring would be 3x3. Which is valid.\n\nSo the approach is: for each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, how do we compute the perimeter for each ring?\n\nLet me take the first example input: 3 3 1. So for i=1, the dimensions are 3 and 3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3) -4 = 8. Which matches the output.\n\nAnother example: input is 7 9 2. Let's compute for i=1 and i=2.\n\nFor i=1: dimensions are 7x9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16 -4 = 32-4=28? Wait, but the sample input for 7 9 1 gives output 28. Yes, that's correct. Then for i=2, the dimensions are 7-4=3 and 9-4=5. So the perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12? Wait, 2*(3+5) is 16? No, 3+5 is 8, multiplied by 2 is 1",
