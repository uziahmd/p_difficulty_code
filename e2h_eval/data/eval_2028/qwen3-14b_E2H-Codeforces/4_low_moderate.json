The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players over n rounds. Each player has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. For each round, we need to determine who wins and count the number of times each player gets pinched (i.e., loses a round). The challenge is to compute this efficiently given that n can be as large as 2e9, which is way too big for a straightforward simulation.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since directly simulating each of the n rounds is impossible due to time constraints, we need to find a pattern or cycle that can be computed once and then multiplied over the number of repetitions.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the moves are determined. For each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of his sequence. Similarly, Polycarpus's move is B[i % k], where k is the length of his sequence.\n\nThe key here is that the sequence of moves for both players repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles. So, the pattern of moves between the two players repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. Therefore, if we can compute the number of losses for each player in one full cycle of LCM(m, k) rounds, we can multiply that by the number of full cycles in n rounds and then add the result for the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period.\n2. For each round in 0 to period-1, compute the moves of A and B, determine who wins, and count the number of losses for each player in this period.\n3. Then, calculate how many full periods are in n rounds (full_cycles = n // period), and the remaining rounds (remainder = n % period).\n4. Multiply the counts from one period by full_cycles.\n5. Then, simulate the remaining 'remainder' rounds to add their counts.\n\nBut first, how do I compute LCM? Well, LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So I need a function to compute GCD. Python's math module has gcd, but for Python versions before 3.5, perhaps I need to implement it. However, assuming that the code will run in a Python environment that supports math.gcd (and note that math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's fine).\n\nWait, but for Python 3.5 and above, math.gcd exists. So, I can compute GCD and then LCM.\n\nNow, for the steps:\n\nFirst, compute m and k. Then compute LCM(m, k) as period.\n\nThen, for each round in 0 to period-1, determine the moves of A and B. For each such round, check who wins, and accumulate the counts for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, and m and k up to 1000, the maximum possible period is LCM(1000, 1000) = 1000*1000 = 1e6. So for each period, we can simulate up to 1e6 rounds. Which is acceptable because even for 2e9, the full_cycles would be 2e9 / 1e6 = 2e3, so the total processing is manageable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute the number of losses per period (for both players), then multiply by full_cycles, then add the losses from the remaining rounds.\n\nSo, the code outline would be:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nm = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute period = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute for each of the period rounds, the moves and count the losses.\n\nThen:\n\ntotal_cycles = n // period\n\nremaining_rounds = n % period\n\ntotal_nik = total_cycles * nik_per_period\n\ntotal_poly = total_cycles * poly_per_period\n\nThen simulate the first remaining_rounds rounds, adding to the totals.\n\nBut how to simulate the first remaining_rounds rounds? Well, for each round from 0 to remaining_rounds-1, get A[i % m], B[i % k], and check who wins.\n\nBut for the initial period, we can precompute the counts for the entire period. So, for the first part, we can loop through 0 to period-1, and for each i, compute the moves and accumulate the counts.\n\nBut for the remaining rounds, we can loop from 0 to remaining_rounds-1, and do the same.\n\nNow, the question is, how to",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to simulate a game of rock-paper-scissors between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who each follow a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge is to efficiently determine the number of times each player loses over a potentially very large number of rounds, up to 2 billion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Cyclic Nature**: Both players use cyclic sequences for their moves. This means their move patterns repeat every LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the lengths of their respective sequences.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: Compute the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences. This LCM represents the period after which both sequences repeat their moves simultaneously.\n3. **Simulate One Period**: Calculate the number of losses for each player over one full period of LCM rounds.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: Determine how many full periods fit into the total number of rounds and the remaining rounds after these full periods.\n5. **Combine Results**: Multiply the losses per period by the number of full cycles and add the results from the remaining rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n    \n    lcm = m * k // gcd(m, k)\n    \n    # Precompute the number of losses in one full period\n    nik_per_period = 0\n    poly_per_period = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        # Determine the winner\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        # Check who wins\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a spot\n            poly_per_period += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot\n            nik_per_period += 1\n    \n    total_cycles = n // lcm\n    remaining = n % lcm\n    \n    total_nik = total_cycles * nik_per_period\n    total_poly = total_cycles * poly_per_period\n    \n    # Process remaining rounds\n    for i in range(remaining):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            total_poly += 1\n        else:\n            total_nik += 1\n    \n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of rounds and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **GCD and LCM Calculation**: The GCD function is used to compute the LCM of the lengths of the move sequences, which determines the period after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Simulating One Period**: For each round within one period (LCM length), the moves of both players are determined, and the outcome is checked to count losses.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: The number of full periods within the total rounds is calculated, and the remaining rounds are processed separately.\n5. **Combining Results**: The total losses from full periods and the remaining rounds are combined to produce the final result.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the move sequences, ensuring that the solution is both optimal and scalable.",
