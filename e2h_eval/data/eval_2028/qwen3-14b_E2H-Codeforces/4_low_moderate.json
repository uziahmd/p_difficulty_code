The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about simulating a game of rock-paper-scissors between two players who have cyclic strategies. We need to calculate the number of times each loses over n rounds. But since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round one by one is impossible. So we need an efficient way to compute this.\n\nFirst, let me think about the approach. The key here is that both players' moves repeat cyclically. So for each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's move is B[i % k], where m and k are the lengths of their sequences.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, iterating through all n rounds is not feasible. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats, and compute the number of losses in each cycle, then multiply by the number of full cycles and add the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Let's call this L. Because after L rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles. So the pattern of moves between the two players will repeat every L rounds.\n\n2. For each round in the first L rounds, compute who wins, and count the number of losses for each player. Then, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // L, and the remainder is rem = n % L. So the total losses would be total_cycles * (losses in one cycle) plus the losses in the first rem rounds of the next cycle.\n\nBut wait, what if L is very large? For example, if m and k are both 1000, then LCM(m, k) could be up to 1e6. Which is manageable because 1e6 is acceptable for a loop. Because 1e6 iterations are okay even for Python.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Compute LCM of m and k. Let's call it lcm_length.\n\n- For each of the first lcm_length rounds, simulate the moves and count how many times each player loses. Let's call these counts per_cycle_nik, per_cycle_poly.\n\n- Then, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // lcm_length. The remaining rounds is rem = n % lcm_length.\n\n- So the total for the full cycles is total_cycles * per_cycle_nik and total_cycles * per_cycle_poly.\n\n- Then, simulate the first rem rounds, adding to the totals.\n\nBut how do I compute the LCM?\n\nWell, LCM(a, b) = a * b / GCD(a, b). So first, compute GCD of m and k. Then compute LCM.\n\nSo the first thing is to compute GCD. For that, Euclidean algorithm.\n\nBut for Python, there's math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nBut for Python versions, perhaps the code needs to handle that. But assuming that the code is written with math.gcd, and for m and k positive, it's okay.\n\nOnce we have the LCM, then proceed.\n\nNow, the problem is to simulate for the first lcm_length rounds, which could be up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1000 each, LCM can be up to 1e6). For each of those rounds, compute the moves of A and B, check who wins, and count the losses.\n\nBut how to compute the moves for each round i (from 0 to lcm_length - 1):\n\nFor round i, Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's is B[i % k].\n\nSo for each i in 0 to lcm_length-1:\n\na = A[i % m]\n\nb = B[i % k]\n\nThen determine who wins. For each such pair, we can check:\n\nif a == b: no loss.\n\nelse:\n\nif a beats b: then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a red spot (so Nikephoros's loss count increases by 1? Wait no. Wait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser, so he gets a red spot. So Nikephoros's red spots count is incremented when he loses. So for each round, we need to check if Nikephoros loses, then add 1 to his count, else if Polycarpus loses, add 1 to his count.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b), determine who loses.\n\nLet me think about the rules:\n\nRock beats scissors (R beats S)\n\nScissors beat paper (S beats P)\n\nPaper beats rock (P beats R)\n\nSo for a given a and",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing n rounds of rock-paper-scissors using their respective cyclic strategies. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible, so we use an efficient approach based on the least common multiple (LCM) of their strategy cycles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use cyclic sequences for their moves. Nikephoros's sequence repeats every m rounds, and Polycarpus's sequence repeats every k rounds. The combined cycle length is the LCM of m and k.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: Calculate the LCM of m and k to determine the length of the combined cycle after which both sequences realign.\n3. **Simulate One Cycle**: Simulate the game for one full combined cycle (LCM length) to count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Full and Remaining Cycles**: Calculate the number of full cycles that fit into n rounds and the remaining rounds after these full cycles. Use the precomputed counts from the full cycle and simulate the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a_seq = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    b_seq = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(a_seq)\n    k = len(b_seq)\n    \n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n    lcm_length = (m * k) // gcd_val\n    \n    # Precompute the number of losses in one LCM cycle\n    nik_losses = 0\n    poly_losses = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm_length):\n        a = a_seq[i % m]\n        b = b_seq[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        # Determine who loses\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            poly_losses += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            nik_losses += 1\n    \n    total_cycles = n // lcm_length\n    remainder = n % lcm_length\n    \n    total_nik = total_cycles * nik_losses\n    total_poly = total_cycles * poly_losses\n    \n    # Now process the remainder rounds\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a = a_seq[i % m]\n        b = b_seq[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            total_poly += 1\n        else:\n            total_nik += 1\n    \n    print(f\"{total_nik} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of rounds and the sequences for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is calculated to determine the length of the combined cycle.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: The game is simulated for one full LCM cycle to count the number of losses for each player during this period.\n4. **Full Cycles Handling**: The total number of full cycles within n rounds is determined, and the losses from these cycles are computed by multiplying the per-cycle losses by the number of full cycles.\n5. **Remaining Rounds**: Any remaining rounds after the full cycles are simulated individually to accumulate the final loss counts.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of n by leveraging the periodic nature of the players' strategies, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
