She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The browser has n tabs. The cursor is at position pos. She needs to close all tabs not in [l, r]. Each second she can move left or right, or close tabs to the left or right. Closing tabs is a single action, but moving takes time.\n\nSo the goal is to find the minimal steps required to close all tabs outside l to r.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. Let's consider the initial position and the required segment.\n\nThe first thing to note is that the required segment is [l, r]. So any tabs outside this need to be closed. But how?\n\nThe closing operations can be done by moving to a certain position and then closing left or right. For example, if she wants to close all tabs to the left of some position, she can do that in one second once she's there. Similarly for the right.\n\nBut the problem is that when she closes tabs, the a and b (the min and max indices of unclosed tabs) change. However, since the problem requires that the final state is exactly [l, r], perhaps we can model the process as needing to close tabs to the left of l and to the right of r.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Close all tabs to the left of l. That would require moving to l (or maybe some position to the left of l?), then closing left. Wait, no. Because if you are at position x, closing all tabs to the left of x (i.e., [a, x-1]). But if you want to close all tabs to the left of l, then you need to have a position where closing left would remove those tabs.\n\nWait, let's think: suppose l is 2. So the required segment starts at 2. So all tabs before 2 must be closed. How to do that?\n\nShe can move to position 2, then close all tabs to the left. That would close tabs 1. Alternatively, she could move to position 1, then close left (but that would close nothing, since a is 1, so [a, i-1] is [1,0], which is invalid). So the correct way is to be at position l, then close left. That would remove all tabs before l.\n\nSimilarly, to close tabs after r, she needs to be at position r, then close right. That would remove all tabs after r.\n\nBut how to get there?\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Move to l (if needed), then close left. Then move to r (if needed), then close right. But maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can do both operations in one go. For example, if she is already at l, then she can close left. Then, she can move to r and close right. But what's the minimal steps?\n\nBut what if l is already in the current position? Or if the current position is already in the [l, r] range?\n\nLet me think about the example given.\n\nIn the first sample input: 6 3 2 4. So n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. The required segment is 2-4. So tabs 1,5,6 need to be closed.\n\nThe optimal steps were: move to 2 (from 3, which takes 1 second), then close left (which closes tab 1). Then move to 3 (from 2, 1 sec?), then move to 4 (another sec), then close right (which closes 5 and 6). Total steps: 1 (move to 2) + 1 (close left) + 2 (move to 4) + 1 (close right) = total 5 seconds. Which matches the sample output.\n\nWait, but the steps are:\n\nMove to 2 (1 sec), close left (1 sec). Then move to 3 (1 sec?), then move to 4 (another sec?), then close right (another sec). So 1+1+1+1+1=5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the idea is that, the steps involve moving to positions where you can perform the closing operations.\n\nNow, the question is: what's the minimal steps required to reach the positions where you can close the left and right parts.\n\nBut there's another possibility: maybe she can close both left and right in a single operation. For example, if she is already in the required segment, maybe she can close left and right in some way. But no, because closing left would close everything to the left of her current position. But if she's in the required segment, then she can't close left unless she's at l, and",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the specified segment [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves efficiently moving the cursor and performing closing operations to achieve the desired result in the least time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Target Positions**: Determine if Luba needs to close tabs to the left of `l` and/or to the right of `r`.\n2. **Cursor Movement**: Calculate the time required to move the cursor to the positions where closing operations can be performed optimally.\n3. **Closing Operations**: Once at the optimal positions, perform the closing operations which take 1 second each.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n# If the current segment is already the required one, no action needed\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Determine if we need to close left and/or right\n    need_close_left = l > 1\n    need_close_right = r < n\n\n    # Calculate steps required\n    steps = 0\n\n    # If need to close left, find the position to close left (which is l)\n    if need_close_left:\n        # Move to l\n        steps += abs(pos - l)\n        # Close left (1 sec)\n        steps += 1\n\n    # If need to close right, find the position to close right (which is r)\n    if need_close_right:\n        # Move to r from the current position (after possible left close)\n        # After closing left, the current position is l, but if we didn't need to close left, it's pos\n        # So, the current position after handling left is either l or pos\n        current_pos = l if need_close_left else pos\n        steps += abs(current_pos - r)\n        # Close right (1 sec)\n        steps += 1\n\n    print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Check Immediate Case**: If the current segment [l, r] is already the entire range of tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no actions are needed, so the result is 0.\n2. **Determine Closing Needs**: Check if tabs need to be closed on the left side (if l > 1) and/or on the right side (if r < n).\n3. **Calculate Movement Steps**: Compute the steps required to move the cursor to the appropriate positions (l for closing left and r for closing right) and add the time for the closing operations themselves.\n4. **Output Result**: The total steps calculated give the minimum time required to close all unnecessary tabs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal steps by focusing on the necessary movements and operations, leveraging direct calculations for optimal performance.",
