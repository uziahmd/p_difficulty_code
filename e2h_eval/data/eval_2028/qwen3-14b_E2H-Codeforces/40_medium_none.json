The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And then return this count modulo a given mod. The constraints are n up to 500, which suggests that O(n^3) or similar approaches might be possible, but I need to think about how to compute this efficiently.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. For each pair of permutations p and q, if p is lex smaller than q and inv(p) > inv(q), we count it. But since there are n! permutations, checking all pairs directly would be impossible for n=500. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the total number of possible pairs. Since p and q are permutations, and considering all ordered pairs where p < q lex-wise. But the problem counts each such pair once, but only if their inversion counts satisfy inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut how can I compute this?\n\nLet me first think about the total number of pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q. Since for any two distinct permutations, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of such pairs is (total_permutations * (total_permutations -1 )) / 2. But since each pair (p, q) where p != q contributes once to either p < q or q < p. However, for our problem, we need to consider only those pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut perhaps I can find the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) by considering all pairs (p, q) where p < q and subtracting those where inv(p) <= inv(q). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find for each possible inversion count i and j, the number of permutations with i inversions and j inversions, then multiply them and count the pairs where i > j and p < q. But how to account for the p < q condition?\n\nWait, but the problem requires p < q in lex order. So for each pair of permutations p and q where p is lex smaller than q, we check if inv(p) > inv(q). How can I model this?\n\nLet me consider that for each pair (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of such pairs is (n!)^2 - n! divided by 2, but since we are only interested in those pairs where p < q, which is exactly half of the total pairs where p != q.\n\nBut how does that help? Well, perhaps the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) < inv(q) plus the number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q) and p < q. Wait, no. Because for each pair where p < q, inv(p) can be compared with inv(q) in three ways: greater, less, or equal. Let me denote:\n\nLet A be the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\nLet B be the number of pairs with p < q and inv(p) < inv(q).\nLet C be the number of pairs with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nThen, since for each pair (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So, for all pairs where p != q, the total inv(p) > inv(q) is A + B', where B' is the number of pairs where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nFor each unordered pair {p, q}, where p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So for each such pair, exactly one of the following is true:\n\n- inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q (counts towards A)\n- inv(p) < inv(q) and p < q (counts towards B)\n- inv(p) = inv(q) and p < q (counts towards C)\nOR\n- inv(q) > inv(p) and q < p (which would be equivalent to inv(p) < inv(q) and p > q, so this is part of B's counterpart)\n- inv(q) < inv(p) and q < p (which would be part of A's counterpart)\n- inv(q) = inv(p) and q < p (part of C's counterpart)\n\nSo, for all unordered pairs {p, q}, exactly one of the following is true:\n\nEither p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) (A), or p < q and inv(p) < inv(q) (B), or p < q and inv(p) = inv(q) (C), or q < p and inv(q) > inv(p) (which is same as inv(p) < inv(q) and p < q? No, wait. If q < p, then inv(q) > inv(p) would be counted in A's counterpart? Or not. Let me think.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose p and q are two permutations, with p < q. Then, for this pair, inv(p) could be greater than inv(q) (counted in A), less (B), or equal (C). Now, for the pair (q, p), since q > p, it's not considered in the A, B, C counts. So the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q is T = (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. \n\nNow, for all pairs (p, q) where p != q, the sum of A + B + C + D + E + F? No. Wait, for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So for all such pairs, the total number of (p, q) with p < q is T, and the same for q < p. Now, for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of the following is true: either p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) (so contributes to A), or q < p and inv(p) > inv(q) (which implies inv(q) < inv(p), so contributes to B's counterpart when considering q < p and inv(q) < inv(p)).\n\nSo, the total number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to A + D, where D is the number of pairs where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p) (since inv(p) > inv(q) implies inv(q) < inv(p)). But since for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of the two possibilities (p < q or q < p) holds. So the total number of such pairs is A + D = (number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q)).\n\nBut how does this relate to our problem?\n\nOur problem requires us to compute A, which is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nIf we can find the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), then since for each such pair, exactly one of (p < q, inv(p) > inv(q)) or (q < p, inv(q) < inv(p)) is true. Therefore, the total number of such unordered pairs is equal to the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q (A) plus the number of ordered pairs (q, p) where inv(q) < inv(p) and q < p (which would be B's counterpart? No, wait. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think of the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q). Let's call this total X. Then, since for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(q) > inv(p) holds. So X equals the number of such unordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by 1 (since each unordered pair contributes once to X or to the other direction). But since the total number of ordered pairs where p != q is n! * (n! - 1), and the number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q) is Y, then X + (number of ordered pairs with inv(q) > inv(p)) + Y = n!*(n! -1). But since X is equal to the number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q), and the number of ordered pairs where inv(q) > inv(p) is equal to X if the inv counts are symmetric. Wait, no. Because for each pair (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q), there's a corresponding (q, p) where inv(q) < inv(p). So the number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of ordered pairs where inv(q) > inv(p). So X equals the number of ordered pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and that's equal to the number of ordered pairs where inv(p) < inv(q). Let me denote that as X = Z, where Z is the number of ordered pairs with inv(p) < inv(q). Then, the total number of ordered pairs with p != q is X + Z + Y = n!*(n!-1). But since X = Z, then 2X + Y = n!*(n!-1). \n\nBut how does this help me find A?\n\nWell, A is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Similarly, B is the number of ordered pairs where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q). Then, since for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of (p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)) or (p < q and inv(p) < inv(q)) or (q < p and inv(q) > inv(p)) or (q < p and inv(q) < inv(p))? No, for each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of (p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)) or (q < p and inv(q) < inv(p)) holds. Because if p < q, then inv(p) > inv(q) contributes to A. Otherwise, if q < p, then inv(q) < inv(p) which would be the same as inv(p) > inv(q) and q < p, which would be part of the count for ordered pairs (q, p) where inv(q) < inv(p). But that's not directly helpful here.\n\nBut what if I can compute the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q (A) and the same for inv(p) < inv(q) and p < q (B). Then, since for all ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q, A + B + C = T, where T is the total number of such pairs (T = (n! * (n! - 1))/2). Also, since for all unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), exactly one of A or the corresponding case where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p) is counted. \n\nBut I don't see a direct way to compute A from X. However, perhaps there's a symmetry here. Suppose that for all pairs (p, q) where p < q, the number of such pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) if there is some symmetry. But that's not necessarily true because the lex order and inversion counts may not be independent.\n\nAlternatively, think about the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) plus the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) < inv(q) plus the number of pairs with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q) equals T. Also, the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) with inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to A + D, where D is the number of ordered pairs (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p). But D is equal to B. Because for each ordered pair (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p), that's equivalent to (p, q) where p > q and inv(p) > inv(q). Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nLet me consider all ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q). This includes:\n\n- All pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) (A)\n- All pairs (p, q) where p > q and inv(p) > inv(q) (which would be the same as inv(q) < inv(p) and p > q)\n\nBut the number of such pairs is X = A + D, where D is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p > q and inv(p) > inv(q). But how is D related to other variables?\n\nAlternatively, think of the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) as X. Then, since for each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) has inv(p) > inv(q). Therefore, X is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by 1. But since for each such unordered pair, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in X. However, the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with inv(p) > inv(q) is the same as the number of unordered pairs with inv(q) > inv(p). No, that's not right. For each unordered pair {p, q} with inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of the two holds. So the total number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the total number of such pairs where inv(q) > inv(p), but that's not possible unless they are equal. Which they are not. Wait, no. For each unordered pair {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q), it's counted once in X. For the same pair, the ordered pair (q, p) would have inv(q) < inv(p), so it's not counted in X. So X counts all ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q), regardless of the lex order between p and q.\n\nBut how does this help me find A?\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to find a way to compute A using the inversion counts and the lex order properties.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me precompute for each possible inversion count i, the number of permutations with exactly i inversions. Let's call this array cnt[i]. Then, for all pairs of inversion counts i and j, if i > j, the number of pairs (p, q) where p has i inversions and q has j inversions is cnt[i] * cnt[j]. But this counts all ordered pairs (p, q) where p has i and q has j. However, among these, how many have p < q lex-wise?\n\nIf I can compute for each pair (i, j) where i > j, the number of (p, q) pairs where p has i inversions, q has j inversions, and p < q, then summing over all i > j gives the answer A.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nThe problem is that for each i and j, the number of pairs (p, q) with i inversions and j inversions and p < q is (cnt[i] * cnt[j] - same_pairs) / 2 + same_pairs_part? Not sure.\n\nWait, for two distinct permutations p and q with i and j inversions respectively, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where p < q. But for permutations p and q, if they are distinct, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So for the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p has i inversions and q has j inversions, the number of pairs where p < q is equal to (total_pairs) / 2 if i != j and the number of permutations with i inversions is the same as those with j inversions. But this isn't necessarily the case.\n\nWait, suppose that for a given i and j, there are a total of cnt[i] * cnt[j] ordered pairs (p, q) where p has i inversions and q has j inversions. Among these, how many have p < q?\n\nIf i != j, then for each pair (p, q) where p and q are distinct, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. However, if i = j, then p and q may be equal (but since they are permutations, p can't be equal to q unless they are the same permutation. So for i = j, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q is (cnt[i] choose 2) since each unordered pair contributes once to p < q.\n\nBut for i != j, how many of the cnt[i] * cnt[j] ordered pairs have p < q? Well, for each pair (p, q) where p is a permutation with i inversions and q is a permutation with j inversions, and p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of such ordered pairs is cnt[i] * cnt[j]. But the number of unordered pairs is (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) if i != j, but each unordered pair {p, q} is counted once in the ordered pairs (p, q) and (q, p). So the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and p has i inversions, q has j inversions is equal to (cnt[i] * cnt[j] - same_count) / 2, where same_count is the number of ordered pairs where p = q. But since p and q are permutations, p = q implies that i = j and p = q. But in this case, when i != j, there are no such pairs. So for i != j, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) with p < q is (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2. But this is only true if for all pairs (p, q) where p has i inversions and q has j inversions, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Which is true since p and q are different permutations (because i != j? No. Wait, even if i = j, p and q could be different permutations. But for the case where i != j, p and q can be same only if they are same permutation, which would require i = j. So for i != j, all ordered pairs (p, q) where p has i and q has j are distinct permutations. So for each such pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Therefore, for i != j, the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q is (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q, inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j is:\n\n- if i == j: (cnt[i] choose 2) (since each unordered pair contributes once)\n- if i != j: (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2\n\nTherefore, for our problem, the answer A is the sum over all i > j of [ (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2 ].\n\nWait, because when i > j, we want to count the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) is i, inv(q) is j, and p < q. Since for each such i and j, the number of such pairs is (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2. Then, summing over all i > j gives the total A.\n\nBut wait, this assumes that for any i and j where i > j, the number of pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j and p < q is (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2. But this is only true if for all pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j, exactly half of them have p < q and half have q < p. But why would that be the case?\n\nThis would be the case if for any two permutations p and q with inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j (i != j), the probability that p < q is 0.5. But is this true?\n\nWell, the lex order of permutations is independent of their inversion counts. So for any two distinct permutations p and q, the probability that p < q is exactly 0.5. Because for any two distinct permutations, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Therefore, for any pair of permutations (p, q) where p and q have different inversion counts, the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q is exactly half of the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p and q are distinct and have those inversion counts.\n\nTherefore, the formula for A is sum_{i > j} (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2.\n\nBut wait, the sum over i > j of (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2 is equal to (total_pairs_with_i>j) / 2, where total_pairs_with_i>j is the sum over i > j of cnt[i] * cnt[j].\n\nBut then, the answer would be (sum_{i > j} cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2.\n\nBut how do I compute this sum?\n\nLet me think. The sum over all i and j where i > j of cnt[i] * cnt[j] is equal to ( (sum_i cnt[i])^2 - sum_i cnt[i]^2 ) / 2. Because sum_{i != j} cnt[i] * cnt[j] = (sum cnt[i])^2 - sum cnt[i]^2. And sum_{i != j} is equal to sum_{i < j} + sum_{i > j} = 2 * sum_{i > j} (since for each i < j, there is a corresponding j > i). Therefore, sum_{i > j} cnt[i] * cnt[j} = [ (sum cnt[i})^2 - sum cnt[i]^2 ] / 2.\n\nSo then, the answer A is equal to ( [ (sum cnt[i})^2 - sum cnt[i]^2 ] / 2 ) / 2 = [ (sum cnt[i})^2 - sum cnt[i]^2 ] / 4 ?\n\nWait, no. Because the sum over i > j of cnt[i] * cnt[j] is equal to [ (sum cnt)^2 - sum cnt^2 ] / 2. Then, the answer A is equal to that value divided by 2, because each term in the sum is multiplied by 1/2. Wait, earlier reasoning said that for i > j, the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q is (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2. Therefore, the total A is the sum over i > j of (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2. Which is equal to (sum_{i>j} cnt[i] * cnt[j}) ) / 2. Which is [ (sum cnt)^2 - sum cnt^2 ] / 4.\n\nBut sum cnt[i] is n! since it's the total number of permutations. Therefore, sum cnt[i]^2 is the sum of squares of the number of permutations for each inversion count. Therefore, the answer A is ( ( (n! )^2 - sum cnt[i]^2 ) / 2 ) / 2 = (n!^2 - sum cnt^2) / 4.\n\nWait, that seems like a big simplification. Let me recheck:\n\nsum_{i > j} (cnt[i] * cnt[j]) / 2 = (sum_{i > j} cnt[i] * cnt[j}) ) / 2.\n\nBut sum_{i > j} cnt[i] * cnt[j} = [ (sum cnt)^2 - sum cnt^2 ] / 2.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nA = [ (sum cnt)^2 - sum cnt^2 ] / 2 / 2 = [ (sum cnt)^2 - sum cnt^2 ] / 4.\n\nBut sum cnt is n! because it's the sum over all inversion counts of the number of permutations with that count. Therefore, sum cnt is n!.\n\nThus, A = ( (n! )^2 - sum cnt[i]^2 ) / 4.\n\nBut wait, this would be the case if all pairs (p, q) with i > j contribute (cnt[i] * cnt[j])/2 to A. But according to our previous reasoning, yes.\n\nBut then, the problem reduces to calculating sum cnt[i]^2, and then computing the formula above.\n\nBut then why does the sample input have n=4 and output 17?\n\nLet me test with n=4.\n\nFor n=4, n! = 24. The sum of squares of cnt[i] for inversion counts.\n\nWhat is the sum of squares of the number of permutations with each inversion count?\n\nFor n=4, the inversion counts can range from 0 to 6. Let me look up the numbers.\n\nThe number of permutations of 4 elements with k inversions:\n\nk=0: 1 (identity permutation)\nk=1: 1\nk=2: 2\nk=3: 3\nk=4: 5\nk=5: 6\nk=6: 5\n\nWait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can compute them. But perhaps I can find the sum of squares. For n=4, the number of permutations is 24. So sum cnt[i]^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 +5^2 +6^2 +5^2 ?\n\nWait, but the inversion counts for n=4 go up to 6. Let me check:\n\nYes, the maximum number of inversions for n=4 is 4*3/2 = 6.\n\nSo the counts for each inversion count:\n\nFor example, the number of permutations with 0 inversions is 1.\n\nNumber with 1 inversion: 1 (swap adjacent elements, e.g., 1 2 3 4 → swap 2 and 3 → 1 3 2 4, etc. But for n=4, the count for 1 inversion is C(4, 2) ? No. Wait, the number of permutations with exactly k inversions is given by the Mahonian numbers. For n=4, the Mahonian numbers are:\n\nk | count\n0 | 1\n1 | 1\n2 | 2\n3 | 3\n4 | 5\n5 | 6\n6 | 5\n\nSo sum cnt[i]^2 is 1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 5^2 = 1 + 1 +4 +9 +25 +36 +25 = 1+1=2, +4=6, +9=15, +25=40, +36=76, +25=101. Sum is 101.\n\nThen according to the formula, A = ( (24^2 - 101) ) / 4 = (576 - 101)/4 = 475/4 = 118.75. But this is not possible, since the answer for n=4 is 17. Clearly, this approach is wrong. So where is the mistake here?\n\nAh, this indicates that my previous reasoning is incorrect. There must be a flaw in my logic.\n\nSo the sample input says that for n=4, the answer is 17. According to this formula, it would be 475/4=118.75, which is not possible. So clearly, my reasoning was wrong.\n\nSo where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me re-examine the steps.\n\nEarlier, I assumed that for any i and j where i > j, the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q, inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j is (cnt[i] * cnt[j])/2. But this is only true if for every pair of permutations p and q with inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j (i != j), exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Which is true. But then, for each such pair (p, q), the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p has i and q has j is cnt[i] * cnt[j], and exactly half of them have p < q and the other half have q < p. Therefore, the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = i, inv(q) = j is (cnt[i] * cnt[j])/2. So summing over all i > j gives the total A. But according to the sample input, this would not hold.\n\nBut according to the sample input, when n=4, the answer is 17. Let's compute according to the formula:\n\nsum cnt[i]^2 is 101. n! is 24. So (24^2 - 101)/4 = (576 - 101)/4 = 475 /4 = 118.75. Which is not integer. Which is impossible. Hence, the formula must be wrong.\n\nTherefore, there's a mistake in my reasoning. Where?\n\nLet me think again. The mistake must be in assuming that for all i != j, the number of (p, q) pairs with inv(p)=i and inv(q)=j and p < q is (cnt[i] * cnt[j])/2. However, this is only true when i and j are different, but perhaps for some i and j, the number of pairs (p, q) where p has i inversions and q has j inversions and p < q is not equal to (cnt[i] * cnt[j])/2. Why?\n\nBecause the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q depends on the relation between p and q. However, the inversion counts are not independent of the lex order. Wait, but the lex order is determined by the permutation's elements, not by their inversion counts. So for two permutations p and q with different inversion counts, the number of times p < q should be exactly half of the total pairs (p, q) where p and q are distinct. But this seems to be the case.\n\nBut why does the sample input contradict this?\n\nIn the sample input, for n=4, the correct answer is 17. Let's compute according to the formula.\n\nLet me compute the actual value of A. According to the sample explanation, there are 17 valid pairs. So according to the formula, the value should be 17. Let's see what the formula would give.\n\nBut according to the formula, it would be ( (24^2 - sum cnt[i]^2 )) / 4. So let me compute sum cnt[i]^2 correctly.\n\nLet me find the correct values for cnt[i] for n=4.\n\nThe Mahonian numbers for n=4 are as follows (from OEIS or known tables):\n\nFor n=4, the inversion counts and their frequencies:\n\n0: 1\n\n1: 1\n\n2: 2\n\n3: 3\n\n4: 5\n\n5: 6\n\n6: 5\n\nSo sum cnt[i]^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 +5^2 +6^2 +5^2 = 1 +1 +4 +9 +25 +36 +25 = 101.\n\nThen, the formula would be (24^2 - 101)/4 = (576 - 101)/4 = 475/4 = 118.75. Which is impossible. But the actual answer is 17. So clearly, the formula is wrong. Therefore, my reasoning must have a mistake.\n\nSo what's wrong with the previous reasoning?\n\nLet me think again. The formula assumes that for all pairs (p, q) with inv(p) = i and inv(q) = j (i != j), exactly half of them have p < q. But this is not true. Because for example, if i > j, there may be more permutations with i inversions that are lex smaller than permutations with j inversions. Or vice versa. But why?\n\nNo, the lex order is not dependent on the inversion count. For example, consider two permutations p and q. Suppose p has more inversions than q. It's possible that p is lex smaller than q. For example, p = [2, 1, 3, 4] has 1 inversion, q = [1, 3, 2, 4] has 1 inversion. Wait, but in this case, p is [2,1,3,4], which is lex larger than q = [1,3,2,4]. So the inversion count is the same, but lex order is different.\n\nAnother example: p = [2, 1, 3, 4] (inversion count 1), q = [1, 2, 4, 3] (inversion count 1). p is lex larger than q. So for permutations with the same inversion count, their lex order varies. But for different inversion counts, it's not clear.\n\nBut the key point is that for two permutations p and q with different inversion counts, the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q depends on the inversion counts. Or does it not?\n\nWait, no. The lex order between p and q is independent of their inversion counts. So for any two distinct permutations p and q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Therefore, for all pairs (p, q) where p and q have different inversion counts, the number of pairs where p < q is exactly half of the total number of such pairs. But why does this not match the sample?\n\nLet me compute the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q. That is T = (24 * 23)/2 = 276. \n\nAccording to the formula, the total number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) is X = (sum_{i > j} cnt[i] * cnt[j} + sum_{i < j} cnt[i] * cnt[j} ) ? No, earlier X was the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q). Which is equal to sum_{i > j} cnt[i] * cnt[j}.\n\nBut according to the formula, sum_{i > j} cnt[i] * cnt[j} = [ (sum cnt)^2 - sum cnt^2 ] / 2 = (24^2 - 101)/2 = (576-101)/2 = 475/2 = 237.5. Which is not possible. So there's a mistake here.\n\nAh, here's the mistake. The sum_{i > j} cnt[i] * cnt[j} is not equal to [ (sum cnt)^2 - sum cnt^2 ] / 2. Because sum_{i != j} cnt[i] * cnt[j} = sum_{i} sum_{j !=i} cnt[i] * cnt[j} = sum_i cnt[i] * (sum_j cnt[j} - cnt[i}) ) = sum_i cnt[i] * (n! - cnt[i}) ) = n! * sum_i cnt[i} - sum_i cnt[i]^2 = (n! )^2 - sum_i cnt[i]^2. Then, sum_{i != j} cnt[i] * cnt[j} = (n! )^2 - sum_i cnt[i]^2. And sum_{i != j} is equal to 2 * sum_{i > j} cnt[i] * cnt[j} }, because for each pair (i,j) where i != j, either i > j or i < j. Hence, sum_{i > j} cnt[i] * cnt[j} } = [ (n! )^2 - sum cnt[i]^2 ] / 2. \n\nBut for n=4, this would be (24^2 - 101)/2 = (576-101)/2 = 475/2 = 237.5. Which is not possible. Hence, there's a mistake in the calculation of sum cnt[i]^2. \n\nWait, this indicates that my earlier calculation of sum cnt[i]^2 for n=4 is wrong. Because for n=4, the sum cnt[i]^2 must be such that (n! )^2 - sum cnt[i]^2 is even. Since sum_{i > j} cnt[i] * cnt[j} must be an integer.\n\nLet me recheck the Mahonian numbers for n=4. Maybe I got the counts wrong.\n\nLooking up the Mahonian numbers for n",
