Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room with candles, considering that he can reuse the burnt-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo the initial number of candles is a. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. The key is that every b burnt candles can be turned into a new one. And this new one can be used again, which might lead to more burnt ones. So it's a recursive process.\n\nLet me think of the example given. For input 4 and 2: \n\nHe starts with 4 candles. They burn for 4 hours. Then he has 4 burnt ones. He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He lights those, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 burnt ones. Again, he can make 2/2 = 1 new candle. That adds 1 hour. Now he has 1 burnt candle. Which is less than b=2, so he can't make more. Total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see. Initial 6 hours. Then 6 burnt, make 6/3=2 new. Add 2 hours. Now 2 burnt. Not enough for 3. Wait, but wait. Wait, 2 is less than 3. So total is 6 + 2 = 8? But the sample output is 8. Yes. So that's correct.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the number of burnt candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones. But how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nInitially, the total hours is a. Because each candle is burned once. Then, we have a burnt candles. Then, while the number of burnt candles is >= b, we can make new candles. Each time, the number of new candles is (burnt // b). But then, those new candles are burned, adding to the hours, and then they become burnt again.\n\nWait, but how to track this?\n\nLet me think of variables. Let's say:\n\ntotal_hours = a\n\nburnt_candles = a\n\nThen, while burnt_candles >= b:\n\n    new_candles = burnt_candles // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    burnt_candles = (burnt_candles % b) + new_candles\n\nRepeat this loop until burnt_candles < b.\n\nYes. Because each time, we take the burnt candles, make as many new ones as possible. Then, those new ones are burned, adding to the total hours, and then they become part of the burnt pile again.\n\nSo for example, in the first case:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal_hours starts at 4. burnt_candles =4.\n\nLoop:\n\n4 >= 2: yes.\n\nnew_candles = 4//2 = 2. total becomes 4+2=6. burnt_candles is 4%2=0 + 2 = 2.\n\nAgain, 2 >=2: yes. new_candles=2//2=1. total becomes 6+1=7. burnt_candles is 0 +1 =1. Now 1 <2. So stop. Total is 7.\n\nYes. Correct.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal_hours =6. burnt=6.\n\nLoop: 6//3=2. total becomes 6+2=8. burnt is 6%3=0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. So done. So total is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. Then initial total is 5. burnt is 5. 5//5=1. total becomes 6. burnt is 0 +1=1. Now stop. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=2. Let's see:\n\nInitial total 5. burnt=5.\n\nFirst iteration: 5//2=2. total is 5+2=7. burnt is 5%2=1 +2=3.\n\nSecond iteration: 3//2=1. total is 7+1=8. burnt is 3%2=1 +1=2.\n\nThird iteration: 2//2=1. total is 8+1=9. burnt is 0+1=1. Now stop. So total is 9.\n\nLet me check manually. Start with 5 candles: 5 hours. Burnt 5.\n\nMake 2 new (5//2=2). Burn them: +2 hours. Now burnt is 5-2*2=1 (original burnt) + 2 (from new ones) ? Wait, no. Wait, when you make 2 new candles, you use 4 burnt ones (since 5//2=2, which requires 2*2=4 burnt candles?), but wait no. Wait, the process is that you have 5 burnt candles. You take 5//2 = 2 (each requires 2). So 2*2=4 burnt candles are used, and you get 2 new. So the remaining burnt is 5 - 4 =1, plus the 2 new ones that are burned. So after burning them, you add 2 to the total. Then the new burnt is 1 + 2 =3. Which is what the code does.\n\nYes. So the code's approach is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize total_hours = a\n\nburnt = a\n\nloop:\n\nwhile burnt >= b:\n\n    new = burnt // b\n\n    total_hours += new\n\n    burnt = (burnt % b) + new\n\nreturn total_hours\n\nYes.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nThe input is two integers a and b. So read from stdin, split into a and b.\n\nThen compute as per the algorithm.\n\nEdge cases: when a is 0? Well, according to the input constraints, a is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: when b is 1? But according to the input constraints, b is at least 2. So no. So the code can handle all cases.\n\nLet me test the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 4 2.\n\ntotal_hours =4, burnt=4.\n\nLoop:\n\n4 >=2: new=2. total is 6. burnt is 0 +2=2.\n\nAgain, 2 >=2: new=1. total 7. burnt is 0 +1=1. exit. Output 7.\n\nSample 2: 6 3.\n\ntotal is 6. burnt=6.\n\nnew=6//3=2. total 8. burnt is 0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. So output 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=2. As discussed, output is 9.\n\nAnother test case: a=1, b=2. Then initial total is 1. burnt=1. No more. So output 1.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2. Initial total 2. burnt=2. new=1. total 3. burnt=0 +1=1. exit. So output 3.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=2. Initial total 3. burnt=3.\n\nFirst iteration: 3//2=1. total 4. burnt is 3%2=1 +1=2.\n\nSecond iteration: 2//2=1. total 5. burnt is 0+1=1. exit. So total 5.\n\nYes. Which is correct. 3 initial, then 1 new (from 2 burnt), then another 1 (from 2 burnt again). So 3 +1 +1=5.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead a and b from input.\n\nThen:\n\ntotal = a\n\nburnt = a\n\nwhile burnt >= b:\n\n    new = burnt // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    burnt = (burnt % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let me code this.\n\nNow, the input is given as a single line with two integers, like for example '4 2' or '6 3'.\n\nIn Python, read from stdin, split into two integers.\n\nSo:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute as above.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nburnt = a\n\nwhile burnt >= b:\n\n    new = burnt // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    burnt = (burnt % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nFor input 4 2, output is 7. Correct.\n\nFor input 6 3, output is 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5. Output is 6.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=2. Output 9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Vasily can illuminate his room using candles, considering he can reuse the burnt-out candles to create new ones. The process involves repeatedly converting burnt-out candles into new ones until no more conversions are possible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`, which will burn for `a` hours initially.\n2. **Track Burnt Candles**: After each hour, the candles that burn out are collected and stored as \"burnt\" candles.\n3. **Convert Burnt Candles**: As long as there are enough burnt candles (at least `b`), convert them into new candles. Each conversion reduces the number of burnt candles and increases the total number of hours by the number of new candles created.\n4. **Repeat Conversion**: Continue the conversion process until there are not enough burnt candles left to form a new one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nburnt = a\nwhile burnt >= b:\n    new = burnt // b\n    total += new\n    burnt = (burnt % b) + new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by reading the input values `a` (initial number of candles) and `b` (number of burnt candles needed to make a new one). The initial total hours is set to `a` because each candle burns for one hour.\n2. **Burnt Candles Tracking**: After burning all initial candles, we track the number of burnt candles.\n3. **Conversion Loop**: While there are enough burnt candles to make a new one, we calculate how many new candles can be made. These new candles are then burned, increasing the total hours. The remaining burnt candles (after conversion) are updated to include both the leftover from the previous conversion and the newly burned candles.\n4. **Termination**: The loop terminates when there are not enough burnt candles left to form a new one, at which point we print the total number of hours the room was illuminated.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion process and ensures all possible reuses of burnt candles are considered, providing the optimal solution.",
