    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nThe instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array. So when I remove one element, I need to find which removal leads to the smallest max-min difference.\n\nFirst, let's consider the original array. The instability is max(a) - min(a). But when we remove an element, the new max and min could be different. However, for the array after removal, the max and min would be the same as the original array except in cases where the removed element was the max or min.\n\nWait, for example, if the original array has multiple instances of the max or min, then removing one of them might not change the overall max or min. But if there's only one occurrence, then removing it would change the max or min.\n\nSo, the key idea here is that when we remove an element, the new instability depends on whether that element was the max, min, or something in between.\n\nBut how can I efficiently compute the possible instabilities for each possible removal?\n\nLet me think. For each element in the array, if I remove it, the new array's max is the original max unless that element was the only occurrence of the original max. Similarly for the min.\n\nBut calculating this for each element directly would be O(n) per element, leading to O(n²) time, which is not feasible for n up to 1e5.\n\nSo I need a more efficient approach.\n\nWait, but maybe the optimal choice is to remove either the first occurrence of the max, the first occurrence of the min, or some other element. Wait, but perhaps the minimal instability is achieved by either removing the max, the min, or maybe some other element that's in between. However, how can I find that?\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the sorted array. Suppose I sort the array. Then, the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. Now, when I remove one element, the new instability would be the max of the remaining elements minus the min of the remaining elements. \n\nIf I sort the array, then for each position i in the sorted array, if I remove a[i], the new min is a[0] (if i is not 0) or a[1] (if i is 0). Similarly, the new max is a[-1] (if i is not last) or a[-2] (if i is last). \n\nWait, but that's only if the array is sorted. Let me think again. Suppose the array is sorted as a_0 ≤ a_1 ≤ ... ≤ a_{n-1}.\n\nIf I remove the first element (a_0), then the new min is a_1, and the max is a_{n-1}. So the instability is a_{n-1} - a_1.\n\nIf I remove the last element (a_{n-1}), the new instability is a_{n-2} - a_0.\n\nIf I remove any other element (say, a_i where 0 < i < n-1), then the min remains a_0 and the max remains a_{n-1}, so the instability is still a_{n-1} - a_0. Which is the same as the original instability.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, if the array is sorted, then the only way to reduce the instability is by removing the first element (so that the min increases) or the last element (so that the max decreases). Removing any other element doesn't change the min or max. Therefore, the minimal instability after removing one element would be the minimum between (a[n-2] - a[0]) and (a[n-1] - a[1]).\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple elements with the same value as the min or max? For example, if the array is [1, 1, 3, 3]. The original instability is 3-1=2. If I remove one of the 1s, the instability becomes 3-1=2 (since the min is still 1, and max is 3). If I remove a 3, the instability is 3-1=2. But if I remove the first element (1), the new array is [1,3,3], instability is 3-1=2. If I remove the second element (1), same thing. So in this case, the minimal instability is 2, which is same as original. But according to the earlier logic, the minimum between a[n-2]-a[0] (which would be 3-1=2) and a[n-1]-a[1] (3-1=2) is 2. So that works.\n\nAnother example: the first sample input is [",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the minimum and maximum values after removing each element.\n2. **Evaluate Instability After Removal**: When the array is sorted, removing the first element or the last element can potentially reduce the instability. This is because removing the first element increases the minimum value, and removing the last element decreases the maximum value. For other elements, the minimum and maximum values remain unchanged, so their removal does not affect the instability.\n3. **Calculate Minimum Instability**: The minimum instability after removing one element will be the minimum of the instability after removing the first element or the last element of the sorted array.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    a.sort()\n    min_instability = min(a[-2] - a[0], a[-1] - a[1])\n    print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n- **Instability Calculation**: After sorting, the instability when removing the first element is calculated as `a[-2] - a[0]` (since the new minimum is `a[1]` and the maximum remains `a[-1]`). Similarly, removing the last element gives an instability of `a[-1] - a[1]` (since the new maximum is `a[-2]` and the minimum remains `a[0]`).\n- **Result**: The minimum of these two values gives the optimal instability after removing one element, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures an efficient solution with a time complexity dominated by the sorting step, which is O(n log n), making it suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000 elements.",
