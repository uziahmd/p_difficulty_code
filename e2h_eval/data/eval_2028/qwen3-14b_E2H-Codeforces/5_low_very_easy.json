Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color, which can be a lowercase letter or a question mark. The question marks are wildcards that can match any color. I need to find the maximum number of pairs where a left boot and a right boot are compatible. And then output those pairs.\n\nThe key is to pair them optimally. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for each left boot and right boot, their colors must be compatible. So, either both are specific and same, or one is a question mark. But since the question marks can be matched with anything, maybe we can find a way to pair them optimally.\n\nBut how do I maximize the number of pairs? Let's think about possible steps.\n\nAn approach could be:\n\n1. Pair as many specific colors as possible. For example, if there's a left boot with color 'a', and a right boot with color 'a', pair them. But since there could be multiple such pairs, maybe we need to count frequencies.\n\nBut since the order matters (each boot can be used once), perhaps we need to track which ones have been used.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: first, process all pairs where both are specific colors. For each color c, pair the left boots with color c with the right boots with color c. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (those with '?'), pair them with any remaining boots (but considering that '?' can match any).\n\nBut how to handle this efficiently?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the problem as a bipartite graph matching problem, where each left boot is connected to right boots that are compatible. We need to find the maximum matching. However, for n up to 150,000, standard maximum bipartite matching algorithms like Hungarian would be too slow. So that's not feasible.\n\nThus, we need a greedy approach that can compute the maximum pairs efficiently.\n\nLet me think again. Since the question marks can match anything, perhaps we can first pair all the specific colors, and then use the question marks to pair the remaining.\n\nLet me outline steps:\n\nStep 1: Pair left and right boots with specific colors. For each color c (from 'a' to 'z'), count the number of left boots with color c and right boots with color c. The number of pairs for this color is the minimum of the two counts. But we need to track which specific boots are used here.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used? Well, perhaps for each color, collect the indices of left and right boots. Then for each color, pair as many as possible between left and right.\n\nFor example, for color 'a', if there are 3 left boots and 5 right boots, we can pair 3 of them. Then, the remaining 2 right boots with 'a' can't be paired with left boots unless there are other question marks.\n\nBut after pairing the specific colors, we can proceed to handle the question marks.\n\nBut what about the question marks? They can be paired with any remaining boots. However, the question marks can be used to pair with other question marks, or with specific colors.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- First, pair all left and right boots with specific colors. For each color, pair as many as possible between left and right. This is done by taking the minimum of the counts of left and right for that color. Once paired, those boots are no longer available.\n\n- Then, collect the remaining left and right boots (those not yet paired). These are the ones with '?' or specific colors that couldn't be paired because there were no matching specific colors on the other side.\n\n- Now, pair the remaining boots. Since '?' can match anything, but we have to pair left with right. How?\n\nIn this case, the remaining left boots could be some combination of specific colors and '?'s. Similarly for the right. But since the specific colors in the remaining left boots can't be paired with any right boots (since those were already processed), except for the ones that are also specific and not paired yet. Wait, no. Because in step 1, we already paired all possible specific colors. So, for example, if there is a left boot with color 'a' and a right boot with color 'a', they would have been paired in step 1. So after step 1, the remaining left and right boots with specific colors cannot be paired with each other. So, the only way to pair them is to use the question marks.\n\nSo, in step 2, the remaining left and right boots are those that either have a specific color that couldn't be matched (because the other side had none) or are question marks.\n\nSo, for step 2, the remaining left and right boots can be paired as follows:\n\nWe can pair the question marks from left with",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve the \"Colored Boots\" problem, we aim to find the maximum number of compatible pairs between left and right boots. Each boot can be either a specific color or an indefinite color (`?`), which is compatible with any other color. The challenge is to pair these boots optimally while ensuring each boot is used only once.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach Overview**\n\n1. **Pair Specific Colors First**:\n   - For each color from 'a' to 'z', count how many left and right boots have that exact color.\n   - Pair as many as possible between left and right boots with the same specific color.\n\n2. **Handle Remaining Boots with `?`**:\n   - After pairing all specific color matches, the remaining boots are those that either:\n     - Have a specific color that couldn't find a match.\n     - Are `?` (indefinite) and can match any color.\n   - Pair these using `?`s with any remaining boots on the opposite side (either specific or `?`).\n\n3. **Track Used Boots Efficiently**:\n   - Use sets to track indices of already paired boots to avoid reuse.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementation Details**\n\n- We use dictionaries to group left and right boots by their colors.\n- We process each color in alphabetical order to pair specific colors first.\n- After that, we handle the remaining `?`s by matching them greedily with any unpaired boots.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code**\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Maps from color to list of indices (0-based)\n    left_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n    right_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n        right_color_map[r[i]].append(i)\n\n    used_left = set()\n    used_right = set()\n    result = []\n\n    # Step 1: Pair specific colors\n    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n        if c not in left_color_map or c not in right_color_map:\n            continue\n        left_list = left_color_map[c]\n        right_list = right_color_map[c]\n        min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n        for i in range(min_len):\n            l_idx = left_list[i]\n            r_idx = right_list[i]\n            if l_idx not in used_left and r_idx not in used_right:\n                result.append((l_idx + 1, r_idx + 1))\n                used_left.add(l_idx)\n                used_right.add(r_idx)\n\n    # Step 2: Pair remaining with '?'\n    left_question = []\n    right_question = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] == '?' and i not in used_left:\n            left_question.append(i)\n        if r[i] == '?' and i not in used_right:\n            right_question.append(i)\n\n    # Pair remaining ? with any available (left with right)\n    for i in range(min(len(left_question), len(right_question))):\n        l_idx = left_question[i]\n        r_idx = right_question[i]\n        result.append((l_idx + 1, r_idx + 1))\n        used_left.add(l_idx)\n        used_right.add(r_idx)\n\n    # Now handle remaining left and right with specific colors that are not matched\n    # Left has specific color but not matched\n    left_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?' and i not in used_left]\n    right_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] != '?' and i not in used_right]\n\n    # Try to pair left with right where they are compatible\n    for l_idx in left_remaining:\n        lc = l[l_idx]\n        for r_idx in right_remaining:\n            rc = r[r_idx]\n            if lc == rc and l_idx not in used_left and r_idx not in used_right:\n                result.append((l_idx + 1, r_idx + 1))\n                used_left.add(l_idx)\n                used_right.add(r_idx)\n                break\n\n    print(len(result))\n    for pair in result:\n        print(pair[0], pair[1])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of Key Parts**\n\n- **Color Mapping**: We map each character to the list of indices where it appears.\n- **Used Sets**: These ensure that no boot is used more than once.\n- **Greedy Matching**: First, we match specific colors, then use question marks to fill in the rest.\n- **Final Match**: Any leftover specific colors are matched greedily if they match.\n\nThis algorithm ensures that we maximize the number of valid pairs while maintaining efficient performance even for large input sizes up to 150,000.",
