Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Hmm. The problem says that we have n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color, which can be a lowercase letter or a question mark. We need to pair them such that their colors are compatible. The maximum number of pairs possible, and output those pairs.\n\nSo the key is to find as many pairs as possible where either both are same, or one is a question mark. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. Let me think about the steps.\n\nLet me think about the possible strategies. Maybe first pair the specific colors. For example, for each color c, count how many left boots have c and how many right boots have c. The minimum of those counts would be the number of pairs we can make for that color. Then, the remaining left and right boots with question marks can be paired with each other or with the remaining ones.\n\nWait, but there's also the case where a left boot with a question mark can pair with a right boot with a specific color, and vice versa. So maybe the way to maximize is:\n\n1. Pair all left and right boots that have the same specific color. For each color c (excluding '?'), take min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) and add to the total. Then, subtract those from the respective counts.\n\n2. Then, handle the question marks. The remaining left '?' and right '?' can be paired with each other. Also, any left '?' can be paired with right non-? (if they are not already used), and vice versa.\n\nWait, but perhaps after step 1, there are some left and right boots with '?' and others with specific colors. How to optimally pair them?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to first pair the left '?' with right non-? (specific colors) and vice versa, but how?\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\nWe can process the pairs in two steps:\n\nStep 1: Pair left and right boots with the same specific color. For example, for each color c (a-z), count the number of left and right boots with c. For each such color, take the minimum of the counts, and add that to the total. Then, subtract those counts from the left and right counts. For example, if left has 3 'a's and right has 5 'a's, then we can make 3 pairs, so left's 'a's are all used, and right's 'a's have 2 left.\n\nStep 2: Now, handle the remaining boots. The remaining left boots can be either '?' or some specific colors that have leftovers. Similarly for the right. But the question is, how to pair them optimally.\n\nBut here's the thing: any left '?' can be paired with any right boot (specific or ?), and vice versa. However, since we want maximum pairs, perhaps we should first pair the left '?' with right non-? (since those can be used once, but if we pair them with ?s, they might be better used elsewhere). Wait, but maybe the best way is to pair as many as possible between left and right '?'s, and then pair the leftover ?s with the other leftover non-?s.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal approach is:\n\nAfter step 1, collect all the left boots that are not paired yet (including ?s) and same for right. Then, the maximum possible pairs is the minimum of the total number of left unpaired and right unpaired. Because each pair requires one left and one right. But how to pair them?\n\nWait, but in this case, the left and right may have some specific colors. For example, suppose after step 1, there are some left boots with 'a' and right boots with 'b', but no way to pair them. But if there are some left '?' and right 'a's, then they can be paired.\n\nSo the problem is, after step 1, how to pair the remaining boots. Let's think of the remaining left boots as being of two types: specific colors (which have no matching on the other side) and '?'. Same for right.\n\nSo here's an idea: for the remaining left and right boots, we can pair as follows:\n\n- First, pair the left '?' with the right non-? (specific colors) that are not yet paired. Because each left '?' can pair with any of these.\n\n- Then, pair the right '?' with the left non-? (specific colors) that are not yet paired.\n\n- Then, pair the remaining '?'s between left and right.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can collect all the left boots that are not yet paired (call them left_remain) and same for right_remain. Then, for each left_remain, we can try to pair it with a right_remain that is compatible. However, this seems computationally heavy",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to pair left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. A color is compatible if both are the same specific color or one of them is a question mark ('?'). The goal is to maximize the number of such pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Specific Colors**: First, count the occurrences of each specific color (excluding '?') in both the left and right boots. For each color, pair as many left and right boots as possible, limited by the minimum count of that color on either side.\n2. **Handle Question Marks**: After pairing specific colors, handle the remaining boots which may include question marks. Pair the remaining left and right boots with question marks optimally:\n   - Use left question marks to pair with right boots that have specific colors not yet paired.\n   - Use right question marks to pair with left boots that have specific colors not yet paired.\n   - Finally, pair the remaining question marks from both sides with each other.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport collections\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Step 1: Pair specific colors\n    left = list(l)\n    right = list(r)\n    \n    # Count specific colors for left and right\n    left_count = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    right_count = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    \n    for c in left:\n        if c != '?':\n            left_count[c] += 1\n    for c in right:\n        if c != '?':\n            right_count[c] += 1\n    \n    # For each color, pair min(left_count[c], right_count[c])\n    pairs = []\n    used_left = [False] * n\n    used_right = [False] * n\n    \n    for c in left_count:\n        if c in right_count:\n            cnt = min(left_count[c], right_count[c])\n            # Need to find cnt pairs of left and right with color c\n            # Find the first cnt left and right indices\n            left_indices = [i for i in range(n) if left[i] == c]\n            right_indices = [i for i in range(n) if right[i] == c]\n            \n            for i in range(cnt):\n                l_idx = left_indices[i]\n                r_idx = right_indices[i]\n                pairs.append((l_idx + 1, r_idx + 1))\n                used_left[l_idx] = True\n                used_right[r_idx] = True\n    \n    # Now, collect remaining left and right boots\n    left_remain = []\n    right_remain = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_left[i]:\n            left_remain.append(i)\n        if not used_right[i]:\n            right_remain.append(i)\n    \n    # Now, pair left ? with right non-?\n    left_q = []\n    right_non_q = []\n    for i in left_remain:\n        if left[i] == '?':\n            left_q.append(i)\n        else:\n            pass\n    for i in right_remain:\n        if right[i] != '?':\n            right_non_q.append(i)\n    \n    # Pair left_q with right_non_q\n    for i in range(min(len(left_q), len(right_non_q))):\n        l_idx = left_q[i]\n        r_idx = right_non_q[i]\n        pairs.append((l_idx + 1, r_idx + 1))\n        used_left[l_idx] = True\n        used_right[r_idx] = True\n    \n    # Collect remaining left non-? and right ?\n    left_non_q = []\n    right_q = []\n    for i in left_remain:\n        if not used_left[i]:\n            if left[i] != '?':\n                left_non_q.append(i)\n    for i in right_remain:\n        if not used_right[i]:\n            if right[i] == '?':\n                right_q.append(i)\n    \n    # Pair left_non_q with right_q\n    for i in range(min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q))):\n        l_idx = left_non_q[i]\n        r_idx = right_q[i]\n        pairs.append((l_idx + 1, r_idx + 1))\n        used_left[l_idx] = True\n        used_right[r_idx] = True\n    \n    # Now, pair remaining ? with ?\n    left_q_remain = []\n    right_q_remain = []\n    for i in left_remain:\n        if not used_left[i] and left[i] == '?':\n            left_q_remain.append(i)\n    for i in right_remain:\n        if not used_right[i] and right[i] == '?':\n            right_q_remain.append(i)\n    \n    cnt = min(len(left_q_remain), len(right_q_remain))\n    for i in range(cnt):\n        l_idx = left_q_remain[i]\n        r_idx = right_q_remain[i]\n        pairs.append((l_idx + 1, r_idx + 1))\n    \n    print(len(pairs))\n    for p in pairs:\n        print(p[0], p[1])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Counting Specific Colors**: We first count how many times each specific color appears in both left and right boots. This helps us determine how many pairs can be formed directly with matching colors.\n2. **Pairing Specific Colors**: For each specific color, we pair the minimum number of available left and right boots.\n3. **Handling Question Marks**: After pairing specific colors, we use the remaining question marks to pair with any available specific colors and then pair the remaining question marks with each other.
