On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray [l, r] in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. \n\nSo the key here is to figure out which subarray to reverse so that when we do that, the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) is as long as possible. \n\nFirst, let's think about the original LNDS. For example, if the original array is already non-decreasing, then reversing any subarray might not help. But if there are some 1s followed by 2s, maybe reversing a part can help merge some parts.\n\nBut since the array can be modified by reversing any interval, how do I find the best possible reversal?\n\nLet me think about the possible cases. Since the elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS is determined by the number of 1s and 2s and their arrangement. For example, the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of elements if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are in non-decreasing order.\n\nBut when you reverse a subarray, you can potentially fix some transitions between 1 and 2. For example, if there's a 2 followed by a 1, reversing that part would turn it into a 1 followed by a 2, which is better for the LNDS.\n\nBut how do I model this? Trying all possible intervals [l, r] and for each, compute the LNDS after reversal would be O(n^2 * n) time, which for n=2000 would be 2000^3 = 8e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo brute force is not feasible. Need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about what reversing a subarray does. When you reverse a subarray, the elements inside it are reversed. So, for example, if the original subarray was [a, b, c], after reversing it becomes [c, b, a]. The rest of the array remains the same.\n\nNow, the LNDS can be thought of as combining the parts before the reversed interval, the reversed interval, and the parts after. However, the optimal reversal would probably involve merging some parts of the array that were previously decreasing.\n\nSince the elements are only 1 and 2, perhaps the optimal approach is to find the best possible way to increase the number of transitions from 1 to 2.\n\nLet me think: the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of elements if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are in non-decreasing order. But how can reversing a subarray help?\n\nAnother approach: the LNDS is equal to the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1. Wait, no. Because in a non-decreasing sequence, all 1s come first, then all 2s. So the maximum possible LNDS is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s. But that's only if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, there are some 2s that come before 1s, which break the sequence.\n\nSo the original LNDS is the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, but that's not correct. Wait, no. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 1, 2], the LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2 or 1,1,2). But the count of 1s is 2 and 2s is 2. So the maximum possible is 3. Hmm.\n\nWait, the maximum possible LNDS for a sequence of 1s and 2s is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s minus the number of times a 2 comes before a 1. Or maybe not. Alternatively, the LNDS can be calculated by considering the number of 1s and 2s and the transitions between them.\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS can be found by looking at the number of 1s and 2s. For example, if there are x 1s and y 2s, the maximum possible LNDS is x + y if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's x + y - k, where k is the number of inversions between 2s and 1s. But I'm not sure.\n\nBut the problem is that when we reverse a subarray, we can change some of these inversions. For example, if there's a 2 followed by a 1 in the original array, reversing that pair would make it 1 followed by 2, which reduces the number of inversions.\n\nSo, the idea is that the optimal reversal is one that maximizes the number of such inversions that are fixed. However, how to model this?\n\nLet me think about the original array. Let's say that the original array has some positions where 2s are followed by 1s. Each such occurrence contributes to a decrease in the LNDS. Reversing a subarray that contains such positions can eliminate some of these inversions.\n\nBut how to find the best possible reversal?\n\nAnother observation: the maximum possible LNDS after reversal can be achieved by merging as many 1s as possible into the beginning and 2s into the end. So, perhaps the best reversal is one that increases the number of 1s before 2s.\n\nFor example, suppose the original array is [1,2,1,2]. The original LNDS is 3. But by reversing [2,3], we get [1,1,2,2], which gives LNDS of 4. So the reversal here eliminated the 2 followed by 1 (the 2 and 1 in positions 2 and 3).\n\nSo the key is to find the maximum number of such inversions (2 followed by 1) that can be eliminated by reversing a subarray. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal reversal is to take a segment that starts with some 2s and ends with some 1s. Reversing that segment would turn it into a segment that starts with 1s and ends with 2s, thus improving the LNDS.\n\nBut how to find such segments?\n\nLet me think about the original array. Let's consider the number of inversions (i.e., positions where a[i] = 2 and a[j] = 1 for i < j). Each such inversion reduces the maximum possible LNDS by 1. So the original maximum LNDS is total_length - number_of_inversions. Wait, is that correct?\n\nNo. For example, in the original array [1,2,1,2], there are two inversions: (2,3) and (2,4) and (3,4)? Wait, no. The inversions are pairs where a[i] > a[j] and i < j. Since the elements are 1 and 2, the only inversions are when a[i] is 2 and a[j] is 1. So in the array [1,2,1,2], the inversions are (2,3) and (2,4) and (3,4) is 1 and 2, which is not an inversion. Wait, (2,3) is 2 followed by 1. (2,4) is 2 followed by 2, not inversion. (3,4) is 1 followed by 2, not inversion. So only one inversion here. The original LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2 or 1,1,2). But according to the formula total_length - number_of_inversions would be 4 - 1 = 3, which matches. In the example where after reversing, the array becomes [1,1,2,2], which has zero inversions. Then the LNDS is 4, which equals 4 - 0 = 4. So maybe the maximum LNDS is equal to total_length minus the number of inversions in the array. But wait, what if the array is [2,1,2,1]. The number of inversions is 2 (positions (1,2), (1,4), (3,4)? Let me count:\n\nOriginal array [2,1,2,1]. The pairs (i,j) with i<j and a[i]>a[j] are:\n\n(1,2): 2>1\n\n(1,4): 2>1\n\n(3,4): 2>1\n\nTotal of 3 inversions. So according to the formula, the LNDS would be 4-3=1? But the actual LNDS is 2 (like 2,2 or 1,1). So that's not matching. So the formula is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so that approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative idea: since the elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that appear after the last 1 in the sequence. Wait, no. For example, in [2,1,2,1], the LNDS is 2. The count of 1s is 2, and the count of 2s after the last 1 is zero. But the LNDS could be 2 (like the two 1s, or the two 2s). But the maximum is 2. So maybe the LNDS is max( number of 1s, number of 2s, ... something else? )\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS can be calculated as follows: the maximum number of elements in a non-decreasing sequence is equal to the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last occurrence of 1. Or maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have all 1s first, then all 2s. Then the LNDS is n. If there are some 2s followed by 1s, then the LNDS is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1. Wait, no. For example, in the array [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 3. The number of 1s is 2, the number of 2s after the last 1 is 1 (the 2 at position 4). So 2+1=3. Which matches. For the array [2,1,2,1], the number of 1s is 2, and the number of 2s after the last 1 (which is at position 4) is zero. So the LNDS would be 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [2,2,1,1]. The LNDS is 2 (the 2s, or the 1s). But according to the formula, the number of 1s is 2, and the number of 2s after the last 1 is zero. So 2+0=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1,2,2,1]. The LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2). The number of 1s is 2, the number of 2s after the last 1 (position 3) is zero. Wait, but the 2s are before the last 1. So that formula would give 2+0=2, but the actual LNDS is 3. So that formula is also incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative approach: For the array consisting of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, plus the number of transitions from 1 to 2. Or maybe not. Let's think again.\n\nWait, for the array [1,2,2,1], the LNDS is 3. How? The longest non-decreasing subsequence is 1,2,2. So the count of 1s is 2, and the count of 2s is 2. The LNDS is 3, which is the maximum between the count of 1s and 2s. But that's not helpful.\n\nSo perhaps another way: the LNDS is equal to the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1. But in the case of [1,2,2,1], the last 1 is at position 4. There are no 2s after it. So that formula would give 2 (number of 1s) + 0 = 2, but the actual LNDS is 3. So that approach is not correct.\n\nThis suggests that trying to model the LNDS directly may be complicated. So perhaps we need to think about how reversing a subarray affects the LNDS.\n\nLet me think of the problem differently. The original array can be modified by reversing any subarray. We want to find the reversal that gives the maximum LNDS.\n\nThe maximum possible LNDS for any array of 1s and 2s is the total number of elements if it's non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are after the last 1. But again, I'm not sure.\n\nBut since the elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS can be determined by the number of 1s and the number of 2s. For example, the maximum possible LNDS is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are after the last occurrence of 1. Wait, but that's not always true.\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS can be computed as follows: the maximum length is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are not preceded by any 1. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS is the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, or the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are in the right part of the array. This seems too vague.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's think of the LNDS as being formed by taking all the 1s and as many 2s as possible. For example, if there's a group of 1s followed by a group of 2s, then the LNDS is the total length. But if there are 2s followed by 1s, then those 2s can't be part of the LNDS unless they are followed by 2s.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the best way to reverse a subarray so that the number of 2s that are after the last 1 is maximized, or something like that.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the following: the optimal scenario is that all the 1s are first, followed by all the 2s. So the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of elements. So the question is, can we find a reversal that makes this possible?\n\nIf the original array is already such, then we don't need to do anything. Otherwise, perhaps the best reversal is to find a segment that starts with some 2s and ends with some 1s. Reversing that segment would turn those 2s into 1s and vice versa, thereby reducing the number of 2s before 1s.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nLet me think about the original array. Let's imagine that there are some 1s and 2s. Suppose that there are some positions where 2s are followed by 1s. Each such occurrence is a \"bad\" transition. Reversing a segment that includes some of these bad transitions can eliminate them.\n\nBut how to model this? For example, consider the array [1,2,1,2]. The bad transitions are (2,3) (2 followed by 1). Reversing [2,3] turns it into [1,1,2,2], which removes the bad transition and gives a full non-decreasing array.\n\nSo the key is to find the segment that has the maximum number of bad transitions, and reversing it would eliminate them. But how to calculate that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the original array as a series of blocks. For example, blocks of 1s and 2s. For example, [1,2,1,2] has blocks [1], [2], [1], [2].\n\nReversing a segment that starts in one block and ends in another could merge blocks.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe maximum possible LNDS after any reversal can be computed as follows:\n\nThe original array has some number of 1s and 2s. Let's denote the total number of 1s as cnt1 and 2s as cnt2.\n\nThe maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is cnt1 + cnt2 - k, where k is the minimal number of inversions (2 followed by 1) that cannot be removed by any reversal.\n\nBut how to find k?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible LNDS is cnt1 + cnt2 - (number of inversions - x), where x is the maximum number of inversions that can be removed by reversing a segment. But how to find x?\n\nEach reversal can remove some number of inversions. The best reversal is the one that removes the maximum number of inversions.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of inversions that can be removed by reversing a subarray. Then, the answer is (original LNDS) + x, but I'm not sure how to compute the original LNDS.\n\nBut what is the original LNDS? Well, for the array of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is equal to the count of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1. Wait, not sure. Let's think again.\n\nLet me think of the original array as follows: the LNDS is the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, or the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are after the last 1. For example, in the array [1,2,1,2], the last 1 is at position 3. The number of 2s after that is 1. So 2 (number of 1s) + 1 (number of 2s after) = 3. Which is correct. In the array [2,1,2,1], the last 1 is at position 4, and there are no 2s after. So the LNDS is 2 (number of 1s) + 0 = 2. Which is correct. In the array [1,2,2,1], the last 1 is at position 4. The number of 2s after is zero. So the LNDS would be 2 (number of 1s) + 0 = 2. But in reality, the LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2). So that formula is not correct.\n\nHmm. So that approach is not working.\n\nAlternative Idea: For an array of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is the maximum between:\n\n- the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1.\n\n- the number of 2s plus the number of 1s that are after the last 2.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The LNDS can be formed by taking all 1s and then as many 2s as possible. Alternatively, taking all 2s and then as many 1s as possible (but that's not possible because 1 is less than 2, so the sequence would be decreasing).\n\nWait, no. The LNDS is non-decreasing. So the best is to have all 1s first, followed by all 2s. So the LNDS is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1.\n\nBut in the case of [1,2,2,1], the last 1 is at position 4. So the number of 2s after it is zero. But the LNDS is 3. How?\n\nAh, because there are 2s before the last 1. So perhaps the formula should be the maximum between:\n\nnumber of 1s + number of 2s that are after the last 1, and \n\nnumber of 2s + number of 1s that are after the last 2.\n\nBut for [1,2,2,1], the number of 2s is 2, and the number of 1s after the last 2 (position 3) is 1. So 2+1=3, which is correct.\n\nSo the LNDS is the maximum between (number of 1s + number of 2s after last 1) and (number of 2s + number of 1s after last 2). But since the array is made of 1s and 2s, the second option is not useful because the 1s after the last 2 would be after the last 2, which is impossible. So perhaps the formula is simply the maximum between the number of 1s plus the number of 2s after the last 1, and the number of 2s plus the number of 1s after the last 2. But since the array is non-decreasing, the latter is not possible, so it's just the former.\n\nWait, no. For example, in the array [2,2,1,1], the last 2 is at position 2, and the number of 1s after it is 2. So the formula would be number of 2s (2) plus number of 1s after the last 2 (2) = 4, which is correct. But the array is [2,2,1,1], which has LNDS of 2 (either the two 2s or two 1s). But according to the formula, it would be 2 + 2 =4. Which is wrong. So that formula is incorrect.\n\nSo this approach isn't working. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me think of the LNDS for an array of 1s and 2s. It's the maximum length of a sequence that is non-decreasing. Since the elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS can be calculated by counting the number of 1s and the number of 2s, and the number of transitions between 1 and 2.\n\nBut perhaps there's a dynamic programming approach. However, given that n is up to 2000, and for each possible reversal, we need to compute the LNDS, which would be O(n^2) per reversal, leading to O(n^4) time, which is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the reversal can be done on any subarray, and the array is small (n=2000), perhaps there's a way to precompute for all possible intervals [l, r] the effect on the LNDS.\n\nBut even that seems challenging.\n\nLet me think about what happens when we reverse a subarray [l, r]. The elements inside [l, r] are reversed. The LNDS of the entire array will be influenced by how the reversed part connects with the parts before l and after r.\n\nFor example, suppose before l, the last element is x, and after r, the first element is y. After reversing, the first element of the reversed subarray is the original a[r], and the last element is a[l]. So if x <= a[r] and a[l] <= y, then the reversed subarray connects nicely with the surrounding parts.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum LNDS after this reversal?\n\nAnother Idea: The maximum LNDS after any reversal is either the original LNDS, or the maximum possible by considering certain scenarios.\n\nFor example, the optimal reversal could be to take a segment that starts with some 2s and ends with some 1s, reversing it to make it start with 1s and end with 2s. This would allow merging the 1s before the segment with the 1s inside the segment, and the 2s inside the segment with the 2s after the segment.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is the original count of 1s plus the count of 2s, minus the number of inversions that are not fixed by the best reversal.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nThe original array has some number of inversions (pairs of 2 followed by 1). Each such inversion is a place where the sequence decreases. Reversing a subarray can eliminate some of these inversions.\n\nThe best reversal would be the one that eliminates the maximum number of inversions.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of inversions that can be removed by reversing a single subarray.\n\nOnce we find that number, the maximum possible LNDS is the original LNDS plus that number. But how to compute the original LNDS?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of elements minus the number of inversions plus the number of inversions that can be removed by reversing a subarray.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to think of the example given in the problem:\n\nFirst example input: 1 2 1 2 → original array. The inversions are (2,3) → 2 followed by 1. So one inversion. The original LNDS is 3. After reversing [2,3], the array becomes [1,1,2,2], which has no inversions. The LNDS is 4, which is 4-0=4. So the number of inversions removed is 1, and the original LNDS was 3, which is 4-1=3. So yes, the formula holds here.\n\nIn the second example, the input is [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]. Let's count the inversions. The original array has several 2s followed by 1s. For example:\n\nPositions 3-5 are 2s, and then positions 6-7 are 1s. So between 3-6, 3-7, etc. Also, the last element is 1. Let's see:\n\nThe original array is:\n\nIndices 1-10:\n\n1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1.\n\nThe inversions are all pairs where a[i]=2 and a[j]=1 with i<j.\n\nLet's count them:\n\nFor each 2, count the number of 1s after it.\n\nLet's go through each 2 in the array:\n\nPosition 3: value 2. The 1s after it are at positions 6,7,10 → 3 inversions.\n\nPosition 4: 2. Same as above: 3 inversions.\n\nPosition 5: 2. Same as above: 3 inversions.\n\nPosition 8: 2. After it are positions 9 (2) and 10 (1) → one inversion.\n\nPosition 9: 2. After it is position 10 (1) → one inversion.\n\nTotal inversions: 3+3+3 +1+1 = 11.\n\nOriginal LNDS is 10 - 11 = -1? No, that can't be. So my previous assumption that the LNDS equals total_length - number_of_inversions is incorrect. Hence, this approach is invalid.\n\nSo back to square one.\n\nAlternative Idea: For the array of 1s and 2s, the maximum possible LNDS is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that are not preceded by any 1. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, the LNDS can be formed by taking all the 1s and all the 2s that come after the last 1. Or, alternatively, taking all the 2s and all the 1s that come after the last 2. But since the sequence is non-decreasing, the latter is not possible. So the maximum is the count of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1. But how to compute that?\n\nLet me think of the array [1,2,1,2]. The last 1 is at position 3. The number of 2s after that is 1 (position 4). So 2+1=3, which is correct.\n\nFor the array [2,2,1,1], the last 1 is at position 4. Number of 2s after it is 0. So 2 (count of 1s) + 0 = 2. But the actual LNDS is 2 (the two 2s or two 1s). So that works.\n\nFor the array [1,2,2,1], the last 1 is at position 4. Number of 2s after it is zero. But the LNDS is 3 (1,2,2). So this formula is not correct.\n\nAh, because there are 2s before the last 1. So the formula should be the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1, but also including the 2s that are before the last 1 but are part of the sequence.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to think of the LNDS as follows:\n\nThe LNDS is the maximum between the number of 1s and the number of 2s, or the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1, whichever is larger.\n\nBut in the case of [1,2,2,1], the number of 1s is 2, and the number of 2s after the last 1 is zero. So 2 vs 2 (number of 2s). So the maximum is 2. But the actual LNDS is 3. So this approach is still incorrect.\n\nAt this point, perhaps I need to think of a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the problem again. Since the array consists of only 1s and 2s, the LNDS is the length of the longest sequence of 1s followed by 2s. So, the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between:\n\n- the number of 1s in the array plus the number of 2s that appear after the last 1 in the array.\n\n- the number of 2s in the array plus the number of 1s that appear after the last 2 in the array.\n\nBut since 1s are less than 2s, the second option is not possible. So the first option is the correct one.\n\nWait, but in the case of [1,2,2,1], the last 1 is at position 4. The number of 2s after it is zero. But the number of 2s before it is 2. So the maximum is 2 (number of 1s) + 0 = 2. But the actual LNDS is 3. So this approach is not correct.\n\nMaybe the formula is not about the last 1, but about the earliest 1 that allows the maximum number of 2s to follow.\n\nBut this seems complex.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the problem as finding the best way to arrange the array into a sequence of 1s followed by 2s. The maximum possible LNDS is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s in the array, provided that there are no 2s before any 1s. Otherwise, it's less.\n\nSo the task is to find the best reversal that minimizes the number of 2s before 1s.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the array as having some number of 1s and 2s. The optimal scenario is to have all 1s first, then all 2s. Any reversal that helps achieve this is good.\n\nSo, the best reversal is one that moves as many 2s to the right of 1s as possible.\n\nFor example, if there's a segment that starts with some 2s and ends with some 1s, reversing it would move those 1s to the front of the segment and the 2s to the end, thereby creating more 1s followed by 2s.\n\nSo, perhaps the best reversal is to find the maximum number of 2s that are followed by 1s, and reverse that segment.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nLet me think about the number of 2s that are followed by 1s. Let's call this the number of bad transitions. For example, in the array [1,2,1,2], there is one bad transition (2 followed by 1). Reversing this segment would remove it.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nLet me consider that the best reversal is to take a segment that contains the maximum number of bad transitions. Reversing this segment would turn each bad transition into a good one, thereby increasing the LNDS.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think of the array as having a series of bad transitions. For example, each time a 2 is followed by a 1, it's a bad transition. Reversing a segment that starts at a 2 and ends at a 1 would turn this into a 1 followed by a 2, which is good.\n\nBut there may be multiple bad transitions within a single segment. For example, if the segment is [2,1,2,1], reversing it would turn it into [1,2,1,2], which still has two bad transitions. So this approach may not be effective.\n\nBut if the segment is [2,1,2,1,2], reversing it would give [2,1,2,1,2] → no, wait, reversing it would give [2,1,2,1,2] reversed is [2,1,2,1,2]? No, wait, the original segment is [2,1,2,1,2], reversing it would give [2,1,2,1,2] reversed is [2,1,2,1,2]? No, wait, the reversed array would be [2,1,2,1,2] reversed is [2,1,2,1,2]? No, the reversed array would be [2,1,2,1,2] → no, wait, the original is [2,1,2,1,2]. Reversed, it becomes [2,1,2,1,2] → no, wait, no. Let me think: the original array is [2,1,2,1,2]. Reversing it would give [2,1,2,1,2] → no, that's the same as the original. Wait, no, the original array is 5 elements. Reversing it would give [2,1,2,1,2] reversed is [2,1,2,1,2]? No! Let me write it down:\n\nOriginal: positions 1-5: 2, 1, 2, 1, 2.\n\nReversed: positions 5-1: 2, 1, 2, 1, 2. So it's the same as the original. So reversing it doesn't change anything. So this segment has no effect.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the number of bad transitions within the segment may not be easy to calculate.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's think about the best possible scenario after reversing a subarray. The maximum possible LNDS would be the number of 1s plus the number of 2s, if the array can be arranged to be non-decreasing. Otherwise, it would be the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1 in the new array.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the best way to arrange the array such that the number of 2s after the last 1 is maximized.\n\nTo maximize this, we need to have as many 1s as possible at the beginning and as many 2s as possible at the end.\n\nSo, the best reversal would be one that takes some 2s from the beginning and some 1s from the end and reverses them, thereby moving the 1s to the front and the 2s to the back.\n\nSo, for example, if there is a segment that has a bunch of 2s followed by a bunch of 1s, reversing it would turn it into 1s followed by 2s, which is good.\n\nThus, the maximum number of 2s after the last 1 is equal to the total number of 2s minus the number of 2s that are before the last 1 in the original array, plus the number of 2s added by reversing such a segment.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think of the original array. Let's say that the original array has a certain number of 1s and 2s. Let's find the position of the last 1 in the original array. Let's say it's at position p. All 2s after p contribute to the LNDS. But if there are 2s before p, they are not counted.\n\nIf we reverse a segment that includes some 2s before p and some 1s after p, then those 2s would be moved to after p, and the 1s would be moved to before p. This would increase the number of 2s after the last 1.\n\nSo the idea is to find the maximum number of 2s that can be moved to the end of the array, and the maximum number of 1s that can be moved to the beginning.\n\nLet me think of it as follows:\n\nLet's define for each possible i and j, the number of 1s in the prefix up to i and the number of 2s in the suffix starting at j. Then, reversing the segment [i+1, j-1] would allow us to combine these.\n\nWait, this is getting complex. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose the original array has some 2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in the given sequence of 1s and 2s. The key insight is that reversing a subarray can help merge segments of 1s and 2s to form a longer non-decreasing sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The sequence consists only of 1s and 2s. The LNDS for such sequences can be maximized by ensuring all 1s come before all 2s. Reversing a subarray that starts with 2s and ends with 1s can help convert it into a segment where 1s are followed by 2s.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: We use dynamic programming to precompute the number of 1s up to each position and the number of 2s from each position onwards. This helps us quickly determine the potential gain in the LNDS by reversing a subarray that starts with 2s and ends with 1s.\n\n3. **Maximize LNDS**: For each possible subarray reversal, compute the potential increase in LNDS by considering the number of 1s before the start of the subarray, the number of 2s after the end of the subarray, and the number of 1s and 2s within the subarray itself.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    # Precompute prefix counts of 1s\n    prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_ones[i+1] = prefix_ones[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n    \n    # Precompute suffix counts of 2s\n    suffix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n    \n    max_lnds = 0\n    \n    # Original LNDS\n    total_ones = prefix_ones[n]\n    total_twos = n - total_ones\n    # Find the last occurrence of 1\n    last_one = -1\n    for i in range(n):\n        if a[i] == 1:\n            last_one = i\n    if last_one == -1:\n        # All 2s\n        max_lnds = n\n    else:\n        twos_after_last_one = suffix_twos[last_one + 1]\n        original_lnds = total_ones + twos_after_last_one\n        max_lnds = original_lnds\n    \n    # Now consider all possible intervals [l, r]\n    # For each l, find the best r >= l\n    for l in range(n):\n        # Count the number of 2s before l (not including l)\n        ones_before_l = prefix_ones[l]\n        # Count the number of 1s from l to r (for some r)\n        # For each r >= l, count the number of 1s in [l, r], and 2s after r\n        # But how to choose r optimally?\n        # Let's iterate r from l to n-1\n        # And track the number of 1s and 2s in [l..r]\n        ones_in_segment = 0\n        twos_in_segment = 0\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            if a[r] == 1:\n                ones_in_segment += 1\n            else:\n                twos_in_segment += 1\n            # Now, the contribution from this segment\n            # The number of 1s before l is prefix_ones[l]\n            # The number of 2s after r is suffix_twos[r+1]\n            # Also, the number of 1s in the segment is ones_in_segment\n            # The number of 2s in the segment is twos_in_segment\n            # When reversed, the segment will have the 1s at the beginning and 2s at the end\n            # So the total would be:\n            # ones_before_l + ones_in_segment + suffix_twos[r+1]\n            # But also, the 2s in the segment (twos_in_segment) can be added if they are after the new last 1\n            # Wait, after reversing, the segment starts with 1s and ends with 2s\n            # So the new last 1 in the entire array is either:\n            # - the last 1 in the segment (if there are any)\n            # - or the last 1 before l\n            # So the new number of 2s after the last 1 is:\n            # if there are any 1s in the segment, then suffix_twos[r+1] + twos_in_segment\n            # else, if the segment has no 1s, then the new last 1 is still before l, and the 2s after r are added\n            # But this seems complex.
